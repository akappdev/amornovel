I\u2019ve never been so happy in my entire life. I love you and Ryan like brothers, you know that, but there\u2019s something completely satisfying about having a wife and children. It fills a void you don\u2019t even know is there until you finally are with your true love,\u201d Derek said as the two men sat by the pool, having a drink.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think Jasmine is about the most perfect person in this universe but marriage just isn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m a confirmed bachelor. Why would I want to settle down with just one lady, when I can have a new one on my arm every single night?\u201d Drew said with a wicked smile. He said the words but even he didn\u2019t believe himself anymore. He\u2019d watched his newly married cousin with his wife and felt a tugging for something more in his life. He wouldn\u2019t admit that out loud, though. He had a great life and he refused to even think about changing it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well you know I felt the same way until Jasmine came back into my life and now I just think of all the wasted years we could\u2019ve been together,\u201d Derek said with pain in his voice. His cousin had married his childhood sweetheart but circumstances had kept them apart for ten years and Drew knew it pained Derek whenever he thought about all the years lost.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m so restless because I need a vacation. I\u2019ve been working non-stop for years now and I think I\u2019m going to pick one of my resorts and just go soak up some sun and lounge around. I\u2019m sure I can find a few pretty ladies to enjoy the time with me,\u201d he said. He was well known as a playboy. The women he got involved with knew the score and were looking for nothing more than a night with him, so there were no hurt feelings between the couples in the morning.</p><p>That had always been enough for him, so he figured the restlessness really was just the fact he was working too hard. The old saying seemed to be quite fitting, all work and no play.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you boys up to out here?\u201d Jasmine asked, as she walked out, with her beautiful baby girl. Drew immediately held out his arms to take her. She was the most adorable thing in the world and he could imagine himself with a few someday. He had to shake the thought off, since he couldn\u2019t have the babies without having a wife. He\u2019d been raised far better than that.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know Drew, he\u2019s talking about all the pretty ladies,\u201d Derek said as he grabbed his wife around the waist and settled her onto his lap. She giggled before bending down to kiss him, making Drew a bit uncomfortable. He cleared his throat, just to remind them he was still there.</p><p>He\u2019d never been so head over heels for a girl he forgot everyone else in the room. He was starting to wonder what that would be like.</p> <p>\u201cSorry Drew,\u201d Jasmine said a bit sheepishly, as a pretty blush stole over her features.</p><p>\u201cWant to babysit?\u201d Derek said. He wasn\u2019t in the least bit sorry. Before Drew had a chance to say anything, Derek rose from the chair, with Jasmine still in his arms and carried her off through the house. He could hear her weak protests as they got further away.</p><p>Britney was looking up at him with her big blue eyes, which he couldn\u2019t resist. He blew some raspberries on her tummy, which made her giggle and pat his face.</p><p>\u201cI know your parents are a bit nutty but you have to love them, anyway,\u201d he said to the baby. He didn\u2019t feel foolish at all talking to her, even though she had no idea what he was saying. He found himself alone for a very long time before the happy couple came back down to join him.</p><p>He raised his brows at his cousin, who just shrugged as if to say, he couldn\u2019t help himself. Jasmine apologized for her husband\u2019s behavior and took Britney back, so she could get her ready for bed. He reluctantly handed her over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take off now, since my presence here is obviously not needed,\u201d Drew said with a huge smile.</p> <p>\u201cHey, you know you\u2019re always wanted here,\u201d Derek told him, truly meaning it.</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I keep coming back. I\u2019m going to take everyone\u2019s advice though and go on a vacation. I\u2019m sure once I get away for some fun, I\u2019ll feel much better and can get back to normal,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay away too long, you know how quickly Britney is growing up,\u201d Derek said, as he walked him to the door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how quickly she\u2019s growing. I\u2019ll be back in a week or so. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s time to start slowing down. I\u2019m realizing traveling isn\u2019t holding the same appeal it used to and whenever I\u2019m away I\u2019m anxious to get back. I think it\u2019s your wife\u2019s cooking. I swear I\u2019ve put on twenty pounds,\u201d he said, while rubbing his incredibly flat stomach.</p><p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019m going to have to go to the tailor to let all my pants out,\u201d Derek agreed, while rubbing his own impressive stomach. Both men looked more like they should be on the cover of magazines, than sitting behind a desk. They shook hands and Drew took off.</p><p>He called his pilot and had the jet readied and headed straight for the airport. He knew some sun and surf would wash all his worries away and hopefully the weird thoughts of marriage and children as well. He simply wasn\u2019t the marrying kind, not like Derek was. Heck, he could tell when they were still teenagers Derek would be the first to marry and make a ton of kids.</p><p>Once he was airborne, he sipped on his drink and laid his head back against the seat. He could feel himself relaxing. Yeah, he thought, this is what I needed. He\u2019d refuse to work for a couple of days and everything would go back to normal.</p><p>Chapter One</p> <p>Trinity laid down on the oversized towel, letting out a sigh of total ecstasy. She could feel the sun shining down on her closed eyelids. She was so relaxed, she felt as if she could float off in the crystal clear water, only a few feet away from her.</p><p>This was the first impulsive thing she\u2019d ever done in her life. She\u2019d always been the responsible, stable, reliable person but after being walked all over for the hundredth time, she packed one bag, hopped on a jet and ended up on a secluded island off the North Coast of Spain. The last portion of her trip had been on a small charter aircraft, with spectacular views of the Mediterranean Sea. It was unlike anything she\u2019d ever seen before. She\u2019d been unable to take her eyes away from the window, as the aircraft circled the island and landed in paradise.</p><p>She\u2019d spent every last dime she so strictly saved over the last ten years, on the mega expensive, all-inclusive resort. As she lay there, soaking up the sun, she knew every penny of it was worth eating ramen noodles for the next year, once she got back home.</p><p>Her life had been flipped upside down a few days ago and she\u2019d finally snapped, like many people had predicted would one day happen, if she continued to let people abuse her good nature. She\u2019d always been the people pleaser in her group of friends and in the few romantic relationships she\u2019d been in.</p><p>Her last relationship was the reason she was now soaking up the sun and flat broke. Her mouth stretched out in a pleased grin. She was starting to get too warm, so she stood up and started walking towards the inviting water. She was trying really hard not to think about her ex but the man invaded her thoughts, which caused a frown to pucker her brows.</p><p>She had been with her supposedly straight-laced boyfriend for six months and really loved him, or at least she thought she did. She\u2019d decided it was time to take the next step in their relationship and had gotten all dressed up, planning on waiting for him to get home from the office.</p><p>She didn\u2019t really understand his job. She just knew he owned some business that developed software. He tried talking about it to her and she\u2019d nod along, as if she understood but in reality, it had bored her to pieces.</p><p>She had the key to get into his place, from when he\u2019d been on a business trip the previous month and she\u2019d gone over to water his plants. She\u2019d forgotten she even had the key but was very grateful, considering she was going to plan a romantic evening for them.</p><p>It was such a clich\u00e9 because of course she\u2019d opened the door, with nervous anticipation, only to find the stupid creep in bed with his secretary. He had, of course, begged her not to leave and promised it was a one-time thing, that he\u2019d temporarily lost his mind.</p><p>Trinity smiled as she thought about his moment of groveling. As she\u2019d walked out the door, she vowed she was done with businessmen for good. She was tired of being their perfect girlfriend, who did their laundry, cleaned their places and anything else they asked. She was done being the girl everyone could depend on. She was done always playing it safe. She was certainly done with being a doormat.</p><p>She dived into the water and swam out until her arms started to ache. She turned around, surprised at how far she\u2019d gotten from the shore. She wasn\u2019t worried about it though, as she was a strong swimmer. Even if she did get tired, she could float on her back for hours. She began the long trip back to shore and continued thinking about those life changing days.</p><p>Trinity had driven back to her boring, beige apartment and started searching the internet for exotic resorts. She\u2019d found a new place on an island, off of the coast of Spain, booked her ticket and went to the mall to purchase a few sundresses and a new bikini. She\u2019d slept incredibly well that night and was off to the airport first thing in the morning.</p><p>She landed yesterday and had wandered the beach as she watched the most spectacular sunset she\u2019d ever seen in her life. Tears had fallen down her face from the sheer beauty of the colors splashed across the sky. She was exhausted as she climbed back up to her room. She was also feeling better than she had in a very long time.</p><p>For a few seconds after she woke up that morning, she\u2019d been confused about where she was. She\u2019d sipped a few too many margaritas in the outdoor bar. Once it all came back to her, she couldn\u2019t keep the smile from her face. She slipped on her most daring bikini and headed towards the incredible beach, where she lounged for hours, until she finally dove into the crystal clear sea water.</p><p>Trinity snapped back to the present, as she continued to swim closer to the shore and she felt nothing but the warmth from the sun and the coolness of the glorious water. There was no stress, no feelings of regret and no doubt she\u2019d made the right choice. That\u2019s all she felt, until something smashed into her head. There was a shooting pain and then she felt blackness surround her. Her last thought, before she started sinking beneath the surface of the water, was her room was non-refundable.</p><p>Drew was lying on his board, swimming out to catch a wave. He\u2019d arrived at his resort earlier that morning and felt good. He\u2019d told his staff they were to pretend not to know him over the next seventy-two hours and then he\u2019d hit the beach. He could certainly get used to being a tourist, he thought with a laugh.</p><p>The day had been relaxing so far and he could feel his stress fading away. As he paddled out further into the sea, he suddenly felt a thump and turned his head, to see a body start sinking into the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he yelled, before diving off his board to retrieve whoever he\u2019d just ran into. No one was ever out in the water this far unless they were surfing. He supposed their board could\u2019ve gotten away from them but he didn\u2019t see one floating around anywhere without a rider. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He caught the person before they sunk too far, realizing it was a woman. He threw her up on his board and quickly paddled back to shore. He immediately began CPR and let out a relieved sigh, when she choked up some water and started to breathe.</p><p>She looked up through blood-shot eyes and groaned, reaching for her head, where he could already see a large lump forming. He was surprised by the clenching in his gut. She was spectacular, in an understated girl next door way.</p><p>She had long blonde hair, which was currently plastered over her face and emerald colored eyes. He\u2019d never quite seen that shade before. They had a sparkle to them, holding his attention. They were surrounded by long lashes, which were quickly blinking up at him.</p><p>Her body was lithe and far to pale, to be so unprotected on these beaches. He could already see a tint of red all over, which was going to bother her in the morning if she didn\u2019t get plenty of lotion on her.</p> <p>He felt his body tighten, at the thought of rubbing lotion all over her smooth skin. Her curves were perfect, neither too small nor too large. He was picturing his large hands running all over her body. He had to shake his head to clear the inappropriate thoughts. He\u2019d almost drowned the poor woman and now he was ogling her like a piece of candy. He really needed to take more time off.</p><p>He reached down and scooped her up in his arms. She needed to get some medical attention, so he could verify she\u2019d be okay. As he walked across the beach, with her in his arms, he could feel her soft heat wash through him. The scent of her hair was causing more erotic images to pop into his mind. Her tiny bikini wasn\u2019t hiding much from him and he wanted to move the top aside, those last couple of inches, to see if her peaks were pale, like her skin. He groaned out loud, as he tried to think of anything but devouring the stranger in his arms. He didn\u2019t normally undress a woman with only his eyes. His partners were usually chasing him down; they didn\u2019t look at him with wide, innocent eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked him, in a scratchy voice and then winced. He was sure her throat was pretty sore. His guilt over hitting her, at least took his mind off of his inappropriate thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI ran into you with my surfboard, I didn\u2019t see you out there. We\u2019re going to the first aid station, to make sure everything is okay,\u201d he answered her, as he entered the air conditioned building. She immediately began to shiver and his eyes were drawn to her beaded nipples, making his breath come out in short pants. What the hell was wrong with him? He\u2019d knocked the poor girl out, almost drowned her and to top it off he was lusting after her. He seriously needed to take some time for a date, one that ended with them in his bed.</p><p>He reached the first aid station, laid her down and quickly found a blanket to cover her up. It was both for her benefit and his. The doctor was there within minutes, as people tended to come running, when it was the owner of the place who needed service. She couldn\u2019t seem to keep her eyes open though and fell asleep before he could begin his examination.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened, Mr. Titan?\u201d the doctor asked with concern, as he headed toward the girl.</p><p>\u201cI was paddling out and ran into her in the water. I hit her pretty hard in the head and had to perform CPR. There wasn\u2019t much water in her lungs, thankfully. She was only under the water for a few seconds,\u201d he explained.</p><p>The doctor examined her thoroughly, before turning back to Drew. \u201cShe will be just fine. Her head is going to hurt pretty badly but other than that, there\u2019s no permanent damage. She shouldn\u2019t be alone tonight though, so if no one is with her, I strongly recommend she stay here overnight,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cShe also needs to rub this aloe lotion on her skin, or she\u2019s going to be hurting pretty badly,\u201d he finished.</p><p>The resort\u2019s biggest medical issue was always sunburned clients. They weren\u2019t used to the intense heat of the island and never protected themselves enough, even though there were signs all over the place and the resort provided free sunblock in every room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s taken care of,\u201d Drew said and shook her awake. She partially opened her eyes, as if it took real effort.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your full name?\u201d Drew asked her.</p> <p>\u201cTrinity Mathews,\u201d she squeaked at him. \u201cI\u2019m on vacation,\u201d she added with a smile. Her small smile lit up her face, making his breathing shallow once again. He was trying to shake off the dizzying effect she was having on him.</p><p>\u201cAre you here with someone?\u201d he asked and found himself holding his breath. He\u2019d noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing a ring but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean anything.</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m here on my own,\u201d she answered. \u201cMy head really hurts,\u201d she added with another wince of pain.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor gave you a shot for that. It will work much faster than pills. It should kick in soon,\u201d he told her. She lay back down and drifted off to sleep once more. Drew sent a staff member out to get him the information he needed on Trinity. She came back quickly and confirmed Trinity was there alone and staying in one of the smaller rooms in the hotel. Well, he thought, Ms. Mathews just earned herself an upgrade to his nicest suite in the building.</p><p>He called in a bellhop, \u201cmove Ms. Mathew\u2019s possessions to the executive suite,\u201d he said. He then had to wake her back up again.</p><p>\u201cTrinity, the resort is going to move you to a suite,\u201d Drew said to her. She smiled at him, as if she was only half listening to what he said. Drew picked her back up in his arms, leaving the blanket on her and trudged through the hotel. A few employees tried to approach him but quickly backed off, after one look.</p><p>He made it to the elevator and rode it to the top floor. There were only a few rooms on that level and you had to have a special room key to even get up there. The doorman was waiting when he approached the door and held it open for him. He carried her inside and laid her down on one of the huge beds.</p><p>She snuggled down into the feather mattress and sighed. The doorman left and he found himself all alone with the gorgeous female. He shook her awake again and she glared at him. He had to suppress the smile that wanted to break out on his face. It was obvious she was getting tired of his interruptions.</p> <p>\u201cTrinity, I\u2019m sorry to wake you but the doctor said you need to get this lotion on, or you\u2019ll burn badly and hate life even worse, come morning,\u201d he said to her. The drug the doctor had given her must have also been a sleep aid because her eyes closed again and she was out cold.</p><p>Drew groaned, as he realized he was going to have to apply the lotion himself. He looked skyward and wondered how much he could take of touching her supple body. He sang out loud, as he poured the lotion into his hands and began rubbing them together. He didn\u2019t want to shock her, with cold lotion, on top of everything else. Once he rubbed it around his hands for a while, he began applying it to her legs.</p><p>He figured if he started with her legs, it would be easier on his libido. He was wrong, so very wrong. By the time he got the lotion all over her incredibly beautiful body, he had a throbbing erection and was breathing like he\u2019d just run a marathon. On top of that, he had sweat dripping off his brow.</p><p>He walked out of the room and quickly jumped into a very cold shower. He stayed there until his skin started turning blue and his goose bumps had their own goose bumps. He got dressed and took out his laptop to start working on some business. If he was stuck indoors, he may as well get back to work.</p><p>Trinity woke up and her first thought was how famished she felt. She smelled something delicious drifting towards her and laughed as her stomach growled very loudly. She noticed she was in the softest bed she\u2019d ever slept in and then looked around her. This wasn\u2019t her room. She began to panic as she looked around. She vaguely remembered everything that had happened.</p><p>She\u2019d been swimming and the next thing she remembered was the sexiest guy she\u2019d ever seen in her life, leaning over her, with panicked eyes. Those eyes had been the same color as the gorgeous sea behind him and his uncovered chest had been dark and muscled. She tried to keep her eyes open and listen to what he was saying. She hadn\u2019t known men that gorgeous really existed, beyond a Hollywood movie or one of her romance novels. She was thinking it must have all been part of her delusions because men that hot certainly didn\u2019t exist in real life.</p><p>The next thing she remembered was the throbbing headache. She had been really irritated when someone kept waking her up because then she had to endure the pain. She reached her hand up to her head and felt around. There was a large lump on the side but the headache was gone. She could vaguely remember a doctor giving her something. Whatever it was had worked magic because she felt really good.</p><p>She climbed from the bed and looked into the closet to see her few clothing items were there. She slipped a sundress on and followed her nose. The man from the beach was sitting at a table, in an enormous room, removing lids from what looked like a very good salad and seafood pasta. He spotted her and immediately jumped up. She had to blink twice to make sure she was really seeing him. She couldn\u2019t believe he was real. She came really close to asking him to remove his shirt, so she could see if his chest and stomach were really as gorgeous as she remembered, while delirious.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Trinity?\u201d he asked her, with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Where am I and why are you here?\u201d she asked with curiosity but not really caring all that much. She wanted the food that was on the table, though. He saw her gaze focused on the food and laughed, before he led her to the table and removed some more lids. She grabbed the bowl of salad and started shoving bites into her mouth. It was the best thing she\u2019d ever tasted. She actually groaned, before she could stop it, then laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t know when I ate last,\u201d she said and gobbled up more food. She couldn\u2019t remember ever being as hungry as she was right then.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine really; I was getting ready to wake you up when you came out. You have been asleep for fourteen hours. The doctor said he\u2019d given you a pretty large dose of pain killer and I was checking on you often but still, I was beginning to worry. He also didn\u2019t want you alone, so I volunteered to take care of you,\u201d he finally answered her earlier question, or at least half of it.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d she asked him again.</p><p>\u201cThe hotel upgraded you, since you went through such a bad accident,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so great. My old room was pretty spectacular but come on, look at this room,\u201d she said with excitement. He looked around, trying to see it from her eyes. It was really nice but he\u2019d gotten so used to luxury rooms he tended not to notice them anymore.</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly happened? I was swimming one minute, then all I know is I felt this horrible pain in my head, then blackness, till I woke up to see you above me,\u201d she asked him, as she continued eating.</p><p>\u201cI was out surfing and didn\u2019t see you. I ran into you with my surfboard,\u201d he said, afraid she was going to get angry. She surprised him when she started laughing. He stared at her, like she really did have a concussion and maybe he should call the doctor.</p><p>\u201cSorry, really I am but you have to admit, it\u2019s pretty funny. I\u2019ve never had a vacation before, ever in my life. I\u2019m always the good girl who does everything right and always plays it safe and then on my first day of vacation I take a swim and get whacked in the head. It\u2019s pretty amusing,\u201d she said still laughing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had expected her to get angry or even worse, to know exactly who he was and threaten to sue but no, she was laughing like it was no big deal. He began to relax, which could be dangerous.</p><p>\u201cI really am very sorry,\u201d he tried once again.</p><p>\u201cSeriously it\u2019s not like you went out there on purpose and thought to yourself, \u2018hmm I think I\u2019d like to hit someone today,\u2019 so don\u2019t worry about it. After all, I did get this amazing suite and that\u2019s worth a nasty headache,\u201d she said with sincerity. \u201cI actually feel a bit guilty about it because they could rent it to someone else. I\u2019ll tell them it\u2019s no big deal tomorrow,\u201d she said, in a matter of fact tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they are more than happy to let you stay here and recuperate fully. Why not enjoy the nice room and have a spectacular vacation. There are some amazing things to do here,\u201d he told her. She wrinkled her brow, as if she really had to think about it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m too tired to even think about moving at the moment, so I\u2019ll have to think some more on it. What time is it anyway?\u201d she asked</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about five in the morning,\u201d he said with a yawn. \u201cYou slept the rest of the afternoon and most of the night,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cWow that\u2019s a bummer. I wasted an entire day of vacation. I\u2019ll just have to make up for it today,\u201d she said with a shrug. He could think of ways of making the vacation pretty great. He hadn\u2019t wanted a woman so quickly in too long to remember. He was starting to hope they could benefit each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to be your tour guide, if you\u2019d let me,\u201d he offered her.</p><p>\u201cAre you here on vacation too?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI am for now,\u201d he told her. He was telling her the truth, partially. He\u2019d come for a vacation but it was only supposed to be for a few days, then he had to get to work. He decided right then his vacation was extended.</p><p>\u201cWell in that case, I\u2019d love to have a tour guide,\u201d she said and then she looked up at him with suspicion. She took in his surf shorts and t-shirt with a frown. \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d she asked him suspiciously. He knew it was a test of some sort but he didn\u2019t know what the right answer was. He knew he didn\u2019t want her to know he owned resorts because she\u2019d figure out quickly this one was his. He also didn\u2019t want to stray too far from the truth because once you started weaving lies, it was really hard to break free from them.</p><p>\u201cI work for the resort,\u201d he answered her. It was the truth, as he worked nonstop at the varying resorts.</p><p>\u201cOh, you work here. But you said you\u2019re on vacation,\u201d she said, with a wrinkle back in place. He needed to be really careful not to chase her away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off for a few days, which is always a vacation, when you\u2019re in paradise,\u201d he answered her. His answer seemed to be the right one because her face lit up and she went back to eating. He was blown away with the amount of food she was shoveling in. He had no idea where she was putting it.</p><p>\u201cWell in that case, I could most definitely use a guide, especially one who knows the area but I don\u2019t want to take you away from your other activities,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cSpending time with a beautiful lady is never a hardship,\u201d he said and gave her his most heart stopping smile. He\u2019d been told by more than one woman, his smile stopped them in their tracks. He wasn\u2019t above using everything in his arsenal to seduce Miss Trinity Mathews.</p><p>Trinity thought she may melt right through the chair when he looked at her like that. Her first reaction was to withdraw and say goodbye but hadn\u2019t she just had a huge pep talk with herself about living life to the fullest. Why not spend time with the adorable local guy and see where things led on her short vacation. She\u2019d soon be back in the real world, where she could be sensible once again.</p><p>\u201cI just realized I don\u2019t know your name,\u201d she said and waited.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Drew and it\u2019s my pleasure to officially meet you,\u201d he said and stuck out his hand. She grasped it and felt some sparks shoot down her arm. She had to suppress the shiver of need rolling through her. Her vacation had certainly become far more interesting since she had decided to go for a swim.</p><p>Trinity finished her meal and headed to the bathroom to shower. Drew got on the phone and called his staff. He told them no one was to approach him with any business, he didn\u2019t care if the place was on fire. He was officially on vacation and didn\u2019t want his guest to know he was the boss. They were incredibly loyal employees and he had no doubt they\u2019d keep his secret.</p><p>Right after he hung up the phone, it rang again. He saw the number was from his attorney and answered. He wasn\u2019t happy when he hung up. His attorney was faxing papers over and wanted to make sure Trinity signed them before the day was out. He was worried there would be a huge lawsuit if she found out the person who had mowed her over was the owner of the resort. Drew really hated politics and lawyers.</p><p>He once again called his staff and asked the manager to handle the paperwork. He made sure they were going to comp her room, all meals and any activities she did for the rest of the week. Ms. Mathews had earned an all-inclusive, free vacation. He had the manager upgrade her return tickets to first class and the hotel was giving her a ten thousand dollar settlement as well. He had a feeling she was going to balk but he\u2019d be there to talk her into it, of course as a friend and not the owner of the resort.</p><p>He prayed she didn\u2019t find out the truth because it wouldn\u2019t go over well. In the meantime he was going to give her the vacation of a lifetime. She got out of the shower and they headed downstairs. The manager called her into his office and presented his offer to her and her reaction was exactly as Drew thought it would be.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll sign your papers, promising not to sue but you really don\u2019t need to give me all this extra stuff,\u201d she said. She wasn\u2019t used to taking any kind of hand out and felt greedy even considering the generous offer. It would be nice to take the money and enjoy a free vacation but it wasn\u2019t their fault Drew ran into her. It wasn\u2019t even Drew\u2019s fault. It was just one of those freak accidents.</p><p>\u201cTrinity these corporations make massive amounts of money and can afford it, besides its most likely coming out of the insurance anyway. Why don\u2019t you just take what is being offered and have an incredible vacation. Just think of all the spa services and playing you can do,\u201d Drew said, with a trust me smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d she asked and he nodded. She then turned to the manager, who was nodding his encouragement, while holding out the pen. She finally took it and signed the papers, with reluctance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry your vacation has been interrupted and hope this will make up for it. Please take advantage of all our services and fully enjoy your stay,\u201d the kind man said.</p><p>\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t bad and you\u2019ve been very kind. Maybe I\u2019ll use the money to go to one of your other resorts,\u201d she said, like the idea really excited her.</p><p>\u201cThat would be excellent Ms. Mathews,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIf you decide to do that, give us a call and we\u2019ll make sure you get the royal service, for a fraction of the cost,\u201d he finished. She knew she\u2019d be far too uncomfortable to take anything else from them but she nodded her head.</p><p>She and Drew left the room and headed out, just as the sun was rising over the ocean. Even though it was very early in the morning, it was still pleasantly warm outside and the two of them sat down in the sand to enjoy the view.</p><p>Drew pulled her in front of him and wrapped her in his arms. Trinity knew she should pull away, as she barely knew the man but it felt so good to be with him. She caved in to her own desires and laid her head against his chest. Her first thought was the man was truly as hard as a rock. She\u2019d never had such a desire to run her hands up a male torso before. She could feel heat pooling in her stomach, the longer she nestled close to him.</p><p>Drew was fighting his own urges as he held Trinity. When she finally relaxed and laid her head against his chest, he had to fight the urge not to lay them both down on the sand and love her, as the sun rose over the ocean. Her presence alone was enough to send his body into overdrive. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever be able to look at a sunset the same way again.</p><p>\u201cSo, what would you like to do next?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI told you earlier this is my first vacation, so I\u2019m going to leave it up to you. Whatever you think would be fun and adventurous, I want to do,\u201d she told him. He had to fight a groan once more because there was only one fun and adventurous thing he really wanted to do and that involved them being in the bedroom, day and night.</p><p>\u201cOkay but be prepared for the consequences of leaving it all to me,\u201d he said. He then stood up and helped her to her feet. Their hands seemed to slide together as they walked down the beach. For once in Trinity\u2019s life she was in no hurry. She wanted to enjoy her week in the exotic place and forget all about the real world. She was off to a really good start.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The next few days flew by in a whirlwind for Trinity. She was having the time of her life with Drew and didn\u2019t want the vacation to ever end. She\u2019d invited him to use one of the spare rooms in her suite, not wanting him to leave. The cautious Trinity would\u2019ve never done that. She was having a hard time not asking him to share her own room. She couldn\u2019t be that bold, though. The only reason she was being brave was because she knew she\u2019d never see him again after the week was over.</p><p>They were taking a late swim, in the heated pool and Trinity was actually a little bit frustrated. She had never in her life been so flirtatious with a man and he was either completely clueless, or didn\u2019t desire her. She decided she only had two days left and it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to put herself out there a bit.</p><p>She was tired of being the good girl and always being cautious. She was going to throw caution to the wind and see what happened. If he still didn\u2019t make any moves, then she had her answer and could still call the vacation a success. She\u2019d be unsatisfied but at least she was relaxed.</p><p>\u201cMmm this water is heavenly,\u201d she purred, as she swam up close to him. The man looked so unbelievably good in nothing but a pair of swim trunks.</p><p>He\u2019d been trying for two days to keep his hands to himself and each moment he was with her, it was becoming harder and harder. He almost laughed aloud at his own thoughts. That was certainly not the only thing becoming harder.</p><p>Trinity was quickly losing her bravado. She wished she could be one of those bold women who could make the first move and just lock her lips to his. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever have that kind of courage.</p><p>She was now hanging onto the side of the wall, thinking it was time to get out of the pool, when he closed those last few inches and pressed their bodies close together. She inhaled a quick breath of air, as her breasts brushed against his chest. She could feel the heat instantly pool in her stomach and her nipples hardened in anticipation of his touch. If he pulled back now she\u2019d lose all function of her body and sink to the bottom of the pool. She turned to jelly and the man had done nothing more than press up close to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew looked into her desired filled eyes and growled low in his throat, pulling her more tightly against him. There wasn\u2019t one part of their bodies not touching. She could feel his obvious arousal pressed against her and wanted the clothing out of the way, so he could plunge inside of her.</p><p>She watched in wonder, as his eyes dilated, seconds before he lowered his head to hers and brought their lips together in the most passionate kiss she\u2019d ever received. She\u2019d never been kissed so erotically and her body was quivering in excitement.</p><p>A deep moan escaped her throat, as his tongue traced the contours of her mouth. Her hands lifted up around his shoulders and her fingers tangled in his hair. It was breathtaking. Her body continued to shake as his hands rubbed up and down her bare back. She was grateful for the tiny bikini that didn\u2019t hide much of her skin from his hands but it still wasn\u2019t enough. She wanted more.</p><p>Trinity lost all ability to think as Drew ran his mouth down the smooth column of her throat and sucked the skin in at her pulse point. He continued caressing her neck and reached the vee between her breasts, making her breath hitch in anticipation.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t realize they were moving, until she felt a cool sensation of water rushing over her head, as he pulled her underneath the waterfall at the end of the pool. They were suddenly enclosed in a cave, with the waterfall hiding them from any prying eyes.</p><p>Drew unlatched her bikini top and tossed it aside while he continued exploring her body. As his lips traced the top of her soft mounds of flesh, she couldn\u2019t stop squirming in pleasure. When he finally latched on to her aching nipple, her back arched forward, wanting more.</p><p>He wanted more light, so he could finally see the color of her beautiful, hardened peaks but the taste of her body was sending him quickly over the edge of sanity.</p><p>He untied her bikini bottom and it floated away to parts unknown. She didn\u2019t care; all she cared about was him uniting their bodies together. She needed him more than she needed air. He brought his lips back to hers and she grabbed ahold of him like she was starving.</p><p>He pulled her legs up and she wrapped them around his waist, while her stomach continued quivering with need, as she realized he was uncovered and pressing against her opening. She moved her hips forward, needing him inside of her. He obliged her body\u2019s request and with one deep thrust, buried himself inside her core.</p> <p>She cried out as he filled her up. She\u2019d never been filled so fully before. Before she had time to catch her breath, he was gripping her hips tightly, as he moved in and out of her moist heat. She threw her head back and cried out. Drew traced her collar bone, sucking on her pounding pulse, as he moved faster in and out of her folds.</p><p>She felt heat shooting from her core and through her limbs, as he continued to move quickly in and out of her. She could feel her muscles tensing, the faster he moved. Suddenly it was too much and she jerked in his arms, as her body tightened convulsively around his engorged staff.</p><p>Drew shuddered as her already tight body, started convulsing around him and he couldn\u2019t hold off any longer. He thrust deeply inside her body, not leaving any space between them. He released his seed deep inside her womb, while his body shook from the power of the orgasm. He was very grateful for the ledge they were leaning on because his legs could no longer hold him up, let alone the both of them.</p><p>Trinity stayed wrapped around Drew, as her breathing started to return to normal. They were still connected together intimately and she didn\u2019t want to let go. After a few minutes of being wrapped together in the water, she started to shiver. They were no longer making love and she realized she was naked in a public pool. She was grateful Drew had thought to drag them to privacy because she hadn\u2019t been thinking of anything but her body\u2019s intense need.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where my bathing suit is,\u201d Trinity finally said and was grateful for the darkness because she could feel the heat in her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d Drew said but the huge smile splitting his face didn\u2019t seem very apologetic. Trinity saw the humor in the situation and started to giggle. If only her friends could see her now, they would certainly not recognize the bold woman she\u2019d just been.</p> <p>\u201cHey, who\u2019s in there?\u201d they both heard someone calling. Her laughter instantly stopped and she was mortified someone knew she was in the secluded cave and most likely knew what she was doing. She began to look around with real panic. She spotted her top and put it on but couldn\u2019t find her bottoms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go find them, wait here,\u201d he said, still sporting the same grin. He quickly disappeared, back out to the main pool and she stayed in the privacy of the cave, shivering with cold. She heard Drew speaking with whoever was out there but couldn\u2019t tell what they were saying.</p><p>He came back through the waterfall and she was incredibly grateful to see her bottoms in his hands. He handed them over and she struggled to put them back on under the water.</p><p>\u201cI knew the night guard out there and he\u2019s gone now. Let\u2019s sneak out of here and go back to the room,\u201d he whispered, when she finally had her suit situated. She nodded and followed him out of the cave. She looked around nervously and there was nobody around. She climbed out of the pool, quickly wrapping a towel around her shaking body.</p><p>Drew grabbed her hand and they headed through the back hallways and stepped onto an elevator. Trinity didn\u2019t breathe fully until they were safely inside the luxurious suite.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that,\u201d she said, as she stared up at the man who had just rocked her entire universe. She was shocked to realize she didn\u2019t feel any guilt over the incident. It had been amazing and she\u2019d carry the memory with her on those long, cold, rainy nights back home.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not I\u2019ve never been so hungry for a woman that I lost my head,\u201d Drew replied with a look of disbelief on his own face. She felt better knowing he didn\u2019t do that with all the tourists. She knew it was just a vacation fling but still, every woman wanted to feel special.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower because I\u2019m freezing and can\u2019t quit shaking,\u201d she told him and headed toward the shower.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll join you, to save on water,\u201d he said with a wiggle of his brows. She\u2019d already thrown caution to the wind and decided to enjoy her last two days of vacation. They made love once again, under the warm water streaming over their bodies. Trinity didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to see water again without her stomach quivering with need.</p><p>They crawled from the shower and straight into bed. Drew pulled her tightly into his arms, caressing her back, which made her want to purr. She had to be careful because she could feel her heart swelling.</p><p>Drew felt more relaxed than he had in too long to remember and thought he could lay there with her until the end of eternity. He didn\u2019t think he was going to be able to let her go in two days. He tried to say the words aloud and didn\u2019t know where to start. If she found out who he really was, she was going to be angry but they couldn\u2019t possibly continue to see each other under false pretenses.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand how he\u2019d gotten himself into such a bad position. He needed to figure out how to fix it. Hell, he built billion dollar resorts visited by royalty. He could certainly figure out how to work things out with a woman.</p><p>He fell asleep, still trying to work it out. He reassured himself he had a couple of days left to do it. He\u2019d done more difficult things, with far less time.</p><p>Trinity stepped out of the elevator, with Drew by her side. It was her last day in paradise and she had to keep reminding herself her time with him was a one-time thing. She allowed herself to be impulsive for the first time in her life and she was trying to convince her mind it was a great vacation and that was all it was.</p><p>It was taking everything in her, to not ask for his number. She couldn\u2019t call him once she left, or she\u2019d just be going from one relationship to another and besides, long distance relationships never worked.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live in the states?\u201d Drew asked her, as they entered the restaurant for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you, then the magic of our time together starts to fade,\u201d she said jokingly.</p><p>\u201cI make it there sometimes and would love to come see you, if I\u2019m in town,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. This has been unbelievable and if we try to stay in contact the real world will break in,\u201d she quietly told him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me exactly where you live, just a state and if it\u2019s meant to be, we\u2019ll run into each other at a romantic little caf\u00e9, on a rainy day and realize we can\u2019t stand to be apart,\u201d he said, with a wicked smile. She realized even if she told him the state, the likelihood of him actually finding her was slim to none.</p><p>\u201cI live in rainy Washington,\u201d she finally replied. He seemed to tense for a moment and then relaxed and plastered his easy smile back on. She most likely imagined the moment, as Drew never seemed to get stressed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe his luck with her living in Washington. Here was the most perfect woman he\u2019d ever met and she lived in his home state. What were the odds he\u2019d meet her in another country? He traveled a lot but mostly by choice now, as his resorts were ran well without his constant surveillance. He found he was spending a lot more time home anyway, with his cousins, Derek and Ryan. With Derek married, they all seemed to center around him and his wife Jasmine.</p><p>He was a bit irritated with himself for getting so hung up on his vacation girl. He was usually much better at sticking with a plan and he\u2019d planned on dating a lot of different ladies, not falling for the first girl he decided to run over with his surf board. He smiled to himself, thinking his cousins would find his predicament hilarious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the beautiful North West often,\u201d he finally told her. Trinity hated the quickening of her heartbeat at his words. She didn\u2019t want to hope to see him again. It would make those long winter nights even longer. She was starting to fall a little too hard for the enigmatic man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be honest Drew, even though it\u2019s kind of hard for me to do so. I\u2019m always the pushover. My last boyfriend, who I thought I was going to eventually marry, decided to bed his secretary, which led me to this very impulsive vacation. I\u2019m grateful I took it and met you. I regret nothing but if I keep in contact with you when I get back to the real world, it\u2019ll change how I feel. I\u2019ll start thinking of happily ever after, instead of right now and I\u2019m not this girl you think I am. You won\u2019t like me when I\u2019m back in the real world,\u201d she said, as a tear escaped her eye.</p><p>\u201cI could never dislike you Trinity, no matter where we are, so here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. Here\u2019s my phone number and I\u2019ll wait each day for the call to come in. If you\u2019d trust me, even a little bit, you could offer me yours,\u201d he said hopefully.</p><p>After thinking a moment in the booth of her romantic getaway, she decided it couldn\u2019t hurt to simply exchange phone numbers. If he never called, she\u2019d just look at this as a magical dream but if he did call, then maybe they could have a nice night together, in the future. She\u2019d try and leave her heart out of it but she could tell she was already failing there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay we\u2019ll do it your way but believe me, I\u2019ll be the first to say I told you so, when you realize how boring I am,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cLet me be the judge of that,\u201d he said and leaned down to give her a heart stopping kiss. She was thinking it may be nice to extend her vacation a few more days. She wondered if it would make her look too needy.</p><p>\u201cThis has been the best vacation I\u2019ve ever had, even if it\u2019s the only one,\u201d she told him with a real smile.</p><p>\u201cHow about we make it a few extra days?\u201d he asked her. He was looking at her with complete seriousness. She was thinking a few extra days couldn\u2019t hurt anything.</p> <p>\u201cI might be able to do that,\u201d she shyly said to him. His smile was so brilliant it was almost blinding. She knew it was a real risk to her heart to stay longer but she couldn\u2019t seem to listen to her brain anymore. She was enjoying her time and she refused to feel guilty.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go tell the hotel you\u2019re keeping that room a little while longer,\u201d he said and grabbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cI can go back to my original room. They aren\u2019t going to want me to stay in the suite,\u201d she said with a laugh at his enthusiasm. \u201cI need to make sure I can change my tickets, as well,\u201d she finished, trying to sound reasonable.</p><p>\u201cRemember you\u2019re being impulsive, so don\u2019t worry about any of it,\u201d he said, as they got closer to the front desk.</p><p>\u201cDrew is that you?\u201d they heard a woman ask. Drew seemed to tense up instantly and Trinity turned to see who would make him so nervous. She figured it was an ex-lover, knowing he hadn\u2019t been a monk before her and wanted to reassure him she didn\u2019t care but she didn\u2019t get the chance.</p> <p>\u201cHello Nancy, how are you doing?\u201d he said. The woman was in her late forties, at least. She really didn\u2019t see why he was so nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just wonderful. You have a beautiful resort here and I\u2019m so glad we decided to stay,\u201d she said with a soft laugh of delight. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished with your amazing spa and feel like I\u2019m floating on a cloud,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re enjoying yourself. We\u2019re in a hurry but I\u2019d love to chat with you later,\u201d he told the woman, then spun Trinity around like he couldn\u2019t get out of there fast enough.</p><p>As they neared the doors, Drew was thinking he\u2019d just escaped a close call. He\u2019d avoid the lobby for the next few days. He didn\u2019t need Trinity to find out who he really was when they were getting so close. He\u2019d never felt the way he did about her with any other woman. He\u2019d come clean with her but it needed to be done in the right moment, not in the middle of his lobby.</p><p>\u201cDrew, I\u2019m sorry to bug you again but my husband really wanted to meet you and talk about the golf course,\u201d the woman approached them once again, with a distinguished looking man. \u201cDarling, this is Drew Titan, the owner of the resort. Drew, my husband, Dean,\u201d she said.</p><p>Drew shook the man\u2019s hand and sighed as he felt Trinity pull her hand from his. He had never been terrified to face anything in his life but he was sure he didn\u2019t want to turn and see the expression on her face. The couple walked away and he finally turned to face her.</p> <p>She was staring at him like he\u2019d just run over her puppy. A single tear slipped from her eye and he reached up to try and comfort her. If she\u2019d only let him explain, he knew he could make everything better. Suddenly, her hand shot out and slapped him hard enough across the face, it echoed through the lobby.</p><p>Several heads turned to stare at them in shock. The security guard started walking forward until he shook his head at him. He deserved that one, he figured.</p><p>\u201cLet me explain...\u201d he started to say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother, Mr. Titan. I don\u2019t know why you even bothered with the entire seduction scene, considering I signed those papers pretty quickly for you. Is there something else you need signed to assure your precious resort is safe from my greedy clutches?\u201d she said with venom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried you\u2019ll sue the resort,\u201d he almost shouted. This entire scenario was quickly getting out of hand. \u201cI just wanted a week with a beautiful woman who didn\u2019t know who I was. That doesn\u2019t make me the bad guy you think I am,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d never say you were a bad guy. You did everything just perfectly. You wined and dined me; you swept me off of my feet. You were the absolute perfect host and I never want to see you again,\u201d she spat at him, before walking away, with her head held high even if her knees were shaking.</p><p>Drew figured he\u2019d give her some time to cool off and then they could talk. She\u2019d realize he wasn\u2019t the villain in this story, once she got over her anger. Even though it wasn\u2019t even noon yet, he ordered a double scotch and sat there with his head in his hands. By the time he figured she had enough time to herself and made his way back up to the suite, she was gone. She didn\u2019t leave a single item behind, except for the slip of paper with his number on it. He decided it was most likely better that way.</p><p>Chapter Three</p> <p>Five months later</p><p>Trinity struggled to her feet, which was becoming harder with each passing day. Her back was hurting particularly bad that day and she was feeling a bit grumpy.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, is anyone here?\u201d she heard a voice ask. She continued up and was a bit bummed to have a new customer. Trinity owned a fairly successful floral shop, but some days she wished it was a bit less busy.</p><p>When she\u2019d found out she was pregnant, after her impromptu vacation, she\u2019d panicked at first. The more time she had to think about it though, the more excited she became. She was now excited to hold her little girl in her arms. She\u2019d received her first pictures of her unborn daughter only a few weeks ago and had been far too excited to wait to find out the sex of the baby. Besides, she was on a tight budget and had to search for clothing as it was on sale.</p><p>Drew had tried calling her for the first month after she got home but he\u2019d finally taken the hint she didn\u2019t want to talk to him and left her alone since. She had then found out she was pregnant a couple weeks after his last call but she wasn\u2019t ready to talk to him about it. She knew she was going to have to tell him but she wasn\u2019t looking forward to the conversation. She just wanted to bask in the glow of her pregnancy for as long as she could.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t basking in any glow that afternoon, though. Her back was killing her, her feet were at least twice their normal size and she\u2019d been really busy. She was incredibly grateful the day was almost over.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, it\u2019s taking me a bit longer to get to my feet these days,\u201d Trinity said, as she finally stood up. The woman smiled at her and then looked towards her hand. She frowned a bit before talking once again.</p><p>\u201cIs this you and your husband\u2019s first child?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is my first child. I\u2019m not married, though,\u201d she said, though she didn\u2019t know why she felt the need to explain herself.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the woman almost sneered at her. \u201cI don\u2019t really need anything after all,\u201d she finished and turned to leave.</p><p>Trinity was in shock as the woman walked out the door. What century was she in, that someone would look down on her because she was pregnant and not married? She decided to close a few minutes early because her day wasn\u2019t going to get any better. She walked toward the glass door and turned the sign, then saw a familiar face through the panel.</p><p>\u201cHello beautiful,\u201d her best friend, Damien Whitfield said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a breath of fresh air Damien, it\u2019s been a rough day,\u201d Trinity said as Damien threw his arms around her for a hug.</p><p>\u201cI always like to hear that from a beautiful lady,\u201d he said with his normal good humor. \u201cI\u2019m taking you out for a terrific dinner and the new horror flick,\u201d he said as he helped her lock up.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds heavenly,\u201d she replied. She needed to watch some zombies eating the human race, to help take her mind off her worries, especially that last customer. She followed him out to his vehicle and they were soon off.</p><p>They had been best friends since high school and were always there for one another, anytime one of them went through a bad break up. She didn\u2019t know how she could make it without Damien.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to work up the courage to speak to you about something but haven\u2019t known how to approach it,\u201d he said to her, as they were eating their desert.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can talk to me about anything Damien,\u201d she answered him, truly meaning it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m just going to go for it and I want you to really listen to me and seriously think about what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Damien started. She was starting to get a bit concerned. She reached across the table and took his hand in hers, encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cI think we should get married, no wait, before you start shaking your head. Remember, you promised to listen,\u201d he stopped her, when she immediately shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay I\u2019ll listen but you\u2019re crazy,\u201d she had to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not that crazy if you think about it. We\u2019re best friends and truly love each other. We\u2019ve always been there for each another, plus we never fight. Neither one of us have been able to find the right person and now you have this baby girl coming in four short months and I\u2019d make a terrific father,\u201d Damien said in one breath.</p><p>\u201cBut Damien we have never been more than friends. There has to be more than just friendship,\u201d she tried to reason with him. She didn\u2019t feel any attraction towards her best friend but she didn\u2019t want to say that to him. There was no reason to be hurtful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply asking you to think about it. I can take care of you and the baby and I think we could be happy,\u201d he said, while staring into her eyes. Trinity did love Damien and he was being reasonable but she\u2019d never been physically attracted to him. She wished she loved him romantically because he was about the most perfect guy she\u2019d ever known. But he simply didn\u2019t make her stomach quiver the way Drew had. She shook her head, to push that thought out of her mind. Drew wasn\u2019t a factor in any of her decisions.</p><p>The baby kicked her as she had that last thought and she smiled. Her little girl was a huge reminder Drew was a factor. She couldn\u2019t think about that right then. He\u2019d lied to her and been no better than her cheating ex. She couldn\u2019t possibly trust him to be a part of her life.</p><p>\u201cLet me think about things, Damien,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTake your time Trinity, I know it\u2019s a huge decision but I really do mean it. I\u2019ll take care of you and love every second doing it,\u201d he said. Damien had pretty much given up on romantic love himself but he\u2019d go to the ends of the earth for his best friend. He wished he felt more than friendship toward her but far more marriages had lasted with less going for them than what he and Trinity shared. He\u2019d hated watching her suffer over the last several months. He couldn\u2019t leave her all alone and pregnant.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if you meet the one and you\u2019re stuck with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re the one but we never realized it?\u201d he asked his own question. She laughed and promised to let him know soon. They went to their movie and the rest of the evening was relaxed as it always was. She had a feeling both of them would really regret it if she said yes but it was very tempting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled up in front of her apartment and walked her to her door, like he always did. They had never had one of those awkward moments but were having one right then. He took a deep breath and bent down to lay his lips on hers.</p><p>Trinity\u2019s first instinct was to pull away and ask him what he was possibly thinking but the man had proposed marriage to her, so it stood to reason he\u2019d want to share a kiss. She made herself relax as he deepened the kiss. His arms wrapped around her awkwardly and she laid her own hands on his arms as he drew out the kiss.</p><p>She was incredibly sad to realize she felt absolutely nothing. There was no spark, no quivering in her stomach. She wasn\u2019t repulsed or anything but it was like kissing a cousin. He finally pulled away from her and she saw the regret in his own eyes. It was obvious he\u2019d felt nothing either.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you for now. Let me know what you decide. Our marriage doesn\u2019t have to be about passion and unrequited love, it can be about friendship and loving your baby girl,\u201d he said to her. She wasn\u2019t sure if he was trying to convince himself, or her. It didn\u2019t really matter, she thought because it wasn\u2019t about either of them, it was about her baby.</p> <p>She reached up on her toes and kissed him softly on the cheek, then went through her door. She leaned against it, as a single tear fell down her face. She really wished she\u2019d felt at least a smidgen of passion from her best friend.</p><p>Trinity was closing up her shop once again but feeling much better. Some of her swelling had finally gone down, helping her to feel a bit more human. It had been a week since Damien had proposed to her and she\u2019d finally decided to accept. She\u2019d tried and failed with romance and it would be really nice to have someone there to help her raise her child.</p><p>The two of them had spoken several times on the phone since their awkward kiss and were fine. They didn\u2019t discuss it but focused on their friendship, like they always had. She was lucky to have such a wonderful man in her life.</p><p>It was far more important to have security and love, than to have passion. She\u2019d loved Damien for a long time and was sure it could grow if she wished for it. She\u2019d just demand of her body to respond to him. She held her head up high with that thought. She was a stubborn person and she\u2019d will herself to obey.</p><p>Damien started walking towards the shop, as soon as she was finished locking the door. She took a deep breath and got ready to tell him her decision. He seemed to know she was ready to talk to him because he said nothing as he approached. He just waited for her to gather her breath. She finally looked up into his beautiful eyes. He really was attractive; she didn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t desire him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll marry you, if the offer\u2019s still on the table,\u201d she told him with a tentative smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Damien told her, as he wrapped his arms around her expanding body and kissed her forehead. She felt like she was at home when she was in his arms and she thought she\u2019d made the right decision. She refused to acknowledge the doubts trying to enter her mind. She also refused to acknowledge his hug did nothing more than comfort her needy body.</p><p>\u201cI think we should do it before the baby is born. If you want a big wedding that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s all up to you. I want your wedding day to be special and you know money isn\u2019t an issue. We\u2019ll have a good marriage and I don\u2019t want you to have regrets about the wedding itself,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can just do it at the courthouse, I don\u2019t have anyone I\u2019d invite to a real wedding anyway,\u201d she said a bit sadly. He reluctantly agreed with her and they started to head down the street together. Her apartment wasn\u2019t far away. Their hands slipped together as they made their way down the sidewalk. That was a natural thing, as they were comfortable touching one another. Heck, she\u2019d fallen asleep in his arms before, while watching movies. They were comfortable with each other, which was why their friendship had always worked out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think about getting you a ring. I\u2019ll do that tomorrow,\u201d he said as they climbed the stairs and turned the corner. She hadn\u2019t thought about a ring either, as she didn\u2019t really think of the marriage as real. She really had to fight back tears because she was settling and making him do so as well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a fancy ring Damien, just a simple band,\u201d she told him, right before they turned the corner.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you need a ring for?\u201d she heard Drew ask, before she stopped suddenly and looked up at the deep blue eyes she hadn\u2019t seen in five months. Her world seemed to stop spinning for a moment and she felt the panic start deep inside her gut. She hadn\u2019t expected to see him again and certainly not in this situation. She couldn\u2019t believe the rush of attraction washing through her from just the sight of him. Why couldn\u2019t she feel the same with Damien?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she was barely able to whisper at him.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question first,\u201d he said, as he glared from her to Damien and then down to her stomach. Drew had thought of no other but her over the last five months and wasn\u2019t happy to find her with another man and very obviously pregnant. Had she gotten over him far more quickly than he would\u2019ve liked? She was very pregnant and it was either his, or she had jumped into the arms of another man right away. Either way he wasn\u2019t happy with her at that moment.</p><p>She could see he was trying to figure out exactly how far along she was. She heard her neighbor\u2019s door, across the hall, open and she wanted to get away from her nosy neighbor, before having this personal conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired Drew and don\u2019t want to talk right now. The shop is open tomorrow, why don\u2019t you come over there around noon,\u201d she said, as she opened her door and stepped inside. Damien followed behind her slowly, with Drew right on his heels. She glared at him, as he entered her sanctuary and looked around.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll talk now and I\u2019d still like to hear why you need a ring,\u201d he stated to her. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d ever thought the man was simply a resort employee. He exuded raw power, in both manner and dress. She was horrified at her traitorous body for its response to him. He was even more impressive than she remembered, if that were possible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d Damien said, since it was obvious she wasn\u2019t going to say anything. Damien could tell at once this was the baby\u2019s father. He\u2019d stand by her side no matter what, but he had a feeling their story wasn\u2019t quite finished. He stood aside to offer his support but if Trinity could work things out with the man he\u2019d be happy for her. He hated to admit it to himself but he was somewhat relieved the man was stepping back in the picture. He loved Trinity and would do anything for her but he knew she deserved so much more than a passionless marriage.</p><p>\u201cI see it didn\u2019t take you long to bounce back after our relationship, or is this the man who cheated on you?\u201d Drew sneered. Damien was close to taking a swing at the man but he didn\u2019t want to make the situation worse for Trinity. He didn\u2019t like being compared to the bastard who broke Trinity\u2019s heart.</p> <p>\u201cNone of it is any of your business Drew. You need to leave now, we have nothing to talk about,\u201d she said, as she glared at him. He looked down at her rounded stomach again, then back to her face and she could feel the heat redden her cheeks. His eyes narrowed even more.</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you Trinity?\u201d he asked her. He was well aware their first time in the pool, they hadn\u2019t used protection. He was never so stupid as to have unprotected sex but he\u2019d lost his mind a lot that week. He\u2019d thought she\u2019d get ahold of him if there were consequences from their week. Hell, for that matter, he\u2019d tried calling her for a month. He wasn\u2019t used to being rejected and hers had wounded his pride, more than he\u2019d ever admit.</p><p>He had also decided after five months, her anger would\u2019ve been cooled off. He couldn\u2019t get his mind off her and finally decided he had to see her again. She\u2019d just have to get over the fact he owned the resort. If she found out he actually owned many resorts, she\u2019d probably really freak on him.</p><p>Trinity realized he wasn\u2019t going to leave until he had his answers so she reluctantly decided she may as well get it out of the way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m five months along,\u201d she said, with her head held high. Drew blew out his breath as if he was surprised she\u2019d tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is mine then,\u201d he said, as fact rather than a question. She couldn\u2019t tell how he was feeling about his child being born in a few months.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Drew. We had a week together and it didn\u2019t work out. I don\u2019t expect anything from you, so you\u2019re free to leave. I know how you like your papers signed though, so if you have your attorney fax them to my shop, I\u2019ll sign whatever you need to be released from responsibility and you can be on your way,\u201d she said, suddenly too exhausted to stand anymore. She walked over to the couch and sat down, before her knees gave out.</p><p>\u201cTrinity you need to figure some things out, so I\u2019m going to leave. Call me if you need me and I\u2019ll be here within a few minutes,\u201d Damien said, before glaring at Drew. He walked out of the apartment, leaving her alone with the man who had changed her life forever. She didn\u2019t want Damien to leave but it wasn\u2019t fair for her to have him stay and deal with her problems. She watched as he walked out the door and blew out a breath, as she waited for Drew to say what he needed.</p><p>Drew began to pace the small apartment. He was so furious. There was no way he could sit down. Finally he turned to face her, when he felt he had his emotions more under control. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d keep something as important as the creation of their baby from him.</p><p>\u201cWere you going to tell me about the baby?\u201d he asked her. That was the first thing he wanted an answer to. He had a really bad feeling the answer was no.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve, eventually,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t see how it mattered either way as they weren\u2019t a couple. She\u2019d have thought he\u2019d rejoice that she wasn\u2019t asking him for anything. Didn\u2019t most men run in the other direction when women so much as mentioned a child?</p><p>\u201cWho was that guy you were with?\u201d he asked. He was angry about many things but the guy talking about getting her a ring was at the top of the list. She was carrying his child and no other man had a right to take his place. He would\u2019ve been there so much sooner if she would\u2019ve just been honest with him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Damien, we decided to get married,\u201d she said in a matter-of-fact tone, like she was discussing going to the grocery store, or the weather. She didn\u2019t seem like a bride to be.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been seeing him?\u201d Drew asked between clinched teeth. The thought of her with another man caused him physical pain, especially considering she was carrying his child in her womb. They were his family, not some other man\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend,\u201d she said, before really thinking about her answer. She was so used to Damien and she as friends, to think of them romantically was nearly impossible. She thought later maybe she should\u2019ve sounded more like they were a romantic couple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you marrying him?\u201d he asked her calmly and because she was still not thinking properly, she answered him honestly.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to help me with the baby,\u201d she said simply. If she would\u2019ve looked up and seen his face, she would\u2019ve realized her mistake in being honest.</p><p>\u201cYou want another man to raise my child?\u201d he asked her. She finally realized there was something wrong, by the tone of his voice. She looked up at his face and what she saw took her breath away. She could understand now how he was the business man he was. He could make all men quiver at his feet with the look of pure fury in his eyes. She stared at him with wide eyes, as she wondered what to say.</p><p>\u201cLook, we both know the week we had was a mistake. I\u2019m not going to punish my child by trying to pretend otherwise,\u201d she finally said.</p> <p>\u201cTell your friend the marriage is off because the real father will be doing the right thing,\u201d he sneered at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Drew,\u201d she snapped back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one being ridiculous? You were trying to keep my child from me. If I hadn\u2019t shown up here, you would\u2019ve never told me,\u201d he said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted and I\u2019m done with this conversation,\u201d she said as she stood up. \u201cPlease lock the door behind you,\u201d she finished and left the room. She climbed into bed and let the exhaustion take her away.</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>Drew watched in amazement as Trinity walked away. He wasn\u2019t used to being defied by anyone and he was certainly not used to someone dismissing him, like she\u2019d just done. He heard the click of her bedroom door, before he thought to go after her.</p><p>He thought about breaking her door down and demanding they finish the conversation but she had looked exhausted and he was sure that wasn\u2019t good for his son or daughter. He looked around the tiny apartment. There wasn\u2019t any room for a baby. Hell he could barely move more than a couple of feet from wall to wall.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think it was possible but her apartment was even smaller than the home he had grown up in. He\u2019d been incredibly poor growing up but his family had taken good care of him. He was still closer than brothers were, with his two cousins. He couldn\u2019t wait to tell them he was going to be a father.</p><p>He sunk down onto her couch, since his legs no longer wanted to support him. The more he sat there, the more it sunk in he\u2019d have a child in four short months. He wasn\u2019t ready for it but then again who was ever ready. He wished he had more time to prepare.</p><p>He noticed a weird looking picture on the coffee table and reached for it. He realized it was a picture of his child. He could see the full shape of the head and body. It had some weird numbers on it, which he didn\u2019t understand. He stared for who knows how long, thinking his child already had his nose.</p><p>He looked down again and saw some paperwork. One was information about a three dimensional sonogram he was assuming was the picture in his hand. The other paper said his child was going to be a girl. His breath rushed out as he realized he was going to have a daughter.</p> <p>He felt the smile spread as he looked at his daughter\u2019s first picture. He could imagine her in his arms and spoiling her rotten. His cousin, who was more of a brother, Derek and his wife Jasmine, just had a baby girl a few months ago and she was about the cutest thing he\u2019d ever seen in his life. He was head over heels in love with her. If he felt that way about his niece, he couldn\u2019t imagine how he\u2019d feel about his own daughter.</p><p>He decided he needed to have a walk. He was far too wound up to pace her tiny apartment. He made sure the door was securely locked and headed back down the staircase. When he stepped back outside, he saw Damien leaning against a wall. He was never one to run from a confrontation, so he approached the man, who was trying to take his place.</p><p>The two alpha males glared at one another. Drew had to respect the guy was standing up for his friend but he was messing with his woman and his child.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be marrying her,\u201d Drew finally spoke, in a deadly calm voice.</p><p>\u201cI figured as much,\u201d Damien said with a cocky smile. Drew relaxed as he realized the guy wasn\u2019t going to try and fight for her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still hanging around then?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure Trinity was going to be okay. She has been my best friend for a lot of years and we have always taken care of each other, which is why I offered to marry her. I don\u2019t want her to be alone,\u201d the man replied simply.</p><p>\u201cI can understand that. I would\u2019ve done the same thing,\u201d Drew replied.</p> <p>\u201cJust know if you hurt her, you\u2019ll have to answer to me,\u201d Damien said, as he stood to his full height. Both men were about the same size and it was obvious Damien would try to defend her honor.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get a drink,\u201d Drew said. He wanted to learn more about Damien and he wanted to know what Trinity had been up to the last five months.</p><p>\u201cI could use a beer,\u201d Damien replied and the men walked down the street together.</p><p>\u201cHow has she been?\u201d Drew asked as they sat down in a sparsely crowded bar.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been sad ever since she got back from her vacation. I knew something was up but at first I just assumed she was upset over her breakup with her ex-boyfriend. Soon it was obvious there was something else going on. She didn\u2019t tell me about the pregnancy until she could no longer hide it. She has never kept anything from me, so I was even more concerned. She wouldn\u2019t talk about you. What the hell did you do to her?\u201d Damien finally finished and stared at Drew with suspicion.</p><p>Drew sighed and decided he may as well tell the story to her best friend. He figured the guy could be his ally in the whole mess. When he finished Damien sat back with a slight chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou really know how to tick her off,\u201d Damien finally managed to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah thanks for that,\u201d Drew replied sarcastically. The men were both relaxed since they had a better understanding of each other.</p><p>\u201cJust calling it how I see it,\u201d Damien said. Damien was surprised to find he actually liked the man. He\u2019d been pretty stupid trying to keep things from Trinity but Damien could understand why he did it. He himself was incredibly wealthy and didn\u2019t often let people know who he was. It just tended to change how they acted around him. He wanted the same thing Drew did, which was to be loved for who he was and not for what he had.</p><p>The two men chatted for a while, then went their separate ways. Drew jumped in his vehicle, having no idea where he was headed, until he pulled up in front of his cousin\u2019s house. He needed to talk to someone who would understand.</p><p>He entered the code to the gate and drove up the long driveway. As the huge house came into view, he felt some of the tension leave his body. The home may be an extremely large mansion but it was also homey and filled with love.</p><p>He walked through the front doors, not bothering to knock and followed the sounds of laughter. He could tell they were all out at the pool. Good, he could use a swim.</p><p>He stepped through the patio doors and spotted little Jacob in a splashing war with Derek. Jacob was the first one to spot him.</p><p>\u201cUncle Drew, your back,\u201d Jacob yelled and jumped from the pool and gave him a very wet hug. He loved every second of it.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing, Squirt?\u201d he asked his nephew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. I was totally beating dad,\u201d he said with excitement.</p><p>\u201cHey, I was catching up,\u201d Derek said as he stepped up beside his son and shook Drew\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re back in town early,\u201d he finished with a raise of his brows. The cousins knew each other well and Derek could tell something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cHey Buddy, can you let your mom know Drew is here and see if she can make us something to eat?\u201d Derek asked Jacob. He agreed with enthusiasm and ran back into the house to search for his mom. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Drew? You look like your world has been flipped upside down?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a father,\u201d Drew blurted out. He didn\u2019t need to ease into things with his cousin. It was better to just get it all out there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great Drew, I\u2019m really happy for you but why are you looking so stressed? Being a father is about the greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d Derek said.</p><p>Derek had only found out about a year and a half ago he was a father. Jasmine had been his childhood sweetheart and circumstances had kept them apart until recently. Once they\u2019d found each other again, Derek also found out he had a nine year old son and vowed to not lose any more time with him. He\u2019d also realized he still loved Jacob\u2019s mother and they had married and now had a beautiful daughter added to their family. Drew wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they had a couple more kids as well because they both loved being parents.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still in shock. You remember the girl I told you about five months ago at my resort, well I decided to pay her a visit and found her extremely pregnant. She wasn\u2019t going to tell me and she was planning on getting married to her best friend. I want to strangle her about as badly as I want to pull her into my arms,\u201d Drew said, as he blew out a frustrated breath.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Derek said as he let out a chuckle. He had dealt with every type of emotion when he and Jasmine had found each other again.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful how you proceed, Cousin because you don\u2019t want to spook her. That\u2019s your baby and you\u2019re lucky to have found her so soon. Just think, in four months you\u2019ll be watching your son or daughter come into this world,\u201d Derek reminded him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl. I\u2019m having a daughter,\u201d Drew said with real excitement.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so great,\u201d Derek said and slapped Drew on the back. Jasmine stepped through the doors, with Britney in her arms. Drew immediately held his own arms out to take his niece. She was so tiny and precious and he couldn\u2019t get enough of cuddling with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so great?\u201d Jasmine asked as she handed over the baby. Drew immediately began blowing bubbles on her little tummy, making her giggle in her tiny baby voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a father,\u201d Drew said as he looked up at Jasmine. She was an amazing woman and he was glad she and Derek found each other again. Hell, he hadn\u2019t thought it was possible to find a woman as great as her until he\u2019d met Trinity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so great, Drew,\u201d she said, as she threw her arms around him and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cWhy have I not met this woman?\u201d she then questioned him, seeming a little hurt.</p><p>He explained the story to her and she seemed a bit appeased but not completely. \u201cI insist on meeting her right away,\u201d Jasmine said with her typical stubbornness. Drew figured it was good to have her on his side. He gave her the address of Trinity\u2019s floral shop. He knew Jasmine would be there first thing in the morning.</p><p>\u201cYou boys watch the kids and I\u2019ll make a celebratory dinner,\u201d Jasmine said as she turned towards the kitchen. Drew\u2019s mouth started to water because Jasmine was a phenomenal cook.</p><p>He sat in one of the lounge chairs, cuddling his niece close to his chest. She let out a little yawn and closed her eyes. He continued to rub along her tiny back and smiled as she let out a soft sigh. He couldn\u2019t believe in only a few short months he\u2019d be holding his own little girl. He never thought he\u2019d want to be a father but knowing he was about to have a child, completely changed things. He could hardly wait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched as Derek and Jacob splashed around in the pool, then his stomach growled as the smells started drifting out from the kitchen. He knew he\u2019d made the right decision coming over. He finally started to relax and then make plans for how he\u2019d win Trinity. He was a business man; he didn\u2019t lose his head over any situation.</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in ten minutes, get cleaned up,\u201d Jasmine called from the other room. The boys didn\u2019t have to be told twice. Jacob and Derek scrambled from the pool and headed towards the changing room. They were back out within minutes. The three of them walked inside.</p><p>\u201cLet me take her from you, so you can eat,\u201d Jasmine said as she held out her arms. He was reluctant to give the baby up. \u201cYou can hold her again after dinner, besides she\u2019s asleep and just lying there, anyway,\u201d Jasmine said with a laugh, as she took the baby. His arms suddenly felt so empty.</p><p>\u201cI love it when she\u2019s asleep and all cuddly,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cNothing like a beautiful lady lying across my chest,\u201d he added with a wiggle of his brows. Jasmine slapped his arm, then walked to the den to lay Britney down in her portable crib.</p> <p>They ate an incredibly great meal together and Drew decided to stay overnight. He had no desire to go stay at the hotel he normally stayed at when in town. Actually, since his cousin had purchased the house, he normally stayed there when he was in town. He was there for only a few days at a time, before he was off to either building another resort, or checking out one of the many finished ones. He knew he could slow down and be home more but he was so used to running all the time.</p><p>He thought it was time to get his own place, with a child to think about. He\u2019d look for something near his cousin because he wanted the kids to grow up together. That was more important to him than anything else. Derek, Ryan and Drew had all grown up together, creating a solid bond and closeness like no other. He knew their children would feel the same way.</p><p>He sat in the den and had a drink, while waiting for Derek and Jasmine to put the kids down for bed. Derek joined him after a bit and the two men sat for a while, relaxing and talking business, among other things.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do next?\u201d Derek finally asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry her, although convincing her of that may be a bit difficult, since she will barely even talk to me,\u201d Drew said, more than a bit frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve certainly been there,\u201d Derek said with understanding.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve told her the truth of who I was from the beginning but it was nice to have a woman like me, thinking I was just an everyday resort worker,\u201d Drew told his cousin. They both understood how he felt, considering where they\u2019d come from. They had been so poor growing up and so many people had looked down their noses at them. Now that they were wealthy, it was the opposite and far too many people wanted to be with them for what they could get out of them.</p><p>\u201cSometimes money is a real curse,\u201d Drew said with frustration.</p><p>\u201cIt will all work out. You guys obviously have a connection and now you have this child together. I know you\u2019ll be able to work things through,\u201d Derek said.</p><p>Drew made his way to the apartment above the garage and laid there in bed, for hours. His mind would not shut off and allow him to sleep. Finally sometime around mornings first light, he fell into a restless sleep. He was anxious to see Trinity again and just wanted the night to end.</p><p>Chapter Five</p> <p>Trinity stepped out of her apartment and walked down the stairs. She was exhausted. She\u2019d tossed and turned the entire night, thinking about Drew and what was going to happen next. She was still beyond angry with the man. He\u2019d lied to her because he was afraid she\u2019d sue his precious resort.</p><p>Even if he had been worried about the resort, he didn\u2019t need to play out the whole seduction thing. It was downright insulting, she thought. She\u2019d been grateful he hadn\u2019t been there in the morning because she may have thrown a mug at him. She figured he\u2019d come to his senses and ran away.</p><p>She stepped down onto the street and the man who she hadn\u2019t been able to get out of her thoughts was right there, leaning against an expensive vehicle, with his typical cocky smile on his face.</p><p>As she studied the man in his custom made Armani suit she couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d ever believed he was only a resort worker. She must\u2019ve been really shook up over her ex-boyfriend\u2019s betrayal. He exuded raw masculine power from the tips of his thousand dollar loafers, to the cut of his expertly done hair. The man radiated power and she knew she needed to put a wall between them or she could easily fall under his spell once again.</p><p>She ignored him and began her walk down the street. She was hoping if she pretended he wasn\u2019t there he\u2019d take a hint and disappear. She wasn\u2019t that lucky. He quickly caught up to her and didn\u2019t look too happy about being ignored.</p><p>\u201cYou know we need to have a talk,\u201d Drew said to her. She continued walking, choosing not to acknowledge his presence. She knew she was acting childish but she didn\u2019t care. It was her prerogative if she wanted to act that way.</p><p>Drew followed beside her and had to control his temper. She was getting too comfortable ignoring him, which was making him angry. He wanted to push her up against the wall and remind her who he was. She hadn\u2019t ignored him when his hands had been roaming all over her body. She\u2019d been crying out his name and begging him for more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going away and the longer you pretend like I\u2019m not here, the longer you\u2019re going to have me trailing you,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. Trinity in no way wanted to have a confrontation with the man in the streets so close to her shop. She continued walking and once she reached her shop she unlocked the door and went inside, with him right on her heels.</p> <p>As soon as they made it past the doors, he seemed to have had enough and grabbed her arm to spin her around. The look of fury on his face halted her protest. She\u2019d seen many faces of the man but never once had she seen this on his features.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to talk to you,\u201d he growled at her. She tried to pull her arm away and realized it was useless. She didn\u2019t see how he could grip her so tightly without hurting her. She really didn\u2019t like the way her body responded to the smallest touch. She was far from over the man who\u2019d nearly destroyed her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what we have to talk about Drew. You were worried about your resort so you romanced me. I was feeling impulsive for the first and only time in my life and was a willing body who practically jumped into your bed. I\u2019m not justifying all of that because we happened to make a mistake and not use any protection. My child isn\u2019t for sale and neither am I,\u201d she snapped, losing her own temper.</p><p>\u201cI never once tried to buy you and if you think I\u2019d ever walk away from my child, you\u2019re sadly mistaken,\u201d he snapped at her.</p><p>How would she know what he would or wouldn\u2019t do? She\u2019d only spent one week with the man. It had been the most memorable week of her life though, which frightened her. She had a bad feeling he wasn\u2019t going to be easy to forget. It had already been five months and she still had erotic dreams.</p><p>\u201cThis is my child, make no mistakes about that,\u201d she snapped right back. She couldn\u2019t believe this person she was becoming. Normally, she would\u2019ve been quivering in her boots at the look on his face. She\u2019d always been the first to back down and that\u2019s how it had always been so easy for people to walk over her. She figured the pregnancy had brought out her protective instincts.</p><p>\u201cWe will get married,\u201d he demanded of her. She looked at him like he had lost his mind. There was no way she\u2019d marry him. He was everything she\u2019d vowed to stay away from in a man. If she did marry, it would be to someone like Damien, someone kind and understanding. She wouldn\u2019t marry someone who openly deceived her and she wouldn\u2019t marry just because she got pregnant.</p><p>\u201cYou need to understand this really quickly, Mr. Titan,\u201d she said with sarcasm, \u201cI won\u2019t marry you, ever,\u201d she finished and tugged at her arm again. He wasn\u2019t hurting her in any way but the grip was firm and he didn\u2019t seem to be in any hurry to let her go.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call me Mr. Titan when you were screaming out my name in passion,\u201d he said to her, taking more offense to the formal name than any of her other words. She narrowed her eyes further at him. She didn\u2019t need to be reminded of how she\u2019d behaved on that island. There must have been something in the water because she\u2019d done things there she\u2019d never even begin to think about doing in the real world.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that was who you were,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously the most frustrating woman I \u2018ve ever had to deal with,\u201d he almost shouted at her.</p><p>\u201cThen stop dealing with me and go away,\u201d she yelled back.</p><p>They glared at one another, neither willing to back down. They were both breathing hard as the silence drug on. Drew suddenly pulled her up against him and crushed his lips down on hers. She was too shocked to react at first and stood there like a rag doll, as his tongue rubbed over her lips, looking for a way to enter.</p><p>When she came out of her shock, she pushed against him for about three seconds, before the heat started to pool in her stomach and thighs. She hadn\u2019t been kissed like that for five months and her hormones were all over the place with the pregnancy. Her anger quickly changed to an all-consuming passion as his lips continued to stroke hers, while his hands rubbed up and down her back.</p><p>His own temper had seemed to evaporate as he continued to stroke her body and mouth. She gasped as a current of electricity shot down her core, making her knees go weak. The gasp was all he needed to slip his tongue inside. He tangled it with hers and the fire built up to an inferno inside of her.</p><p>She was no longer trying to push him away but clutching him closer to her. She forgot about the fight, her anger, or even who she was, as he deepened the kiss. His hands moved down to grip her backside and pull her up against his very obvious arousal. Her stomach was sticking out but not so far yet that she couldn\u2019t feel his impressive erection pressing into her. Within minutes she wanted him.</p><p>He backed her up against her counter and lifted her, so he could slide between her legs. He never broke contact with her lips. She had never been so devoured in her life and she didn\u2019t have any desire for it to end. There really was a very thin line between anger and passion and she had crossed it without any thought.</p><p>He spread her legs apart, pressing himself up close against her, as he continued with the heart-stopping kiss. Her hands circled up, around his neck, while her fingers dove into his thick hair. She tugged on the strands, pulling him closer to her. He growled in his throat as he gladly obliged her unspoken request. In the back of her mind, there was a voice shouting at her to stop but she didn\u2019t want to listen. She wanted to keep feeling the exquisite pleasure he was bringing her needy body.</p><p>He slipped his hand up under her blouse, running his fingers over the bump of her stomach and up to her aching breasts. She groaned in need as his hand rubbed over her nipples, poking through her thin bra. He tested their weight and groaned again as he felt their increased size spilling out into the palm of his hand. He pinched her nipples and she almost released right there on the counter. She\u2019d been responsive to him before but it was nothing in comparison to what she was feeling now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moved his hands down, towards her skirt and started pushing it up out of the way. They had both forgotten they were in a public place, where anyone could walk in. They just needed to relieve the intense pressure building in their bodies. She needed this; she deserved this, what could one more time hurt?</p><p>The phone suddenly rang, bringing Trinity back to reality. It kept ringing and she suddenly pulled back, realizing where she was and what she was doing. She gasped in shock as she looked up into Drew\u2019s desire filled eyes. His hands were still holding her close and he was bending his head to take her lips back with his.</p><p>The phone had done nothing to dampen his desire and he was ready to continue where they\u2019d left off, before the interruption. Without realizing what she was doing, her hand came up and slapped him hard across the cheek. The sound echoed through the small shop and Trinity sat there, stunned she\u2019d just done that. She was too shocked to say anything and stared at him open-mouthed.</p><p>The slap seemed to clear his head because he took a step back, as he looked at her in anger. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d hit him again and he had actually allowed it. If any other woman had done such a thing to him, he would\u2019ve walked out the door without a backward glance but he couldn\u2019t seem to stay away from her. He may have deserved it at the resort but not this time, she had been just as hungry for him as he was for her.</p> <p>\u201cDid you get it all out?\u201d he asked her in a deadly calm voice, which was far more frightening than if he were yelling.</p><p>She had her hand over her mouth in shock. She really hadn\u2019t meant to do that. She couldn\u2019t blame him for the passionate kissing, as she had done nothing to stop it until the phone rang. She was still furious with him but she\u2019d been just as excited as he had.</p><p>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t mean to do that,\u201d she finally managed to stutter. He rubbed his cheek and raised his brows at her.</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell feels like you meant to do it and you put your full weight into it,\u201d he said with a smirk. He was regaining his composure and once again acting like the one in control. She narrowed her eyes as he mentioned her growing weight. She then put her hand protectively over her stomach, reminding them both she carried a child in there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back, this discussion is in no way over,\u201d he told her, in what seemed far more of a threat than anything else and stomped out the door.</p> <p>Drew walked down the street, feeling more frustrated than ever before in his life. It was more than obvious he still wanted her with a need frightening in its intensity but he needed to set that aside.</p><p>She was carrying his child and that meant she needed to marry him. He would\u2019ve been far happier in a time where he could simply drag her down the aisle and make her marry him. It would be so much easier than playing these stupid games.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a man used to being told no and he found he didn\u2019t like it. He hadn\u2019t expected her to fall into his arms at first glance but he certainly hadn\u2019t expected her to still be full of hostility. He\u2019d messed up with one small lie and she\u2019d just have to get over it.</p><p>He figured she was like other women though and she had her price. He\u2019d make her a comfortable woman and in turn he\u2019d get to be there to raise his child. He couldn\u2019t even think about her meeting another man his child would call dad. He was the baby\u2019s father and no other man would play that role.</p><p>He stopped in a local pub and ordered a double bourbon. He never drank so early in the morning but unless he wanted to walk the streets with an obvious arousal and steam coming out of his ears, he needed something to soothe his desire and his temper. He had to smile at how quickly anger had turned into burning passion.</p><p>He\u2019d never in his life, experienced so much desire for a woman. He forgot a woman as soon as he walked out the door. He enjoyed women, he loved their soft curves and he loved their hair and laughter. He loved everything about them but he never ever got hung up on just one. He didn\u2019t think it was possible for him to want one woman more than he wanted anything else. Hell, he\u2019d throw away millions of dollars for one more night with Trinity.</p> <p>He signaled the bartender and ordered one more drink. He had a feeling it was going to be a very long day and he was getting ready for round two with Trinity. He had to smile at her spunk, though because he had a feeling being married to her was never going to get boring.</p><p>Drew arrived at her shop later in the afternoon and was very proud of himself for acting so calm. He walked in the doors and after she glanced up to see who it was, she went back to what she was doing, as if he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>He was getting really tired of her acting like he was non-existent. He walked over to her work station and stood there, with their body\u2019s touching. He knew she couldn\u2019t ignore him if he was touching her. He wouldn\u2019t mind finishing what they had started earlier anyway.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of giving people their space?\u201d she finally snapped at him. He smiled as he heard the tension in her voice. His presence affected her far more than she wanted to let on.</p><p>\u201cBut darling we should most definitely get used to touching, as we\u2019re going to be married,\u201d he came right back with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to marry you,\u201d she said slowly, like she was talking to a child.</p><p>\u201cWell then the neighbors are going to talk about you being my mistress,\u201d he told her. \u201cOur child will be looked down upon because her mother is shacking up with her dad,\u201d he added as if he was unconcerned.</p><p>She was so frustrated with the man, she had to give up on the arrangement she was working on because she was destroying the expensive flowers. She began putting things away and glanced at the clock. She still had a few hours to go before she could close the shop. She really wanted to storm out the doors but it wouldn\u2019t do her much good anyway, as he\u2019d most likely follow her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be living with you so that won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d she finally calmed down enough to say to him. It still came out between clinched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a full time father to my child, so we\u2019re going to be together one way or the other,\u201d he threatened her. She threw up her hands and stomped off to the bathroom. She stayed in there for a while, trying to figure out what she was going to do about the man.</p><p>When she walked out, he was at the counter with a woman, who had her biggest bouquet on the counter. She was flirting openly with him and Trinity was surprised to feel the coil of jealousy in her gut. She told herself she didn\u2019t want to be with him and she didn\u2019t care who he flirted with but when the woman let out a giggle and fluttered her eyelashes, she had to fight not to claw at her.</p><p>\u201cIt was so great to meet you and I hope you have a wonderful time at your mother\u2019s,\u201d he said with a flirtatious smile. The woman actually blushed before she finally turned around to leave. Trinity stood there, open-mouthed as he turned around.</p><p>\u201cI used to work at a local hardware store when I was a teenager and luckily your register was similar so I took care of the sale,\u201d he said to her as he handed her the receipt. She looked down and noticed he\u2019d way overcharged the woman. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how much you were selling the bouquet for so I took a guess from some I\u2019ve purchased before. I hope it was correct,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cNo, you actually sold it for twice the amount I would\u2019ve normally sold it for,\u201d she said. She was shocked the woman paid so much. Trinity was thinking she needed to hire an attractive guy to work in her shop. Maybe then her sales would go way up.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re charging far too low for your arrangements, then,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your business advice, Drew,\u201d she snapped. She knew he was most likely right but she was worried she\u2019d lose business if she charged too much and she\u2019d rather have a lot of customers, who were paying less than take the risk. It meant she had to work more hours and far harder but it was working out.</p><p>\u201cSo I hope you have come to your senses by now. I can arrange a wedding within a couple of days,\u201d he said in a conversational tone. She couldn\u2019t believe he was so overconfident he felt he could criticize her and talk about marrying her in the same sentence. He really needed someone to come along and knock him off of his pedestal. She was more than willing to be the one to do it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to tell you this for the last time and I hope you\u2019ll hear it this time. I\u2019m not going to marry you. What happened on the island was a mistake and should\u2019ve never taken place. I\u2019m not going to repeat that mistake by becoming your wife. After the baby is born, we\u2019ll talk about visitation but right now she\u2019s in my stomach so you can go ahead and leave for the next four months,\u201d she said and walked towards her front doors.</p><p>She pulled the door open and looked at him expectantly. He looked at her with narrowed eyes, trying to decide what to do. He was really considering that shot gun wedding idea. It was becoming more and more appealing.</p><p>He finally walked over to the door and pressed his body up close to hers. He was happy when she didn\u2019t back down but glared up at him instead. Her passion turned him on. He smiled down at her and kissed her before she knew what was happening. It was a short kiss, to show her he was far from giving up.</p><p>\u201cI have some errands to run today but I\u2019ll be back,\u201d he told her with promise. She stood there and watched him walk down the street. She had a mixture of relief and sadness, watching him walk away. She was determined to protect herself but the man was so confident and had so much sex appeal it was hard for her to remember who she even was when he was around.</p><p>She closed the door and went back to work on some bouquets. She had a wedding coming up and it was a lot of work getting all the arrangements ready. At least it wasn\u2019t prom season, she thought with relief. The money was always good but her hands were done for by the end.</p><p>Drew walked down the street and climbed into his car. His forceful approach was obviously not working, so he was going to have to try something new. His father had always liked to say you caught more flies with honey than vinegar, so maybe he needed to change his methods of trying to catch her. Of course, he really didn\u2019t understand that saying, since he didn\u2019t know why anyone would want to catch flies. He drove to his hotel and forged a new game plan.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Trinity got ready for the new day, not wanting to step outside her tiny apartment. She knew Drew would most likely be there and she didn\u2019t know how long she was going to be able to resist his charm. It was easier for her when he was being demanding and arrogant but when he turned on the sex appeal, she was a goner. She was hoping he\u2019d take the hint and disappear for a while, so she didn\u2019t have to fight him and herself too. The baby kicked her hard in the ribs, as if she didn\u2019t like the thought. She rubbed her belly and whispered soothingly to her daughter.</p><p>She was always starving in the mornings but didn\u2019t have the energy to fix much, so she grabbed a muffin and poured herself a large glass of milk and got ready for her day. She\u2019d be alone at the shop all day and noticed it was starting to bother her. She needed to hire a couple people but she didn\u2019t want to pay out the money until she absolutely had to. She was thinking it may be a better idea to work for someone else so she could at least be around other employee\u2019s. Even though it had been her dream to own her own place, she was finding it lonely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked the few blocks to her shop, looking around everywhere, a bit disappointed not to see Drew. She scowled at herself for that thought as well. She didn\u2019t want him to be around and she needed to always remember that. She blamed her disappointment on her hormones, since they were going crazy.</p><p>She turned her key in the lock and flipped the open sign around. She always took such pride when walking through the front doors because it was all hers. She had worked hard to make her dream come true and took a lot of pride in the small but beautiful shop. Her touch was present in every square inch of the room.</p><p>She put her purse away and stepped back to the floral station, to begin making some bouquets for walk in clients. She had a few orders needing to be delivered but other than that, it was a slow day.</p><p>The bell over her door rang and she looked up to see Drew striding inside, looking far too good for so early in the morning. She should\u2019ve known he wouldn\u2019t wait long before stalking her again. She was surprised though, by the instant quickening of her heart.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, how are you today?\u201d he asked her, as if they were strangers. She looked at him suspiciously, wondering what he was up to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine and yourself?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wonderful. I\u2019m in need of several bouquets,\u201d he responded, before sticking out his hand. \u201cMy name is Andrew Titan but my friends all call me Drew. I own several resorts and am in need of a new florist,\u201d he said with a completely straight face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, Drew?\u201d she asked, far too tired for games.</p><p>\u201cI decided we need to start over from scratch, so here I am, being completely honest,\u201d he told her, with a twinkle in his eyes. She found it really hard to resist the man when he was acting so charming. She decided to play along for the moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Drew. I\u2019d love to help you with some arrangements,\u201d she said and took his still outstretched hand. She wasn\u2019t prepared for the fire that shot down her arm from his simple touch. She tried pulling away but he held on tightly. The man should have a warning label attached to him. He was seriously dangerous to the female libido.</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is all mine,\u201d he said in the sexiest voice she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of arrangements do you need?\u201d she asked, finally managing to pull her hand free. She had to resist the urge to rub it against her leg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to you. I have three orders I need sent to prospective investors and I want to send a huge one to my cousin\u2019s wife. She gave birth a while ago and I realized I never sent flowers. That kid is the cutest thing ever and she deserves the biggest arrangement you can possibly make,\u201d he said.</p><p>Trinity was surprised by his request. He\u2019d gone all soft eyed talking about the baby. She had never taken him for the kind of guy to love babies, maybe she really didn\u2019t know him all that well, she conceded.</p><p>She walked back over to her cooler and started selecting different flowers. Drew followed her around and lifted the buckets for her, transporting them to her work station. She tried to shoo him away but he was determined, so she just let it go.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been lifting these buckets just fine on my own,\u201d she said to him, with a little bit of exasperation.</p><p>\u201cYou need to take care of yourself,\u201d he said, while pointedly looking down at her stomach. She figured it was easier to let him help, verses continuing to argue with the man.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had this place?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI opened a couple of years ago. It was always my dream. I\u2019d like to expand someday and have a larger shop, with gift items and live plants as well,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cDo you do well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing a lot better than I thought I would. With the baby coming though, I\u2019m going to have to hire some help and that will cut into the profits,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s really difficult for small businesses to succeed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing better than some,\u201d she said. She tended to look at the positives of things verses the negatives if at all possible.</p> <p>\u201cYour work is beautiful. You have a real gift,\u201d he told her, as she worked on the bouquets. They were stunning. She had a real eye for the flowers she used and just the right amount of greens. He was thoroughly impressed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, I really enjoy doing it,\u201d she said. She loved the praise when someone appreciated her work. They continued to chat easily together as she finished with his order. A few customers came and went as he sat down on a stool and continued to visit with her. She was enjoying it far more than she should. She knew she should\u2019ve asked him to leave but it was nice having him there. The time was passing quickly and they were getting along so well. She knew they should at least be friends because of the baby. If she could manage to tamper down on the hunger she felt every time she was around him that may be a possibility.</p><p>\u201cI need to close down for a bit and make some deliveries,\u201d she finally told him. She normally did her deliveries at the end of her shift but there was a funeral she had to get her biggest order to.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I do the deliveries for you so you can go ahead and stay open,\u201d he offered. She had been busy and it would be better to leave the shop open but she didn\u2019t want to feel like she\u2019d owe him anything. \u201cI don\u2019t mind really, I have some stops to make anyway,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cIf you really don\u2019t mind,\u201d she finally caved in. He got the address information, loaded up her orders and took off. She was a bit sad to see him leave. She had to shake it off, refusing to get attached to him being around. The phone rang so she picked it up, grateful for the distraction.</p><p>Drew was gone for a few hours and the shop got really busy, occupying her wandering mind. By the time he walked in the door, holding a sack with delicious aromas coming out of it, she realized she was starving. He set the sack on the counter and she practically ripped it open, in her intensity to see what was inside. She pulled out a tray with her favorite pasta dish and could feel the saliva building up in her mouth.</p><p>She dove in with real enthusiasm. She didn\u2019t say anything to him until she was about halfway finished with the meal. When she finally looked up, he was staring at her with a huge smile on his face. She was slightly embarrassed at her own behavior.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Sometimes I get so busy I forget to eat and when I see food I go a little crazy,\u201d she said with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYou were like that on the island,\u201d he said as his eyes darkened. Her own body reacted to thoughts of the resort. It had been such a tropical paradise and she hadn\u2019t thought of anything but pleasure. The pleasure of the sun, the water, the food and most especially, the pleasure of her body when he was touching her.</p><p>\u201cThat was a million years ago Drew and I\u2019m back in the real world now and have real world responsibilities. I do appreciate your help today and the lunch but we are over and you need to accept that,\u201d Trinity said. She was trying to convince herself of that fact as much as she was trying to convince him.</p><p>Drew\u2019s expression never changed. He continued to stare at her, with longing in his eyes, which was doing funny things to her stomach. She tried to focus on the food but had lost her appetite. She picked at it some more and finally gave up and shoved it aside. Drew took her hand in his and waited until he had her full attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided you\u2019ll be my wife. I\u2019ve never felt about a woman the way I feel about you and you\u2019re carrying my child. We\u2019ll stay together. I understand you\u2019re scared. I understand you\u2019re angry I mislead you but you\u2019ll learn soon you can\u2019t live without me,\u201d he said with complete confidence.</p><p>She was left breathless and without any words. It was almost impossible to argue with the man but as she thought about what he said, her temper flared a bit. How dare he demand such things of her? She wasn\u2019t some school girl there to please him.</p><p>\u201cDrew sometimes in life you simply have to accept when you can\u2019t have your own way. I\u2019m not a possession you get to choose to keep or cast off. You can go away now,\u201d she said, with some venom in her tone. Drew laughed; she could not believe the man actually laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good for me, Trinity. I need people in my life who aren\u2019t afraid to tell me how it is but nonetheless we\u2019ll be together,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a few errands to run this afternoon but I\u2019ll be back before you close,\u201d he told her, then almost as an afterthought, gently kissed her before walking out the door.</p><p>Trinity stood for several minutes after he left, with her hand pressed against her still tingling lips. The man had a way of affecting her, unlike anyone before him. She finally shook it off and got back to work. When he came back she\u2019d have to be firm and not let him affect her.</p><p>About an hour before closing, the bell on the door rang out, letting her know someone was coming in. She looked up nervously and let out a sigh of relief, followed by a pang of disappointment, when it was a woman and not Drew.</p><p>The woman seemed to be around her age and was carrying the most adorable little girl. Just the sight of the baby made her heart skip a beat. She couldn\u2019t wait to hold her own daughter in her arms.</p><p>\u201cHello, how are you this afternoon?\u201d Trinity asked the woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great and how are you?\u201d the woman responded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s closing time soon but other than that I\u2019m wonderful,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Jasmine and this little one is Britney,\u201d the woman said, as she held out her free hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you Jasmine, my name is Trinity, how can I help you?\u201d she asked. She loved customers like Jasmine, who were happy and friendly. She also loved getting to know her customers because they would come back and she could learn exactly what they liked, making sure to do an excellent job.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to meet you; I\u2019m married to Derek, who is Drew\u2019s cousin. I call him my brother-in-law because they are more like siblings,\u201d Jasmine said.</p><p>\u201cOh...well...umm...\u201d Trinity stuttered, not knowing what to say.</p><p>\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have just barged in here on you but when Drew told us he was going to be a father, I had to meet the woman who had finally gotten ahold of him,\u201d she said with humor in her tone.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t together though...\u201d Trinity tried to say before she was interrupted again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re carrying a Titan child, so you\u2019re pretty much together, believe me. You can try and fight it but these guys really care about family. My husband and I had a very rocky start but I love him so much and am so grateful he fought for me because now we have Britney and Jacob and I\u2019m disgustingly happy all the time,\u201d Jasmine said.</p><p>The baby was squirming in her arms and Trinity wanted to hold her so badly but didn\u2019t even know this woman and couldn\u2019t ask her to hand over her child. Jasmine saw the look of yearning on Trinity\u2019s face and handed Britney over.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so precious,\u201d Trinity coo\u2019d at her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty amazing and incredibly spoiled,\u201d Jasmine said with real fondness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down over here with me and we can chat?\u201d Trinity said as she moved over to the love seat she had brought in when she found out about the baby. She knew she\u2019d want a comfortable place to rest.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect, tell me all about how you and Drew met and please don\u2019t leave out any juicy details,\u201d Jasmine said to her. Trinity could feel the heat suffuse her cheeks, as she thought about those details. She didn\u2019t know what it was but she liked Jasmine instantly. She was just so friendly, how could you not?</p><p>Trinity found herself opening up and telling her about their time on the island and then about the last few days. Jasmine listened the whole time, nodding her head in understanding.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I know he\u2019s behaved like a complete moron but he\u2019s a terrific guy and if you give him a chance you\u2019ll see that,\u201d Jasmine said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s great but I\u2019ve sworn off all business men. I haven\u2019t had good experiences with them. I won\u2019t try and keep the baby from him but I just can\u2019t get into a relationship with the man,\u201d Trinity said and hoped Jasmine would understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will all work out,\u201d Jasmine told her. The bell rung again and in walked the man in question. It didn\u2019t take him long to spot the two women.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my beautiful girl,\u201d Drew said as he approached. Trinity was starting to blush and then he plucked the baby out of her arms, who immediately started to giggle. Trinity felt a little embarrassed, thinking the comment had been for her and hoped he hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cUncle missed you, Precious,\u201d he cuddled Britney and continued to talk to her. She looked up at him like she could understand everything he was saying. She reached her small hand up and was patting his cheek. Trinity was impressed with how well he handled the baby. If he was half as affectionate with his own daughter, she\u2019d always know her father loved her.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot to make up for Drew,\u201d Jasmine said as she glared at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said and looked from one to the other. They both looked at him like he was dumb, so he shrugged his shoulder and continued to talk to his niece, who adored him. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t look at Uncle that way,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what a moron you were at the resort. Seriously, you bonked her in the head and then had the gall to lie to her. No wonder she\u2019s giving you a hard time,\u201d Jasmine continued. \u201cIt was so great to meet you, Trinity. Please come have lunch with me on your next day off. I want to get to know you more and I really want the kids to grow up together,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think that sounds wonderful. I\u2019ll be off on Sunday and Monday, if either of those work for you,\u201d Trinity responded.</p><p>\u201cSunday will work perfectly. Come any time after ten, here\u2019s my address and my phone number. I can\u2019t wait to see you,\u201d she finished. She then gathered the baby up and headed out. Trinity looked at the clock and was relieved it was closing time. She counted out her till and started shutting things down.</p><p>\u201cCan I take you to dinner, please?\u201d Drew asked her. She knew she should probably say no because it sounded great. She found she really wanted to spend time with him, which was scary. She was trying to get the words to come out of her mouth and was a bit surprised by her own answer.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fine,\u201d she replied. They walked out of the shop and he immediately grabbed her hand. She fought for a moment to pull free but he was holding firm, so she gave it up. It was much easier to let go of the smaller battles, so she had the energy for the bigger arguments.</p> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Sunday came quickly and Trinity found she was really excited to see Jasmine, again. She\u2019d always had a hard time making friends because she was so busy all the time and she was painfully shy. She was also always the practical one. When other kids had been out partying, she had been the one studying.</p><p>It had all been worth it, though because she now owned her shop and was on her way to her goals being accomplished. She was about ready to leave, when there was a knock on her door. She knew who it was before she opened it up.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Drew said and she could smell the warm scent of muffins wafting through the bag he was holding. He felt a compulsive need to feed her all the time.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, you know?\u201d she told him, although she grabbed the bag and started munching on the delicious pastry. She didn\u2019t know where he bought his pastries but they were heavenly tasting and she soon found herself half-way through a second one.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re more than capable of taking care of yourself but I enjoy feeding you and checking up on you. I\u2019ve never been a father before and I feel a need to make sure my daughter is getting all she needs,\u201d he explained. Trinity rolled her eyes but allowed him to walk with her down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m visiting Derek today so we can ride together,\u201d Drew said as he steered her towards his car. She decided to let it go; at least she wouldn\u2019t have to struggle to fit behind the wheel, which was becoming harder with each day.</p><p>They rode to the home, chatting a bit. As they made their way through the gate and started up the driveway, Trinity was awed into silence. When the home came into view she gasped out loud.</p> <p>\u201cThis is their house?\u201d she asked him in amazement. It looked more like a resort than someone\u2019s home. Her eyes were drawn to the huge front door and the seemingly endless walls. She didn\u2019t know how they managed to find their way to different areas of the home.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s very large. I gave Derek a heck of a time when I first saw it but Jasmine has made it really homey,\u201d he told her. She didn\u2019t see how it was possible to make the mansion look homey, it was simply too massive.</p><p>He pulled up by the front doors and they climbed from the vehicle. The door opened up and a young boy came rushing out. \u201cUncle Drew, you\u2019re here,\u201d he said, as he launched himself into Drew\u2019s arms. He certainly had a way with children.</p><p>\u201cHey Buddy, I think I\u2019m going to whoop you today in some water basketball,\u201d he said, as he ruffled his head.</p><p>\u201cNo way, I\u2019ve been practicing. You\u2019re going down,\u201d the boy told him. Trinity smiled as the two of them bantered back and forth.</p><p>\u201cJacob, this nice lady is Trinity and this young lad here is my nephew, Jacob,\u201d Drew introduced them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d the boy said politely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you as well,\u201d Trinity said. He was adorable and well mannered.</p><p>\u201cMom is excited for you to come. Follow me, she\u2019s in the kitchen,\u201d Jacob said and ran ahead of them into the house. Trinity couldn\u2019t stop looking everywhere. The home was huge and beautiful but Drew was right about it seeming homey. Jasmine had done a great job at making the place comfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou guys made it. I\u2019m so glad,\u201d Jasmine said as they stepped into the kitchen. She gave Drew a quick hug and surprised Trinity by throwing her arms around her as well. She pulled back with a giggle. \u201cI remember those days of my belly preceding me into a room,\u201d she finished with a laugh. Trinity could not help but laugh along with her.</p><p>\u201cI know, I think I grow a foot every night,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>\u201cYou boys go play and let us diss on you for a while,\u201d Jasmine said. The boys obeyed and left them together. The smells coming from the kitchen were amazing and suddenly Trinity\u2019s stomach let out a loud growl. Jasmine laughed, again. Trinity couldn\u2019t believe she was still hungry after eating those rich pastries but she couldn\u2019t seem to get enough. She hoped she didn\u2019t gain a hundred pounds during the pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cI remember that as well. Sit down and let me give you a snack, while everything finishes up,\u201d Jasmine said.</p><p>\u201cI can wait, I don\u2019t want to be a hassle,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop being so submissive. You have to learn to stand up for yourself, or seriously these Titan guys will walk all over you,\u201d Jasmine said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019d love to have a snack,\u201d Trinity said, with her cheeks turning a little bit pink.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start, now get off those feet,\u201d Jasmine said with a smile. Trinity sat down and ate every morsel of food Jasmine put before her. It was incredible.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously should open up a caf\u00e9,\u201d Trinity told her. \u201cYour food is too good to be wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told the same thing from these handsome men but I don\u2019t want to lose my love of cooking and if I had to do it for the long hours it takes in order to succeed, I\u2019d no longer enjoy it,\u201d Jasmine said to her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always wanted to open a floral and gift shop, with a little caf\u00e9 in it. I thought it would be great to have a section of books people could buy and they could come in and eat, read and order flowers or gifts. If you do ever consider a caf\u00e9, then I hope you\u2019ll talk to me,\u201d Trinity said shyly.</p><p>\u201cSeriously that\u2019s something I\u2019d consider. Let me finish our lunch and we can do some research,\u201d Jasmine said with excitement.</p><p>\u201cI meant in the future sometime,\u201d Trinity said, a little shocked at her enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time like the present,\u201d Jasmine told her. The women continued to talk, while Jasmine finished lunch. As if the men had built in radars, they showed up as the last of the food was finished cooking. Everyone sat around the table enjoying the great food and even better conversation. Trinity was more relaxed than she had been in a very long time.</p><p>\u201cNow you boys are on clean up duty. Trinity and I are going to the library to do some research,\u201d Jasmine said mysteriously and the two women took off. Drew looked over at Derek with a question in his eyes and he just shook his head as if he didn\u2019t understand women any more than the next guy did.</p><p>The two ladies went into the library and Trinity gasped as she looked around. It was a beautiful room, with books from floor to ceiling. She walked along the shelves noticing there was a little bit of everything. Any reader would be happy to step into this room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty great, huh? I still have a long way to go before these shelves are filled but I get a few more each week. This library is what sold me on the place,\u201d Jasmine said with excitement. She was pleased to see Trinity loved the room.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever leave this room,\u201d Trinity finally said.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way. Take your time looking around. I\u2019m going to jump on the computer and do some research,\u201d Jasmine said, as she sat down on the comfortable looking couch and opened up a laptop.</p><p>She pulled Trinity over after a while to show her a building for sale. It looked absolutely perfect for what they wanted but the price tag was pretty extravagant.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can afford that,\u201d she said feeling badly about it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not worry about the cost right now. I know how that sounds but let\u2019s just check it out tomorrow and see what we think,\u201d Jasmine pleaded with her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it doesn\u2019t hurt to at least look,\u201d she agreed. The two women made their plans and Trinity didn\u2019t know who she called but the agent was more than happy to show them the place whenever they were ready. She offered to do it right then but Jasmine told her she\u2019d prefer to wait until the next day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The afternoon flew by too quickly and Trinity was sorry to leave. She was enjoying her time with Jasmine; already a strong friendship was forming. The two women hugged before Drew led her back out to his car. She waved goodbye and sat back sleepily in the car\u2019s comfortable seat.</p><p>The next few days flew by for Trinity. Drew was there every waking moment and the more she was around him, the harder a time she had with trying to keep her distance. He was there to help her at work. He was constantly bringing her delicious food and he was touching her every chance he got.</p><p>With him back in the picture, her body had awakened, more than ever before. He was touching her casually so often, she was close to screaming. She needed so much more from him, than a quick brush of his fingers but she knew she couldn\u2019t go there. The more time she was with him, the harder it was to remember the purpose of her boundaries.</p><p>The man was so incredibly attractive and what made it worse was she remembered how his hands felt touching her all over. She was frustrated and completely unsatisfied. It was making her incredibly grumpy and he was even being a great sport about her snapping at him. He was far too perfect.</p> <p>She had went and looked at the building with Jasmine and fell in love with the place. It was so perfect. There was ample space for everything and it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to remodel it how they wanted. Jasmine was looking into things and would get back to her soon with some numbers.</p><p>Trinity knew Jasmine could afford to foot the entire purchase but she wanted to feel as if she was an equal partner. She\u2019d do whatever she could to make it happen. She was currently renting her building and paying a really high amount, so by taking on a partner and having a mortgage instead of a rent payment, may actually save her money. She\u2019d also be able to make more if she had more merchandise.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard back from Jasmine yet, so she was getting worried she\u2019d possibly changed her mind, deciding it was just too risky. She couldn\u2019t believe how bummed that made her feel. She had been the one who was leery to go into such a large investment but after she\u2019d really thought about it, she wanted it more than anything. It would be so nice to have a business partner, someone to share her successes with and someone to have around to talk with. She shook off her mood and got back to work.</p><p>\u201cHello beautiful, how are you feeling today?\u201d Drew asked as he walked in her doors a few minutes after she opened. Her face split in a smile at the sight of him, before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a business to run?\u201d she asked him, trying to sound stern but failing miserably.</p> <p>\u201cThe nice thing with being the boss is I can take off whenever I want,\u201d he responded with a wicked grin. He then came over to her and kissed her on the lips. He was doing that too often as well. She\u2019d given up telling him no. Who was she fooling anyway? She craved his touch.</p><p>\u201cI have a doctor appointment today if you\u2019d like to come along?\u201d she asked him shyly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to come,\u201d he answered her with real enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be closing early today so if you want to be back here around two then we can go together,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing going on today, so I\u2019ll just hang out here with you,\u201d he said instead and sat down on her couch and pulled out his laptop, which was a normal habit for him now.</p><p>\u201cIf you insist,\u201d she replied and got to work on her arrangements. The further along she was getting, the harder it was for her to stand for long periods of time, without her back hurting. After about an hour she was reaching around and rubbing on her lower back, without even thinking about it.</p> <p>She felt Drew\u2019s arms wrap around her and she was being tugged over to the couch. He sat her down and started giving her a back rub. She had to fight not to groan out loud at the pure pleasure he was creating.</p><p>\u201cI should be working,\u201d she tried to protest but not with much effort behind the words.</p><p>\u201cYou need to take better care of yourself. It\u2019s obvious you\u2019re in pain,\u201d he countered her and continued with the back rub. She leaned forward, so he could reach lower and stopped protesting. She didn\u2019t know how much time passed but when the bell on her door rang, she felt like growling at the person who dared to interrupt.</p><p>The person picked out a couple of pre made arrangements and was soon on their way. The door rang again and a young girl walked in.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Trinity asked her.</p><p>\u201cI just graduated floral school and would like to apply for a job,\u201d the girl said shyly. Trinity spoke with her for several minutes and liked her instantly. She was eager and excited. She took her in the back and had her show some of her techniques. The girl had a really good eye for colors and picked up on designs quickly.</p><p>\u201cI was planning on waiting another month before hiring but you have come in at a really good time because my back is hurting more than usual,\u201d Trinity told her. She hired the girl on the spot and she\u2019d start the next day.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d she replied excitedly and rushed out the door.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to take on an employee,\u201d Drew told her. She got back to work and soon it was time to leave for the doctor\u2019s office.</p><p>Drew led her to his car and she climbed into the luxurious interior. It was really nice to be taken care of and she was fighting the urge to just let go completely and lean on him. They made it to the office in no time and soon they were being taken back to a private room.</p><p>The doctor came in and Drew introduced himself. \u201cI bet you\u2019re excited to hear the heartbeat,\u201d the doctor said to him.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Drew confirmed. She was fixated on his face, as the sound of their child\u2019s heartbeat filled the room. He had such a look of wonder on it tears sprung to her eyes. \u201cCan we do that picture thing?\u201d he asked the doctor.</p><p>\u201cShe had an ultrasound a couple months ago and everything checked out. They are a pretty expensive procedure, when it\u2019s not needed,\u201d the doctor explained.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how much it costs, I really want to have it done,\u201d Drew said. The doctor sent them to a different room.</p><p>\u201cDrew, I can\u2019t afford to have one of those done,\u201d Trinity tried to explain to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking care of all the baby\u2019s expenses,\u201d Drew told her and his tone said the issue wasn\u2019t up for debate. She didn\u2019t have any insurance and had been struggling to pay for the whole thing but she didn\u2019t appreciate his taking control of her pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to take care of everything but if you want another ultrasound then you can take care of that,\u201d she finally conceded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in far too good of a mood to argue, so we\u2019ll leave that discussion for another time,\u201d he finally said. She lay on the table and glared at him for a moment. Soon another doctor came in the room and began rubbing some cold goo on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen one of our three dimensional ultrasounds before?\u201d she asked them both.</p><p>\u201cI had one done a couple months ago,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>\u201cI saw the picture but I wasn\u2019t here when it was done,\u201d Drew said as he stared at the screen. Suddenly his child\u2019s head was there in front of him. She was moving around and he saw the profile, then the back of her head. She was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen in his life. He could stare at that monitor the entire day and never get bored.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe how much it showed of his daughter. It was like he was looking through a glass bowl or something. It was amazing. He wanted to reach out and run his fingers along her delicate cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter is healthy and active. Do you want to take home some more pictures?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cYes please,\u201d Drew answered enthusiastically before Trinity had a chance to speak.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as if your husband is excited to be a father. This must be your first child,\u201d the woman said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she will be here in a few short months,\u201d Drew said. Trinity was silent. She wasn\u2019t going to bother trying to correct the woman and she was finding it pretty endearing how excited Drew was.</p><p>She printed off some pictures and sent them both back to the doctor\u2019s office. He came right in. Trinity guessed it was helpful having Drew with her because she\u2019d never had such quick service.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is healthy and everything is right on schedule but you\u2019re not doing as well. Your blood pressure is too high for my liking and puts you at risk for getting toxemia. I need to put you on bed rest for at least two weeks, then we can reassess. You also need to eat more because you\u2019re feeding the baby well but not yourself. You\u2019re under what I\u2019d like to see your weight at,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take work off,\u201d she tried to argue with the doctor.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t take my advice, you\u2019re risking yourself and your baby. You could go into early labor and the chances of survival aren\u2019t good at this point in your pregnancy,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>\u201cShe will go on complete bed rest doctor,\u201d Drew said and looked over at her. She wasn\u2019t happy with him or the doctor at that point but she wouldn\u2019t let her own temper harm her child. She\u2019d just have to close the shop for a while. She couldn\u2019t imagine what that was going to do to her income.</p><p>They walked out of the doctor\u2019s office and he took her to a restaurant, where she picked at her food. She was too stressed to eat much at all.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said you needed more calories, please eat for the baby\u2019s sake,\u201d he pleaded with her. She forced herself to eat more, although she had a hard time getting it down her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to close the shop, it just stresses me out,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cStress isn\u2019t good for your condition. You need to let me help you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI know Drew, and I don\u2019t need your help,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou obviously need my help. I\u2019ll call a temp agency and get someone in to work the shop, plus you have the new employee you just hired. I\u2019ll pay their wages and quit shaking your head at me. You can\u2019t be stressed and worried about how to pay them. I\u2019m also going to stay with you for now to make sure you\u2019re taking better care of yourself,\u201d he said.</p><p>She continued to try and argue with him but she may as well have been speaking to a brick wall because he wasn\u2019t listening. He led her from the restaurant and made his phone calls and drove her home.</p><p>As they stepped into her tiny apartment, he decided he was going to start really searching for a new place. He couldn\u2019t stand to stay in the claustrophobic apartment for too long. His child needed more space anyway, with a real yard.</p><p>Trinity went in to take a nap and he searched the web for some homes. He found a couple of prospective places, which weren\u2019t far from his cousin. He made appointments for that evening and after checking on Trinity, left to go see them.</p><p>He fell in love instantly with one of the houses. The home was empty, as the previous owners had lost it. It was bank owned, which made things so much easier for him. It was huge, not quite as big as Derek\u2019s but pretty dang close. It had about ten acres of property and a pool. There was even a tennis court. He knew Trinity would love it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made a cash offer for the place and used his connections to push things along. He drove back to her place, feeling pretty good about himself.</p><p>He\u2019d snagged her keys on his way out and let himself back in. He looked in on her in the bedroom and felt his body tightening. She must have been too warm because she had kicked the covers off and was laying there in her tiny tank top and short shorts. She looked unbelievable and it took everything he had not to join her in the bed and strip those pieces of clothing from her.</p><p>Her curves had grown and he wanted to test their weight in his hands. He wanted her so badly he didn\u2019t think he could take it much longer. He groaned low in his throat and headed towards her tiny bathroom for an ice cold shower. It didn\u2019t help him much.</p><p>Drew tried to work in her small kitchen but he couldn\u2019t concentrate. He hadn\u2019t slept well since the day he\u2019d found out she was pregnant and his eyes were trying to shut on him. He looked over at her couch and wasn\u2019t enthusiastic. He peaked back in at her and she was still sound asleep. He decided to damn the consequences and climbed in next to her.</p> <p>Trinity immediately snuggled up next to him, after he lay down. She may be fighting her attraction for him but in her sleep, her body clearly was seeking him out. He wrapped her in his arms and fell into his first restful sleep in too long.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Trinity woke up and attempted to stretch. Something was blocking her, though. Her bed wasn\u2019t against the wall so she couldn\u2019t figure out why she couldn\u2019t move her arms. She opened her eyes and realized she was pressed tightly against Drew.</p><p>Her initial thoughts were to grab him and finally relieve the ever increasing pressure that had been building up in her body. Then she began to panic as she thought about taking that step again. She tried to extract herself from his arms without waking him but his arms around her may as well have been iron shackles. He wasn\u2019t budging.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he mumbled and his hands started moving over her body. She sucked in a breath as his hands rubbed down her back and over her behind. She tried arching into him but her stomach was in the way. The pressure was building up in her core and she was forgetting her reasons for not making love with the man.</p> <p>He continued to stroke her, up and down her back and then his hands started to move along her sides and she was holding her breath, waiting for him to reach her aching breasts. She started to wiggle and she could tell the moment he woke up fully, by the urgency in his touch.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d she tried once.</p><p>\u201cWe definitely should do this. Please Trinity, I need you,\u201d he begged her. She couldn\u2019t say no to him. She wanted him so badly and his voice was filled with such need she felt sexy for the first time in forever.</p><p>He pushed her onto her back and continued stroking her body up and down. He pulled her shirt off and let out a gasp of pleasure at her larger breasts. They\u2019d grown a full size in the months since he had last touched her and from his reaction he was pleased by the change.</p><p>He bent his head and began kissing her throat, sucking the sensitive flesh. He moved down to her aching breasts and continued kneading them, then following behind with the swipe of his tongue. He was circling around her incredibly sensitive peaks and she arched her back, trying to get him to take them into his mouth.</p><p>He finally gave her what she wanted and licked the darkened orbs. He gently sucked first one into his mouth, then gave equal attention to the other. She could feel the pressure building deep within her core, from his mouth and hands playing with her body. She was so much more sensitive than she\u2019d ever been before and he was quickly sending her over the edge.</p> <p>He continued to play with her sensitive nipples as his hands were wandering down her body. He reverently rubbed his hands over the mound of her stomach, making trembles rush throughout her body. Then his hand slid between her thighs, pushing them apart. He reached up and flicked his fingers over her sensitive flesh and she cried out as the orgasm rocked her body.</p><p>He continued to stroke her flesh, as he brought his lips back up her throat. He finally kissed her with so much tenderness she felt tears fill her eyes. He stroked her mouth with his warm tongue and even before the last of her trembles were receding, she could feel her body building up for more.</p><p>She wanted him so much; she needed him to fill her. He continued to caress her mouth and she couldn\u2019t stop the trembles that continued to rock her insides. Everywhere he touched her, fire shot through her blood. It was the most exotic experience of her life.</p><p>He dipped his fingers deep within her heat and her hips jerked off the bed in pleasure. She groaned as the sensations washed through her over and over again. \u201cPlease Drew, I need you,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He turned her onto her side and lay down behind her, still caressing her body. She could feel his erection pressing against her backside and she\u2019d never felt such an ache. She pushed against him, needing him to enter her. He kissed along her neck, as he massaged her breasts.</p><p>He then finally started pushing inside of her heat. He was stretching her folds inch by beautiful inch and she could feel her body start to come apart at the pure pleasure of him inside of her again.</p><p>He continued licking her neck and rubbing her breasts, as he began moving in and out of her core. She started shaking, as all the sensations began sending her over the edge. He moved one of his hands down to her hip and pumped in and out of her faster. She couldn\u2019t take anymore and was quickly sent over the cliff in a wash of total ecstasy. She gripped his hand tightly, as her body gripped around his thick shaft.</p><p>He let out a groan, as he sunk deep inside of her and she could feel him pumping deep within her womb. They lay there pressed tightly together, both trying to get their breathing back under control. He rubbed her gently from her neck to her hips and back again. Every time his hands passed over her sensitive flesh she moaned in pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cNow that\u2019s the way to wake up,\u201d he whispered in her ear, which sent a shiver down her spine. She couldn\u2019t believe how sensitive she was to his every movement.</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened though,\u201d she tried to be reasonable. He flipped her around onto her back and looked into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re carrying my child and we both want each other so what\u2019s wrong with us making love?\u201d he questioned her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not ready to jump right back in,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d he told her, before kissing her silent once more. He showed her why they should have no regrets for the next hour. By the time they managed to crawl out of bed, Trinity was feeling relaxed and more loved than ever. She was going to give herself this day to feel good, with zero guilt. Tomorrow would be soon enough for that.</p><p>Drew jumped in the shower after they ate breakfast together. Trinity knew she was supposed to be on bed rest but she wanted to go check on her shop and make sure the temp person was working out and everything was fine. She decided to sneak out before he got done.</p><p>She dressed quickly and left the apartment as silently as she could. She couldn\u2019t believe she felt guilty as she climbed down the stairs and started walking down the street. He didn\u2019t own her; she could go for a walk if she wanted to.</p><p>She was a few doors down from her shop when someone came up behind her and poked something into her back. She tried to move out of the way, thinking it was some person not paying attention to where they were going.</p><p>\u201cGive me your purse and you won\u2019t get hurt,\u201d a man\u2019s voice sneered into her ear. She was shocked speechless, as terror seized her. She was too shocked to do what the man asked of her.</p><p>\u201cLet go now,\u201d he shouted at her, as she gripped it tightly to her side. She was in the habit of wrapping the handle around her arm so she didn\u2019t drop it. It was far too hard to bend down now. He grabbed the strap and tugged on her bag and she automatically pulled back.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane lady, give me the bag now,\u201d the man said, with bulging eyes, as he pulled a knife out. She started to shake all over but she couldn\u2019t make her arm let go of the bag. He sliced the knife out towards her and she felt a stinging in her arm. He then shoved her hard and she stumbled backwards, landing on her butt.</p><p>Pain shot up her spine from the impact and her arm was throbbing. He took off running and her only thought was she still had her purse. She then looked at her arm and saw the blood streaming down and the sight made her pass out cold.</p><p>\u201cTrinity talk to me, are you okay, please be okay, wake up,\u201d she heard Drew yelling at her, through a bank of darkness. \u201cPlease baby, open your eyes. The ambulance is coming right now, please just wake up, you have to tell me where it hurts,\u201d he continued to yell in a panicked voice. She couldn\u2019t understand why he was yelling. She was just trying to sleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she finally managed to mumble and she felt his hands roam all over her body. She tried to push him away because she just wanted to sleep. He passed over her arm and pain shot downward, waking her right up. Her eyes flew open, to look into his terrified eyes and the whole thing came back to her.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d she finally managed to get past her tight throat.</p><p>\u201cThey will be here in a few more seconds, do you hear the sirens?\u201d he told her as he continued running his hands up and down her body.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to take my purse. I tried to let it go but my hand wouldn\u2019t listen to my brain,\u201d she tried to explain to him.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve been with you, I\u2019m so sorry baby, I\u2019m so sorry. If anything happens to you or our daughter I\u2019ll never forgive myself,\u201d he sputtered as he rubbed her face and head. \u201cTell me where it hurts,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cMy arm and back hurt,\u201d she told him with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry baby, he cut your arm and someone said they saw him push you down. Does your stomach hurt?\u201d he asked her, terrified of what her answer would be.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Drew, my back hurts really badly, I can\u2019t tell if it is my stomach too,\u201d she said, as tears started streaking down her face. \u201cMy baby,\u201d she cried out, as her hands groped her stomach.</p><p>The ambulance pulled up and the paramedics rushed out. They asked her a few questions and placed a neck brace on her, before lifting her up to the gurney. Drew never left her side the entire time. He rode next to her in the ambulance whispering reassurances and holding her hand.</p><p>They rushed her into the emergency room and a doctor came over immediately. They hooked all kinds of monitors up to her and soon she could hear the sound of her baby\u2019s heartbeat. Both her and Drew breathed out a sigh of relief at the strong sound.</p><p>\u201cThe baby doesn\u2019t seem to be in any immediate danger but your blood pressure is through the roof. You were supposed to be on bed rest, from these notes I\u2019m reading and had no business out on the streets,\u201d the doctor scolded her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it was just a small walk,\u201d she tried to explain but she was feeling a lot of her own guilt and would do whatever the doctor asked of her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to stitch up your arm, You\u2019re staying overnight so we can monitor you and the child. If we can get your blood pressure down, then you can get released tomorrow but only if you\u2019re on strict bed rest. That is you go from your bed to a couch and back again. You\u2019re not to take walks, you\u2019re not to work, you\u2019re to be waited on hand and foot,\u201d the doctor told her sternly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, too afraid to argue with anything the man said. They poked and prodded her before she was finally moved to a room. She breathed a sigh of relief, as the pills they gave her kicked in and she drifted off into blissful sleep. She couldn\u2019t understand how the day could start off so well and end so badly.</p><p>Drew made calls to his family and knew they would be there in no time. His cousins would drop whatever they were doing to be there for each other. Family was number one to all of them. This was his future wife, with his child, lying in a hospital bed and they would\u2019ve been angry with him if he hadn\u2019t called so they could be there. The second she\u2019d conceived his baby, she had become a part of that tight family circle.</p><p>He got a call while he was pacing the halls the bank accepted his offer. He called in some connections to speed the process up. He wanted to get moved in within a couple of weeks, where he\u2019d be able to take care of her much better.</p><p>He called up his normal temp agency and had them start performing interviews for a staff. He wanted things ready as soon as he got the keys. As he continued to pace the hallways he saw Derek and Ryan round the corner. They spotted him immediately and walked over. He explained everything to them and they talked him into going with them for some much needed coffee.</p> <p>Jasmine was right behind them and promised to stay with Trinity in case she woke up. She had tears of worry in her eyes. He pulled her close for a hug, so grateful she\u2019d married his cousin. She was a blessing to their family. She shooed him away and went in to sit by Trinity\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell does something like that happen in broad daylight?\u201d Ryan said as he slammed his mug down on the table.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that neighborhood at all. It\u2019s the older part of town and the businesses have to have bars on the windows at night. That should be the first clue she shouldn\u2019t be walking down that street alone. I want her out of there now,\u201d Drew said vehemently.</p><p>\u201cI agree with you Drew but be careful, she\u2019s stubborn and you don\u2019t want her to stay there just because you\u2019re telling her not to,\u201d Derek tried to reason with his cousin.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on strict orders from the doctor for total bed rest, so she doesn\u2019t have a hell of a lot of choice but to listen to me for a while,\u201d Drew said with some satisfaction. He knew very well how stubborn the woman could be. He also knew how much she already loved their child and she\u2019d do anything to keep her safe.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I have some good news for you,\u201d Derek started. \u201cJasmine and Trinity were talking about opening a combined business together and Jasmine found an incredible space. We purchased it yesterday. It\u2019s not too far from where we\u2019re living. It\u2019s in a much safer area. Jasmine was actually coming over today to tell her she\u2019d snatched it up before it was gone and they could move forward,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great Derek, I\u2019ll feel so much better if she\u2019s not living or working down there and the women will have each other there as well. I don\u2019t like her working alone, I don\u2019t care how great the neighborhood is,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cI agree with you fully there. I\u2019m going to talk to Jasmine about having some extra help. She plans on having the baby with her and she will need more people to help her run things. Hell, money isn\u2019t an issue anyway but their safety is,\u201d Derek said.</p><p>\u201cMan am I glad I don\u2019t have anyone other than you guys to stress over because it doesn\u2019t sound like any fun,\u201d Ryan said. Both Derek and Drew turned to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cYour time is coming,\u201d Derek finally said. Ryan just shook his head and got a look of terror on his face. He wasn\u2019t ready to head down that road.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance you guys,\u201d he said. The three of them relaxed since there was a clear plan of action in place. They all felt better when they were planning or accomplishing something. None of them liked to feel helpless and if someone they loved had a problem, they felt that way.</p> <p>Drew wasn\u2019t looking forward to the conversation they were going to have later but then again he was the business man he was because he never backed down. He could handle any situation, including a very angry woman. He smiled in anticipation.</p><p>Jasmine sat by the bed, anxiously waiting for Trinity to wake up. She wanted to share her news with her but more importantly she wanted to hear from her that she was okay. If anything had happened to that child it would\u2019ve destroyed Trinity. She may not have known her very long but she was a mother and knew how bonded you became with your child, even from the womb.</p><p>\u201cIs she still sleeping?\u201d a man asked as he walked in the room. Jasmine looked at the gorgeous creature, thinking the plot just thickened as the man came and sat by her bed with a worried expression.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t stirred, yet. I\u2019m Jasmine,\u201d she said, sticking out her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Damien Whitfield, Trinity\u2019s best friend. Drew called and told me what happened,\u201d he said, shaking her hand, then immediately returning to Trinity\u2019s bedside.</p><p>Jasmine was relieved to hear he was a friend; otherwise there may have been a fight in the hospital room. Drew was a bit territorial, especially with Trinity carrying his child.</p><p>Trinity started to stir and finally opened her eyes. She looked around and spotted Jasmine and Damien and her face lit up with a smile. It was good to see her friends.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d they simultaneously asked, which made Trinity smile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had better days,\u201d she tried to joke but her voice came out too cracked to pull it off. She winced at the sound of her own weakened voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about what happened,\u201d Jasmine told her, with tears in her eyes. Damien sat there rubbing her hand, giving her time to gather some strength.</p><p>\u201cIt was all my fault; I shouldn\u2019t have been out there in the first place. The doctor told me to stay in bed but I was determined to check on my shop,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>\u201cTrinity, you\u2019re always putting too much pressure on yourself. Don\u2019t start playing the blame game or you\u2019ll just cause more stress. I had to come and check on you but have to get back to the offices. Promise me you\u2019ll call as soon as you feel better,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>\u201cI promise, I love you,\u201d she said. He bent down and kissed her forehead and quickly departed. Trinity was grateful he\u2019d come in. He was always so busy with business she didn\u2019t get to see him nearly enough, especially with her so pregnant and tired all the time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you brought up the shop because I have great news to share with you,\u201d Jasmine said, pulling her attention away from the door Damien just walked through. \u201cI went and checked out that space and there was another person who\u2019d put in an offer. I didn\u2019t want to lose it so Derek gave them an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse and they accepted. The shop is ours. I know I should\u2019ve waited for you but we would\u2019ve lost it and I really want to do this with you,\u201d Jasmine finished.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so great Jasmine but I haven\u2019t figured out if I can afford it yet,\u201d Trinity said with some regret. She really wanted to share a space with Jasmine but she refused to take any handouts. She wouldn\u2019t feel right about that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about any of that right now. We\u2019ll work it out. The point is we have the space and can spend the day getting it designed so Ryan can get started on remodeling,\u201d Jasmine told her.</p><p>She was so excited about it Trinity couldn\u2019t help but get equally involved. Jasmine had brought some paper and the two women spent the next hour figuring out how they wanted the shop to look. They were both giggling like children as their ideas got placed on paper. Trinity could see the finished product in her mind and it was spectacular. She couldn\u2019t wait for the opening day. At least it would give her something to do while she was stuck on bed rest. She wasn\u2019t a person who could lie around and knew the restlessness was going to be hard. She\u2019d do that for no one but her unborn child.</p><p>The men returned and the girls shushed them and continued on with their plans. They were oblivious to anything but their future shop. The men sat back, pouting a bit as they were completely ignored.</p><p>\u201cI think we have it all figured out, what do you think?\u201d Trinity asked, as they looked over what they had been doing.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s perfect,\u201d Jasmine agreed. The two women hugged again. \u201cHere you go Ryan, the place is all yours to make perfect for us,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tall order,\u201d Ryan replied.</p><p>\u201cWe have complete faith in you,\u201d Jasmine said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to earn it,\u201d Ryan said. Jasmine knew he was just being modest. The man was a wiz with any kind of building material. He preferred remodeling historic sites and was greatly in demand from many people. He had unlimited work lined up but he was dropping everything for their project. She loved him to pieces for it.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re the best guy ever,\u201d Jasmine said as she kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIf I keep getting rewards like that one, I\u2019ll be at your beck and call,\u201d he said with an evil grin. He then turned towards Trinity and waggled his brows. She laughed and wiggled her fingers for him to come closer. He leaned down and she kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cOkay enough of that,\u201d Drew growled, as he glared at his cousin.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m irresistible,\u201d Ryan said with a shrug. Both women laughed and the cousins glared. Ryan just continued to laugh. There was nothing greater than getting a rise out of his cousins. He knew both men would be there helping him get the place ready because their women wanted something and that meant they wanted them to have it immediately.</p><p>\u201cOkay everyone out now, Trinity needs to get some rest,\u201d Drew told his family. It was getting late and she was looking far too tired. He wasn\u2019t going to have any trouble sleeping either, even on the uncomfortable hospital couch.</p><p>The family members hugged Trinity and wished her well, then trudged out of the room. Her dinner was brought in and she ate it all, even though she made faces at the poor flavor. After she was finished she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open any longer and soon drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Drew curled up on the couch, even though she told him she\u2019d be fine and he could leave. He\u2019d sleep much better there, where he could be there for her if she needed him. He drifted off soon after her.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ms. Mathews I\u2019ll release you today but only if you promise you won\u2019t be alone and you stay home,\u201d the doctor said to her the next day.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she said. She really wanted out of the hospital. She\u2019d be willing to promise just about anything to get out of there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be with her the entire time and will make sure she doesn\u2019t do anything to harm herself or our child,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cOkay then Mr. Titan, I\u2019m leaving her in your care,\u201d the doctor told him, like she was a child who didn\u2019t know how to behave. He looked at them again before signing her release papers. Trinity didn\u2019t waste any time getting ready and heading for the front doors. She wasn\u2019t happy about having to be pushed out in a wheelchair. She was sure bed rest was going to be even worse than she imagined. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew drove them to her apartment and followed her up the stairs. He\u2019d tried to carry her but she put her foot down. She wasn\u2019t an invalid who couldn\u2019t walk. He\u2019d caved, when she agreed to walk very slowly. She gritted her teeth but walked slowly up the stairs.</p><p>As Drew looked around the tiny room, he was grateful the new place would be ready soon. If they were going to be under house arrest he\u2019d go insane being in the tiny space for too long. He had newfound sympathy for prisoners.</p><p>\u201cSit down and I\u2019ll get you something to eat,\u201d he told her. For once she actually listened, without arguing. He was off to a good start. He made her a sandwich and some soup and sat down with her on the couch while she ate.</p><p>\u201cThis is good, thank you,\u201d she told him. She was starving, after the horrible hospital food.</p> <p>\u201cI need to talk to you about some things,\u201d he started. She looked at him quizzically. He knew the conversation was going to be a battle and did not want to raise her blood pressure any more than necessary.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and spit it out,\u201d she said with an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cI bought a new home. It\u2019s pretty close to Derek and Jasmine,\u201d he started with.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, you must be excited. You really don\u2019t have to stay here and babysit me if you want to get settled in,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI bought the place for us,\u201d he said, while looking her in the eye. Her cheeks flushed and her eyes widened in shock. He had to remember to keep calm, so not to raise her blood pressure. He was going to be firm but he could keep his temper in check.</p> <p>\u201cI...you...we aren\u2019t a couple,\u201d she sputtered at him.</p><p>\u201cTrinity, we are a couple. We\u2019re sexually compatible. We enjoy being together and to top all that off, we\u2019re having a child. We will get married but I\u2019m willing to give you more time to get used to that. But you\u2019re on doctor\u2019s orders to not be alone and for complete bed rest. This place is too small for two people to stay in comfortably so it makes sense for you to move in with me now,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine in my own place,\u201d she told him, as she crossed her arms over her chest. Drew blew out a breath of frustration. He knew she was going to be difficult but it still frustrated him.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to be a jerk, Trinity but you\u2019re not safe here, which means my child isn\u2019t safe. Are you so selfish you\u2019d endanger our child for the sake of your pride?\u201d he asked her. He watched her suck in a breath in shock. He wanted to take the words back but he needed to get her to move and he couldn\u2019t figure out any other way other than force. He really didn\u2019t want to go down that road.</p><p>\u201cI love my child, Drew,\u201d she finally said to him.</p><p>\u201cI know you do Trinity and that was a crappy thing to say, I\u2019m sorry. How about a compromise? You\u2019re going to be on bed rest for a while, most likely the rest of your pregnancy,\u201d he said. She gave him the courtesy of at least listening to him. \u201cStay with me until after the baby is born so I can help take care of you. If we haven\u2019t managed to work things out by then, we can reassess our situation. You know this apartment is far too small for a baby anyway,\u201d he tried to reason with her.</p> <p>She really couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with what he was suggesting. She was far too attached to the man already and it would be really hard for her to keep her distance if they were living together but he was trying to be a good father. That was more important than anything else. She was still unsure, though.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for this, Drew,\u201d she said, though she was starting to cave. Drew could see she was fighting herself as much as him, which gave him confidence. He sat back with a smug smile.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay in this place, it would drive me insane, so you can either move into the large house with me, where you\u2019ll be waited on and completely pampered, or I\u2019ll move in and you\u2019ll have to go back to the hospital because the doctor said you weren\u2019t to be alone,\u201d he told her with too much confidence.</p><p>She glared at him for several minutes, trying to break him down but she knew he was well aware of how badly she hated that hospital. He was blackmailing her, plain and simple. She\u2019d much rather be anywhere other than the sterile hospital room. She was considering it though, just so he couldn\u2019t have his way but then she\u2019d only be punishing herself and that didn\u2019t make either of them winners.</p><p>\u201cOkay Drew, I guess I\u2019ll move in with you but when I\u2019m better we\u2019ll talk about this again,\u201d she told him with reluctance. He threw his arms around her with excitement and grabbed the laptop so she could see the house. She was definitely impressed. It was beautiful and larger than anything she was used to. It would be hard to leave there once she\u2019d lived in it. She\u2019d try not to get attached.</p><p>The weeks went by far too slowly in the cramped apartment. Trinity was actually excited to get out of there because the space was far too small for her and Drew. He was everywhere and the more she was around him; the more difficult it was to remember her reasons for not being romantically involved with him. She was also incredibly edgy, not being allowed outside. He promised her he\u2019d set up a lounge outside at the new place so she could get some fresh air.</p><p>She sat on the couch while he packed all her possessions. She felt a bit self-conscious as he went through everything she owned but he approached it like she was sure he approached business. He was methodical as he packed up her things, labeling each box before moving on to the next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually glad to have this to do because I\u2019ve got to tell you, being locked in this closet of an apartment is starting to drive me crazy,\u201d he said as he finished another box.</p> <p>\u201cYou can leave any time you want,\u201d she snapped, a little irritable herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dealing with it and it\u2019s only for one more day,\u201d he said, choosing to ignore her bad attitude. \u201cI called the Salvation Army and they will be here early in the morning to pick up the furniture we aren\u2019t keeping,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly fine furniture and I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t use it,\u201d she snapped at him. Her feet were swollen once again and the place didn\u2019t have air conditioning and she was ready to bite someone\u2019s head off. Poor Drew happened to be the only person around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to put your furniture down Trinity and you know that but come on, nothing matches and a few of these pieces have duct tape holding them together,\u201d he said to her, with far more patience than she deserved.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to fight him too hard on the matter because she had bought the furniture second hand, at an excellent price and was sure she could pick up more if she needed it but she didn\u2019t like him putting her things down. It was simply a matter of her pride.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not going to be a kept woman don\u2019t you? Just because we made a child together, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to take over my life,\u201d she snapped. He grinned at her. He found her ill temper amusing. He also loved how independent she was and that she wasn\u2019t afraid to call him on his arrogance. There were too many people afraid to talk back to him. He wouldn\u2019t be falling in love with her if she was like the masses of other people in his life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never think of you as a kept woman,\u201d he finally managed to say without laughing. She could still see the smile in his eyes and glared all the more at him for it. He turned away and started on another box. He heard her grumble something but chose to ignore it. She had been trying to pick a fight with him for two days and instead of it angering him, it was incredibly amusing. He knew they would both feel better when they got into the new place and had a bit more space. He knew it would be helpful to have Jasmine visit with her so the women could do the girl talk thing he simply didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to start packing up your clothes,\u201d he said. He was looking forward to that. Her cheeks turned pink at the thought of him going through her intimate clothing.</p><p>\u201cI can do that on my own,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said complete bed rest, so you can lay in bed and direct me,\u201d he told her with a wicked grin and a waggle of his brows. That caused her to turn even more scarlet.</p><p>\u201cYou can help me with my closet but I\u2019ll take care of the dresser,\u201d she finally said with a glare. There was no way she was going to have him go through her panty drawer. He looked like he was going to argue some more but he finally seemed to realize she wasn\u2019t backing down. He shrugged his shoulders and they headed into the bedroom.</p><p>She laid on the bed and her eyes started to get heavy and before long she fell asleep, with him quietly moving around the room. Drew tucked the light blanket around her and gently kissed her on the forehead, then headed out to let her rest.</p><p>The moving company was coming in the morning and most of the house was already packed up, so Drew headed into town for a while. He had to get out of the apartment. He called his cousins and the three of them met at their favorite furniture store. He found he was enjoying himself as he picked out furniture. He normally left all decorating for his resorts up to his decorators and rarely picked his own pieces out but he\u2019d wanted to furnish his home, himself.</p><p>He grabbed some catalogs, so Trinity could pick out the drapes and decorative type stuff. He was mainly focused on getting furniture so they had a place to eat and sit.</p><p>They walked into the children\u2019s section and he stared around at all the baby furniture, completely clueless. He had no idea what to buy for his new daughter. Derek got on the phone and called Jasmine. She rushed down there, more than happy to help. Within an hour of her arrival they had a fully stocked nursery.</p><p>He stared down at the crib, picturing his tiny daughter asleep in it and had to fight the emotions welling up inside him. He couldn\u2019t believe in a short amount of time he was going to be a father. It was coming so fast. The doctor didn\u2019t think she\u2019d make the full forty weeks. He was hoping for her to make it to at least thirty six.</p><p>He stopped for some take-out and headed back to the apartment. Trinity was just starting to wake when he walked in the door. She came out to the living room, groggily rubbing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSomething smells heavenly,\u201d she said, as her stomach rumbled with pleasure. Drew laughed as her cheeks turned pink. He loved how easy she was to read.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for this child to be born so I can go back to eating like a normal human being. I\u2019m hungry all the time,\u201d she said a bit sheepishly. She may have been embarrassed but she still grabbed an egg roll and started eating it hungrily.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the doctor, you\u2019re not eating enough,\u201d he said, as he piled her plate with food. She shook her head at him and began to eat from the plate. She didn\u2019t see how she wasn\u2019t getting enough food, when it seemed to her she was eating all the time. The baby was taking up all the room in her stomach though, so she couldn\u2019t put as much in there. When she had only finished about a quarter of the plate, she pushed it away, causing Drew to look at her with disapproving eyes. He pushed it back closer to her and she decided to just ignore him. She couldn\u2019t force feed herself and besides, she knew she\u2019d be hungry again in about an hour. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew crawled in bed with her that night, as he tended to do every night and she fell into a restful sleep. He hadn\u2019t tried making love to her again but he\u2019d convinced her the couch was too small for him to sleep on. She felt badly for him, since he was putting everything else in his life on hold to take care of her. Besides she slept better with him holding her. It felt great to be in his arms and he was great support for her back.</p><p>They both woke up late the next morning and had to rush around before the movers showed up. She had her last minute items that needed packed and she wanted to do a final search of her cupboards and drawers. She was just finishing up when the Salvation Army arrived for her furniture. She was a little sad to see the items hauled away.</p><p>The men thanked her for her donation. The apartment seemed too empty, with not much left except a bunch of boxes. The moving company showed up within minutes of the other men leaving and her apartment was cleared out within an hour. Drew sent the men ahead of them. He\u2019d already hired some staff members who\u2019d let them into the new home.</p><p>She wandered around the empty apartment, making sure she hadn\u2019t forgotten anything. It was completely empty. There was a knock on the door and a couple of women came in, carrying cleaning supplies. She kept the place spotless but there was a final cleaning that had to be done. Drew hadn\u2019t wanted her around the chemicals and had insisted on hiring a company to do it for her.</p> <p>As much as her back was hurting, she hadn\u2019t argued with him and was relieved to have someone else doing the hard work. She turned her keys over to the manager and walked out of the place she had called home for the past couple of years.</p><p>Drew gently helped her into his car and they were off to the new house. She\u2019d only seen pictures of it online and was looking forward to going through it. From the pictures, it was certainly impressive.</p><p>They entered the locked gate and drove down the driveway. The moving van was backed into the garage and there was another furniture company van backed up as well. He told her he\u2019d ordered their furniture. He\u2019d also brought her a lot of catalogs and asked her to decorate. She\u2019d been too tired the night before but had to admit she was looking forward to going through them.</p><p>She\u2019d never had the money to decorate the way she wanted to. She figured even if she wasn\u2019t there a long time, it would be her gift to him, to decorate the place beautifully. She knew she had a great eye, which was why she\u2019d chosen to be a florist. It was a form of art to create a bouquet for someone\u2019s special day.</p><p>Trinity was wide eyed, as she walked through the huge front doors. The place was enormous and stunning. It was more like one of his resorts, than a home. She wandered from room to room, gasping in delight. There was even a library, similar to the one at Jasmine\u2019s house. Drew said it wasn\u2019t as large as Derek\u2019s place but she was thinking he was wrong. She didn\u2019t understand why anyone needed so much space.</p> <p>She stepped through the French doors and was delighted to find an outdoor kitchen. She\u2019d always wanted one. She could imagine her daughter playing in the swimming pool, while she barbequed dinner and then they\u2019d eat beneath the stars. It was perfect in so many ways. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to go back to living in an apartment after residing in this home.</p><p>The movers kept bringing in the furniture and she was impressed with everything he picked out. He had excellent taste and she couldn\u2019t imagine she would\u2019ve picked anything different.</p><p>\u201cI want to show you something and remember if you don\u2019t like any of it, we can return it and get what you want. But I wanted to help you since you\u2019re on bed rest,\u201d he told her, as they slowly made their way up the beautiful staircase.</p><p>He opened a door and she felt tears fall, as she stepped into the room. It was fully stocked with baby furniture. He\u2019d thought of everything. She walked over to the gorgeous canopied bed and looked inside, excited for the day her daughter would lay her little head in there.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t pick out any of the bedding or anything because Jasmine said you\u2019d want to choose your own theme but she said you should like this cherry wood,\u201d he said with some apprehension. He couldn\u2019t tell by her tears if she liked it or hated it. He stood there waiting for the verdict.</p><p>She walked up to him and wrapped him in her arms, as much as her large belly would allow. \u201cThank you Drew, it\u2019s all perfect,\u201d she said with a sniffle. The more things he did, the more she realized how hard it was going to be to let him go.</p> <p>There was a gorgeous changing table and matching dresser and the room even had a walk in closet. She didn\u2019t understand the need for a walk-in closet in a baby room but she was sure he\u2019d want to fill the shelves full. He\u2019d definitely be the type of guy to spoil his daughter. Even when they were no longer together, he\u2019d pamper and love his daughter. Trinity felt too much pain thinking of them not being together so she decided not to think about it.</p><p>There was an incredibly inviting rocking chair, not far from the crib. She walked over and sat down and sighed as she sunk down deep into it. It was luxurious and glided smoothly and silently back and forth. She could feel the heaviness of her eyes, as she rocked lightly and looked over the room.</p><p>He pushed a button and a step came up to cushion her swollen feet and the back laid down slightly. She could feel herself drifting off to sleep and decided not to fight it. She was tired from the busy day. She had a feeling she\u2019d sleep often in the wonderful chair.</p><p>Drew watched Trinity, as she closed her eyes and drifted into sleep. She was so unbelievably beautiful it was hard for him to take his eyes off her. He knew they still had a ways to go but he also knew he couldn\u2019t give her up. They were a family and he\u2019d do anything to keep them together.</p><p>She\u2019d come to realize how important it was for them to stay together. He\u2019d bought her the home and as she decorated it and settled in more, he knew she wouldn\u2019t want to leave. It was really hard for him not to demand she bend to his will but he\u2019d figured out quickly that didn\u2019t work so well with her. It was much better for him to coerce her than to force. He\u2019d just make her life too appealing for her to want to leave.</p><p>He knew his largest hurdle was convincing her he was nothing like the business men she\u2019d dated in the past. He\u2019d lied to her in the beginning but she had to realize why. Maybe she\u2019d trust him more when she realized he\u2019d put the house in her name and he wanted nothing more out of her than her love.</p><p>He tucked a blanket around her, glad she was resting and went back down the stairs to get things put away. His cousins would be there anytime to help him. He had a lot to do and wanted the house to be set up and not full of boxes. The sooner she saw the home as permanent, the better off they\u2019d be.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>\u201cThis place is beautiful, Trinity,\u201d Jasmine said with enthusiasm, as they walked from the front door together. \u201cI\u2019m at your beck and call to fill up that library,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty great but this is only temporary so I don\u2019t want to add too much right now,\u201d Trinity said with some caution. Jasmine chose to ignore the comment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to go through those catalogs with you if you need any help. We need to get you tucked up on the couch before your warden finds you\u2019re on your feet,\u201d she said with a laugh. Trinity knew she was joking but she wasn\u2019t far off. Drew seemed to have a radar go off anytime she got up for longer than a few seconds. She was thinking this bed rest stuff was going to raise her blood pressure far worse than taking a simple walk around would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it. It\u2019s all a bit overwhelming but since I can\u2019t really go anywhere, or do anything physical right now, it\u2019s kind of nice to have something to do,\u201d Trinity told her. The two women sat down and soon had racked up the credit card with purchases. Trinity wouldn\u2019t have ordered half the items but Jasmine insisted. Plus, she was irritated with Drew for being such a prison guard and was hoping to irritate him a bit with the spending, even if it was on his own home.</p><p>\u201cThese boys have far too much money and it needs spent,\u201d Jasmine said with a laugh. Trinity had the feeling he wasn\u2019t going to even notice the dent she\u2019d made to his bank account. It kind of took the pleasure out of her little tantrum. She was enjoying ordering the baby things. She couldn\u2019t wait for the items to be delivered. It was going to be so exciting to see the nursery all finished.</p><p>The cook brought them some lunch and they ate while going through the many catalogs. Once they were finished with the decoration items, Jasmine pulled out a bag with a bunch of other catalogs.</p><p>\u201cRyan is halfway finished with the remodel work on our shop, so now comes the fun part. We can start ordering some supplies. I think I brought everything over you\u2019ll need to set up your floral department. This company will bring the coolers out and set them all up. It\u2019s a bigger space so you\u2019ll have more display area. I also found this great company for gift items. I know my portion is supposed to be the caf\u00e9 but I\u2019d love to help with the gift section too. I love this type of stuff,\u201d Jasmine said, with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to have a bigger shop but I\u2019m in the dark with what needs to be done, so I\u2019m more than happy you want to be a part of it,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>The two women looked over the magazines and got more and more excited as they looked at everything. Drew and Derek came in a couple times and then decided to leave again, instead of getting suckered into looking at the myriad of items the women thought were so great. They were used to dealing with mergers and buildings; they always left decorating to other people. They just agreed with the women the items were to die for and snuck back out.</p><p>Jasmine had been right about him not caring about the purchased items, though. He hadn\u2019t even blinked when she\u2019d shown him the huge order. She couldn\u2019t possibly think of what she could do to get under his skin.</p><p>Once the women were finished purchasing half the items in the catalogs, it was getting late. Trinity was a little worried as the costs kept going up and up but Jasmine reassured her their location was phenomenal and they\u2019d sell out in no time and need to place even more orders. Trinity was thinking they could be really successful with this shop. She was beyond excited.</p><p>By the time the baby came everything would be ready to go and she\u2019d be able to enjoy working in her shop. The great thing about being a business owner was she could take her daughter with her because there was no way she wanted a stranger to raise her child, while she worked all day.</p><p>The two girls would be very close, growing up together. She was grateful they\u2019d have each other to play with. Ryan was even building a play area, which would benefit their daughters and their clients children as well. It was something she wouldn\u2019t have even thought about.</p><p>By the time they finished supper, she was exhausted and ready to go to bed. Jasmine gave her a big hug and headed out with Derek, then she was left alone with Drew for the first time that day. She started to get a bit nervous, as she thought about the night ahead. They had never discussed sleeping arrangements.</p><p>He led her up the stairs and opened the doors to the master bedroom and she was very impressed. The boys had been busy while her and Jasmine had been lounging around and spending money. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow, Drew this room is really spectacular,\u201d she told him as she looked around. She stepped into the huge closet and noticed it was filled with both his and her clothing. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea for us to share a room,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and looked down into her eyes. \u201cI know things haven\u2019t been perfect and I\u2019ve kind of bullied you into this situation but we\u2019ve been sleeping in the same bed and it\u2019s very nice. I won\u2019t pressure you into sex before you\u2019re ready but I\u2019m not budging on the sleeping situation,\u201d he said. He said the words with steel in his voice but his hands were gentle, wrapped around her body.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like being told what to do and was tempted to kick him in the shin and go find another room, just for the spite of it. As if he could read her mind he smiled down at her.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d try and fight me on this, which is why there are no other beds in the house,\u201d he said a bit smugly. She glared some more at him. There were some comfortable couches she could sleep on. \u201cOh come on, it\u2019s not that bad to sleep with me,\u201d he said on a sigh of frustration.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll sleep in here for tonight because I\u2019m exhausted but I\u2019m not snuggling with you,\u201d she said. She knew she sounded like a pouty child but it was frustrating how he always seemed to get his way. He shrugged, as he started stripping from his clothes.</p><p>Trinity couldn\u2019t breathe when he stood before her in nothing but his boxer shorts. The man was so incredibly sexy, standing before her, with his Adonis chest and abs. As her stare continued down his body, her breath sucked in at the site of his very obvious arousal stretching the front of his boxer\u2019s. When her eyes snapped back up to his face, he smiled wickedly at her.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is ask and we could both go to sleep feeling pleasured tonight,\u201d he suggested. She was far too tempted to take him up on his offer. She was fighting with herself on what to do. She really wanted him and just looking at his beautiful body had sent her pulse rate skyrocketing and the heat flowing towards her core. She didn\u2019t understand how he could possibly want her, with her stomach sticking out a mile but he obviously wasn\u2019t turned off by her ever expanding body.</p><p>He\u2019d decided to not force her into anything but he wasn\u2019t above seducing his wife-to-be. He could see the longing on her face, which was something he couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>He stepped closer and brought his lips down to hers in a tender kiss. The only part of their body\u2019s touching was their lips and she could feel herself swaying towards him. Her stubborn mind may be saying no but her alert body knew exactly what it wanted. She couldn\u2019t resist him when he caressed her so gently. He ran his tongue along her lips and gently nipped her mouth. She moaned at the pure pleasure of his caress, opening her mouth for him to slip inside. He caressed her mouth, causing her to quiver with need. His tongue mimicked what he\u2019d like to be doing with his body, as he slipped it in and out of her mouth and caressed her lips.</p><p>His hands finally ran up her sides and slipped under her shirt, caressing her rounded stomach, until he finally reached her aching breasts. The nipples were already peaked, in anticipation of his touch. When he finally brushed his palms over the tight buds, her entire body jerked with pleasure. He broke the kiss long enough to slowly pull her shirt over her head and brought their lips back together again. He was moving slowly and she knew she could stop the seduction at any time. The power of that knowledge almost brought her to her knees. He was still leaving their lovemaking up to her but he was seducing her slowly. She didn\u2019t think an earthquake could stop her from reaching for him. She needed him and there was nothing wrong with that. She needed to be loved in a way only he could provide.</p><p>His breathing shortened with the deepened kiss. As her body responded to his caresses, he knew she wouldn\u2019t deny him and his body was shaking with need. He had to possess her or he wouldn\u2019t survive the night. He changed his slow caresses to urgent, desired filled kisses with his hands roaming over her body. Her knees were starting to get wobbly and she was afraid she was going to sink to the floor at any moment. Drew could feel her losing strength so he scooped her up in his arms and gently laid her on the bed, without ever breaking the kiss. She sighed in pleasure as his hands swept down her body. He pulled her pants off and touched her where she most needed him.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me and there won\u2019t be regrets,\u201d he demanded of her. She didn\u2019t want to say the words. It was too much like giving in. When she didn\u2019t respond to him, he pulled back from her aching heat to look at her face. She cried out in displeasure. He rubbed her thighs and circled her core, making her whimper.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me to touch you, Trinity,\u201d he growled as he continued to touch her everywhere but the one spot she wanted most.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Drew, I need you,\u201d she finally gasped.</p><p>He pushed her legs apart and she willingly opened to him and cried out in pleasure when he finally inserted his fingers into her wet heat.</p><p>He ran his tongue down the column of her throat and she arched her head back, to allow him easier access. He kissed his way towards her breasts and sucked the peaks into his mouth, making her cry out. She couldn\u2019t remain still as he caressed her needy body.</p><p>He kissed his way down her stomach and she quivered in need as her skin tingled with anticipation of his next caress. He knew her body better than she did herself and everywhere he touched her, set fire to her very core.</p><p>He spread her legs further apart and kissed the inside of her thighs. She arched in pleasure, when he ran his tongue along the inside of her legs. He moved closer to her core and she trembled. He finally gave her what she needed and kissed her sensitive flesh in the most intimate way a man can. Her body jerked off the bed as his tongue stroked her hot flesh.</p><p>\u201cPlease Drew, I need you,\u201d she called out to him. He continued to stroke her with his tongue, making her cry out. When he finally sucked her swollen nub into his mouth, she went over the edge with intense pleasure. He continued to stroke her flesh, making her body spasm. When her shaking finally started to recede, he turned her body kissing his way up her hips and side. He sucked on her neck, making her heat start to build once again. He brought his hands around to her far more sensitive breasts and rubbed them as he pinched her nipples between his fingers.</p><p>He brought his other hand down to her very core and rubbed the sensitive nub, as he pushed his erection up to her opening. She pushed back against him, needing him to fill her up. Every time she was with him, her need only grew greater for the man.</p><p>\u201cNo regrets,\u201d he demanded of her. His head was pushed up against her opening and she was pushing back against him, needing him to enter her. He still held back, waiting for her answer. She knew if she didn\u2019t promise him what he wanted he\u2019d pull away from her, leaving them both aching and unsatisfied. Her heart warmed knowing he cared enough about her to not want her to have bad feelings of them making love.</p><p>\u201cNo regrets,\u201d she finally answered breathlessly. He pushed inside her with a fast thrust, which caused all the air to whoosh out of her lungs. How could she possibly have any regrets, when she felt so full? She wanted to stay that way forever. She could no longer imagine her life without him in it, she knew she was in trouble but as he moved within her body, she could no longer think about anything.</p><p>He felt so good inside of her it made it difficult for her to breathe. He wasn\u2019t slow any longer in his movements and grabbed hold of her hips so he could thrust in and out of her tight opening. He gripped her firmly in his hands and pushed faster in and out, making her cry out in pleasure. She tightened around him as the orgasm shook through her once again, even more powerful than the last one.</p> <p>He yelled out, as his own body pulsed inside her. She could feel the pumping of his release, which intensified her own pleasure. The moment stretched on, for what seemed like forever, as they both tried to get their breathing under control. He finally pulled free of her body and turned her over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Trinity. That was far too rough. I seem to lose all sense of control with you,\u201d he said as he rubbed her gently all over. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked her with real concern radiating from his expression.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d was all she managed to get out. She was more than okay, she was completely satisfied. She couldn\u2019t even keep her eyes open as the pleasure washed through her. She drifted off to sleep with his hands still fluttering over her soft curves.</p><p>Drew pulled her against him and held her tightly in his arms. He couldn\u2019t believe how lucky he was to have found her. She was beautiful, passionate and so intelligent. He rubbed his hands over the mound of her stomach and was filled with wonder, when his child pushed against him. He kept rubbing the spot and his face split with pride. His child must be restless because she was pushing out against his hand.</p><p>He was once again filled with pure joy as he thought, soon he\u2019d be able to hold her in his arms. He knew she wasn\u2019t ready to come into the world yet but he could hardly wait.</p><p>Trinity could not get comfortable the next day. She was sitting in the living room, with a movie playing and feeling restless. Her back had been hurting all morning and seemed to be getting worse. She figured it was just typical pregnancy pain and didn\u2019t want to alarm Drew but as the day was progressing, it seemed to be getting worse. She figured it would be a great time to take a warm bath.</p><p>She slowly stood up from the couch. As she finally got to her feet, a cramp ripped through her mid-section, causing her to double over, right as Drew walked in the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked in a panic as he came over and put his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she panted through the pain.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like nothing. We\u2019re going to the hospital now,\u201d he stated and picked her up, like she weighed nothing at all. She tried to protest but he wasn\u2019t listening. He gently placed her in the car and must have broken every speed limit, in his haste to get her to the hospital.</p><p>He pulled up in front of the emergency room and rushed her inside. He told the doctor she was having some pain and they rushed her back to a room, where she found herself hooked up to a bunch of machines once again.</p><p>Her stomach continued to cramp every few minutes and she was starting to worry she was going into early labor. It was too soon. The baby wasn\u2019t ready to come yet.</p><p>The doctor looked over her charts and listened to the baby, with a worried expression on his face. \u201cYou have gone into early labor but don\u2019t panic. You got here early enough we should be able to stop it,\u201d the doctor told her and she couldn\u2019t understand how he\u2019d think she wouldn\u2019t panic at his words.</p><p>She looked over at Drew, who was trying not to look worried and failing miserably. He paced the room, as the doctor placed an I.V. in her arm and they administered a drug to try and stop the labor.</p><p>\u201cThis should stop the labor but if for some reason your little girl decides to make her entrance into the world early, her chances are good. She\u2019s a little over four pounds right now,\u201d the doctor tried to reassure them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Trinity asked with real fear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Sometimes our bodies just don\u2019t realize it\u2019s not time for the baby to be born,\u201d the doctor tried to reassure her. She lay almost completely still for the next several hours, not wanting to do anything to make the labor progress. Finally the drug seemed to be working because the contractions stopped. She fell into a fitful sleep, as she continued to lie in the hospital bed.</p><p>Drew stayed by her side the entire time. He was just as worried as her, if not more. He was frustrated there wasn\u2019t more he could do to help her and the baby. He was supposed to be their protector and couldn\u2019t do anything to stop her pain. He was also feeling incredibly guilty about their lovemaking. He knew he\u2019d been too rough with her. He questioned the doctor about it and he reassured Drew the lovemaking wasn\u2019t to blame but he didn\u2019t believe him. He\u2019d never forgive himself if something happened to his child or Trinity.</p><p>Trinity came in and out of consciousness, as the doctor continued to monitor her. Jasmine showed up and stayed by her bedside, next to Drew. She was grateful to have her in her life. Trinity had quickly become one of her best friend\u2019s and she couldn\u2019t imagine losing her.</p> <p>Jasmine and Drew comforted each other and Trinity as well each time she woke up. They all said prayers the baby would stay in the comfort of her womb for as long as possible. The doctor told them each extra day gave the baby more strength and increased her odds.</p><p>The doctor moved her to a private room but he wanted to keep her in the hospital for the remainder of her pregnancy, to make sure she was safe. The contractions stopped but her body was dilated about four centimeters and he was very concerned he\u2019d only put off the early labor, for a short period of time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping to get at least another week in, before you go into labor for good. You won\u2019t reach your full term but each day we\u2019re able to keep the baby safe inside you is one more day she\u2019s getting stronger and gaining weight,\u201d he told her.</p><p>After her third day in the hospital room, Trinity was ready to leave but knew it wasn\u2019t safe for her daughter. She missed her house already and was surprised she thought of it as home so soon.</p><p>The doctor said her body was in a very fragile state and he was concerned if she left, she\u2019d go immediately into labor. He wanted to keep the baby in her stomach as long as possible and keep her hooked up, where both her and the baby could be monitored around the clock.</p> <p>\u201cSo, please tell me why I\u2019m only seeing you at the hospital, now?\u201d Damien asked as he walked into her room, holding a giant vase of flowers, balloons, and most importantly, a huge box of chocolates.</p><p>\u201cOh, Damien, you\u2019re my hero right now if you hand over that box immediately,\u201d she said with a tear in her eye. He didn\u2019t even bother teasing her with the chocolates, he just handed them over.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? Are you going to roast our pretty girl a while longer?\u201d he asked with a teasing smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep her in as long as possible,\u201d Trinity told him, while rubbing her large stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t made it by the new place. I had to leave the country for a while. This new business deal is kicking my butt,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve really missed you. I have Jasmine but you\u2019ve been my best friend forever,\u201d she said, having a hard time not crying.</p> <p>\u201cHey, you know I\u2019ll never go away. I promise when this deal is over I\u2019ll come over and even change a few diapers,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d she said with a smile. She bit into her first chocolate and moaned, causing his brows to rise. \u201cIt\u2019s really good,\u201d she added with a giggle. He was able to stay with her for a long time so they caught each other up on their lives. She cried a little more when he walked out the door.</p><p>On her fifth night in the hospital, Drew pulled his chair close to her bed. He grabbed her hand and took a deep breath. She knew he was trying to talk to her about something important and so she waited for him to say what he needed to.</p><p>\u201cTrinity, I know you aren\u2019t sure about us as a couple but you know I care about you, right?\u201d he finally asked her.</p><p>\u201cI think you want to care about me because you love our daughter,\u201d she answered him honestly.</p><p>\u201cI do love our daughter, more than you could ever imagine but Trinity I care about you. When we\u2019re together, everything feels right. I think over time we could be really happy together, if you\u2019d just give it a real chance,\u201d he pleaded with her. She was feeling more open, as she worried over her daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Drew, I\u2019ll admit that,\u201d she told him as she squeezed his hand.</p><p>\u201cWill you please let me do the right thing for my daughter, before she\u2019s born?\u201d he asked her. She didn\u2019t understand what else he could possibly do that he hadn\u2019t already. He had turned his world upside down to take care of her, bought a new home, took time off from work. She looked at him quizzically. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small box and her eyes widened as she realized what he was talking about. She automatically started shaking her head but he stopped her.</p> <p>\u201cPlease marry me so you and my daughter can have my name. Let me be your husband and her father. If you really can\u2019t stand it then you can divorce me but please don\u2019t deliver our daughter without being my wife. I thought we were going to have more time to figure this all out but she could be born any day and I need for you to be my wife when she\u2019s born,\u201d he asked her with so much passion, she didn\u2019t know how she could deny him.</p><p>She was still unsure about everything between them but he had been really good to her and this was one way she could actually pay him back. This was something she could do for both him and her daughter. She knew he was nothing like her ex-boyfriend, so she had nothing to fear. She finally nodded her head in agreement.</p><p>Drew\u2019s face split with a brilliant smile as he gently pulled her into his arms and hugged her close to him. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d he whispered into her ear and she felt a tear escape her eye at the heartfelt gratitude in his voice.</p><p>Things moved far more quickly than she could\u2019ve ever imagined. A few hours later Derek, Jasmine and Ryan showed up with a preacher in tow. Jasmine had a bouquet of flowers, which she handed over and a tiara she placed on her head. Trinity felt really silly, considering she wasn\u2019t allowed to get out of the bed and was wearing a hospital gown but she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do this again the right way later but for now it\u2019s the best we can do on such short notice,\u201d Jasmine told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much, you really didn\u2019t have to do anything at all,\u201d Trinity said self-consciously. She knew she must look a wreck but she wasn\u2019t even allowed up for a shower, only sponge baths. She didn\u2019t exactly feel like a blushing bride. It hurt her heart a little bit so she pushed it out of her mind.</p><p>The ceremony only took about fifteen minutes. Ryan went out the door and came back in with a beautiful cake and some sparkling cider. She got a little bit choked up as Drew fed her a piece of the cake, then leaned down to kiss her lips. He seemed so happy, she knew she\u2019d made the right choice.</p><p>\u201cI know this isn\u2019t a traditional wedding by any means but none of that matters. What matters is you two love each other and are going to have this beautiful baby girl soon. There will be plenty of time later to do things the right way. May you have many romantic days and far more passionate nights,\u201d Ryan said, as he held up his glass in a toast.</p><p>Trinity could feel the blush stain her cheeks at his words. It may not have been her dream wedding but it was perfect nonetheless. She looked at Drew and realized she was head over heels, completely and totally in love with the man. She didn\u2019t know at what point she let down the walls around her heart but she knew the door was open and if he decided to leave her, she was going to be beyond devastated.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say it was any one particular moment she fell in love but several smaller moments over the last several months. The man was simply too hard to resist and now she was married to him and her world had flipped completely upside down.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Trinity barely reached thirty-six weeks in her pregnancy. She\u2019d been having contractions all morning and nothing the doctor\u2019s did could stop the labor. She prayed she\u2019d kept her inside of her long enough she\u2019d be okay.</p><p>In the afternoon her water broke and nothing was going to stop the delivery. She\u2019d hoped to stretch it for even a day or two more. She\u2019d deal with the pain to give her baby girl more time inside her womb, safe and sound.</p><p>\u201cTrinity things are moving along really quickly, we need to move you to the birthing room. Your daughter is anxious to meet her parents and it\u2019s not going to be much longer,\u201d the doctor told her.</p><p>They wheeled her down the hallway and Drew never left her side, which she was incredibly grateful for. She\u2019d never needed anyone like she needed him at that moment. She was terrified and wouldn\u2019t feel better until the doctor told her the baby would be fine.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks good Trinity, her heartbeat is strong and she has put on some good weight this last week and a half. I know that doesn\u2019t seem like much time but for a baby it can make all the difference,\u201d the doctor continued to reassure her.</p><p>She cried terrified tears as they switched her onto a new table and began prepping her for the birth. \u201cYou\u2019ll both be okay, baby. I know it,\u201d Drew told her, while gripping her hand. He was solid as a rock and the confidence in his expression was encouraging.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon,\u201d she cried helplessly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done everything you were supposed to do and I know she will be strong, just like her mother,\u201d he reassured her and bent down to gently kiss her. She took a deep breath and got ready for the hard task of pushing.</p><p>The hospital staff got her legs in the stir-ups and checked her dilation. \u201cYou\u2019re ready now, so the next time you feel a contraction, I want you to use all your strength and push,\u201d the doctor explained.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait long before the pain came ripping through her body. She\u2019d never felt anything like it. It was as if her insides were turning inside out and she was going to explode. Sweat broke out over her brow and she cried out, as she pushed down with all her might.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good Trinity, I can see her head. I think she\u2019s going to come out with only a few pushes. I know it\u2019s hard but you need to relax and push just like that when you get your next contraction,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>The next one hit before she was ready but she did what he said, gripping Drew\u2019s hand tightly in hers, as she pushed with everything she had. \u201cVery good, she\u2019s crowing. We need to get her head out so as soon as it hits, push with all you\u2019ve got,\u201d the doctor told her.</p><p>She wanted to bash his head in. It was really easy for him to tell her to give it all she had. He wasn\u2019t the one trying to pass a child through a small opening. Drew rubbed a cloth over her sweating brow, then the next contraction hit with the force of a tornado. She didn\u2019t see how she wasn\u2019t ripped in half from the horrible pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She screamed as she bore down and pushed as hard as she could. She felt nothing but the burning pain as the baby\u2019s head came out. The doctor was doing something and then the next contraction hit even harder and she pushed again, without any words from anyone and she felt more burning. She thought she may die right there on the table, before she even saw her daughter.</p><p>The contractions were right on top of each other and she barely had time to catch her breath before the intense urge to push again hit her. She did it a couple more times and she felt relief as her daughter passed through her body.</p><p>She looked up to see the doctor stick something in her mouth and then the most amazing sound in the world surrounded her, the angry wail of her daughter\u2019s intense displeasure of being taken from her warm home of eight months.</p><p>The nurse quickly wrapped her in a blanket and lay her down on Trinity\u2019s chest, then she was looking into the squinting eyes of her baby girl. She was the most beautiful thing she\u2019d ever seen in her life. She was trying to open her eyes but the lights were far too bright, allowing her only to open them to tiny slits. She was crying in the most pathetic little voice Trinity had ever heard and she sobbed right along with her.</p> <p>She was so tiny, lying there on her chest she didn\u2019t see how it was possible she could be okay but she looked pink and beautiful beneath the slimy paste on her body. Trinity looked at Drew and was amazed to see a tear slide down his own cheek as he touched his daughter for the first time. Her heart swelled even more for the man, in love with their little girl.</p><p>\u201cWe need to take her over here and make sure she\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll bring her back right away if all her vitals check out,\u201d the nurse told her kindly, before picking the baby up. Trinity\u2019s tears fell, at the empty feeling of not having her daughter in her arms.</p><p>\u201cShe looks healthy and strong Trinity, you did a really good job,\u201d Drew reassured her, as he once again bent down to kiss her softly.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she said, not taking her eyes off her daughter laying helplessly under the warming lights. The nurses didn\u2019t seem to be in a panic as they checked her vitals, which was reassuring.</p><p>The doctor gave her some kind of shot that numbed her as he cleaned her up. She realized she must look pretty frightening but Drew was looking at her like she was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen. It filled her with warmth, which she needed, as she couldn\u2019t stop shaking now that things were all over.</p> <p>The nurses cleaned her up and lifted her onto a new bed, which caused more pain for a moment. The heated blankets under her and on top of her made the pain worth it though because she was finally starting to warm up.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you kept her safe inside for long enough because she\u2019s healthy. Her lungs are fully developed and she won\u2019t need oxygen. She\u2019s a little underweight at only four pounds eight ounces, so we\u2019ll want to keep her here until she\u2019s over five pounds but other than that you have a healthy, beautiful baby girl,\u201d the doctor finally said.</p><p>Trinity was filled with relief at his words. Their baby was going to be just fine. She would\u2019ve stayed in the bed for the next month straight if she could\u2019ve given her more time but she was still going to be fine.</p><p>\u201cCan I hold her again?\u201d Trinity asked them.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d the nurse said, as she brought her over and placed her back in Trinity\u2019s arms. She was now wrapped up in a warm blanket and mother and daughter watched each other in fascination.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Princess?\u201d she said to her as she rubbed her head. She looked back at her with those beautiful blue eyes all newborns had. She blinked a few times and Trinity couldn\u2019t believe she was actually holding her in her arms. \u201cDo you want to hold your daughter?\u201d she finally said to Drew.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll break her. I\u2019ve never held such a tiny baby,\u201d he admitted with a worried frown between his brows.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be perfect at it,\u201d Trinity told him with confidence. He leaned down and gently picked her up and cradled her to his chest. The complete look of overwhelming love on his face made more tears fall down Trinity\u2019s cheeks. It was more than obvious he adored his daughter and she knew she\u2019d done the right thing in marrying him so they could all be together. Even if he never loved her, he\u2019d always love his little girl and that meant more than anything else.</p><p>\u201cShe weighs nothing, it\u2019s like I\u2019m holding nothing but a blanket,\u201d Drew said in awe as he held her close to his chest. He couldn\u2019t believe how unbelievably beautiful his baby girl was. She was so tiny but so perfectly formed. He had never in his life loved something so much, as he loved his daughter. It was overwhelming in its intensity. He loved his family and he loved Trinity, although that was hard for him to accept but the love for his daughter was unlike anything he\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>As he held his daughter and looked down at his wife, everything felt so perfect. He knew he couldn\u2019t possibly live without either of them. He\u2019d fight to the ends of the earth for them. He could now understand what his cousin Derek had been through and felt a bit of guilt at how much he had teased the poor man.</p><p>He had all the money in the world but he\u2019d never felt truly rich until this moment in time, with his newborn daughter in his arms and his wife looking up at him with love in her beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to move you back to your own room,\u201d the nurse told them. Drew laid the baby back in her arms for the transport. She gladly held her and didn\u2019t take her eyes off the baby the entire way. She wouldn\u2019t have noticed if the building was falling down around them, she was so fascinated by her daughter\u2019s tiny features.</p><p>They got into the room and the nurse helped her sit up in bed, then brought in a tray of food. She realized she was starving for the first time in over a week. Drew took the baby back in his arms and sat in the chair next to her bed while she ate.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be nursing, or should I make up a bottle for her?\u201d the nurse asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m nursing,\u201d Trinity told her. She knew it was a natural thing but she still blushed, since Drew was sitting there in the room with her. She\u2019d never discussed any of that with him and didn\u2019t know how he felt about it. She just knew it was important for the baby to get all the added help she could, especially with her being born early and weighing so little.</p><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019re done with your meal, we should try and get her to eat. She won\u2019t be very interested in it at first but she will soon gain an appetite,\u201d the nurse told her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Trinity answered shyly. She was a little nervous to be talking about such a personal thing with a stranger but glad to have some help, as she didn\u2019t really know what she was doing.</p><p>She finished her meal and the nurse helped her with the process of getting the baby to latch on. It wasn\u2019t an easy task but Trinity had all the patience in the world for her daughter. After some time went by, she finally managed to latch on and get some food. Trinity was beyond proud of her little girl.</p><p>Drew stepped out of the room, to give her some privacy and to let his family know his baby girl was born. They were all in the waiting room, most likely pacing. He let her know he\u2019d give her about an hour before bringing them in to see the newest family member.</p><p>They arrived soon after she finished and nobody could get enough of her, commenting on how beautiful she was. \u201cOh my gosh, she makes Britney seem so big, now,\u201d Jasmine said, as she cuddled the baby close to her. \u201cI want to have ten more of these Derek,\u201d she said with a smile of longing.</p><p>\u201cYou can have as many as you want,\u201d he told his wife and kissed her. \u201cWe can get started tonight in fact,\u201d he added with a look of lust in his eyes. Jasmine giggled and passed the baby over to Ryan. He gently cradled her in his arms, with a look of complete awe on his face.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just so tiny,\u201d he whispered. She looked even smaller against him. One of his hands was the length of her body. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll break her,\u201d he finished nervously, as he looked at Drew with panic.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll break her too,\u201d he said with just as much awe.</p><p>\u201cYou guys wouldn\u2019t do anything that would harm her, not in a million years,\u201d Trinity told the men. They soon handed her back to Trinity and she greedily took her in her arms. It hadn\u2019t been that long but she\u2019d missed her sweet scent already.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Derek finally asked.</p><p>She and Drew looked at each other. They hadn\u2019t really discussed names and in all the excitement since the birth, neither of them had thought about it. She hadn\u2019t the slightest idea what she wanted to name her little girl.</p><p>\u201cI have a favorite aunt named Stephanie. I\u2019ve always liked that name,\u201d Drew suggested to her. She tried the name out and it seemed like a fit.</p><p>\u201cOkay then her name is Stephanie,\u201d she agreed with him, which earned her one of his heart-stopping smiles.</p><p>\u201cHello there Stephanie Titan, welcome to the family,\u201d Ryan said as he brushed his hand against her soft head. Trinity really liked the sound of that. Her beautiful baby girl, Stephanie Titan had arrived safe and sound and healthy.</p><p>She started to yawn and the family said their goodbyes so she could get some rest. Drew carefully picked up Stephanie and laid her in the basinet next to the bed. If she made a peep then Trinity would wake up and be able to tend to her. She fell asleep before the last family member left the room.</p><p>Drew looked at his beautiful wife and sleeping baby and felt so much overwhelming love for them he didn\u2019t understand how his heart didn\u2019t burst. He knew they had a hard road ahead of them but at the moment things were too perfect to even imagine anything bad could happen.</p><p>Drew worked his typical magic because the baby was kept in the hospital for four days while she put on weight and he made sure they were there with her the whole time. Normally the mother was released after two days if she was healthy and ready, like she was, but she couldn\u2019t leave her newborn there. Drew made sure she stayed as a patient so she could still have the comfortable bed and private room.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care how he did it. She only cared she could keep Stephanie with her because she wasn\u2019t willing to spend even a minute away from her daughter, let alone all night. When the doctor finally gave them the okay to bring her home, she was more than ready to get out of the hospital though. She wanted her own bed and her daily routine to start with her daughter at home.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Trinity looked at her daughter and smiled. She couldn\u2019t believe she was already a month old. The time was flying by too quickly and she wanted nothing more than to stop the clocks.</p><p>She and Drew had come to a truce of sorts because they were both mesmerized with their little girl. He had stayed home non-stop for the two weeks after she\u2019d come home from the hospital but then one of his resorts was having some problems and he had to take off. She couldn\u2019t believe how badly she missed him.</p><p>He\u2019d set her up with a video conferencing system because he said he couldn\u2019t bear to not see his daughter on a daily basis. He\u2019d set up a private camera that hung over her crib, so he could click his computer on and watch his little girl sleeping. Trinity was overwhelmed with how much he loved her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, as she looked down at her baby girl, it was impossible for her to imagine anyone not loving her like crazy. She was more beautiful and wonderful than anyone could ever imagine.</p><p>Trinity was also very grateful to have Jasmine, especially with Drew being gone for such a long period of time. The home was so large and she was really lonely. Jasmine had been coming over often to keep her company. She said she got lonely herself, with Derek working and Jacob at school.</p><p>Both women were extremely excited for the new shop to open. Today was their last day of getting the final touches done. The next morning was their Grand Opening. They had hired a few employees and Jasmine had a nanny who would be at the shop to help with the two babies. It all seemed too unreal to be true.</p><p>She\u2019d been too worn out from the hard pregnancy and delivery to close her old shop down and it was bittersweet to go into the empty shop, after it was cleared out, to make sure everything had been done correctly.</p> <p>She was moving on to a better place so it wasn\u2019t like it was the end but it had still been sad for her. She\u2019d been grateful to have Jasmine with her when she\u2019d done the final walk through.</p><p>Drew had hired a staff for the house so she was never truly alone but it wasn\u2019t the same thing as having her husband there, or her best friend. She was getting pretty close to Maria, their cook. She was about the age her mom would be and full of life and laughter. The woman was a phenomenal cook as well. Even Jasmine liked her food and she was most definitely a critic.</p><p>Trinity heard Jasmine\u2019s laughter about two seconds before she entered the room. \u201cI love that little dress. She looks so adorable today. I can\u2019t believe how much she keeps growing,\u201d Jasmine said, as she pulled Stephanie into her arms. The baby coo\u2019d at her, which had Jasmine laughing more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing how quickly they grow,\u201d Trinity said in awe. \u201cWhere\u2019s Britney?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI left her home with the nanny because we\u2019re going to be putting the final merchandise out and I thought it would be easier. She\u2019s walking all over now,\u201d she said as she nuzzled the baby.</p> <p>\u201cI love Stephanie getting bigger but I\u2019m grateful she can\u2019t get away right now. It would be much harder to keep an eye on her while we\u2019re down there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRyan got the cribs and swings all set up for us. I think the girls are going to do great but our first few days are going to be hectic so I\u2019ll leave Britney home, although it will kill me a little bit. If she was still nursing, I couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, nursing can definitely be a blessing and a curse,\u201d Trinity said. She was the food source for her daughter and since she was still so tiny, she ate far more often.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m desperately trying to fight those baby blues right now. Britney is almost a year old already and holding Stephanie all the time is making my womb jump. Of course Derek is ready anytime I want to have another one but I want to wait at least six more months before we start trying. Of course I never get tired of practicing,\u201d she said with a huge grin.</p><p>Trinity was a little jealous of her friend. Drew hadn\u2019t even touched her since the week before the baby had been born. He blamed himself for sending her into early labor, which was ridiculous but she figured that was more of an excuse. She still had baby weight to get off and she was always so worn out she was sure she wasn\u2019t looking her best. She figured he wasn\u2019t even kissing her because she looked a wreck all the time. It would be nice if he felt about her the same way Derek felt about Jasmine. She had to push those thoughts aside because they didn\u2019t do her any good. The important thing was they were making things work, so their daughter could have security and love, which was far more important than her own needs.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to head out?\u201d Jasmine asked her.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I want to get going before I lose too much steam. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to spend far too much time in that heavenly room Ryan built us,\u201d she said, with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI was so excited to see that. He thought of everything. The man is an absolute genius at building,\u201d Jasmine agreed.</p><p>The two women climbed into Jasmine\u2019s car and drove the short distance to their shop. Trinity still felt awe as they pulled up to the front doors. It was beautiful, inside and out, due to the creative building skills of Ryan. He was doing some final painting to the outside of the building, as they stepped from the vehicle.</p><p>He dropped what he was doing as soon as he spotted the ladies. \u201cYou\u2019re arriving a bit late,\u201d he said, as he opened the back door and pulled out Stephanie\u2019s car seat. She thankfully, was fast asleep so Trinity could get things done.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get out the door when you\u2019re dealing with babies. They need changed and fed and then when you think you\u2019re ready to go, they spit up all over you and them and you have to start all over again,\u201d Jasmine said, with fondness. She adored being a mother.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Ryan said. His words may have said he was relieved but the way he adored his nieces and nephew contradicted his words. At that moment he was carefully carrying Stephanie inside, gazing at her as if she was the greatest thing in the universe. The two women looked at each other with knowing eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes Ryan, you\u2019re a confirmed bachelor, for sure,\u201d Jasmine said with a twinkle in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take her out of the seat and put her in the crib?\u201d he asked Trinity.</p> <p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s comfortable in there. Just undo the latches and tuck her blanket around her. I just changed and fed her, so she should sleep for a couple hours,\u201d she answered him. He seemed disappointed by that. She\u2019d have to keep an eye on him, to make sure he didn\u2019t wake her on purpose just to carry her around. She\u2019d noticed all the men doing that. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare wake her, Ryan,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said with a slight pout. How could she not love these strong, masculine guys, when they absolutely adored her daughter? She gave him a hug, then wandered around the building.</p><p>Ryan truly had done an amazing job. The floor space was huge, with custom built display shelves. Her coolers were framed in wood and there was so much color everywhere she looked. She wandered over to the play area and smiled. It was safe and completely enclosed so the girls wouldn\u2019t be able to sneak out.</p><p>She walked behind the custom made counters and was still amazed by the amount of space. She had a huge work station to make any kind of bouquet she wanted. Beyond that area he had not only added a large bathroom but had created a break room. There was a soft sofa, she had the feeling she\u2019d take many naps on, a changing table, two cribs and a luxurious rocking chair.</p><p>She and Jasmine would never need to leave their business. It was already stocked with full supplies so they wouldn\u2019t have to tote diapers or rags back and forth. Everything was there and easy to use. He\u2019d even made a small nook for a stackable washer and dryer, to clean their bedding right there in the shop. For a confirmed bachelor, he sure was smart when it came to the needs of the new mothers.</p><p>She reluctantly walked from the break room and over to Jasmine\u2019s side of the shop. She had the most perfect kitchen imaginable. The counter matched Trinity\u2019s, except it was longer and had stools attached in front.</p><p>She already had several glass cases set out, just waiting for her goodies to fill them up. The kitchen had top of the line appliances in it and plenty of room for several people to move around. She had a very limited menu and was only serving breakfast and lunch but Trinity had the feeling she was going to be full day and night because her food was excellent.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d Trinity asked as she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the soup of the day ready for tomorrow. This one is much better if it has a night to sit in the fridge and marinate before it\u2019s cooked. I\u2019m making a few pots because I think we\u2019ll be busier than normal tomorrow. It will slow down after our opening weekend though,\u201d she said.</p><p>There were a couple of people busy working on different things for the next day but Jasmine was huge on freshness and some things had to wait till the next morning. She had bread rising, which would be ready for the ovens in the morning and more pastries than she could imagine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here and set up fans to blow the smell away from me because I\u2019ll never lose this weight with you cooking such amazing food,\u201d she said, then practically ran from the kitchen. Jasmine\u2019s laughter followed her across the shop.</p><p>She soon got busy setting out the last of her gift items on the pristine shelves and with the help of her two employees\u2019, began making several bouquets. She wanted the cases full of everything imaginable, from single rose vases, to huge baskets. She\u2019d be incredibly happy if she sold even half of the display. It would be her biggest day ever.</p><p>She was just finishing a basket when the monitor signaled Stephanie was waking up. She went to get her but Ryan beat her to it. He was pulling her out of the seat and talking baby talk to her. She blew bubbles at him, as she stared up at her uncle with her big blue eyes. He carried her around for a while, until she decided it was time to eat and he reluctantly handed her over.</p><p>Trinity was more than happy to take her back to the break room and have some alone time with her daughter. She sat back in the rocking chair and enjoyed the sounds of her hungry slurps, as she gulped down her milk, like it was the last meal she\u2019d get. Her daughter had liked eating from day one. It was a good thing for her putting on weight. Trinity rubbed her head, as she sang softly to her.</p><p>She could feel her eyes getting heavy as she finished feeding her and raised her to her shoulder for burping. She couldn\u2019t wait until she was back to having full energy again because she hadn\u2019t made it through one day since the birth without a nap.</p><p>The two women finally were satisfied everything was perfect for their next day and headed out of the shop. They were both worn out but had a great sense of pride at what they accomplished. The shop looked spectacular and they knew it would be a success. The men had hung up huge Grand Opening signs and she\u2019d noticed several cars driving by slowly to see what the new business was.</p><p>As Trinity laid Stephanie down for the night and slipped into her huge bed all alone, she had to fight back tears. She had really wanted Drew to be there with her for the Grand Opening. She knew her little business was nothing compared to the billion dollar resorts he owned but it was special to her. She knew he had to be away but she was still saddened. She fell asleep with a tear on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou guys have done an excellent job at getting this cleared up in time. I won\u2019t be available to come back over here for at least a month, so anything you need will have to go through the home office,\u201d Drew told the table of men surrounding him.</p><p>He\u2019d been stuck on the small island off the coast of Spain for two weeks and had to leave within the next hour or he was going to miss the Grand Opening of his wife\u2019s shop. She hadn\u2019t pled with him to come back but he knew it meant a lot to her and he wouldn\u2019t have cared if it ended up costing him the deal, he was leaving one way or the other that day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook hands with the men and headed out the door. His driver was waiting and the jet was ready. He could barely contain his excitement as he boarded the jet. He\u2019d never had such urgency to return home before. He\u2019d missed his baby girl more than anything he could\u2019ve ever imagined. He had also missed his wife. He needed to tell her how important she was to him and he needed her to accept they were going to stay together forever. If the last two weeks were any indication, he knew he couldn\u2019t possibly live his life without his two girls in it.</p><p>They\u2019d become such a huge part of his entire being and the thought of any distance from them ripped him apart. He\u2019d started conducting interview for a new executive who would do the majority of the traveling because he was done. He was excited because the man he hired to do the job had accompanied him on this trip and he was perfect. Drew knew he\u2019d be able to rest well, knowing the man wasn\u2019t only competent, but eager and hungry.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to sleep but before he knew it the captain was coming over the intercom stating they were preparing for landing. He looked out the window as the sun rose in the sky and could hardly wait to pull both Trinity and Stephanie close to him. Heck, the baby was only a month old and he could hardly wait to watch Trinity grow large with his second child. He had become like Derek and could picture their house with ten children running around. The more the merrier, he thought. He decided he\u2019d better wait a little while before suggesting that to Trinity. She was still pretty tired after giving birth to their daughter.</p><p>The car picked him up from the airport and he was soon heading towards the shop. It was to open in an hour and he had about a forty minute drive to get there. He told the driver he\u2019d get a five-hundred dollar bonus if he got him there in thirty. The man hit the gas and Drew smiled because money always talked.</p> <p>They pulled into the parking lot and Drew was thrilled to see a line outside the door. He could imagine both the women were brimming over with excitement to see the eager crowd. He slipped around back and let himself in the employee entrance and headed out to find his wife. He spotted her at the counter, looking over some paperwork and his heart swelled. He\u2019d missed her so badly.</p><p>He snuck up behind her and wrapped her in his arms. She stiffened for a minute until she turned around and saw it was him. Her face split wide open in a huge smile. They stared at one another for a few moments, then Drew bent his head to take her lips. He\u2019d missed her so much and as he deepened the kiss his body came fully alive. He knew it was too soon for them to make love but his body wasn\u2019t listening. It was a good thing there were a lot of people around, or he may have done something stupid.</p><p>\u201cI missed you and Stephanie so much these last two weeks. I finally got that employee hired so I won\u2019t have to travel nearly as much and when I do, I\u2019m taking you both with me because I can\u2019t bear to be apart for so long,\u201d he finally told her, when he managed to pull away from her.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d she admitted to him quietly. She had her arms wrapped around his back and couldn\u2019t pull away from him. It was so great to be back in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you out for a special celebratory dinner tonight,\u201d he told her and brought his lips back to hers and neither of them could speak for several minutes.</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds perfect,\u201d she finally responded. They were then interrupted by one of the employee\u2019s letting them know the doors would be opening in just a moment. Drew reluctantly let her go and went to find his daughter.</p><p>She was just starting to stir in her crib and as he bent down to pull her into his arms, her eyes opened and he had to fight back his emotions. She was still so small but she was so beautiful and he\u2019d missed the soft scent of her. He cuddled her close to his chest and simply breathed the scent of her into his lungs. He wouldn\u2019t be away from her for so long, again.</p><p>He walked out into the store and found his cousins. The three men stood there as the rush of people came flooding through the doors and were filled with pride for Jasmine and Trinity. The women were beaming, as they rang up sale after sale.</p><p>Trinity kept looking up, overwhelmed at the sight of her handsome husband gently cuddling Stephanie close to his chest. She was busy for the next several hours and found she wanted nothing more than to break away and simply hold her daughter, while Drew held them both. She had always wanted the shop and was proud it was having such a successful opening day but she\u2019d finally realized being with her husband and daughter far outweighed her need for success.</p><p>She had a competent staff and would be more than happy to be there only part time. Jasmine told her she\u2019d be working minimal hours herself, as she couldn\u2019t bear to be away from her family for long periods of time. Trinity realized there was nothing wrong with depending on her husband. Even if the man never loved her like she loved him, she\u2019d be happy to simply be a family together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to order every bouquet in the shop,\u201d Damien said as he walked up and gave her a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t be able to make it today,\u201d Trinity said with a huge grin splitting her face. Her day was officially perfect with all the people she loved in the room with her.</p><p>\u201cI threw business out the window. Today is about my best friend and beautiful niece,\u201d Damien told her. She quickly came around the counter and threw her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cHey, I think there are holes being burned into my back,\u201d he said with a laugh. He then dipped her low and whipped her back up, causing a giggle to escape. She looked over at Drew, who looked as if he was grumbling a bit too his cousins. She liked the thought he may be a bit jealous. It was good for him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me Miss, can you help me?\u201d a woman interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Damien but it looks like I\u2019m being beckoned,\u201d she told him. She gave him one more hug and got back to work. He walked over to the guys and she caught a glimpse of Drew slugging him in the arm. Ouch, she thought but Damien laughed and the men continued talking for a while before Damien slipped out the doors.</p><p>She broke away a few times to feed her daughter but other than that she was swamped all day and by the time they were able to leave, she was pretty dead on her feet. Drew took her home instead of out to a restaurant, then massaged her feet while she fed her daughter. She laid back and enjoyed the feel of his hands on her.</p><p>They put the baby to bed and he pulled her to their room and laid her down. Her body wasn\u2019t ready yet for love-making, which about killed her because she wanted them to share that again. She was incredibly self-conscious though of her body. He began rubbing her back and sides and she pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you. I know you aren\u2019t ready yet for love-making but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t kiss you and enjoy your beautiful curves,\u201d he told her before kissing her breathless.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not very beautiful right now Drew, I still have this extra weight from the baby and I never get enough sleep. I know I must look a mess,\u201d she said to him and could feel the blush on her cheeks. He pulled her chin up so he could look into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most stunning woman I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Your body is perfect and I don\u2019t care how much sleep you lose, you\u2019re still gorgeous. Don\u2019t ever try to hide from me because I love every square inch of you,\u201d he told her with passion. He grabbed her hand and pressed it against his very obvious arousal and her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t touched me since the baby was born and I thought you were a bit repulsed by me,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you thought that, Love. I could never be turned off by you. I was feeling so much guilt about our love-making the night before you went into the hospital. You make me go so crazy and I was so rough with you and simply didn\u2019t trust myself,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>\u201cDrew, you\u2019d never hurt me. You please me in ways I never knew were possible before I met you. You have given me so much and I can\u2019t imagine my life without you in it. I know I\u2019ve been stubborn and a bit of a pain but I really love you and want our marriage to be the real thing,\u201d she said to him. She was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to give her his love but she could no longer hold the words in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy to hear you say that. I\u2019ve loved you for so long. I never realized my life was empty until you were there and then gone. I missed you from the moment you left our private paradise and was overjoyed to find you pregnant with my child. I know I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes but loving you has been the best thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>He then pulled her close to him, so he could devour her mouth. Neither of them could breathe by the time he pulled back from her. He then explored her throat and moved down the slopes of her breasts. She was aching everywhere and cried out in frustration they couldn\u2019t be joined together.</p><p>She may not be able to make-love with her husband right then but she could certainly make sure he was satisfied. She pushed him over and slowly unbuttoned his shirt as she ran her tongue over his muscled chest. A slight sheen of sweat was breaking out on his tanned skin.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I can\u2019t take much more,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, as he tried pulling her back up to him. She shook his hands off of her as she reached his lower stomach and gently nipped the taught skin. He sucked in his breath at the pure pleasure she was giving him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he growled as he realized her intentions.</p><p>She said nothing, as she slowly unbuttoned his pants and pulled them and his boxers down his legs. His magnificent length sprung out, showing her how turned on he was. It filled her with pride she was able to turn him on so much.</p><p>She kissed her way back up his legs and felt empowered by the quivering of his body. He was breathing heavily and his head was thrown back, as he groaned in pleasure from her touch. She reached the top of his thighs and his body jerked as her hand rubbed against his moistened head.</p><p>She slipped her tongue out and licked the bead off his tip and he cried out. She\u2019d never in her life felt so sexy, or powerful in bed. It was a euphoric feeling and she wouldn\u2019t have ever done this for any other man. She gently cupped his silky smooth shaft in her hand, loving the strength of the hardened flesh. She rubbed her hand up and down, while gripping him tightly. She then lowered her head and took his tip into her mouth.</p><p>As her tongue flicked around his shaft and her hand continued to work its magic, he groaned over and over again. She was encouraged by his sounds of pleasure and tightened her mouth even more and began to suck him deeper inside her moist mouth. He grabbed her head, holding her tightly against him as she continued to pleasure him.</p><p>His body began to tense and he pulled her head free. \u201cI\u2019m not going to last,\u201d he croaked at her. She smiled at him and ran her tongue across the tip as she continued to stroke him quickly with her hand. She pulled back as he cried out and his release shot from him.</p><p>She stared in fascination as his engorged staff pumped in her hand and spilled over. It was the sexiest thing she\u2019d ever watched in her life. His body was jerking in pleasure as she used his own release to smooth her hand easier up and down the still quivering shaft. She continued to rub him until every last ounce of his orgasm spilled from him. She then couldn\u2019t resist flicking her tongue one last time over his beautiful head. He convulsed at the gentle touch and she smiled with pure feminine power. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slowly kissed her way back up his stunning abs and chest until she finally brought their lips back together. He kissed her gently; as his body was sated from the gift she\u2019d given him. He brought his hand down to the outside of her silky panties and rubbed. He knew he couldn\u2019t make-love to her but he could certainly pleasure her if he was very careful.</p><p>She started to writhe beneath his touch. \u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d she started to say but as he slipped the panties away and touched her swollen nub, her protest stopped in a gasp of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you but I need to touch you,\u201d he said into her mouth. She moaned her acceptance.</p><p>He continued to kiss her, increasing her body\u2019s pleasure, as he gently flicked his finger over her most sensitive area. She wanted so much more, she wanted him connecting their bodies together and it nearly killed her they couldn\u2019t. Her stomach was quivering in pure pleasure as he continued rubbing his finger on the outside of her opening, flicking the most sensitive spot.</p> <p>She jerked in surprise as the intense orgasm rocked her body. He slowed his rubbing down, as she continued to spasm in pure pleasure. He softened the kiss, as he helped her pleasure draw on and on. She finally collapsed against his chest in pure satisfaction. They both lay there together, feeling good they \u2018d managed to satisfy each other and express their overflowing love.</p><p>He pulled her against him and rubbed her head, as she laid it there on his chest. She fell asleep to the sound of his beating heart and knew nothing could be as great as that moment in time. She had an amazing daughter who she couldn\u2019t live without and an amazing husband who had made sure to keep them together.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Trinity couldn\u2019t believe her daughter was going to be a year old already. The last year had flown by and she was happier than she could ever possibly imagine. Drew had some huge surprise planned for her and she was giddy as a school girl, trying to imagine what it could possibly be.</p><p>He had already given her everything she could ever imagine and couldn\u2019t think of anything he could do for her that would top the past year. She had her own surprise for him as well. She rubbed her belly in anticipation. She\u2019d just found out she was pregnant again. She knew it was too soon but she was filled with excitement she was going to have another child. She loved Stephanie so much and Drew was head over heels for her and she knew he\u2019d welcome her news.</p> <p>She\u2019d been a bit saddened as Stephanie kept growing and would love to give her a sibling. She\u2019d be happy to have as many children as the house could hold. She loved being pregnant and she loved having her baby in her arms. Her and Drew would constantly pick up Stephanie and she was quite the spoiled little girl. She was well loved. When her parents were not holding her close, then one of her Uncles were there to pick her up.</p><p>She\u2019d noticed a slight change in Ryan lately and worried about him. He\u2019d seemed more stressed out than normal and she wondered if maybe there was a woman causing those circles to appear. She and Jasmine were determined to find out what it was about.</p><p>He\u2019d recently purchased a home near them and they were both thinking he was getting ready to settle down. They would most certainly figure it out. Jasmine stepped into the room with a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d Jasmine asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell me what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a best friend\u2019s code,\u201d Trinity said. Jasmine had been as secretive as Drew and Trinity was going a bit crazy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t give it away but let me tell you I\u2019m a bit jealous. You have a man who loves you very much. If I didn\u2019t have my own amazing husband, I wouldn\u2019t be nearly as happy for you,\u201d Jasmine joked with her.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to let you know the next time you\u2019re going crazy with anxiety, I\u2019m going to sit back and smile,\u201d Trinity said with a fake frown. Both women knew their friendship was solid. Trinity followed Jasmine out of the house and let her lead her away. She still had no clue where they were going, or what was going to happen.</p><p>They drove out of town and pulled up to a recreation hall and Trinity had no possible idea what could be going on but she stopped trying to figure it out and walked inside with Jasmine. When she stepped inside, she looked around in confusion and then to Jasmine\u2019s face, which was beaming at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d Trinity gasped.</p><p>\u201cDrew promised to give you a real wedding, so he planned it all out. I couldn\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t get at all suspicious when I was questioning you so much about your perfect dress, or what kind of place you\u2019d like and then the fitting for the supposed ball dress, was priceless. Has anyone ever told you how gullible you are?\u201d Jasmine said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea,\u201d Trinity told her with awe. She looked around the room, there were people everywhere. She was rushed to a huge mirror where a couple of people started playing with her hair and two other people started working on her fingernails and toenails. Within a couple of hours Trinity had been transformed and looked in the mirror at her gorgeous hair. There were diamonds dripping down and she was a bit afraid they may be real. She decided she wasn\u2019t going to think that because it would make her paranoid.</p><p>Jasmine slipped behind her and placed the same tiara she\u2019d worn in the hospital on her head and it made the look perfect. She would\u2019ve been disappointed to not have that one piece of her first wedding there.</p><p>They walked over to a dressing room and Trinity felt tears fall as she looked at the gorgeous gown hanging there. It was perfect in every single way. Jasmine and Drew had done an amazing job to make sure her dress was everything she could ever possibly want and so much more.</p><p>Jasmine helped Trinity step into the luxurious gown and as the layers of silk floated over her body and Jasmine tightened it up, Trinity truly felt like a princess. She stepped into the exquisite heels and looked in the mirror, barely even able to recognize herself.</p> <p>Jasmine stepped into her own beautiful gown and Trinity could hardly wait to get to Drew. She knew he\u2019d look so incredibly handsome. The women stepped outside and Trinity gasped at the beautiful car waiting for them. It was a convertible Jaguar and there were bows all over it. The driver was wearing a tuxedo and top hat. She giggled at the romance of it all.</p><p>The two women were assisted into the vehicle and the driver made his way slowly down the road. It didn\u2019t take long before they pulled up at a darling secluded church. It looked out of place in the middle of nowhere and Trinity wondered how he had found it.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind but this is where I had my wedding. Derek had it fixed up for me and I thought you\u2019d love it, as well. It\u2019s a great place and will give you good luck,\u201d Jasmine said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Jasmine and exactly what I would\u2019ve chosen,\u201d she said, really trying hard not to let the tears start flowing once again.</p><p>The driver stepped around and helped them from the vehicle and Trinity couldn\u2019t get enough of her surroundings. There was a large red carpet, leading all the way up the patch and over the stairs. There were also huge arrangements tiered down the steps and bows running along the banisters. It was amazing and she was completely awed.</p><p>Little Jacob stepped out of the building, looking very debonair in his own little tuxedo. He\u2019d grown so much in the past year Trinity had known him and now was about an inch taller than her. She loved her sweet nephew.</p><p>\u201cHi, Aunt Trinity. You look pretty,\u201d he said and bowed to her like a perfect gentleman. \u201cI\u2019d be very proud if I can walk you down the aisle to Uncle Drew,\u201d he finished. She could feel the tears start to gather in her eyes again. Like the perfect gentleman he pulled out a handkerchief and handed it over to her. She dabbed at her eyes and smiled at Derek, who\u2019d stepped out the door.</p><p>He put Jasmine\u2019s hand through his arm and stood at the head of the church and waited for Trinity to get ready. She nodded at them and the music started and they made their way forward. Trinity took a deep breath and slowly followed them. She was very grateful to have Jacob walk with her. He was going to be a heartbreaker himself when he got older. He was certainly following in his uncles footsteps. She smiled at him, as they stepped through the door. She looked forward and all thoughts were tossed from her mind as she took in Drew.</p><p>He was so breathtaking in his tuxedo, with his father and cousin standing next to him. Jasmine and Derek were on the other side and the family made such a stunning vision, she felt like she couldn\u2019t even breathe. She could not believe how lucky she was to have him and his family as a part of her life. It all seemed so much more real with her getting this dream wedding, too.</p><p>Their eyes were locked together as she made her way down the aisle and Jacob did such a great job as he placed her hand in Drew\u2019s. She could barely breathe; she was so taken back by the sexiness of her husband. The preacher spoke words and she repeated where she was supposed to but she had no idea how she managed because she was almost faint with happiness.</p><p>Soon the preacher was pronouncing them remarried and Drew was pulling her into his arms. He kissed her with so much passion and longing, it felt like they really were marrying for the first time. Derek cleared his throat and Drew reluctantly pulled away from her. She blushed as the crowd broke into applause at the beautiful couple.</p><p>Drew slipped her arm through his and walked her down the aisle. He pulled her out the door and took her around the back of the church. The scene was breathtaking. He had huge tents set up and there was music playing. He pulled her straight onto the dance floor and took her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stunning,\u201d he whispered into her ear, causing a shiver of desire to run down her spine. She loved him so much and couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d ever fought her attraction to him. He brought his lips back down to hers and her stomach was quivering with desire. She couldn\u2019t imagine ever getting tired of his body pressed up tightly to hers. He spun her around the floor and she noticed other couples had joined them.</p><p>She looked at Jasmine, who was wrapped tightly in Derek\u2019s arms. The two of them looked like newlywed\u2019s themselves, as he was spinning her around. She let out a giggle of delight at something he said and then blushed red and looked around. The two women\u2019s eyes met and they shared a moment of pure delight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to cut the cake,\u201d someone said and Drew led her over to a table that had a huge four-tiered cake with a waterfall cascading down from its layers. He sliced a piece off and gently fed it to her, even though the crowd was calling for them to get a little messier. He took the small piece of cake from her delicate fingers, then sucked her finger into his mouth to lick away the frosting.</p><p>She felt the pull of his lips deep inside her stomach and a shiver of desire raced through her. She watched Drew\u2019s eyes narrow in passion and wanted nothing more than to get into a room alone with him. She didn\u2019t even care where it was but she wanted her husband badly. He started to pull her away, when Ryan grabbed his arm.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast there Romeo, it\u2019s time for your toasts,\u201d he said with a knowing smile. Drew growled at him but Ryan just laughed and took Trinity\u2019s arms. She looked back longingly at her husband. Ryan and Derek said their toasts, which brought more tears to her eyes. Since Drew wasn\u2019t able to drag her away, he pulled her back onto the dance floor and continued with the foreplay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pretty soon Jasmine came up to her and pulled her off to change. The two women made quick work of changing clothes and Trinity was delighted with the short summer dress Jasmine picked out. She felt delicate and beautiful and was grateful because in a few short months her body would be changing once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant again,\u201d she finally burst out, no longer being able to contain the secret. Jasmine squeaked with delight, before throwing her arms around her best friend.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, that\u2019s so great because I just found out I am too. We\u2019re going to do this together this time,\u201d she said. Trinity let out her own squeal, as the two women hugged. The only thing more perfect than her special day and having Drew as her husband, was going through her pregnancy with Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told Drew yet so you can\u2019t say anything,\u201d Trinity said as she looked around.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told Derek yet either, so we\u2019d both better do it tonight because you know we aren\u2019t going to be able to contain ourselves very long,\u201d Jasmine said. The girls giggled again because they knew that was true.</p><p>They walked out of the room and neither of them noticed the looks on their husband\u2019s faces. The men were so enamored with their wives it was simply breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I could be this happy,\u201d Drew said, as he watched the two women walk forward.</p><p>\u201cTrust me cousin, I know what you mean,\u201d Derek said. He had his own plans for his beautiful wife that night.</p><p>The men split apart as they took their women into their arms. Drew headed towards the awaiting car out front. The guests threw birdseed, as they raced inside the vehicle. Trinity was laughing as they collapsed into the backseat and instantly embraced.</p> <p>\u201cI have one final surprise for you,\u201d Drew told her between kisses.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything else,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking a three day honeymoon. I wanted it to be longer but I know neither of us could stand to be away from Stephanie too long,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well,\u201d she said, as she continued kissing him. She wanted to strip him naked right there but was well aware they weren\u2019t alone. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not too far,\u201d she finished, which caused him to growl even more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, woman,\u201d he said as he ran his hand up her thigh. She\u2019d have to say he was the one causing the torture.</p><p>They arrived at his jet and quickly slipped inside. He didn\u2019t want to sit in the seats at all. He wanted nothing more than to take her into the bedroom and show her how much she meant to him.</p> <p>\u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d she said as they buckled up for takeoff.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. His hand was rubbing up and down her thigh, going higher with each pass he made.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to have another baby,\u201d she blurted out. His hand stilled as he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, as his eyes widened. She nodded her head yes and suddenly he was throwing off his seat belt and kneeling in front of her. His head lay down against her still flat stomach and she felt a tear slip from her eye. He was holding her tightly against him and she could not believe what an amazing man he was.</p><p>\u201cYou need to buckle back up, we are moving,\u201d she told him. He reluctantly got back into his seat and buckled just as the jet started lifting into the air. He couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her, though. The second the pilots told them they could remove their seatbelts; Drew threw his off and pulled her from her seat. He lifted her into his arms and carried her to the large room.</p><p>He gently laid her down on the bed and lifted her shirt away so he could caress her stomach. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to get to watch you grow from the very beginning. I hate how much I missed out on with Stephanie,\u201d he said. She felt so guilty she\u2019d taken that time from him and was glad he\u2019d get to be with her this time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Drew,\u201d she said, truly meaning it.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry about, I can admit I was narrow minded and you had every right to not be trustful,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cI just hate how much time we lost,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMe too, Love. But, what matters now is we have forever, from this moment on,\u201d he said with full sincerity.</p><p>They started kissing again and all thoughts were erased from their minds as passion quickly took over. It didn\u2019t matter how many times she made love to him, it was more exciting each time. They fell into an exhausted sleep and neither woke until the captain told them it was time to buckle up, again.</p><p>Trinity got into her seat and gasped in delight as she realized where they were going. The jet turned in a large circle and landed on the small strip, with no extra room to spare.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you brought us back here, you\u2019re such a romantic, Mr. Titan,\u201d she said with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure we leave together this time,\u201d he told her with a smile. They quickly headed to the resort and up to the suite where their story had begun but this time it would end with a much happier ever-after. </p> </body></html>"]
