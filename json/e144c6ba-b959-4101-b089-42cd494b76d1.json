As Master of the Guild of Nighthawks\u2014thief-catchers and trackers\u2014he\u2019d spent the last week hunting for leads on the mysterious revolutionary leader, Mercury, whose humanist movement was plaguing London.</p> <p>And now he\u2019d found one.</p><p>No mention of the name Mercury, but Lynch\u2019s instincts were on fire at the rumor of a shipment that was due to be smuggled out of the steamy enclaves on the edges of the city\u2014a particular shipment that was received every month at this time, though his informant hadn\u2019t known what it was.</p><p>Easy enough to guess. The enclaves were both jail and factory, where the mechs within were forced to work steel in repayment for their mechanical limbs. This particular enclave was responsible for manufacturing mech parts for the automaton army that protected the aristocratic Echelon.</p><p>In the distance, chimneys lurked in the smog like little watchtowers. A foghorn echoed mournfully as the boat slowly traversed the Thames. The world seemed unnaturally silent beneath its ethereal blanket, but for the faint whisper of movement in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d someone murmured in the alley below him. \u201cIs that them? Someone give \u2019em the signal.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch\u2019s head snapped up.</p><p>Tendrils of fog eddied around a man on the other rooftop, licking at his legs and cloak\u2014Garrett. Making a sharp gesture with his fingers, Lynch silently directed his lieutenant. There were four other shapes in the dark, but he couldn\u2019t see them, only hear a faint scraping sound that whispered on the tiles through his aural communicator. Made of fine brass pieces and leather, it fit in his ear perfectly, a transmitter receiving every whisper that Garrett made. Garrett\u2019s matching piece could relay his commands no matter where they both were.</p><p>The sound of iron scraping over cobbles echoed in the still night. Someone hissed a warning and the sound cut off. Lynch leaned forward, cocking his head to listen.</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d This was a voice of command, cool and low. \u201cD\u2019you want the world to \u2019ear us? Remember, the friggin\u2019 bleeders can \u2019ear for miles.\u201d</p><p>Definitely humanists.</p><p>Lynch crouched low on the edge of the tiled roof, his heart fluttering in his chest with anticipation. Darkness swallowed him as he leaned over the edge, his eyes picking out his prey immediately. One of the benefits of the craving virus that afflicted him was superior senses. A blue blood could see on the darkest of nights and hear the faintest whisper, though that barely made up for the fierce hunger he could never quite assuage, the unrelenting craving for blood...</p> <p>A trio of cloaked figures hovered in the alley, a phosphorescent flare stick shielded by one of their cloaks. One was a tall man, with broad shoulders beneath the concealing cloak and pockmarked cheeks. He knelt and dragged a heavy crate out of the open sewer grate in the cobbles.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s eyes narrowed. There were men within the sewers, but he couldn\u2019t tell if they were from the enclaves or more of this mysterious group.</p><p>Holding up a hand to counteract his previous command, Lynch melted back into the shadows to listen. If the mechs were using the nearby sewer systems to smuggle metalwork out of the enclaves, then the prince consort needed to know.</p><p>A month ago, the humanists had tried to bomb the Ivory Tower, the seat of the Echelon\u2019s power. The handling of the bombing had been a disaster, with half the aristocratic Echelon trampling through his evidence and only one witness, who sullenly refused to talk, in custody. The only piece of evidence Lynch had was in his pocket: a piece of leather that had torn from a woman\u2019s cloak in one of the antechambers. A humanist, he suspected, and one involved in the bombing. The scent of her was long faded from the worn leather, but if he closed his eyes, he knew he could bring her scent to mind. It filled him, branding his memory as if he could never escape her.</p><p>Maybe she would be below? His blood fired at the thought. He wanted to find her\u2014he needed to. Though sometimes, in the dark of night, he wondered if his reasons for this madness were the same as the prince consort\u2019s.</p><p>Swallowing hard, Lynch forced the thought of the mysterious woman from his mind. He had a job to do.</p><p>What could the humanists be doing here? Were they after explosives? Or maybe a weapon to counteract the heavily armored metal automatons that patrolled the streets?</p><p>He needed to get his hands on that crate.</p> <p>\u201cHurry,\u201d the leader snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re already behind schedule.\u201d</p><p>A man grunted. \u201c\u2019S bloody heavy, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteel often is,\u201d came the reply.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d someone hissed.</p><p>Silence fell. Lynch faded back against the brickwork of a chimney.</p><p>\u201cThought I saw somethin\u2019 movin\u2019,\u201d the same person murmured. \u201cUp there. On the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNighthawks?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Urry it up,\u201d the leader snapped. \u201cWe need to move. Now.\u201d</p><p>Lynch scowled as one of the Nighthawks darted between chimneys. Too late. They\u2019d been seen.</p><p>Lynch stepped onto the incline of the roof and rode it to the edge, leaping out over nothingness. He saw Garrett and the others moving at the edge of his vision, then he landed in the swirling fog that clung to the cobbles below, his knees bending to absorb the shock.</p><p>A man in a rough jerkin, with shoulders the size of a pugilist\u2019s, staggered to a halt in front of him, his mouth gaping in shock and both of his arms missing from the elbows down. He wore instead the heavy hydraulic arms of a mech, the work crude and rudimentary, without even the synthetic flesh the Echelon\u2019s master smiths could create. Enclave work.</p><p>\u201cNighthawks!\u201d the man bellowed, the hydraulic hoses in his steel arm hissing in the night as he swung a blow at Lynch.</p><p>Grabbing the man by the wrist, Lynch kicked his feet out from under him and drove him onto his face on the cobbles.</p><p>A shadow shifted in the fog. Lynch caught a glimpse of a dark-hooded cloak and a pistol gleaming in the weak, phosphorescent light of a fallen flare stick. \u201cLet \u2019im go,\u201d the leader commanded in a low voice. He thumbed the hammer on his pistol back.</p><p>Lynch could see little of his opponent beyond the cloak and a gaping blackness where his face should have been. A black satin mask covered his entire face and throat, leaving not an inch of skin visible. And he suddenly knew.</p><p>\u201cMercury,\u201d he said, staring down the barrel of the pistol. Hungry exhilaration leaped through him, shadows sweeping through his vision as the hunger of the craving momentarily overtook him. The bastard was right in front of him.</p><p>He heard the click a moment before the gun barrel coughed.</p><p>Lynch flung himself into a roll as the gun retorted with a hollow thunk. A Nighthawk appeared behind him and stiffened, a tiny blue-feathered dart sticking out of his chest. Lewis Hicks, one of the novices. He staggered forward, gave a little sigh, then crumpled at Lynch\u2019s feet.</p><p>Hicks\u2019s eyes remained open and he trembled on the cobbles, rigid as a board, momentarily paralyzed.</p><p>Lynch looked up. The new hemlock darts the humanists were using to bring down blue bloods made him wary. The poison paralyzed a blue blood for a good five to ten minutes, leaving them at the human\u2019s mercy. As a predator, the sudden sense of vulnerability unnerved him.</p><p>Mercury\u2019s shoulders stiffened but he wasted no breath. Instead, he turned and bolted down the alley, his cloak swirling the remnants of the fog and his shadow lengthening.</p><p>\u201cScatter!\u201d someone yelled.</p><p>Men poured out of the sewers, scrambling past the Nighthawks. Garrett had a man shoved up against a wall and slapped cuffs on him. The humanists fled like mice, darting down alleys. There weren\u2019t enough Nighthawks to catch them all, but Lynch only needed one. Oh yes. Cut off the head of the snake and you had them all.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine,\u201d he snapped to Garrett, leaving his lieutenant with the rest of them. Sprinting down the alley, he swiftly gained on the revolutionary, making a snatch at the man\u2019s cloak. It tugged for a moment and Mercury spun with a vicious left hook that smashed Lynch across the face. Pain slashed through his cheekbone, leaving his vision white for a second. There must have been something in the revolutionary\u2019s hand. Brass knuckles perhaps.</p><p>Whirling, Mercury tore free of the cloak and bolted, leaving Lynch with a handful of fabric and the elusive scent of gunpowder.</p><p>Curse it. Lynch started after him with deadly focus.</p><p>The alleyway was running out, the stone walls that surrounded the enclaves rearing up into the night. Lynch slowed to a halt as Mercury spun, staring at him through the thin gauze of his eye slits.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer,\u201d the revolutionary leader warned, lifting the pistol again.</p><p>\u201cThe problem with the new make of recoil dart gun is that it requires manual reloading. You appear to be out of darts. Or you would have used it on me already.\u201d He had no doubt of that.</p><p>Mercury\u2019s chin tipped up as the pistol lowered. \u201cThat don\u2019t make me no less dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Lynch rubbed at his jaw and the bruise that was no doubt starting to form. \u201cI never expected it to. What did you hit me with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA love tap, milord.\u201d The words were laced with sarcasm. \u201cCome closer and I\u2019ll give you another.\u201d</p><p>They stared across the expanse of cobbles. Lynch frowned at his enemy\u2019s choice of words, something about the situation stirring unease through his gut. Behind him came shouts. He sensed Mercury\u2019s attention shift over Lynch\u2019s shoulder and then the revolutionary took a hesitant step backward, hitting the wall.</p><p>\u201cNowhere to run,\u201d Lynch said softly. \u201cNowhere to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always somewhere to run. Au revoir, sir.\u201d Tossing the steam pistol aside, Mercury whipped a heavier gun from the belt at his hip, with a sharp four-pronged hook at the end of it.</p><p>For a moment, Lynch thought the revolutionary was going to fire it at him, but then he pointed it into the sky above and pulled the trigger.</p><p>The grappling hook soared into the darkness with a hiss of rope trailing behind it. Metal clamored on stone far above, then the revolutionary jerked on the rope. It held and he pressed something on the side of the grappling gun.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d Lynch snapped, leaping forward.</p><p>His fingers grazed the toe of Mercury\u2019s boot as the revolutionary sailed into the air. Laughter rang down through the darkness, thick with huskiness. Lynch snarled and slapped a palm against the stone. He\u2019d had him. In the bloody palm of his hand and he\u2019d lost him.</p><p>Looking up, he bared his teeth. It was risky for a blue blood to enter the enclaves. Recent mech riots had seen dozens of mechs trampled in the streets by the metal Trojan cavalry. There was no love lost for a blue blood\u2014or a craver, as the mechs called them.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. He was dangerous too. And he\u2019d spent over a year hunting the bastard, only to have Mercury slip through his fingers. The prince consort\u2019s warning rang dire in his ears. Bring me his head. Or share his fate.</p><p>Not bloody likely. Looking around, Lynch shoved his boot into a crack between the stones in the wall and hauled himself up through sheer strength, biceps straining.</p><p>It was the last thing Mercury would expect.</p><p>Steam hissed as the enormous piston rolled through its rotation. The woman known as Mercury hurried past, her breath hot and moist against the silk mask over her face and her eyes darting.</p><p>Here in the enclaves, hot orange light lit the steel beams of the work sheds and enormous furnaces. The place was riddled with underground tunnels where the workers lived, but aboveground, the work sheds dominated. It wasn\u2019t quite a jail\u2014mechs earned a half day off a fortnight\u2014but it was close.</p><p>Metal ingots glowed cherry red and the air was thick with the smell of coal. Men worked even at night to keep the furnaces hot, silent shadows against the shimmering heat waves. Rosalind slipped past a mech in a pitted leather apron as he shoveled coal into the open mouth of a furnace, the blast of heat leaving a light sheen of perspiration on her skin. Droplets of sweat slid beneath her breasts and wet the insides of her right glove. She couldn\u2019t feel the left. Only a phantom ache where the limb used to be and where steel now stood.</p><p>Damn it. Rosalind tossed aside the spring-recoil grappling gun and started tugging at her right glove. Her heart wouldn\u2019t stop rabbiting in her chest, her body moving with a liquid anticipation she knew well. Foolish to relish such anticipation, but the danger, the edge of her nerves, were a drug she\u2019d long been denied.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe her bad luck. The Nighthawk himself, in the flesh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A man of shadow and myth. Rosalind hadn\u2019t gotten a good look at his face in the darkness, but the intensity of his expression was unmistakable and she\u2019d felt the heavy caress of his gaze like a touch upon the skin. Her most formidable opponent, a man dedicated to capturing her and destroying the humanists. The shock of his arrival had thrown her, and Rosalind wasn\u2019t a woman who was surprised very often.</p><p>She slipped between rows of fan belts with heavy metal automaton limbs on them. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. She\u2019d known it was risky, making this one last trip, but she didn\u2019t have any choice. Martial law had choked the city ever since the bombing of the Ivory Tower and she needed the parts the mechs had promised her.</p><p>The bombing had been a mighty blow for the aristocratic Echelon. Every major blue blood lord in the land, including the prince consort and his human queen had been gathered. If the attack had succeeded, it would have wiped out nearly all of the parasitic blue bloods, leaving the working classes\u2014the humans\u2014to cast off the yoke of slavery and servitude. No more blood taxes or blood slaves. No more armies of metaljacket automatons to keep them suppressed.</p> <p>A bold plan.</p><p>If it had succeeded.</p><p>For a moment Rosalind almost wished she\u2019d thought of it, but the group of mechs she\u2019d rescued from the steamy enclaves to work steel for her a year ago had gone behind her back. For the past six months, she\u2019d urged for patience while the mechs had whispered that she was too soft, not merciless enough to lead the humanist movement. In the end, they\u2019d taken matters into their own hands. Rosalind tried to stop the bombing attempt before it was too late, to try and save her younger brother, Jeremy. Instead, the mechanists had used him, seducing him with grand stories and sending him to deliver the bomb himself.</p><p>It had been a catastrophe. The Echelon now understood the threat the humanists posed. Rosalind had been forced to scatter those still under her command as martial law settled its heavy weight over the city and the Echelon put a bounty on their heads. She and her older brother, Jack, had gone into hiding while they tried desperately to discover any word of Jeremy.</p><p>Of the mechanists who\u2019d betrayed her and the rest of the movement, there was no sign. All she had left of them was the rancid taste of guilt in her mouth. She knew Jeremy had been fond of their leader, Mendici, and his brother, Mordecai, but she hadn\u2019t stopped the hero worship. She\u2019d been too busy with the cause and her own personal project to see what was happening within her family.</p> <p>Steel screamed as it rang against stone. Rosalind spun on her heel and looked around, fists clenched protectively in front of her. Her gaze raked the shadows. He wouldn\u2019t have followed her here, would he? The enclaves were dangerous for a creature of his ilk.</p><p>Nothing but stillness greeted her questioning gaze. Sparks sprayed in the distance from a steam-driven welding rig, but there was no one in sight.</p><p>Didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Easing a foot behind her, she stepped back slowly, watching the shadows. The feeling of danger was a familiar one. She\u2019d been a child spy, an assassin, and years of such work had taught her when she was being watched and when she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re clever,\u201d a cool voice said behind her.</p><p>Rosalind spun with her fist raised. The Nighthawk caught her arm in a brutal grip, barely flinching at the blow.</p> <p>\u201cBut I expected that,\u201d he murmured, looking down at her from his great height. His fingers locked on her right arm in a cruel grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d return the compliment,\u201d she snapped breathlessly, forcing her voice lower. Where the hell had he come from? \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it very clever for a man like you to \u2019ave ventured \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>She jerked against his grip but it was immoveable. Harsh red light lit his face, highlighting the stark slash of his brows and his hawkish nose. He looked like the Devil\u2019s own, his lips hard and cruel and his eyes glaring straight through her. A hard black leather carapace protected his chest\u2014the body armor of the Guild of Nighthawks.</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know I could kill any number of mechs if they come running.\u201d His voice was soft, she noticed, a low, gravelly pitch that one strained to listen to nonetheless. He\u2019d be someone who didn\u2019t bother to raise it often. Someone who expected his word to be obeyed and wasn\u2019t often disappointed.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she agreed, curling her middle finger and twisting the tip of it. The thin, six-inch blade concealed in the knuckle at the base of her hand slid through the glove silently, one of the many enhancements to the joint she\u2019d received. Punch a man like this and she could skewer him. \u201cBut I weren\u2019t speakin\u2019 o\u2019 them. This is my world, not yours.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind stabbed hard, stepping forward with her body to give strength to the thrust. Lynch caught her wrist, jerking to the side so that the blade skittered across his ribs and not through them. Shoving away from her, his fingers came away from his side sticky with black blood. In daylight, there would be a faint bluish-red tinge to it\u2014the color gave the blue bloods their name.</p><p>He looked up, his pale eyes burning with intensity and the promise of revenge. The blood in Rosalind\u2019s veins turned cold at the sight and she snatched the knife from her boot, feeling its familiar weight in her right hand.</p><p>Lynch sucked in a sharp breath and looked away from his bloodied fingers. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very wise.\u201d</p> <p>Shadows moved. Rosalind shifted, striking up with the knife to where she thought he would come at her. A hand caught hers, thumb digging into the nerve that ran along her thumb.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she swore, as the knife dropped from her suddenly useless hand. She knew a hundred ways to disarm a man. But her arm was yanked hard behind her, and as the Nighthawk spun her, shoving her face-first against a brick wall, she realized none of them would matter. For he knew them too.</p><p>His strength terrified her, even as it exhilarated. Here was a match, she thought with a shiver. An enemy she just might not be able to vanquish.</p><p>Shoving her between the shoulder blades, he jerked her arm up behind her back. Black spots appeared in her vision, but she didn\u2019t cry out. Instead, she relaxed into it, the pain slowly softening, much like digging a thumb into a hard knot of muscle. She knew pain; it was an old friend and she\u2019d faced far worse than this in her time. Pain didn\u2019t scare her. No, indeed, she welcomed it. The physical ache was something that she could fight, unlike the gut-wrenching, hopeless fear that assailed her whenever she thought of her missing brother.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s firm body pressed against her, one knee driving into the back of hers. There was nowhere to move, nowhere to go. He had trapped her quite neatly. But then, she had a surprise up her sleeve, one last ace to play.</p><p>Lynch paused. Then he caught her wrist and peeled her mech hand off the wall, examining it. The useless fingers splayed wide as he touched a pressure point in the steel tendons, turning it this way and that. Hatred burned within her.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019m a mech.\u201d</p><p>His thumb ran over the shiv where it erupted through the glove, revealing just a hint of the gleaming steel of her hand. She hadn\u2019t bothered with the synthetic flesh some used to conceal their enhancements. They were never real enough, never the right color or consistency. And she didn\u2019t want to conform to the Echelon\u2019s demands. Damn them. She was human enough, with all the rights a human should have, no matter what they said about mechs.</p><p>Lynch found the catching mechanism and the blade slid back within the steel. \u201cVery clever, lad. No wonder you hit like Molineaux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go and I\u2019ll give you another.\u201d</p><p>Silence hung between them. Then Lynch laughed, a short, barking cough of amusement that sounded as if it had been a long time since he\u2019d found anything remotely amusing.</p><p>The laughter died as swiftly as it had appeared. His pressure on her arm relaxed, and Rosalind slumped against the brickwork as her injured shoulder protested.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt you would.\u201d Grabbing a handful of her coat, he spun her around, one fist clenching the shirt at her throat. \u201cAnd perhaps you\u2019d overwhelm me eventually, but I don\u2019t care to test the theory. You\u2019re bound for Chancery Lane.\u201d</p><p>The Nighthawk Guild Quarters. Once there, she\u2019d never see the light of day again. Except for a brief view of it on her way to the scaffold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea,\u201d she said recklessly. The ace up her sleeve... \u201cYou and I...we could come at some sort o\u2019 arrangement.\u201d</p><p>Those cold gray eyes met hers. She could see them more clearly now that her sight had adjusted to the hellish red glow, but her perception hadn\u2019t altered. Lynch would give his mother to the law if she broke it.</p><p>There was always a way to manipulate a man though. Even Lynch had to want something, to desire it...She just had to work out what it was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to bribe the wrong man,\u201d he said coldly, shoving her arms out wide.</p><p>A cool, impersonal hand ran along each arm, under her armpits and lower, to her hips. His hard fingers found the small pouches attached to her belt\u2014powders and poisons that specifically injured a blue blood. Their eyes met and Lynch jerked hard on her belt buckle. The belt slithered through the belt loops on her breeches with a leathery slap, and Rosalind sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cEvery man can be bribed,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is it you want, Lynch? Money? Power?\u201d She saw the contemptuous answer in his eyes as he discarded her belt with a jerking toss.</p><p>\u201cNothing you can give me. If you move your hands, I\u2019ll break them. Even the steel one.\u201d</p><p>With that, he knelt, sliding his hands down the inside of her legs. His palms were cool and impersonal, but Rosalind jerked at the touch. No man since her husband had touched her there and the feeling unnerved her.</p><p>There was another knife in her boot. He took it, tucking it behind his own belt as he started the return journey. Smooth hands slid behind her knees, the pressure just firm enough to make her breath catch. Higher...higher...then shying away just before he cupped her arse.</p><p>\u201cYou missed somewhat,\u201d Rosalind forced herself to say as he straightened. To escape, she would have to outwit him and for that she needed his senses dulled.</p><p>His fingers lingered on her hip. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Igher,\u201d she whispered, tilting her head back to look at him. The smooth leather of his gloves slid over the rough linen of her shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s me greatest asset.\u201d</p><p>His thumb splayed over her ribs, beneath her breast. So close. Though she\u2019d wanted to keep her sex a secret, men often underestimated a woman or were fooled by the flirtatious bat of her eyelashes. She had nothing but contempt for those who\u2019d fallen to her knife for that mistake.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Igher,\u201d she dared him. Her stomach twisted in anticipation, unexpected heat spearing lower, between her thighs. Rosalind licked dry lips. Don\u2019t think about what he is. Use him; use your body.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s hand slid over the faint, unmistakable curve of her breast, his eyes widening. They were tightly bound, so as not to interfere with her movement, but he was a man. He knew what it meant.</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d He yanked his hand back as if burned. His eyes narrowed, but she could see thought racing behind them. \u201cYou! You were in the tower. With the bomb.\u201d</p><p>One hand curved around her skull and he grabbed a fistful of her hair. Rosalind snatched at his cloak as he dragged her head back, exposing her throat.</p><p>Stubble rasped against her cheek and Rosalind\u2019s gut turned to ash as his jaw brushed against the smooth skin just below her ear. No! She flailed wildly, her iron fingers wrapping around his wrist, knowing even as she grabbed him that she couldn\u2019t stop him. Not if he wanted her blood.</p><p>\u201cYou are her,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>And she realized that he was inhaling her scent.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going for the vein after all. Rosalind\u2019s body trembled as it relaxed, her stomach quivering. Lord have mercy. She was safe from that particular violation.</p><p>Then her mind started racing. \u201cWho?\u201d How had he known that she was in the Ivory Tower the day the mechs had bombed it? The day the Duke of Lannister had died? Did he suspect her hand in that?</p><p>Lynch lifted his head, his hand cradling her skull. She saw his eyes and stilled. Dangerous.</p><p>He dragged a scrap of leather from his pocket and held it between two fingers. \u201cYou left this behind. I could smell you all over the leather. You, two other people\u2014and gunpowder.\u201d</p><p>A perfectly innocuous piece of leather, its absence barely noticed. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been carryin\u2019 it around all this time? How touchin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case I forget the scent.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind stared into his eyes, her mind making one of those insane leaps of intuition it sometimes did. Lynch wanted her. His own personal obsession, she realized.

This was his weakness, right here. \u201cAin\u2019t there nothin\u2019 I can bribe you with now?\u201d</p><p>He understood her meaning, his pupils flaring as he jerked away from her. Rosalind tumbled against the bricks, her hand splayed to catch herself. If she were a lesser woman, she might have known some prick to her conscience at the rapid rejection. But she\u2019d searched his eyes as she said the words; this wasn\u2019t repulsion. For a moment, interest had flared there.</p><p>\u201cYou shot the Duke of Lannister and tried to blow up the court. If you think I\u2019ll make any sort of arrangement with you, you\u2019re a fool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shot the duke,\u201d she admitted. \u201cA woundin\u2019 blow only. \u2019E was tryin\u2019 to strangle an acquaintance of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deny being behind the bombing attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you take me for a fool?\u201d</p><p>She dared to take a step toward him. \u201cIf I thought it would \u2019ave worked, then I would \u2019ave led the action, but this were no plan of mine.\u201d No, she\u2019d gone to find Jeremy.</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d Lynch loomed closer, his nostrils flaring. \u201cThen what were you doing tonight? Just what are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d She looked up through the gauze of her mask\u2019s eye slits.</p><p>Lynch caught her chin, his finger stroking over the black satin. His thumb slipped beneath the edge of the mask, lifting it over her mouth and higher. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand caught his. \u201cNo.\u201d Rosalind took a chance and darted her tongue out, licking the edge of his thumb.</p><p>Lynch jerked his hand back, heat smoldering in his gaze. \u201cYou disappoint me. Nothing you say or do will change my mind. You\u2019re under arrest, petticoats or not.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her wrist and she twisted, capturing his own. The tendons in his arm tensed, but Rosalind slowly brought his hand up, keeping her gaze locked on his the whole time. She pressed the palm of his hand against her cheek, turning her lips into it. Lynch returned her stare with cool disinterest, but the pulse in his throat had quickened.</p> <p>Rosalind licked his palm, tracing her tongue slowly across the seam there. \u201cDon\u2019t it excite you?\u201d His gaze flickered to hers and she stepped closer, turning his hand over to trace her lips against the tender flesh between the back of his fingers. \u201cYou,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMe. Two enemies finally come together.\u201d Palm out, she pressed her other hand flatly against the rippled abdomen of his body armor and flexed her fingers. The leather was polished with age and use. Impossibly smooth. Like his skin.</p><p>The thought took her by surprise. In all her years, she\u2019d only ever felt such a curiosity stirring within her once, and that had been for her husband, a man she admired and respected. Lynch was worthy of neither in her eyes.</p><p>Or was he?</p><p>She\u2019d learned enough about him in recent months. Testing his weaknesses, discovering what type of man he was\u2014what type of enemy she faced. The answer made her nervous. Cold and implacable, people whispered. Ruthless. Even the Echelon called him Sir Iron Heart, but never to his face.</p><p>The man in front of her was hard. She could sense that innately. But the look in his eyes...Oh no, that was not cold. Not cold at all.</p><p>\u201cAll these months you\u2019ve been chasin\u2019 me, Lynch.\u201d The words were a caress, but her mind raced. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve caught me. Ain\u2019t you curious? Don\u2019t you want just a little taste before you turn me over to the prince consort?\u201d</p><p>Her own trembling thoughts used against him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His head tilted toward her, his breath coming harshly.</p> <p>Excitement thrilled through her. Anticipation. It was the only time she ever truly felt alive these days. As if she\u2019d been sleepwalking for so long, Lynch\u2019s presence was like an icy dash of water to her face. Sliding her hand over each ripple of leather, Rosalind let her fingers pause on the edge of his belt and looked up, beneath her lashes. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Furious color flushed the stark edges of his cheekbones. Lynch glared down at her, but the cool disinterest in his eyes had burned away. The blackness of his pupils overwhelmed his irises until she stared into a demon\u2019s eyes, his rational thoughts obliterated by hunger, by desire.</p><p>She had him.</p><p>Rosalind lifted onto her toes, sliding her iron fingers through the inky black strands of his hair. Her lashes half lowering, she dragged his head down with a fistful of his hair and guided his mouth to hers.</p><p>She\u2019d kissed men in the line of duty, seduced them with a flirtatious smile that barely touched the cold, hard ball of emotion within her. It had never meant anything to her. Yet she trembled now, her hand stroking the hard, leather-clad body, feeling the buttery soft texture of his armor beneath her gloves. Her words hadn\u2019t only seduced him\u2014she felt the truth of them herself. The excitement of something forbidden.</p><p>His cool breath brushed against her sensitive lips as they caressed her own. Lynch resisted. \u201cTake off your mask,\u201d he said hoarsely, his own fingers stroking the trembling flesh of her jaw.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She could feel his body leaning away from her as he fought for his senses. In desperation, she reached up and opened her mouth over his.</p><p>A shudder swept through the massive frame enveloping hers. He stiffened in shock and she drank of his mouth, her tongue caressing his with a dare and her hands sliding lower. That hard body melted against her and she felt the moment he stopped fighting his inclinations. Hands cupped her face and he kissed her as if he were a desperate man, passion rising up within him so swiftly that it shocked her. She tasted loneliness in his hunger, and something flared to life within her, something foreign and dangerous. A yearning that ached like a fist in her stomach, an echo.</p><p>Rosalind turned her face, gasping into his hair as she sought to pull herself back from that. The moment she could breathe the sensation lessened, but she didn\u2019t immediately kiss him again.</p><p>His hand cupped her nape and he grabbed a fistful of hair, dragging her head back. Cool lips slid over her chin and lower, across her throat. Rosalind clutched his shoulder, wary of her vulnerability but it didn\u2019t return. If she concentrated on the feel of him, on each delicate sensation as he licked at her throat, then she could manage to hold on to herself.</p><p>A blue blood. But he felt like a man beneath her questing hands, and he tasted like one as he returned to her lips, his breath sweet with his evening wine. The kiss deepened, his tongue forcing her lips apart, taking no prisoners. Hungry. Her body ached, the throb between her legs so long denied. Eight long years since Nathaniel died, and she\u2019d never once regretted not taking a lover. Never found a man who even tempted her. But danger was its own addiction and a part of her thrilled at the man in her arms. The Nighthawk. Her dearest enemy. A shadowy entity she\u2019d taken great pleasure in thwarting for the past six months.</p><p>A man she was about to thwart again.</p><p>Her back hit the brick wall. Lynch\u2019s mouth slid up her throat and claimed her lips again. She barely had time to snatch a breath or even a fistful of his shirt before his tongue rasped over her teeth. A thousand impressions leeched into her; the chafe of her nipples against the linen that bound them; the taste of his mouth; the drugging scent of him; and the gravely rasp of his knuckles on the brick as he caught her beneath the arse and dragged her legs around his hips.</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s nails curled into his shoulders, padded only by the single glove she wore. Sweet lord... She was losing herself again... She kissed him, biting at his mouth, drawing his lip between her teeth and nibbling on it. It would be so easy to forget herself, to let herself surrender until she was lost...</p><p>No.</p><p>Hands caught her own, pinned them to the wall. But she needed them free and she fought him.</p><p>Her head spun. \u201cLet me\u2014let me touch you. I want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>The words stilled the violence of his passion. Rosalind bit her lip, catching a glimpse of those dark eyes. She wasn\u2019t the only one fighting this attraction. And if she let him go\u2014for just a second\u2014then she\u2019d lose him.</p><p>Never. Rosalind surrendered, rocking her hips against his, feeling the hard steel of his erection between her thighs. She let her body ride against his, her hands sliding over his shoulders and luring him closer as she threw her head back and gasped.</p><p>Lynch slammed one hand against the wall beside her head, shuddering. \u201cCurse you,\u201d he whispered. Then his mouth bit at hers hungrily and he was lost in her again.</p><p>Rosalind slid her hands over the corded muscle of his throat, linking them behind his neck. It was a simple matter to tug the glove from her mech hand. Dropping it carelessly, she groaned into his mouth as his hand slid over her arse, tugging her against him hard.</p><p>A twist of the knuckle on her mech ring finger and a sharp needle slid from the interior. Rosalind tasted his breath and realized that she was stalling. She slid her hands over his shoulder, the rasp of his stubble scraping her jaw.</p><p>Just another moment.</p><p>One more...</p><p>Her hips rode his and she threw her head back, eyes glazed with passion. \u201cI almost wish...\u201d she gasped, \u201cthat I didn\u2019t \u2019ave to do this.\u201d</p><p>Then she slid the needle into his neck and injected the hemlock straight into his body.</p><p>Lynch stiffened, spasms racking him. \u201cNo.\u201d Slumping against her, he clawed at the wall to hold himself up, his knees giving way.</p><p>Rosalind landed lightly on her feet, the hard body pinning her to the wall. It was a good thing, for she wasn\u2019t sure her own knees would support her right now. She caught Lynch under the arms as he gurgled something in his throat. Words she probably didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>Laying him on the ground, she stepped back, capping the needle neatly within her metal finger and twisting the knuckle back into place. A sensation almost like guilt licked at her.</p><p>A stupid thought. A dangerous one. Sentiment had no part in her world. Nor emotion. Either could get her killed in an instant.</p><p>Her knives were tucked behind his belt. Lynch\u2019s gaze locked on hers and she realized what he was thinking.</p><p>Cut his throat now and there\u2019d be no more Nighthawks on her trail, no more martial law. This would be a devastating blow to the Echelon that they might not recover from.</p><p>Her fingers slid over the knife hilt as she took it, familiarity molding it into her hand. Rosalind\u2019s fingers clenched unconsciously as she stared at him. It wouldn\u2019t be the first blue blood she\u2019d ever killed.</p><p>Come on, my little falcon. Do it. You are what you are, after all. What\u2019s one more death?</p><p>She could almost hear Balfour whispering in her ear. Lust died a quick death and bile rose in her throat. No. She wasn\u2019t his to command. Not anymore. She\u2019d freed herself the moment she\u2019d cut her hand off.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter. His whisper sickened her. I made you what you are. And you can never escape that...</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. Metal clanged and she realized she\u2019d dropped the knife.</p><p>Lynch twitched, a gurgling snarl in his throat. She couldn\u2019t tear her gaze from his. He knew, she realized. Knew that she couldn\u2019t do it. No, not couldn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Fool. She shook her head and took a step back, her boots crunching on old metal filings on the ground. She\u2019d regret this. Tactically this wasn\u2019t the right choice. All of her training screamed at her to finish the job.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s fingers twitched. How long had he been down for? One minute? Two? The amount of time the hemlock would paralyze him depended on how high his craving virus levels were. If his CV levels were high, then he might begin to regain control of his body before she\u2019d fled the scene. Not a thought to relish, especially with that look in his eyes.</p><p>Rosalind snatched her knife up again and sheathed it in her boot. Sparks sprayed off a welding rig nearby. She crouched low, looking to see if anyone had seen. If they had, then Lynch\u2019s life would be in danger.</p><p>You don\u2019t even have to wield the knife. Just walk away and leave him here. Defenseless.</p><p>One second of hesitation. It would be so easy...but something stopped her. A hitherto unknown sense of mercy. This was the second time in as many months where she\u2019d allowed someone to live whom she probably shouldn\u2019t have. Rosalind cursed under her breath and bent low to grab his wrists. Dragging him behind a boiler, she hid him from sight.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that you were beaten,\u201d she murmured, kneeling beside him. His eyes glittered in the shadows, red furnace light flickering over their dark depths. A promise of vengeance. She nodded slowly, acknowledging it. This\u2014what she had started here tonight\u2014would not end until one of them had the upper hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come...for you...\u201d He could barely speak, but the words sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p>A vow. A deadly promise.</p><p>Anticipation flared as she turned and walked away. The world was bright with color, her body still dancing with energy. Awake. \u201cI\u2019ll watch for you then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch for you then.\u201d</p><p>A hand curled around his shoulder and Lynch jerked awake, the shattered remnants of the dream slipping from his mind as his study came to life around him. Blinking, he looked down at the mess of paperwork he\u2019d been leaning in and the ink that stained his hands. There was crusted blood under his fingernails, where he\u2019d tended the wound in his side. Though it had already healed, courtesy of the blood-craving virus that made him a blue blood, the action had weakened him.</p><p>Garrett stepped back, arching a brow. \u201cYou need to go to bed.\u201d</p> <p>Scraping a hand over his tired face, Lynch shook his head. \u201cI need to find Mercury. The analysis on the crate?\u201d</p><p>With a scowl, Garrett strode across the room and knelt by the fire. He teased the meager coals to life again with the bellows, then added a stick of kindling. \u201cWhere\u2019s Doyle? He should be looking after you better than this.\u201d</p><p>Lynch scraped his chair back from the desk and stood. \u201cHe\u2019s already been in here nursemaiding me. I sent him away. The crate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe steel within appears to be some sort of steam-driven part. A boiler pack, Fitz suspects. Could be used for all manner of machinery.\u201d</p><p>Fitz would know. The young genius had never met an invention that didn\u2019t fascinate him. Lynch\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cUseless then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot quite. I\u2019ve sent Byrnes to the enclaves with some men to inquire of the make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll find nothing,\u201d Lynch stated, turning toward the liquor cabinet. \u201cThe mechs in the enclaves are remarkably closemouthed these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since the prince consort set the Trojan cavalry on them two months ago,\u201d Garrett replied.</p><p>Lynch poured himself a snifter of blood, measuring it carefully. He screwed the lid of the flask back into place. \u201cBe careful where you say such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the guild headquarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no doubt the Council has at least three spies in here.\u201d Lynch lifted the snifter and drained it, the cool blood igniting his senses. His vision swam, painting the world in black and gray for a moment. Slowly he put the glass down. He wanted more; he craved it. And just as certainly wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p> <p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ve got men inside the guild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain of it.\u201d The Council knew too much of his affairs for it to be coincidence. Lynch swiftly changed topics, to one he wanted to pursue. \u201cThere\u2019s been no sign of the woman?\u201d</p><p>Garrett leaned back against the desk, his arms crossed and his gaze neutral. Too neutral. Lynch hadn\u2019t asked how much he had heard through the aural communicator; its range was limited, but Garrett had found him quickly enough to have been in the vicinity.</p><p>\u201cThe men returned. No sign of her. The scent trail ended near Piccadilly Circus. One of those chemical bombs the humanists use to obliterate all scent had been dropped.\u201d</p><p>Clever girl. Lynch\u2019s eyes narrowed. He\u2019d fallen for her ruse like a green schoolboy and the thought rankled. She was out there somewhere, no doubt laughing behind his back. The worst of it was that his men had found him before he\u2019d recovered, lying on his back still partially paralyzed. Garrett had covered for him, sending them after the fleeing revolutionary, but they\u2019d seen enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not quite sure how she gulled you. You\u2019re no pigeon, ripe to be plucked.\u201d Though Garrett\u2019s manner of speech was so precise as to mimic the Echelon, sometimes his base roots showed in his language choice.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d Lynch\u2019s voice was hard and dry. A warning for Garrett to drop the subject.</p><p>The encounter frustrated him. Sex and the female form were distractions he\u2019d long since thought himself invulnerable to. That she\u2019d gotten under his skin so quickly and easily chafed at him.</p> <p>Sex was just another need, another form of hunger, and he thought he\u2019d controlled those needs well. He strictly controlled the amount of blood his body required and bedded a woman when he felt the urge arise. Not once had either need ever overruled him. Until now.</p><p>And all it had taken was that little whisper of sin in his ear, her knuckles stroking down over the leather carapace of his abdomen. He\u2019d barely seen her face, just her lips beneath the edge of the mask as she tempted him with her offer.</p><p>Sensory memory flooded through him: the faint hint of her breast in the cup of his hand, her long legs locking around his hips as she arched against him, the exhale of her breath burning against his lips...</p><p>Damn her. Even now his body stirred and he knew why.</p><p>A body was never enough. He\u2019d seen and slept with some of the most beautiful women the Echelon had to offer and rarely remembered their names. But this one haunted him. A mystery. A challenge. A part of him hungered for the next encounter, longing to take it further. This time he\u2019d have the upper hand and he intended to make full use of it, to pay back every ounce of humiliation on her flesh and leave her gasping for more.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Lynch forced his body to cool. The thoughts were madness\u2014the hunger speaking, his own personal demons. He was the Nighthawk, damn it, and when he got his hands on her, he\u2019d arrest her and hand her over to the Council.</p><p>Case solved.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, Garrett was watching him, entirely too perceptive. Chestnut colored hair swept over his brow, a drawcard for women\u2019s eyes everywhere. Or perhaps that was the smile Garrett flashed at them. He had his uses, despite his weakness for anything in a petticoat. Put him in a room with a woman who refused to say a word, and before five minutes were out, he\u2019d have her signed confession and every intimate detail of her life.</p><p>Garrett knew women inside and out. And he knew when a man had been bested by one.</p><p>\u201cIf you breathe a word of this...\u201d</p><p>A slow, stealthy smile crept over Garrett\u2019s mouth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it, sir.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>The candle guttered in the chill breeze as Rosalind climbed down the ancient stairwell. Once, a long time ago, it had been designed as access from an abandoned surface station to the underground train platform below. Now it was boarded up and long forgotten, except for the timber slats she\u2019d carefully broken and then forged into a slender gap\u2014access to her world, the musty caverns and dark tunnels they called Undertown.</p><p>Water dripped in the distance. The only other sounds were the faint shuffle of her flat-soled boots and the echoing moan of a breeze stirring through the abandoned rail tunnels. Rosalind reached up and dragged the stifling mask over her head. Cool air met her heated skin and she sighed in relief.</p><p>The taste of Lynch lingered. Or perhaps that was the mocking burn of memory, taunting her with what she\u2019d done.</p><p>Or rather, how she\u2019d reacted.</p><p>You liked it.</p><p>A horrible, gut-clenching thought. She\u2019d never cared for men, a deficit she\u2019d thought of as a relief until Nathaniel had come into her life and awakened her to the joyous misery of lust. Her husband had been the brightest light in her life...and the greatest sorrow. If his death had taught her one thing, it was never to betray herself again. Never to let another man close.</p><p>And she\u2019d succeeded. Until now.</p><p>Unclenching her hand around the satin mask, she shoved it into her pocket grimly. Tonight she\u2019d played her game and she\u2019d enjoyed it. It wouldn\u2019t happen again.</p><p>Stepping out onto the platform, she had only a second\u2019s warning before a breath of wind blew the candle out. The sudden darkness obliterated her vision but not her senses. She felt something move, and reacted, shoving her arm up in a block. Twisting her finger, she felt the hiss of vibration as the blade slid through her metal knuckle\u2014</p><p>A hand hit her high in the chest and Rosalind gasped as her lungs emptied. Then she was smashed up against the brick wall, mortar crumbling around her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d a husky voice said in disgust.</p><p>Rosalind tilted her head back as her vision slowly adjusted to the darkness, and panted, trying to ease the vice around her lungs. She pressed her hand a fraction forward. The tip of the blade dug into the hard muscle of abdomen. \u201cAnd you\u2019re gutted.\u201d</p><p>A grunt. Then Ingrid shoved away from her. \u201cWouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>Truth. Rosalind\u2019s face twisted in disgust at herself. A distracted revolutionary was a dead one. She eased the blade back into the mech hand, rubbing her thumb over the polished steel. \u201cYou\u2019re back early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d The dark shadow materializing in the depths of the tunnel was starting to take shape. Ingrid towered over her at nearly six foot, with broad shoulders and shapely hips. She had a warrior\u2019s physique, courtesy of her Nordic ancestry, though she was smaller than many others of her kind. The loupe virus that made verwulfen what they were encouraged growth and muscular development. Or so the scientists said.</p><p>Though Ingrid\u2019s words were harshly spoken, Rosalind heard the gruff, underlying fear. \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d she said, sliding a hand over Ingrid\u2019s forearm. The other woman was almost a sister to her. An overbearing, overprotective sister at times, but Rosalind found she appreciated it. \u201cI had a run-in at the enclaves. The new boiler pack is lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into the Nighthawk.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then Ingrid slowly released a breath. \u201cI hope it was with a sharp knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately not. Come. We need to meet with Jack, find out how his night went.\u201d</p><p>Ingrid followed as Rosalind leaped down onto the train tracks. A rat chattered in the dark and Rosalind smiled as her friend cursed.</p><p>\u201cBloody rats,\u201d Ingrid said in disgust. But she kept close to Rosalind\u2019s side, just in case.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t bother you,\u201d Rosalind replied, disappearing into the dark silence of the tunnel.</p><p>They walked for several hundred feet, unerringly following the abandoned steel tracks. Ingrid could see in the dark, but Rosalind was forced to rely on memory, silently counting the steps. Her groping fingers found an ironbound door in the side of the tunnel just as a gust of wind blew through the emptiness, stirring her hair. It sounded like a faraway scream, no doubt one of the trains that ran in nearby underground systems.</p><p>Some of the locals who ventured down here thought the sounds were the cries of ghosts; those long-dead miners and engineers trapped down here when the Eastern line collapsed. Or those who had died three summers ago, slaughtered by the vampire that had haunted the depths until it was killed.</p><p>Rosalind was scared of neither. A vampire was just a blue blood gone wrong and she knew how to kill those. As for ghosts...well, she had plenty of her own.</p><p>Shimmying into the access tunnel, her hands and feet found the metal ladder and she scurried down it. Ingrid followed, shutting the iron door behind her with a clang.</p><p>A sickly green light burned below. Rosalind slid the last few feet to the bottom of an old ventilation shaft. An enormous fan stirred lazy circles in the wall, casting flickering shadows through the phosphorescent light. A man leaned against the pitted brickwork, his arms crossed over his chest and a scowl on his face. He saw her and relaxed, pushing off the wall toward her.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said, letting out her own breath of relief. Her brother looked tired, what little she could see of his face. A heavy monocular eyepiece was strapped over one eye to help him see in the dark and a leather half mask obscured his lower face. The eerie green tint of the phosphor light-amplifying lens unnerved her. With it, he could see almost as well as Ingrid.</p><p>Rosalind lifted a hand to touch him, then paused when he flinched. Jack didn\u2019t like to be touched anymore, even through the heavy layers of his coat and gloves. Rosalind\u2019s fingers curled into a hard fist. That was one of the things she missed so much about Jeremy\u2014the way he\u2019d wrap an arm around her shoulders and drag her close, taunting her about the fact that he\u2019d outgrown her. The way she\u2019d kick his feet out from under him and take him to the ground with a laugh. \u201cYou might be taller,\u201d she\u2019d say, \u201cbut I\u2019ll always be your older sister.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s hard gray gaze ran over Ingrid. \u201cNo trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d Ingrid replied.</p><p>Rosalind found herself the recipient of that stare. She shot her friend a hard look. \u201cNothing I couldn\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m curious,\u201d Ingrid said, stalking past. \u201cJust how did you get away from the Nighthawk?\u201d</p><p>Gritting her teeth together, Rosalind ducked past her brother\u2019s startled gaze and hurried after Ingrid. \u201cI seduced him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosalind!\u201d Jack snapped, trailing in her wake. Three long strides and he was close enough to fall in beside her, the phosphorescent flare stick in his hand highlighting the harsh planes of his face. \u201cTell me you two are jesting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ingrid laughed under her breath.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately not,\u201d Rosalind replied. \u201cI lost the shipment and five men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteel can be replaced,\u201d Jack replied.</p> <p>\u201cSo can men,\u201d Ingrid called back.</p><p>But not the money for either. Rosalind ground her teeth. The money was filtered through the Humans First political party, along with information from several sources in the Echelon. The humanist network had already been in place before she stepped into her husband\u2019s shoes and tried to fulfill his dream; it was only lately that she\u2019d begun to wonder where so much money was coming from.</p><p>Ahead of them, a rectangle of darkness was limned by bright yellow light. Home. Rosalind\u2019s shoulders drooped, starting to feel the exertion of the night. The excitement with Lynch had driven her through the streets on the run from his men, but now, in the shadowy darkness of safety, her energy began to flag.</p><p>Beyond the door a single candle sputtered on the table at their entrance. The furnishings were sparse and mostly scavenged. They didn\u2019t need much for their purpose and everything could be left behind in a hurry.</p><p>Jack shut the door behind them as Rosalind sank into one of the stuffed armchairs. A spring dug into her hip and she shifted.</p> <p>Jack crossed his arms again. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me about your night,\u201d she said as Ingrid lit the gas boiler to make tea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in yours.\u201d</p><p>There would be no shaking him in this mood. \u201cWe were ambushed as we left the enclaves. Lynch and his men were waiting for us, no doubt given the tip by somebody.\u201d Rosalind frowned. \u201cI need to discover who\u2014that could be costly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d Ingrid asked, looking up from the kettle.</p><p>Intense. Rosalind stilled as unwelcome memory flooded through her body. \u201cExactly as they say. Hard and cold. And very determined.\u201d The way he\u2019d looked at her\u2014as if he\u2019d tear apart the world to get his hands on her again. She shivered. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen the last of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should have put a bullet in him,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in the position,\u201d she lied, dropping her gaze. \u201cThe best I could do was paralyze him with hemlock. His men came while I was getting away and I had to flee.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind could feel Jack\u2019s gaze boring into the top of her head. Looking up, she smoothed the expression from her face. \u201cSo tell me about your night. Any luck?\u201d</p><p>Tension lingered in his shoulders, then he blew out a breath and glanced at Ingrid. \u201cWe intercepted the coach carrying the London Standard\u2019s editor toward the Ivory Tower. The escape went as planned and one of our men got him out. Unfortunately, a group of metaljackets came and we were forced to separate.\u201d</p><p>Another avenue lost tonight. The editor had printed a caricature in the London Standard of the prince consort with a monstrously deformed head, dangling puppet strings over a wan image of his human wife, the queen. He wouldn\u2019t be doing that again.</p><p>\u201cNo casualties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on our side.\u201d Though she couldn\u2019t see it, she could sense the vicious smile behind the mask.</p><p>\u201cAnd no word of Jeremy?\u201d she asked, looking toward Ingrid with deceptive casualness. Though it rankled, there was no use in her looking for Jeremy when Ingrid\u2019s senses were far better suited. She\u2019d spent the entire month blundering along behind Ingrid, no doubt hindering her. Tonight had been the first night she\u2019d forced herself to let go, to let Ingrid do what she did best.</p> <p>This time it was Ingrid\u2019s turn to drop her gaze. \u201cNothing. No sightings, no scent trail.\u201d Ingrid took a deep breath then looked up, her bronze eyes gleaming. \u201cHe\u2019s not outside the city walls, Rosa. If there\u2019s any hope that he survived\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe survived,\u201d she snapped. There could be no other option, for if there was, then she had failed him. Her baby brother, the one she\u2019d practically raised. The world blurred, a haze of heat sweeping behind her eyes.</p><p>Jack\u2019s hand slid over hers and Rosalind looked up in shock as he squeezed her fingers gently, then let go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he murmured, then turned to Ingrid. \u201cAnd nor is it yours. If you can\u2019t find him, then he\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>It was her fault though. Rosalind had been too wrapped up in her cause to pay attention to her brother. Jeremy had fallen in with the mechs, lured by their rough talk and bawdy laughter. He was almost a man, and she couldn\u2019t blame him for wanting the company of other men. It was only when he went missing that she realized how much she\u2019d been ignoring him lately.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s not outside the city walls,\u201d she murmured, rubbing her eyes. So tired. \u201cThat leaves the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ingrid snapped. \u201cYou can\u2019t even think it.\u201d</p><p>The thick wall that circled the city borough kept the riffraff out and the blue bloods in. Inside it was their territory. Their stalking grounds. A world of glittering carriages, fancy mansions, silk, and steel.</p><p>Rosalind slowly lowered her hand. \u201cWhere else do I look, Ingrid? He was last seen in the Ivory Tower during the bombing and the bodies were all accounted for. I\u2019d hoped he\u2019d escaped with the few mechs that got away but we\u2019ve hunted some of them down and nobody knows where Jeremy is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich leaves the blue bloods,\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cOr the bloody Nighthawks,\u201d Ingrid snapped. She shoved to her feet. \u201cAnd none of us can get near the Guild Headquarters.\u201d</p><p>Nighthawks. Rosalind stilled. The very men who were hunting the mechs\u2014and Mercury. Why hadn\u2019t she thought of it before? \u201cIf anyone knows what happened to the mechs who blew up the tower,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cit would be the Nighthawks.\u201d</p><p>Sensing trouble, Jack shot her a sharp look. \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s my file on my lord Nighthawk?\u201d She spotted it on a pile on the table and pushed out of her chair eagerly. \u201cThere was an advertisement,\u201d she said recklessly, tearing open the file and hunting through it. Pages and pages of notes on Lynch and his comings and goings scrawled across the page. Know your enemy. \u201cSeveral weeks back in the London Standard.\u201d Her fingers closed over the piece. \u201cAn advertisement for a secretarial position\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack snapped, knowing precisely where her mind was going.</p><p>Ingrid looked between the two of them, then frowned. \u201cThe position might be filled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to ensure it\u2019s vacant again,\u201d Rosalind said flippantly, not averse to kidnapping anyone temporarily for her needs.</p><p>\u201cRoz, this is insane,\u201d Ingrid said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone to play the part. I can\u2019t do it, not with these eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can.\u201d</p><p>Her words fell into an abrupt silence. Ingrid\u2019s jaw dropped and Jack took a menacing step toward her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I do,\u201d Rosalind replied, knowing where the trouble was going to come from. \u201cThis is what Balfour trained me to do.\u201d And perhaps the only thing she was truly good at. Though she hated him, the prince consort\u2019s spymaster had recognized her talents and nurtured them early on. He knew her in a way even Jack did not. The only thing he had ever misunderstood were her limits, what even she could not be coaxed to do.</p><p>Like the day he had asked her to kill her husband.</p><p>The only time she had ever disobeyed him\u2014the cost of which still haunted her at night. Her hand sacrificed to save the man she\u2019d betrayed. And Nathaniel lying dead at Balfour\u2019s hand in punishment.</p><p>\u201cYou were too late, mon petit faucon,\u201d Balfour murmured, cleaning the blood from his hands with a rag and eyeing her dispassionately as she\u2019d slumped to the floor from the blood loss. \u201cI gave you five minutes to prove your loyalty.\u201d A furious glance at the bloodied stump with its rough tourniquet. \u201cAnd so it is proven.\u201d Throwing the rag aside.</p><p>She could barely see him or Nathaniel. Her vision was bleeding black around the edges.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he whispered, lifting the wrist and making her scream as her vision went white. \u201cI shall make you a new hand. And you will serve me again.\u201d</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t. It had been Jack who broke her out of the healing ward where she lay delirious, his own skin acid-burned and bloody from the cost of her betrayal. And Ingrid, the young verwulfen girl from Balfour\u2019s menagerie whom she\u2019d always felt sorry for.</p><p>Because she too knew how it felt to be trapped in a cage.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn,\u201d Jack snapped, his hand slicing the air in a sharp gesture. \u201cBalfour used you. And me. He didn\u2019t care whether we came back from our missions alive or dead, Rosa. Well, I do. I can\u2019t find my brother and I\u2019m damned well not going to watch my sister walk into such a dangerous situation.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear the cost of Jeremy\u2019s loss on top of what she already owed those she loved. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop me,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd I can manage Lynch. I know I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chain you to the bloody\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so certain you can manage the Nighthawk?\u201d Ingrid asked.</p><p>Rosalind backed away from her brother. Avoid rather than fight. \u201cHe\u2019s attracted to me\u2014to Mercury rather. I can manipulate that. Lynch might be a blue blood but he\u2019s still a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, are you listening to yourself?\u201d</p><p>She ignored Jack. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Almost too perfect. As his secretary, I\u2019ll be given free rein to examine his paperwork at my leisure. If he knows anything about the mechs and Jeremy, then I\u2019ll be able to find it. If not, then I walk away and he never sees me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s if he offers you the position,\u201d Ingrid replied.</p><p>\u201cHe will.\u201d Jack shot her a cutting look. \u201cRosa always gets what she wants, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind curled her hands over the back of the chair and stared at him. Hard. He didn\u2019t realize it, but that was capitulation in his voice. \u201cThen that means I\u2019ll find Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s there. If he\u2019s still alive.\u201d One last parting shot.</p><p>Rosalind hid her flinch. She felt better now that she had a plan. \u201cTrue. But I need to find out if he is. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll ever be able to move forward.\u201d</p><p>Ingrid frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to disguise yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven your height and scent,\u201d Ingrid muttered.</p><p>\u201cFind someone roughly my height. \u2018Mercury\u2019 can make an appearance while I\u2019m with Lynch. He\u2019ll never suspect me.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s face tightened. \u201cSo be it. But we do this the way we were trained\u2014and you get out the moment you find the Nighthawk doesn\u2019t have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said softly, knowing that she had won.</p><p>Fog swirled at his feet as Sir Jasper Lynch strode through the narrow alleyway, his great cloak flapping around his ankles and his cane echoing on the cobbles. Each slap of his boot soles seemed to echo the frustration beating in his chest.</p><p>Crossing Chancery Lane, he caught sight of the grim building that housed his men. Almost all of them were blue bloods, but their infections had been by chance or accident, rather than intention. Only a son from the best bloodlines of the Echelon was offered the blood rites when they turned fifteen. Any chance infections were considered rogues, and they were offered either a place in the Nighthawks or the Coldrush Guards that served the Ivory Tower. Or death.</p><p>Lynch had been the original Nighthawk, but over time the entire guild had come to represent his name. The Nighthawks were legendary in the city, a threat used to cow criminals and revolutionaries alike.</p><p>They\u2019d never once been unable to track their prey.</p><p>Until now...</p><p>The streets were starting to bustle with pre-dawn traffic. A young paperboy with ruddy cheeks from the cold shoved a copy of the London Standard in front of him. \u201cMurders in Kensington! Read all about it! Blue blood gone mad!\u201d</p><p>Lynch slipped him a shilling. The Haversham massacre was being investigated by his man Byrnes, a task he\u2019d usually save for himself but for the importance of capturing Mercury. It had been an effort to keep it out of the papers so far. \u201cAny other news, Billy?\u201d</p><p>The lad wasn\u2019t the only one he used for information. Though they stood in plain sight, the paperboys were almost invisible in the city. \u201cThe Coldrush Guards arrested the London Standard editor yest\u2019day, sir. Found \u2019im in a cellar with a printing press and a pair of \u2019umanists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shame.\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cNot really. They was escortin\u2019 \u2019im back to the Ivory Tower when they was attacked last night. Bunch o\u2019 lads swarmed the metaljackets guardin\u2019 \u2019em and knocked the Coldrush Guards out some\u2019ow. Them \u2019umanists, they says.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hemlock darts no doubt. But the interesting thing was that they\u2019d taken out the metaljackets. He\u2019d have to look into how they did that. Slipping Billy another coin, he took a paper for show and hurried across the street.</p><p>The guild loomed over Chancery Lane, an alley running along both sides, as though the row houses on each side feared to touch it. Leering gargoyles kept watch on the roof; inside each gaping mouth was a spyglass that\u2014by use of a clever mirror system he\u2019d designed\u2014transmitted inside images of the street so that his men could keep watch without being seen. Stepping through the pair of glossy black double doors, he found himself in the main entry. It looked like the typical London manor and it was easy to penetrate\u2014not so easy to escape. If he pressed the security breach button a chain-and-lever system would drop heavy iron bars over every opening.</p><p>A faint creak on the floor above drew his eyes upward. From the faint hint of bay rum in the air, he recognized Garrett. Nobody else wore bloody aftershave.</p> <p>Lynch took a step forward, then froze as the scent of something else caught his attention. Warm flesh. Linen and the mouthwatering tang of lemon. Just a hint of woman.</p><p>His hunger stirred. He was overdue for his allotted measure of blood. That had to be the problem.</p><p>Garrett appeared at the top of the stairs, lean and stark in his black leather body armor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman here,\u201d Lynch stated. \u201cWho is she?\u201d His men knew the rules. All assignations were to be on their own time and not in the guild.</p><p>Garrett sauntered down the stairs. \u201cShe\u2019s here for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cFor the secretarial position. To interview with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he muttered, stripping his great cloak off. He tossed it on the hatstand. \u201cI forgot. I thought I said no more women? I want someone with a stronger constitution and more fortitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe insisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the nature of a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Garrett grinned. \u201cThat brutal sense of honesty is why you keep a lonely bed.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch scraped a weary hand over the stubble on his jaw. That hadn\u2019t always been the case. \u201cIt could have something to do with the fact I\u2019ve not been to bed for two...possibly three days.\u201d He considered it. \u201cDefinitely three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some coffee and blood sent up. And a plate of biscuits for the lady.\u201d</p><p>Lynch gave an abrupt shake of the head. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. She\u2019s not staying. Blood however...blood would be much appreciated.\u201d</p><p>Climbing the stairs, he paced toward his study on cat-silent feet. All the better to observe. The door to his secretary\u2019s study cracked open an inch. The scent of her was much stronger here. The heavy overlaying perfume of lemon verbena and linen lingered in the air. Some scent she\u2019d dabbed on her wrists and throat he imagined.</p><p>The narrow slice of door presented him with a view of dark blue skirts, the bustle hooked up in a style fashionable almost five years ago. A thick velvet wrap the color of midnight covered slim shoulders and her hat disguised her features. He couldn\u2019t tell whether she was young or old, pretty or plain.</p><p>He could tell, however, that she was examining the enormous map of London that covered the far wall. Red pins dotted the map, carving out a large swathe of East London and red string ran between each pin, creating an incomprehensible spider web for those who didn\u2019t know what it meant\u2014sightings of Mercury that he\u2019d been able to verify or the location of several humanists he\u2019d uncovered. Some he\u2019d left in place. It was enough to know who they were. He had larger prey to catch.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s hand slid inside his waistcoat pocket and the small scrap of leather inside. No perfume there. His fingers had long since rubbed away any trace of scent. But close his eyes and it would be a simple matter to recall the hot scent of her, laced with the burning smell of iron slag in the enclaves and the choking pall of coal. Mercury wore no perfume. His cock throbbed at the thought and Lynch ground his teeth together. Devil take her.</p><p>The woman in his study ran her fingers along the map, the jaunty hat swiveling to survey the room. Searching for something? Or merely bored? He hadn\u2019t asked how long she\u2019d been waiting, though since it was but morning, it couldn\u2019t have been too long. Nobody was allowed out at night between the hours of nine and six during martial law.</p> <p>Easing the door open, Lynch slipped inside without a sound. The woman froze, as if she sensed him immediately. Her head tilted to the side, revealing the fine line of her pale jaw and a pair of rosy lips. From the prickling uneasiness in her stance and the stiffening between her shoulder blades, she hadn\u2019t been around a blue blood often. No doubt she was one of the working class, her ears full of rumors and superstitions about how a blue blood lusted for blood, their hungers insatiable. Or how the Echelon kept factories filled with human slaves.</p><p>\u201cSir Jasper.\u201d She turned slowly, the light striking over her fine features. Eyes the color of polished obsidian met his. Lynch stopped in his tracks. She was just past the first blush of youth, but...no...He looked closer. Her tip-tilted nose and fragile features gave the impression that she was younger than she was. Her sense of poise told another story.</p><p>Thirty perhaps.</p><p>Lynch raked his gaze over her. Skin like porcelain, so pale and creamy it almost glowed in the soft dawn light through the windows. Her eyebrows were coppery wings, arching delightfully as she examined him back. He couldn\u2019t see her hair for the hat and netting, but he imagined it was the same fierce copper of her brows. She was slender enough through the torso that her heavy skirts swamped her and her hands were hidden by kid-leather gloves that she hadn\u2019t bothered to remove, as etiquette demanded. To present the wrists or the throat to a blue blood was tantamount to exposing a breast.</p><p>So she did have some experience with blue bloods. Interesting. Lynch had to amend his previous assessment of her. She was wary enough that the experience had not been a good one, he suspected.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d she asked, pasting a smile on her rosy lips and offering him her right hand.</p><p>Lynch stared at it. \u201cLet us get to the point, Miss\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Marberry.\u201d Slight emphasis on the first word.</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA widow.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid your services are not required. There was a mix-up with the advertisement. The position has already been filled.\u201d His eye caught a letter on the desk, the address written in gold ink. From the Council of Dukes then. He started toward it. \u201cGarrett will see you to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not by a woman,\u201d she replied tartly. \u201cWith their weak constitutions and all.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stopped and looked at her. She\u2019d overheard him in the entry. Cool brown eyes met his. A challenge. If she thought he would be embarrassed, then she didn\u2019t know him very well.</p><p>Opening her reticule, she tugged out a sheaf of papers. \u201cI have references from my last two places of employ. I worked for Lord Hamilton in the War Office, and then for Lady Shipton as her personal secretary. I assure you\u201d\u2014her voice became a drawl\u2014\u201cafter that, nothing could shock me or turn my stomach.\u201d</p><p>Lynch crossed his arms over his chest. He\u2019d dealt with the Shipton case. A jealous blue blood husband and an adulterous consort whose predilections had surprised even him. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d seen it all by now. \u201cYou are aware that both your previous employees are dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by my hand, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>A bold piece. He straightened in interest. \u201cI meant that I would be unable to check your references.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me be bold...I assume that is your preference anyway?\u201d</p><p>Lynch gave a brisk nod. She was observant at least.</p><p>\u201cMy previous employers are dead, as you noted, which means I have nothing but two pieces of paper to prove my aptitude for employment. This leaves me in somewhat of a quandary. I need to earn a respectable living, Sir Jasper. I have a brother...\u201d And here she faltered, showing perhaps the first lack of composure. \u201cHe\u2019s young. And assorting with certain types of people I don\u2019t approve of. I should like to let an apartment in the city, away from these influences, but at the moment I am unable.\u201d</p><p>She needed a steady job and a good wage. Lynch\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not unmoved,\u201d he told her, leaning his hip against the desk. \u201cBut I\u2019ve had five secretaries in the last three months. My work involves certain grisly details and long hours, and nobody seems able to keep up with me. I\u2019ve spent more time in the past three months training new secretaries than working, and I haven\u2019t the inclination to waste any more of it.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Marberry squared her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that. Garrett informed me of the nature of the job. He said you would work me into the ground, forgetting human needs such as sustenance and sleep, squire me all around the city to take your notes and examine dead bodies. You told your last secretary to hold someone\u2019s head, so you could examine the angle of the cut that decapitated the body and that was why they resigned.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Lynch was taken aback. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all correct then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some matters I believe he forgot to mention, but mostly yes. The men call me \u2018that uncompromising bastard,\u2019 though they\u2019re not aware that I know that. It\u2019s not the worst thing I\u2019ve been called. Still want the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Jasper.\u201d Mrs. Marberry leaned toward him, completely unaware of the fact that her bodice gaped. He, however, noticed everything. Smooth skin, the veins tracing their way beneath her flesh, blue and pulsing with blood. Shifting slightly, Lynch glanced away. She would be trouble. He shouldn\u2019t hire her. With her pretty little mouth and stubborn chin, the men would be all over her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t frighten me nor can you drive me away,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need someone who\u2019s not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s gaze locked on hers. Her eyes were truly fascinating\u2014dark pools that seemed to hint at infinite depths. He wondered briefly if they echoed her personality; were there hidden depths there too? Then he shook the thought off as foolish. One had only to observe to understand the true measure of a man\u2014or a woman. He\u2019d not met one yet whom he\u2019d been unable to decipher down to the last iota of their soul. People were predictable. \u201cAnd that person is you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look away. Instead, she looked right through him, as though she could see inside him. Not once had he been on the receiving end of a stare like that. \u201cThat person is me.\u201d</p><p>By gods, she would be trouble. And yet he was strangely tempted. The girl had gumption, glaring at him as if daring him to employ her. Not even a hint of the vapors, though she was clever enough to be wary. He was what he was, after all.</p><p>Perhaps she could manage to deal with him? Perhaps she might last longer than a week, unlike the previous Mrs. Eltham, she of the decapitated-head incident.</p><p>Mrs. Marberry glanced away, her fathomless eyes hidden beneath thick, dark lashes. Lynch\u2019s breath caught. Devil a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too pretty,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>Lynch gestured at her, striding away from the desk. \u201cThis...\u201d He made a curving motion in the air to indicate her. \u201cThis won\u2019t work. I hire ugly women. Ones with moustaches. Ones my men wouldn\u2019t look twice at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly think I\u2019m the sort of woman to inspire riots in your guild quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re speaking of four hundred and fifty men I work into the ground. They barely have time to speak to women and now you want me to place a pretty one in the middle of them all?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze hardened. \u201cShould I be concerned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcerned?\u201d Then he realized she was speaking of assault. \u201cGood God, no. They wouldn\u2019t dare. I\u2019d have them eviscerated. And they know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your objection stems from the fact you think I\u2019d be a distraction?\u201d</p><p>A distraction? A damned catastrophe. Lynch scowled, turning toward the window with ground-eating strides. He\u2019d never been a man to stand still for long. It helped him to think. \u201cI know you\u2019d be a distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t I be at your side at all times?\u201d she asked, following him in a swish of skirts and perfume. \u201cI daresay your men wouldn\u2019t dare risk such foolery in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lynch spun on his heel and found her in his path. Acres and acres of navy skirts with that tight cinched in waist and...the breasts. The dress was modest, but at his great height, he couldn\u2019t help that the angle gave him a certain view. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perhaps I wasn\u2019t speaking of the men?</p><p>Heat tightened in his abdomen and he clasped his hands behind his back. Damn her, this would be a mistake. He had a thousand things to think of and a revolutionary leader to find. He couldn\u2019t afford to have a buxom, determined redhead under his nose. Especially one who smelled like lemons and soft, freshly laundered sheets.</p><p>The thought conjured to mind the image of her upon his own sheets, that pale, flawless skin laid bare for his inspection. Her pretty little mouth parted in a gasp as he ground his hips down upon hers.</p> <p>Lynch\u2019s cock stirred, reminding him of what it felt like to be a man. Damn it. She was already affecting him. This should be evidence that this would be a bad idea.</p><p>But he needed a secretary. One who wasn\u2019t scared of him.</p><p>A faint hint of color rose in Mrs. Marberry\u2019s cheeks but she refused to look away. He was staring, he realized.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to employ me or not?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Instinct told him to say no. But as he opened his mouth, the words changed. \u201cYes,\u201d he found himself saying. \u201cOn a trial basis. I\u2019m desperate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd a charmer,\u201d she noted with an arched brow. A little smile toyed over her lips. Relief. \u201cI shall have to watch myself with you, I see.\u201d</p><p>I shall have to watch myself.</p><p>After the disastrous encounter with Mercury and now this, it was becoming clear that he needed a woman to take the edge off. Mercury had done this to him, left him on edge, and now his body hungered for release.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your given name?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s highly informal, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find I rarely bother with formalities. I\u2019m not going to bark \u2018Mrs. Marberry\u2019 whenever I want you. It\u2019s a mouthful.\u201d</p> <p>A slight hesitation. \u201cRosa,\u201d she said, her full lips forming the word softly. \u201cMy name is Rosa. And you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already turned toward the desk, determined to get away from that lingering scent. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Jasper will be perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>Lynch gave her his back and Rosalind finally had a chance to take as deep a breath as she could in the unfamiliar corset. The other night hadn\u2019t done him justice, with the darkness and the red glow of the enclaves. She\u2019d realized then his great height and cold, penetrating stare. They said fully grown men broke into confessions when he looked at them and women quivered at the knees.</p><p>What she hadn\u2019t expected to find was a coldly handsome man, his dark hair cropped neatly and raked back out of his face with an impatient gesture. His jaw was darkened with stubble and a pinched line swept his dark brows together in what seemed a permanent frown.</p><p>Rosalind examined him, little goose bumps prickling over her skin. The other night had left its mark on her body. She\u2019d long since thought herself impervious to men, especially dangerous ones, but she\u2019d dismissed Lynch as merely another blue blood and that had been foolish.</p><p>Her gaze slid over his broad shoulders as he clasped his hands behind his back. Shoulders she\u2019d dug her nails into, her lips caressing the smooth skin of his throat. A little flutter of excitement started low in her belly, tempting her. She sucked in a breath, her fingernails digging into her palms. This was what she hadn\u2019t dared admit to her brother or Ingrid. Lynch might be attracted to Mercury against his will, but the truth was a delicious irony, for she too had been caught in the trap.</p> <p>Rosalind stole a calculating glance at the room as she took a step forward. Tonight, she\u2019d be able to recall almost every little detail. Her gaze slid to the wall with that damning map. She wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew what all those little pins meant, because they were the location of dozens of humanists hidden in the general populace. Some had been discovered and arrested, but a great deal of those pins were humanists who were blissfully unaware that their identity had been compromised.</p><p>The map told her a great deal about the Nighthawk. He was patient, for one thing. He was also clever enough not to flush them out of their holes. The red string became a spider web, and Rosalind had the feeling that he was the one who\u2019d woven it.</p><p>Just waiting for a little fly, a certain revolutionary, to get caught in its sticky web.</p><p>Thank goodness she\u2019d decided to risk infiltrating the guild. Now she knew the trap was there and could warn people, or perhaps use it for her own gains.</p><p>\u201cSir Jasper,\u201d she forced herself to say. \u201cThat is rather a mouthful too.\u201d</p><p>The Nighthawk shot her a hard look over his shoulder as if surprised she\u2019d spoken up. Those icy gray eyes stole her breath, leaving her feeling as if the room had faded away and there was nothing beyond the two of them.</p><p>A horrible, uncomfortable feeling for it gave her the impression that he could see every little secret she was hiding. And she was damned good at hiding her secrets.</p><p>Light played over the straight, hawkish slant of his nose. \u201cLynch, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would you like me to start?\u201d Rosalind toyed with her gloves, a habit she\u2019d never broken herself of.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to discuss your wages first?\u201d His gaze dropped to the fiddling of her fingers and Rosalind forced them to stillness.</p><p>\u201cI already asked your man, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen as soon\u2014\u201d His head lifted, stark, gray gaze tracking something beyond the door. A hint of dark shadows flashed through his eyes, signs of the hunger within, the voracious predator that lurked beneath the sophisticated skin of every blue blood. The craving.</p><p>Rosalind stilled. There was a gun strapped to her thigh fitted with firebolt bullets that exploded on impact, and a sheath of needles at her wrist that were dipped in hemlock. But the creeping fear still prickled at her skin.</p><p>Lynch might look and act like a gentleman, albeit a brusque one, but she would never forget what he truly was.</p><p>The door slammed open and an older man with a bald head and leather jerkin stormed in. He saw her and stopped, ruddy color infusing his cheeks. \u201cBeg pardon, miss.\u201d A faint Irish accent. His blue eyes shot to Lynch. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you \u2019ad anyone \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoyle, this is my new secretary,\u201d Lynch replied, stillness emanating from him. \u201cMrs. Marberry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d Doyle arched a brow. A brisk nod in her direction, then he returned his attention to his master. \u201cThis just came in. More bad news.\u201d He tugged a letter from within his jerkin and tossed it at Lynch.</p><p>Lynch snatched the missive out of the air. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPark Lane,\u201d Doyle replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a bloodbath. Lord Falcone slaughtered \u2019is entire family. Women, children, thralls...all of the servants. Lord Barrons wants you there now.\u201d</p><p>As the Duke of Caine\u2019s heir, Barrons would be reporting directly to the ruling Council of Dukes, despite their friendship. Lynch frowned. \u201cThis is the second incident in a week. Byrnes has barely begun to go over the facts of the Haversham case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems it weren\u2019t an isolated incident after all.\u201d Doyle shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCurse it.\u201d Lynch spun on his heel, pacing the rug. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that excuse will suit \u2019is Royal Pastiness,\u201d Doyle replied bluntly. \u201cNot with nob\u2019s gettin\u2019 their hands all bloodied. Might be different if it were just us rogues.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. Rosalind\u2019s gaze flickered between the men, wondering if Lynch would chastise his man for the insubordination, but his expression remained coolly neutral.</p><p>Division in the blue blood world? She went very still, her mind racing. All along she\u2019d thought the enemy was one, but if she could use this information to somehow turn the Nighthawks against the Echelon then she would have a powerful weapon on her hands.</p><p>The men seemed to have forgotten her for the moment. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d Rosalind asked. \u201cBut what is going on?\u201d</p><p>Lynch shot her a piercing look that went straight through her. \u201cA murder scene, Rosa. Now we\u2019ll see whether you are suited for the job. Fetch that writing case and follow me. I\u2019ll need to see the bodies while they\u2019re fresh.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Rosalind ground her teeth together as the carriage shot around another corner. The strap dug into her hand and she clutched the writing case to her chest so as not to lose it.</p><p>Lynch rolled with the sway, his long legs eating up the interior. He sat opposite her, rifling through a sheaf of papers and frowning occasionally. Though he largely ignored her, the occasional quick glance scoured her like fire. She didn\u2019t like being in here, trapped so closely together. He was too large, the force of his presence dominating the space.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that, in the dark confines of the carriage, all she could remember was what that hard body felt like pressed against her own. The taste of his mouth and the depth of his longing as he had kissed her startled something into life deep within her. Hunger. Newly awakened and barely sated. A desire for flesh, for sin, for wet kisses and the hard stroke of his body over hers.</p><p>She\u2019d told herself to forget the memory, but it lingered on her skin like some textural apparition. She\u2019d been a fool to kiss him. A fool\u2014even now\u2014to want more.</p><p>\u201cWho were the Havershams?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Lynch barely glanced up. \u201cLord Haversham, his consort Lady Amelia, and their three children. A minor branch of the House of Goethe. They were found on Monday morning by the eldest son, who\u2019d returned from a gaming club. The entire household was torn apart, humans included, and Haversham had shot himself in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tore them apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe suspect so. There were two quarts of blood in his stomach and his consort had pieces of his skin under her fingernails from where she\u2019d tried to fight. The man\u2019s bloodletting knife was on his person and the blade matches the marks found on the servants and...the children.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind absorbed that. The tone of his voice had sounded as though he repeated the facts by rote, but at the end... He didn\u2019t like the part about the children, she thought.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do such a thing?\u201d Despite her personal feelings about blue bloods, it was an odd thing. Haversham was a minor lord. No doubt he kept enough thralls to satisfy the bloodlust, unless he was close to the Fade, when a blue blood lost all trace of color and began to evolve into a mindless, blood-driven predator. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Fade, was it?\u201d The thought unnerved her. She knew what happened when a vampire stalked the city.</p><p>Lynch shook his head. \u201cHis craving virus levels were holding at sixty percent.\u201d</p><p>Not the Fade then. The craving virus made a blue blood what they were, but most of the Echelon kept a careful monitor on their CV levels. It was law. A spate of vampires a century ago had forced the ruling Council of Dukes to make it compulsory. Any blue blood whose levels began to hit seventy-five or even eighty were closely monitored.</p><p>Any higher and an ax was sent for.</p><p>\u201cDoyle said there\u2019d be children here.\u201d As a child she\u2019d seen enough gruesome sights to consider her nerves steel\u2014indeed, she\u2019d been the cause of some of them. But children...children were always bad.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lynch said in a deadly soft voice. \u201cFalcone had two. A boy and a girl.\u201d He considered her for a long moment. \u201cIf you wish, you can wait outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d She needed to make herself useful to him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t think less of you.\u201d The stark gray of his eyes became shadowed with something else, something haunted. \u201cNobody should have to see children like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your last secretary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different. The victim was a grown man, a blood addict. He\u2019d beaten his thrall one too many times and so she cut his throat when he was asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut his throat? I thought he was decapitated.\u201d A blue blood could heal from almost anything but that.</p><p>\u201cShe used a large knife,\u201d he replied, \u201cwith great force and a considerable amount of times.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind considered his words, slowly drawing her own conclusions. She needed to know more about this man\u2014her adversary. Yet she couldn\u2019t deny the slight tingle of genuine curiosity. \u201cChildren unnerve you then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be surprised to find that I do occasionally display and feel emotion. I\u2019m not a machine.\u201d</p><p>He might have been asking if she\u2019d like some tea. Rosalind looked out the window, at the fog-laden streets. She didn\u2019t want to empathize with him. Lynch was the enemy. But she\u2019d heard whispers of how even the Echelon thought him cold and mechanical. A steel heart. Virtually a mech, they laughed.</p><p>Evidently he\u2019d heard those rumors too.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do it?\u201d she asked, despite her intentions. \u201cHow do you do this job?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lynch lowered the papers into his lap. \u201cBecause I\u2019m good at what I do. I\u2019m the best. For every woman I find assaulted, every child murdered, I know that I can find the culprit, perhaps even stop them before they get at someone else.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can...switch it off. It\u2019s a gift I have,\u201d he replied softly. \u201cI try not to think of them as human. They\u2019re gone by the time I get to them. Bodies. Nothing but bodies. All I can do is offer them justice.\u201d</p><p>That she certainly understood. Emotion had been burned out of her long ago. It was easy to simply...push it to the side. To not think of it. To focus on her cause.</p> <p>The mystery of Lynch deepened. Who was this man? He was her opponent, the shadowy entity on the other side of the metaphorical chess game they played. She needed to know him, and yet, each answer humanized him in a way she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>He was nothing like the Echelon. Like Lord Balfour.</p><p>Not a steel heart, she thought, but steel walls. Built to protect him. And that would be how she would bring him down, she realized. The man was not impervious, which meant he had a weakness. Rosalind simply had to find it.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s gaze dropped. \u201cYou toy with your gloves. Do I make you nervous?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind stopped playing with the fingertip of her glove immediately. \u201cNo.\u201d Perhaps. It was that damnable stare of his. She\u2019d faced many an adversary, often at knifepoint, but there was something about Lynch that itched at her skin, along her nerves. It wasn\u2019t fear. She\u2019d killed enough blue bloods to know they weren\u2019t infallible. But...something... She couldn\u2019t yet identify the reason for it. \u201cIt\u2019s a habit.\u201d</p> <p>Folding her hands in her lap, she peered through the window. The streets raced past, an endless tapestry of brick, mortar, and fog. Gas lamps still gleamed on the street corners. And the touch of his gaze was almost a physical pressure. She found herself shifting in her seat and forced her body to still. It had been easier as Mercury, when the mask hid her from him. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the thought of what lies ahead. What we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash of movement in her peripheral vision. Rosalind jerked her hand back as he reached for it.</p><p>Lynch froze, his face hardening. \u201cI was only seeking to offer comfort.\u201d</p><p>Her left hand. Her iron hand. Rosalind\u2019s heart thundered in her chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She put it back in her lap. One touch and he might feel the iron, feel the joins. It was only luck that etiquette demanded she keep her gloves on at all times in front of him, except while dining, though she intended to take her repast in private or not at all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like my hands being touched,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnywhere else is fine.\u201d</p><p>For a moment his gaze flickered to her d\u00e9colletage. Then away. It might not have even happened but suddenly her nerves were on fire again.</p> <p>He\u2019d looked at her as a man would eye a woman. And suddenly Rosalind realized what she\u2019d said. Her mind took a swift detour, imagining those hands on her, and her body reacted, nipples hardening beneath the stiff taffeta of the gown, a shiver of feeling edging its way down her spine.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch you again then,\u201d Lynch replied. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind didn\u2019t want to drive him away. She needed to get under his skin, learn his secrets, the manner of man he was. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal,\u201d she said, her mind racing through a list of plausible lies and finding one that was almost real. \u201cMy father...\u201d She looked down at her lap. \u201cI have a bad association with the gesture.\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s stark features softened. \u201cI see. I apologize then.\u201d</p><p>The carriage lurched into another corner. Rosalind hung on for dear life. Lynch merely braced himself, his powerful thighs clenching as they cleared the corner. The butter-soft leather of his trousers creaked.</p><p>\u201cThis is madness,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky to arrive at the crime scene alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, Perry drives like this all the time. I prefer speed over caution. I need to see what happened before the Echelon\u2019s men step all over my evidence and destroy it.\u201d</p><p>Her fist tightened on the carriage strap. \u201cSome of the Echelon will be there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBarrons perhaps, the Duke of Caine\u2019s heir. The summons came from him and he has an inquiring mind.\u201d Lynch picked up his papers again. \u201cAnd no doubt the prince consort\u2019s Coldrush Guards will be there, to report back to him.\u201d</p><p>The place would be swarming with blue bloods. But not Lord Balfour. She breathed a sigh of relief. She was much changed from the child and young woman he\u2019d known, but though he expected her to be dead, he would still recognize her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>The world suddenly slammed to a halt, tires squealing and people cursing. Rosalind lost her grip on the carriage strap and plummeted forward.</p><p>A firm grip caught at her as she tumbled onto the carriage floor between Lynch\u2019s legs. There was a moment of hard muscle beneath her hands, then she realized exactly where her hands were and wrenched them back.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s fingers dug into her arms, his large body stiff as they both realized the suggestiveness of her position. The color leeched out of his irises, his black pupils swallowing them whole.</p><p>The demon inside him.</p><p>Rosalind froze. The gun strapped to her thigh suddenly chafed, as if reminding her how difficult it would be to get at it. She\u2019d cut through the pockets in her skirts, leaving a clear path to the weapon, but her skirts were hopelessly tangled around her legs.</p><p>With a jerk he tore his hands away, his fingers clenching in the seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d Lynch\u2019s voice was hard, almost metallic, completely lacking inflection. He took a deep breath and looked away, closing his eyes. \u201cJust move slowly.\u201d A muscle jumped in his jaw. \u201cI would help you, but I don\u2019t believe I should touch you just now.\u201d</p><p>There was nowhere to put her hands. Rosalind eyed his knee grimly and forced herself to lay her right hand on his thigh. The steam carriage jerked into motion and her fingers dug into the clenched steel of his muscle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t opened his eyes, his breathing slow and steady. Controlled. Forcing himself to reign in his hungers, his desires. \u201cAs am I.\u201d A tight smile. As if he could only permit himself this.</p><p>Rosalind pushed herself to her knees, her eyes level with his chest. The hard carapace of his breastplate molded to fit his body, the musculature defined in an almost vulgar way. Beneath it he wore a black shirt with a long, leather coat over the top.</p><p>The only thing she could smell was leather. A blue blood had no personal scent, but some liked to disguise that fact with perfumes or aftershave. Indeed, Garrett reeked of it, though from her impression of the man, she wasn\u2019t surprised. Lynch however...No scents, no perfumes. Only a faint lingering hint of coffee and something else, something almost coppery.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>His eyes opened, as if wondering what was taking her so long. Rosalind\u2019s breath caught and she surged to her feet, practically throwing herself back into the seat. The black had faded, his demons well and truly leashed. The sight was impressive. She\u2019d rarely ever seen a blue blood control himself like this.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen often. But I\u2019ve not been to sleep for several days and I didn\u2019t have time to...partake of nourishment before we left.\u201d</p><p>His entire body was rigid, his words so quiet she might not have heard them. A hint of embarrassment? Of shame? Rosalind stared at him, the breath slowly leaving her lungs. She felt almost unnerved, her body primed to fight or flee. But the danger had passed. Why then did the feeling persist?</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should carry a flask,\u201d she suggested, her voice rough and low.</p><p>\u201cAn excellent suggestion.\u201d</p><p>The murmur of his voice shivered over her skin, and she tore her gaze away, forced it to the window. The world beyond was a foggy haze, gas lamps flickering past in rapid succession. The brickwork on the houses was fancier, and iron-scrolled fences appeared, often with small gardens.</p><p>They were nearly there. Suddenly Rosalind couldn\u2019t wait. She wanted to get out of this damned carriage, away from him. And it wasn\u2019t fear that motivated her desire, but rather the uncomfortable turmoil he left her thoughts in.</p><p>The carriage slowed, the rumble of the steam engine softening to a hiss as the furnace exhaled. Rosalind pressed her hand to the window, peering through the glass. He watched her, she knew. She could feel it on her skin, shivering down her spine. The thought almost tore a laugh from her lips, sharp-edged with panic.</p><p>Think of Nate. She pressed her lashes tightly together, desperately trying to picture her husband. For years he\u2019d haunted her thoughts, but she couldn\u2019t find him now\u2014only a vague outline, a hint of the smile that had won her heart.</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt you,\u201d Lynch said.</p><p>No doubt he could smell her nervousness, read it in the still lines of her body. But he misconstrued the reason behind it.</p><p>Opening her eyes, she noticed her breath fogging the glass. \u201cI know.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t allow him to hurt her. Taking a slow breath, her corset digging into her ribs, Rosalind pasted a smile on her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s the carriage. I\u2019m not fond of small spaces. Not for too long anyway.\u201d</p><p>His penetrating gaze bore into her. \u201cDon\u2019t touch your hands. Don\u2019t lock you up.\u201d A slow nod. \u201cI shall remember.\u201d</p><p>Finally the carriage eased to a halt. The door jerked open and Rosalind could barely contain herself. She wanted to get out with a desperation that bordered on anxiety. The walls were pressing in on her.</p><p>Garrett appeared, surprised to find her in the doorway so suddenly. He offered his arm in reflex, that insincere smile edging over his lips. A dangerously handsome man but far too pretty for her tastes. No her tastes ran darker, or so it seemed.</p><p>Rosalind ignored his arm and stepped down, pleased to be free of the carriage. The lack of its constraint lightened her soul. Her skirts spilled around her and she straightened them.</p><p>Garrett looked down beneath his lashes, as if considering his arm. He\u2019d made it clear he considered this a hunt and she the prey. Every affront only seemed to heighten his intensity, though it merely frustrated her.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like being touched.\u201d Lynch alighted with dangerous grace. \u201cOn the hands anyway.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. Was it her imagination, or was there actually a play of amusement around the hard line of his lips? A softening perhaps or hint of smoldering warmth in those glacial eyes?</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Garrett stepped aside with a smile that almost gleamed.</p><p>One punch with her metal hand and all those pretty white teeth would be scattered across the cobbles. Rosalind smiled at the thought and he smiled back, no doubt thinking he was winning her over.</p><p>The warmth faded out of Lynch as if it had never been there.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Lynch snapped his fingers and strode toward the house. \u201cStop trying to seduce my secretary, Garrett, and get your mind on the job. Mrs. Marberry, if you would kindly do what I\u2019m paying you to do. Feminine wiles are almost as teeth-grating as the vapors.\u201d</p><p>No softening there.</p><p>Rosalind stared after him with narrowed eyes, then grabbed her skirts in her fist and scurried after him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t paid me anything yet. And believe me, I have no interest in plying my \u2018feminine wiles.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He stopped abruptly at the front door of a large mansion, well lit from within. Rosalind nearly ran into him. Turning, he said, \u201cGarrett likes women, Mrs. Marberry. Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, Sir Jasper.\u201d She fluttered her eyelashes at him, goaded into sarcasm. \u201cI hadn\u2019t figured that out at all.\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re mocking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaking me for a fool.\u201d</p><p>Another hot glare that unnerved her. \u201cI dislike women who think they\u2019re smarter than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m smarter.\u201d To her own credit she didn\u2019t emphasize the word \u201cthink.\u201d \u201cAnd it seems you dislike women in general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I simply find little use for them.\u201d</p><p>This time she could feel her cheeks heating. \u201cBeyond the obvious.\u201d</p><p>His gaze traced her mouth. \u201cMrs. Marberry. This is precisely what I wished to avoid with my men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was Rosa? Now I am Mrs. Marberry?\u201d</p><p>A long, steady look. \u201cYou are always Mrs. Marberry. To me. For convenience sake, you are Rosa.\u201d</p><p>She looked around. \u201cAnd we\u2019re alone, Sir Jasper.\u201d On the stoop of a Georgian town house, the wind whipping his great cloak around her in a cocoon of intimacy. Rosalind took a shallow breath. But this was what she wanted, she decided\u2014to discover the man\u2019s weakness. And it seemed, from the way he was looking at her, that he did find some use for women. Or perhaps for redheads in particular. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was easy to smile, to play at being Rosa Marberry, now she was out of that carriage. She slipped into the role as if it were a second skin. All of the disquieting thoughts she simply shoved aside. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my supposed wicked tendencies are bothering your men at all.\u201d</p><p>But bothering him. Ah, yes. She smiled, let her gaze drop beneath her heavy lashes. It helped to think of him as a man, not a blue blood, to pretend that he was only human.</p><p>If she pretended he was only a man, then she could admit that he was quite a fine figure of one. It was no wonder she felt this odd attraction. The thought eased her nervousness. It meant nothing. Lynch\u2019s silence was troubling. Expression flickered over his face when she looked up, but so minutely that she could not decipher it. He was an observer, she realized. Always watching, always thinking. She wondered what conclusions he drew as he examined her. Wondered if he could see right through her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll say this once,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIf I suspect you are having inappropriate relations with any of my men, the position will be forfeit immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not allowed to smile at any of them?\u201d</p><p>Stillness. Then: \u201cOf course you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor that is all it was,\u201d she replied tersely. \u201cGarrett holds no interest for me as a man. He laughs too much and he wears far too much cologne.\u201d She gathered her skirts. \u201cNow, if that is settled, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cFollow me then, Rosa. If you feel the urge to cast up your accounts, please don\u2019t do it on the bodies.\u201d</p> <p>With that he strode past her, his broad shoulders framed by the elegant chandelier in the entry. Rosalind licked her lips and gave a frustrated sigh as she hurried after him. The man was infuriating.</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Garrett muttered, standing in the middle of the foyer and turning in circles as he examined the scene.</p><p>Lynch moved slowly, cataloging each inch of room and analyzing it. One of the servants lay on the grand staircase. She\u2019d obviously tried to flee before Lord Falcone got to her. The woman lay sprawled across the carpeted stairs in her mobcap and apron, blood dripping from the torn gash in her throat. It was messy\u2014made with blunt teeth and not a blade.</p><p>The butler had almost made it to the door before he too was cut down. A spreading pool of blood beneath his crumpled body soaked into the carpet. Lynch\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as the Haversham case,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFalcone was more interested in killing them by this stage. No doubt he glutted himself upstairs.\u201d Kneeling down, he touched the sticky pool beneath the butler. His vision blurred momentarily, his sense of smell heightening even as his mouth watered. He wanted to touch his fingertip to his tongue but years of control had taught him better.</p><p>Behind him, Rosa scribbled furiously in her notepad, taking down his words. Her skin was pale, her lips compressed, but she gave no other sign that this scene bothered her\u2014or she was determined not to.</p> <p>Rubbing his fingertips together, he looked up the stairs. Golden lamplight bathed the walls. Falcone had not bothered to update to modern conveniences like gaslight. Some of the older blue bloods were like that.</p><p>Perry slipped silently into the room, her dark hair slicked back beneath a cap. \u201cA bloodbath,\u201d she murmured, exchanging an uneasy glance with Garrett. Her nostrils flared, scenting the air, the blood. As one of the five who made up Lynch\u2019s Hand\u2014his best\u2014she needed to be on scene. Perry had gifts of her own, beyond driving a steam carriage through hairpin turns at breakneck speed. With one sniff she could place a man to the London borough he came from.</p><p>\u201cFind Falcone,\u201d Lynch commanded. \u201cI want a full CV count by morning.\u201d If Falcone had been close to the Fade, Lynch needed to know.</p><p>Barrons appeared at the top of the stairs, lean and moving with a swordsman\u2019s grace. Dressed in black velvet, the only sign of color was a ruby stickpin in the stark white cravat at his throat.</p><p>\u201cBarrons.\u201d Lynch nodded, a sign of respect to the young lord. Barrons was often involved in matters requiring an inquisitive mind. Their paths crossed regularly at these events; no doubt the prince consort wished to be kept apprised.</p><p>\u201cFalcone\u2019s up here,\u201d Barrons called, his voice carrying the inflection of the well bred. \u201cHe\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill alive?\u201d Lynch hurried up the stairs. Behind him came the swish of skirts and the lemon-and-linen smell he couldn\u2019t quite escape.</p><p>The two men exchanged a look.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can call it that. I\u2019ve managed to subdue him in the study. I\u2019ll warn you, it\u2019s not pretty,\u201d Barrons said, his gaze drifting over Lynch\u2019s shoulder toward Rosa.</p><p>\u201cIt rarely is,\u201d Lynch replied. He had the brief instinct to step in front of her, his shoulders bristling.</p><p>Barrons didn\u2019t have the look of a man eyeing a fine woman, but something about his perusal chilled Lynch to the core. He turned and offered his hand to Rosa to help her up the last three steps.</p><p>She eyed it for a moment, then reached out with her right hand and accepted it. Too late, he recalled her aversion to being touched there. But then her warm, slim fingers were sliding over his, the kid leather beneath his touch smooth and well-worn.</p><p>\u201cBarrons, this is Mrs. Marberry, my new secretary,\u201d he introduced.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure.\u201d Barrons nodded.</p><p>Rosa smiled, but Lynch had the feeling it wasn\u2019t genuine. \u201cThe pleasure is mine, my lord. I never expected to be rubbing shoulders with someone from the Council of Dukes itself.\u201d</p><p>Barrons studied her, then glanced away. \u201cAn honorary member, my dear. I stand in my father\u2019s place until he recovers.\u201d</p><p>Lynch said nothing. The Duke of Caine had been afflicted with a mysterious illness for years. The chances of him recovering were slim and Barrons knew it.</p><p>The fact that the craving virus was a possessive disease was not unknown. It tolerated no other viruses or illnesses in its host\u2019s body. Yet few dared tell Barrons that to his face. He knew it. The man was no fool, after all.</p><p>Whatever illness afflicted his father, he kept rumors of it under lock and key.</p><p>Barrons gestured toward the study. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019d best view Falcone first. Your men can deal with the bodies. They\u2019re through there.\u201d He gestured behind him, at the library and the bedrooms.</p><p>Though Lynch wanted to see the bodies himself, Falcone was of the greater interest to him. \u201cI was unable to examine Haversham properly. He\u2019d killed himself before we arrived. I thought it guilt at the time.\u201d</p><p>Barrons shot him a sober look. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. I don\u2019t believe Haversham had enough control of his senses to suffer such an emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you think he was murdered? I examined the body myself. The entry and exit wounds seemed consistent with suicide and powder burn was found on his hands and jaw. I could smell other people on his skin, but I assumed they were his victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t believe Haversham had the faculty to kill himself.\u201d</p><p>They strode along the carpeted hall. It was darker here, a single candle burning in the sconce.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I expect?\u201d he asked. \u201cWas Falcone close to the Fade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcone\u2019s barely forty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s neither rhyme nor reason to the Fade,\u201d Lynch argued. \u201cSometimes the virus colonizes a man swifter than it does others. I\u2019ve seen an eighty-year-old with a CV count as low as twenty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of albinism,\u201d Barrons countered. \u201cHis skin carries a healthy glow, his hair is still light brown, and his eyes are hazel. If his CV count were higher, his color would have begun to fade before now.\u201d</p><p>Muffled screams began to penetrate. Lynch\u2019s gaze locked on the closed study. \u201cHow precisely did you subdue him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shot him with a dart of hemlock,\u201d Barrons replied. \u201cIt paralyzed him for barely a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minute?\u201d Rosa blurted.</p><p>Lynch had almost forgotten her. Almost.</p><p>The two men looked back.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve read of these new hemlock concoctions in a scientific journal. I thought they paralyzed a blue blood for nearly ten minutes?\u201d</p><p>No scientific journal would dare speak of such a thing. Lynch\u2019s lashes lowered in consideration, running over her. The propaganda pamphlets the humanists printed, however, were a different story. Did his secretary have humanist tendencies? Or was she simply one of the many curious in London who read the pamphlets when they were distributed?</p><p>He knew a man, an informant who was emphatically loyal to the Echelon, who liked to read the pamphlets, regardless of his loyalties. Jovan thought the caricatures of the prince consort as a pale, bloated vulture hovering over the queen were humorous.</p><p>\u201cThe amount of time the concoction paralyzes depends upon the amount of craving virus in the blood,\u201d Barrons explained. \u201cThe higher the CV levels, the quicker paralysis wears off. I\u2019ve tested it on myself, actually. It takes me four and a half minutes to begin regaining control of my limbs.\u201d</p><p>Which meant Barrons had a high CV count. Lynch filed that away for future thought.</p><p>\u201cThen if Lord Falcone doesn\u2019t have a high CV count, how on earth did he manage to recover so swiftly?\u201d Rosa frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat is the question,\u201d Barrons said. \u201cThere\u2019s no explanation. In fact, there\u2019s no explanation for his state at all.\u201d</p><p>The three of them stopped in front of the study door. From within came the muffled sounds of a thud. Then something splintered.</p><p>Barrons reached grimly for the dart gun at his side. \u201cI tied him to the chair,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI believe he\u2019s just broken it. Be prepared for anything.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for the door, he eased it open and slipped inside. Lynch clutched his cane-sword and glanced at Rosa. \u201cStay there,\u201d he snapped, and hurried after Barrons. If he allowed the Duke of Caine\u2019s heir to get killed, then his own head would be forfeit.</p><p>The room was silent and dark, a breeze blowing through the gauzy curtains. The splintered remains of the chair littered a rug in front of the desk, with rope discarded in bloodied pools.</p><p>Barrons hurried to the window and looked out. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe must have gone through it.\u201d</p><p>The hair along the back of Lynch\u2019s neck lifted.</p><p>\u201cThis is a catastrophe. If he gets loose in the city, it\u2019ll cause mass hysteria,\u201d Barrons said. \u201cWe have to capture him before he goes too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we dealing with here?\u201d Lynch asked, aware of everything the young lord had not said in front of Rosa.</p><p>\u201cA blue blood acting like he\u2019s in the Fade when he isn\u2019t. Presume you\u2019re facing a vampire, Lynch, and you might come close to the truth.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stilled. Becoming such a creature was the only fear a blue blood had. A vampire could kill hundreds before he was brought down\u2014and had in the past. But the Echelon had become adept at controlling such matters. If a lord somehow managed to alter his CV readings, then the telltale signs of the Fade began to show in his flesh. He began to stink of rot, his body slowly deforming into a wiry, maggot-pale quadrupedal creature.</p><p>The hair along his spine tickled. Lynch scrubbed at the back of his neck. Barrons strode past him toward the door but Lynch hesitated. He could smell something now. Something sweet, like flavored ices or sugared buns.</p><p>Blood dripped.</p><p>\u201cBarrons,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t think he went out the window.\u201d</p><p>The lord reached for the door, his gaze snapping back over his shoulder. Lynch slowly rolled his eyes up and Barrons\u2019s head lifted. He didn\u2019t need to see what had caught the lord\u2019s attention to know where Falcone was.</p><p>Barrons jerked his pistol up and Lynch dove out of the way as the man who\u2019d once been Falcone dropped from the plaster ceiling. It landed where he\u2019d been standing and as Lynch rolled to his feet, it sprang for Barrons.</p><p>Gunfire spat in the dark room, momentarily singeing Lynch\u2019s vision. All he could see were a pair of dark forms grappling and then Barrons\u2019s yelp as the young lord went down.</p><p>Lynch had his own pistol up, but the center of his vision was a mess of glittering lights. Leaping forward, he reached for Falcone and yanked with all his strength, tearing the creature off the fallen lord. Blood stained the air. He could taste it in his mouth, smell it thick in his nostrils. There was no time to see the damage however. Falcone twisted in a way not even a blue blood should be able to and leaped for him.</p><p>A blow smashed into his hand and the pistol skittered across the floor. Lynch ground his teeth as his arm was nearly wrenched clean out of the socket. He twisted back, avoiding another blow, and finally caught a good look at his adversary.</p><p>Falcone\u2019s face twisted in an expression of rage, his eyes bloodshot and wild. Nothing human lurked there. Blood matted his hair and clothes, and the nails on his hand were sharp. Lynch had a split second to examine him before they raked toward his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parrying with the cane-sword, he barely managed to block the first blow, then the next one, let alone use it to his advantage. Falcone was monstrously fast and each blow echoed up the muscle in Lynch\u2019s forearm. Lynch ripped the sword free of the cane, but Falcone lashed out, nails screaming on steel as he knocked it out of Lynch\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d Barrons yelled, scrambling upright. Blood bubbled on his lips and his chest was a raw mess. He clutched at the stained velvet, trying to drag himself into a sitting position against the wall.</p><p>Falcone\u2019s head turned at the sound and Lynch seized his chance. He leaped forward, tackling the man to the floor and using his own considerable strength to force Falcone onto his face. Yanking on an arm, he wrenched it up, putting a shoulder lock on the creature.</p> <p>Light flooded into the room as the door opened.</p><p>Lynch recoiled from the bright glare just as Falcone gave a mighty heave beneath him. Rosa rushed inside, backlit by the light, a pistol in her hands and her face grim as her eyes locked on him.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cGet out of the house!\u201d</p><p>Falcone strained, the tendons in his shoulder tearing. Lynch could feel his grip slipping, and horror sank its cold claws into his gut as he saw Rosa\u2019s jaw drop in surprise.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d he screamed as Falcone rolled and threw him aside.</p> <p>Lynch hit the wall, the breath whooshing out of him. He landed on hands and knees, just in time to see Rosa flee down the corridor. Falcone went after her in a blur.</p><p>\u201cPerry! Garrett!\u201d He shoved off the wall and lurched toward the door. Something hurt in his side. Maybe a cracked rib. No time though. He had to stop Falcone\u2014before the creature tore Rosa\u2019s throat out.</p><p>That thought burned through his chest like fire. Tearing through the door, he saw the flap of Falcone\u2019s coattails as the lord bounded down the stairs. Rosa screamed out of sight and a gun barked.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Garrett\u2019s voice echoed through the entry.</p><p>Lynch sprinted along the corridor as shouts broke out. He didn\u2019t know what was happening. More gunfire coughed. Perry screamed Garrett\u2019s name and then the gunfire fell silent.</p><p>Vaulting over the rail of the staircase, Lynch leaped through the air, raking the scene with a sharp glance. Rosa tripped on the bottom step and went sprawling. Garrett was down, clawing at his chest. He was perhaps the only reason Rosa was still alive. Falcone had stopped to attack him first.</p> <p>Lynch landed hard on the marble foyer below, the vibration shivering up his legs. Falcone ignored him, leaping on Rosa and riding her to the ground. Her head cracked on the marble tiles and the gun in her hand tumbled free.</p><p>No!</p><p>Blind rage turned his vision to shadows. The demon in him\u2014the hungry, darker side of him\u2014rose with a choking grip until he could barely see. The next thing he knew, he was hauling the creature off Rosa and throwing it into the wall. Falcone gathered his feet under him as he hit and rebounded off it with athletic grace.</p><p>Lynch had a knife in his hand before he knew it. Falcone hit him hard, blunt teeth sinking into his throat. Lynch drove the knife up, deep into the creature\u2019s chest. As if realizing his intentions, Falcone jerked, his jaw opening. Lynch grabbed him and yanked him over his shoulder, slamming the lord flat on the ground. His bone handled knife hilt gleamed in the golden light, and he knelt down, using his knee to shove it home as he grabbed Falcone by the head and snapped his neck.</p><p>Silence fell, broken only by the gasping wheeze from Garrett\u2019s throat.</p><p>Lynch staggered off the body, the shadows draining from his vision. He felt light-headed all of a sudden. Rosa was on her feet, her mouth parted in shock as she stared at him.</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d he snarled, stabbing a finger toward her. One last glance at Falcone\u2014he wasn\u2019t getting up again\u2014and he staggered toward Garrett.</p><p>Perry was on her knees, hands clamped over the wound on Garrett\u2019s chest.</p> <p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Lynch demanded. Not Garrett. He\u2019d been only a boy when Lynch took him on, streetwise and full of an insincere charm he used to protect himself, running along at Lynch\u2019s heels, emulating him, driving him insane with a thousand and one questions.</p><p>He reached out and tilted Garrett\u2019s head to the side.</p><p>Garrett winced. \u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d he gasped. With a bloody smile, he added, \u201cCan\u2019t leave so many bereft women behind. They\u2019ll be...crying for days.\u201d</p><p>Perry shrugged out of her coat and pressed it over the mess in Garrett\u2019s chest. Lynch saw blood pumping through an artery and felt the iron grip of those icy fingers rake his gut again. The heart. Falcone had hit the heart. There was no surer way to kill a blue blood.</p><p>\u201cHe needs a physician,\u201d Perry said in an emotionless tone, but that didn\u2019t mean she felt nothing. When she looked up, light gleamed off her eyes, suspiciously bright. \u201cFast.\u201d</p><p>Lynch straightened and looked around. \u201cWhere the bloody hell are the Coldrush Guards Barrons brought with him?\u201d</p><p>Nobody could answer that.</p><p>\u201cRosa, I need you to fetch help,\u201d he said, trying to prioritize needs in his mind. Lynch liked Barrons enough that he didn\u2019t wish to see the lord die\u2014but more than that, he knew losing the Duke of Caine\u2019s heir would be a monumental catastrophe. Garrett however...Garrett was personal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him, sir,\u201d Perry said softly, seeing the dilemma in his face.</p><p>He nodded shortly. \u201cBarrons is down. I need to see if he\u2019s going to survive. Rosa, send for a physician or a doctor. Even a bloody midwife will do.\u201d</p><p>Rosa\u2019s gloved hands were clenched in her navy skirts as she stared at him with those liquid-dark eyes. She made no move to obey.</p><p>Had the fright shocked her insensible? \u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d Her lips compressed, a hint of defiance glinting in her eyes. \u201cQuite badly.\u201d</p><p>He slapped a hand to his throat and felt the wetness there. The room stank of blood\u2014most of it not his, thank goodness. But the smell of it... Lynch almost groaned, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. That was the only sign of his discomposure, but she saw it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had worse,\u201d Lynch said, tugging the collar of his leather coat up. Gesturing toward the door, he added, \u201cHurry. Before the others bleed to death. And then make sure you stay outside until this is dealt with.\u201d</p><p>Lynch needed her out of here. He\u2019d not risk her life again and right now, with the way she was looking at him and the intoxicating scent of blood, he just might be the one who lost control.</p><p>Rosalind shivered on the doorstep of the mansion, tucking her cape-jacket tight about her shoulders. More of the Nighthawks had arrived in the last hour, as well as a pair of physicians and enough Coldrush Guards to secure the mansion. Crowds of curious onlookers loomed beyond their impassive forms, desperate to know more of what had happened.</p><p>\u201cWas it them humanists?\u201d a blue blood lord called, his top hat bobbing in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cA vampire?\u201d another cried, waving his walking stick.</p><p>Panic edged their voices and the crowd murmured. Rosalind edged back into the concealment of the trailing roses that cascaded over the entrance and tugged her bonnet up around her face. Nobody would know her here, yet vulnerability rode her. She was surrounded by too many blue bloods\u2014half the Echelon it seemed, clad in their flamboyant velvets and silks. Even at this time of the day, gaudy feathers bobbed in ladies\u2019 bonnets and Rosalind caught a glimpse of several white wigs and powdered faces in the crowd\u2014older blue bloods, by the look of it, those still mired in fashions from the past. Or perhaps seeking to hide the effects of the Fade. Who knew?</p><p>\u201cRosa?\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s voice cut through her scrutiny. Rosalind turned swiftly, her skirts slithering over the tiled portico and her heart leaping into her throat. She was used to keeping a cool head in moments of stress, but once the excitement had settled, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop her heart from pounding. So close. Falcone\u2019s eyes had been full of madness and hunger. She\u2019d heard his harsh panting as he chased her down the hall, knowing that she\u2019d never make it in time, knowing that he would have her... And then Garrett had looked up, his eyes widening in shock before he smoothly drew his pistol and put a bullet into Falcone\u2019s chest.</p><p>He\u2019d saved her life. A second more and Falcone would have had her. As it was, the shot had barely slowed him. Rosalind had stumbled down the stairs, Garrett launching himself past her to meet the maddened lord\u2014another action that saved her.</p><p>It was easy to despise the blue bloods after everything they\u2019d done to her, but Garrett had risked his life for hers without a thought. She didn\u2019t like that. It didn\u2019t fit her view of the world.</p><p>Lynch had tried to hastily wash the blood from his skin and rake his hair back into place, but the same feverish glow that burned in her chest lit his eyes. \u201cI need you. Come.\u201d</p><p>Tugging her notebook and pencil out of her reticule, Rosalind followed him inside. The stale scent of death seemed to permeate the air in the grim afternoon light and two of the Coldrush Guards were stationed inside. Her gaze went immediately to where Lynch had launched himself over the railing of the banister. He\u2019d landed lightly, the edges of his long leather coat flaring around him, his eyes cold with purpose, before he\u2019d thrown himself at Falcone. Killed him in fact, with grim, efficient purpose. She hadn\u2019t missed the way he\u2019d moved; someone had taught him a brutal fighting style. Falcone had been stronger and faster, but Lynch knew how to disable a man with a few swift chops of the hand.</p><p>Rosalind looked up, light gleaming through the facets of the chandelier above. A good twenty-foot drop and he\u2019d handled it like it were a step off the porch. A shiver worked its way along her spine.</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>Blue bloods were superior in strength and speed to a human, but that didn\u2019t always mean the balance was uneven. A trained assassin could cut down an untrained blue blood in hand-to-hand combat. Someone like Lynch though? Impossible.</p><p>If he ever realized who she was, Rosalind had no intentions of getting close enough to him to find out who would win.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Lynch said, gesturing to the body by the stairs. Someone had draped a sheet over the corpse, but it clung wetly to Falcone, drenched in blood. \u201cWrite this down. We\u2019ve taken an analysis of Falcone\u2019s CV levels with the portable brass spectrometer. They came in at fifty-three percent. Note: Request Haversham\u2019s CV levels when we return.\u201d</p><p>The butler was covered with a coat someone had found. Rosalind frowned. \u201cDo you usually cover the bodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d done it for her then. Her pencil paused, scratching to a halt. Then she hastily wrote the rest of his words.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I can determine, Falcone was in the dining room with his family when the...seizure...took him,\u201d he continued, starting up the stairs. \u201cHis cup was nearly full, but the decanter levels indicate he\u2019d partaken of a quart of blood. He shouldn\u2019t have been driven by the craving. His CV levels indicate he was far from close to the Fade. Something caused this then. An outside influence? A toxin? Was the blood he was drinking tampered with? Or some hitherto unknown disease that afflicts blue bloods\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called, trying to scribble furiously in her writing pad as she followed him up the stairs.</p><p>Lynch waited. \u201cThis way.\u201d He started down the corridor, barely giving her pause. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Garrett?\u201d she asked, interrupting him. \u201cAnd the duke\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarrons is recovering in Falcone\u2019s room with the physicians. Thankfully his wounds are already healing, though they were serious enough at the time. As for Garrett, he\u2019s in the kitchen. Doyle arrived through the back with the rest of my men and he\u2019s trying to stitch him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he recover?\u201d The thought shouldn\u2019t have bothered her. One less blue blood for the world to worry about.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s dark lashes shuttered his eyes. \u201cGarrett\u2019s stronger than he appears, but he\u2019s lost a lot of blood. Perry had to give him some of hers.\u201d</p><p>He strode through the doors ahead of him. Rosalind followed, a fistful of skirts in her hand. He might not have cared, she thought. Truly, for all the emotion he showed, Garrett could have been any man off the street.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, gesturing to the dining room. Two bodies lay beneath the bloodied linens of the tablecloth. \u201cThis is where he was dining.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind stumbled on the doorstep, her gaze narrowing on the small shapes beneath the table cloth. So small... Her throat tightened, the blood draining out of her face. Shards of porcelain littered the floor, a spilled decanter flooding the mahogany tabletop with a pool of spreading red wine. It dripped from the edge in a steady, monotonous plummet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt smells like...a bakery,\u201d she murmured, swallowing hard against the flood of bile in the back of her throat. She couldn\u2019t look at them again. How could anyone slaughter their own children? What manner of monster could do that?</p><p>A blue blood, a voice whispered in her mind.</p><p>Lynch stared at the scene as though absorbing it. \u201cSo it does. As did Falcone.\u201d He turned to her to speak, then paused. \u201cRosa?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up and saw something that almost looked like concern on his face. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d The words dried up and she clapped a gloved hand to her lips. She wasn\u2019t all right. All she could see were those tiny, twisted shapes beneath the bloodied linen.</p><p>Movement blurred. A hand wrapped around her elbow, Lynch\u2019s large body stepping between her and the bodies. Then he was pushing her through the door, into the blinding light of well-lit corridor. The walls staggered by, a door opening in front of her. She moved like a puppet in his grasp, acid burning her throat.</p><p>Lynch pushed a window up and shoved her toward it. Fresh air swept that sickly sweet scent out of her nostrils and she clutched the window ledge, sucking in a choked breath. His hand settled in the small of her back tentatively, as if he wasn\u2019t sure how welcome his touch would be.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have taken you in there.\u201d Soft words. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind shook her head, swallowing hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d No matter how much she tried to shove the image away\u2014into that small dark recess of her mind where lurked unimaginable memories\u2014she couldn\u2019t. It was tattooed on the back of her eyelids, burning its way into her stomach and throat.</p> <p>A cool hand rubbed small circles against the curve of her spine. Rosalind gripped the sill and leaned out, drawing the coal-laden air of London into her lungs. Anything to rid herself of that bakery scent.</p><p>As if to distract herself, she focused on his touch. Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for,\u201d he replied, his cool exhale stirring the curls at the nape of her neck.</p><p>For the first time Rosalind realized how closely he stood, his legs pressing against her bustle and skirts. Nervousness etched its way down her spine. She hadn\u2019t forgotten the look in his eyes when he killed Falcone\u2014he\u2019d enjoyed it, licking the taste of blood from his lips. It should have sickened her further, yet she found she couldn\u2019t quite equate that monster with the man who stood behind her, his hand rubbing soothing circles against her skin.</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s body responded to his nearness, but not with lust, not with the way the previous scene still haunted her. Instead, she relaxed back into his touch, her head bowing low as she took some small, guilty comfort from his closeness. She didn\u2019t want to think about why his presence made her feel...safe?</p><p>She\u2019d stood alone for so long, walling herself off from others after her husband\u2019s death. She didn\u2019t need the softening of a man\u2019s touch or his presence to comfort her. She was strong enough without it.</p> <p>Rosalind stiffened. He had to stop touching her. She didn\u2019t like it. \u201cI\u2019m fine, sir.\u201d</p><p>His touch hesitated, his fingertips skating over the smooth taffeta of her gown. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>The sudden screaming absence of his touch made her feel almost cold. But no, that was nothing more than the chill breeze through the window. A shiver worked its way across her skin and she looked for anything to take her mind off the frozen melee of emotion that stirred her.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall you tell the crowd?\u201d she asked, examining the assembled blue bloods below.</p><p>\u201cThat we are investigating.\u201d His voice was hard again. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to be made aware of the full facts of the case.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s fingers tightened on the windowsill. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell them, they\u2019ll suspect worse. They\u2019re already crying \u2018vampire.\u2019\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019ve been too many people through the house: the Coldrush Guards, Lord Barrons, the physicians... You cannot keep all of them quiet. I would imagine it would be better to give the press some details, enough to still the fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cVery wise of you, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople fear what they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said with a glance over her shoulder, then abruptly regretted the words.</p> <p>Lynch stared back at her, his hands clasped behind his back. His gaze was hauntingly intense in the chill afternoon light. \u201cSo they do.\u201d Slowly he bowed his head. \u201cTake your time. I shall wait for you in the foyer when I\u2019m done speaking to the journalists.\u201d</p><p>She waited until she heard the door click behind her before letting out the breath she\u2019d been holding. A glance outside showed the crowd baying at the iron-scrolled fence, fury and fear etched in stark emotion across their faces. For a moment they looked almost human, then she pursed her lips, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>There was nothing human about a blue blood, nothing at all. No matter what she thought of Lynch, she could never forget that.</p><p>As she turned away, her eye caught on a solitary figure leaning against the corner across the street, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>With his cap pulled low over his face and a heavy coat obscuring his throat and jaw, she shouldn\u2019t have recognized him but she did. Mordecai. The leader of the mechs who\u2019d tried to bomb the tower.</p><p>The satisfaction curling over his lips was unmistakably his\u2014the smug grin that had always made her hackles rise. What was he doing here? Surveying his handiwork? Or simply enjoying the sight of the blue blood\u2019s distress?</p><p>Her iron fingers jerked inside her glove unconsciously. He\u2019d done something, she was certain of it. Somehow he\u2019d been the cause of this, the reason those two small bodies lay still and silent beneath the white table cloth.</p><p>The reason she couldn\u2019t find her brother Jeremy.</p><p>Rosalind was moving before she thought about it, the house a blur around her as she darted down the stairs to the foyer, her boot heels ringing on the polished tiles as she shoved the front door open.</p><p>Stopping on the edge of the portico, Rosalind caught her skirts in her hand in frustration. He was gone. The corner was empty, the crowd swallowing up any sign of him and trapping her here. There was no way she could push through them and the thought of being surrounded by so many of the enemy made her throat tighten.</p><p>I\u2019ll find you. Her eyes narrowed. Then she\u2019d make him regret ever sending her brother in to deliver the bomb.</p><p>Five</p><p>Fog lingered in the alleyways, seeming to lurk in the still corners and doorways where no breeze stirred. Rosalind dragged her shawl tight around her shoulders and moved swiftly through the evening crowd. The hairs on the back of her neck lifted. It was the silence, she decided, the way everybody\u2019s voices were muted and nobody would meet each other\u2019s gaze. Martial law had choked the city since the bombing, with metaljackets on every corner and rumors of humanists in every whisper. The unease was universal. Even she felt it, despite nerves that should have turned to steel long ago.</p><p>A quick glance at her pocket watch told her she\u2019d best hurry. It was almost half eight and she had to be home before nine. If she were caught out, she\u2019d be arrested.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, she took out her key in front of the door that led to her leased apartment. The door jerked open.</p><p>Rosalind slapped a hand to her chest as Ingrid glared at her over the threshold. \u201cDamn it, Ingrid. Are you trying to give me a fit of the nerves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNerves?\u201d Ingrid asked in a smoky voice. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind pushed past. The door slammed and then the lock clicked behind her as she tugged at her gloves, each finger at a time. She hated wearing them; they made her right hand sweat and it was difficult to grip a pistol with them. But if anyone caught a glimpse of her bio-mech hand, they\u2019d alert the authorities. It was clearly not enclave work.</p><p>Mech limbs never came cheaply and it sometimes took as many as fifteen years in the enclaves for a mech to pay off his debt. After they had worked off their bond, they often returned to the enclaves as free men\u2014or women. The streets of London weren\u2019t the same for a person with a mech enhancement. The Echelon saw them as less than human and, therefore, without even the punitive rights most humans lived by.</p><p>Sometimes Rosalind wondered if it would be better if she\u2019d not had the replacement, not that she\u2019d had the choice. It made her stand out and that was dangerous in her world. But it also gave her two working limbs and that was invaluable for an assassin.</p><p>Rosalind tossed the gloves aside, flexing her steel fingers. You\u2019re not an assassin anymore. But sometimes it still felt like it. Sometimes in the night she woke sweating, seeing a victim\u2019s face flash through her mind. It was the only time she couldn\u2019t protect herself from the memories.</p><p>There\u2019d been five of them in total. Balfour\u2019s enemies. At least she had the satisfaction of knowing they\u2019d been blue bloods. Still...</p><p>Shoving them aside, into that little mental compartment in her mind that she kept locked, she turned toward the sitting room and the decanter there. The fire was stoked, casting a merry light over the stuffed armchairs, with their wilted lace doilies clinging to the backs and a mahogany table between them. Sparse accommodations, but then she didn\u2019t truly live here. This was just a facade for her little game.</p><p>Silence lingered and she cast a distracted glance over her shoulder. Ingrid leaned against the doorjamb, a frown drawing her dark brows together. \u201cYou are nervous. I can smell it.\u201d</p><p>The problem with living with a verwulfen\u2014their enhanced senses could smell anything. Rosalind shrugged out of her cape and feathered hat, discarding them on an armchair. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve been dragged to Kensington and back, upstairs, downstairs, and then home again, with no luncheon or refreshment to speak of. The man\u2019s a machine\u2014a well-oiled machine that runs on fumes.\u201d</p><p>She sank into the remaining armchair and slumped in an unladylike manner. Lynch had been an unstoppable force today, his mind making leaps of logic that even she struggled to follow. He questioned everything, checking over every inch of the house. The only aberrance they\u2019d found had been a pair of small metal balls in the dining room that looked somewhat like the clockwork tumbler balls children played with in the streets. The sickly sweet smell lingered around them, though undoubtedly the children had been behind their presence.</p><p>Ingrid stepped closer, dragging a footstool forward and tugging Rosalind\u2019s boots up before straddling the edge of the footstool herself. \u201cGot something for you.\u201d</p><p>Slipping a slim, rectangular box out of her waistcoat, she handed it to Rosalind. From the weightlessness, the box might have been empty.</p><p>Rosalind opened it. A thin, pale glove of almost translucent material lay on crumpled tissue paper. The artistry was exquisite, with fine blue veins of cotton barely showing through the outer layer of synthetic skin and slick scars that looked like ancient burn marks marring the back of the hand. Small oval scales were embedded into the fingertips with painted half-moons and a rosy hue.</p><p>\u201cSynthetic skin,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man in Clerkenwell who knows someone who does this sort of thing. I asked him for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis must have cost a fortune.\u201d Rosalind looked up. \u201cIngrid, how did you pay for this?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes locked, the burnished gold of Ingrid\u2019s irises flaring. \u201cMade some money in the Pits,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cIngrid!\u201d The Pits were notorious dens in the East End where men pitted themselves against other men\u2014or even beasts. Sometimes the fights stopped when a contestant was unconscious. Sometimes not.</p><p>Forbidding it wouldn\u2019t stop the other woman. Indeed, quite the opposite. Still, she had to say something. \u201cYou\u2019re not invulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fighting helps to keep me temper under control. And I don\u2019t like you being unprepared. If the Nighthawk asks to see your hands,\u201d Ingrid said, \u201cthen what shall you do?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind slowly closed the lid over the glove. \u201cIt won\u2019t hold up under scrutiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But all you got to do is let him catch a glimpse so he don\u2019t start getting suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Rosalind murmured.</p><p>Ingrid nodded gruffly. She\u2019d never say how worried she was, but she was fretting and that would put her on edge. They\u2019d first met when Ingrid had been just a little girl, trapped in a cage in Balfour\u2019s menagerie. Rosalind had been well fed and cared for, but she had been a pawn-in-training, just as alone in some ways as Ingrid. The pair of them had struck up a friendship and eventually Balfour had let Ingrid out of the cage at times to duel with her. Of course, pitting her against an opponent who was stronger and faster than her, but untrained, had been nothing more than a test of her skills.</p><p>He\u2019d underestimated the bond the two girls had struck however. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ingrid cleared her throat \u201cNo word of Jeremy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to look. There was a massacre.\u201d Rosalind didn\u2019t know what else to call it. \u201cLord Falcone tore his household apart then tried to do the same to us.\u201d She swiftly relayed the day\u2019s events as Ingrid tugged off her boots. The woman dug her thumb into Rosalind\u2019s heels and her eyes glazed. She was half tempted to shut them, but the memory of Mordecai\u2019s face flashed through her mind. She\u2019d been trained to always finish her report, no matter what state she was in. \u201cI saw Mordecai there. He was outside, watching the house.\u201d</p><p>Ingrid froze, then her thumbs slowly resumed their massage. \u201cDid he have anything to do with it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Rosalind rubbed at her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to suspect they had some plan up their sleeve when they broke with us, something they didn\u2019t deem fit to share with the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA weapon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething that drives a blue blood into bloodlust.\u201d She\u2019d considered the thought many times today. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of the like. But why else would he be there? And how did he do it? Is it a poison? A toxin in the air or in Falcone\u2019s cup of blood? An injection perhaps?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, not an injection. Lynch had the body examined thoroughly this afternoon, back at headquarters. He wouldn\u2019t have missed something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind laughed mirthlessly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the man. He\u2019s painstakingly thorough.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m aware of half of his thought processes. There\u2019s nothing on his face, but I know he\u2019s thinking. Always thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes he suspect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe was distracted by the case.\u201d Rosalind considered the day\u2019s events and the way Lynch had glanced at her. \u201cAnd he would never suspect his pretty young secretary is his adversary. He\u2019s attracted to me.\u201d</p><p>Why had she blurted that out?</p><p>Ingrid\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou smell nervous again.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind shoved to her feet, her skirts swishing around her stockinged ankles. \u201cOf course I\u2019m nervous. The man\u2019s a blue blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t forget that,\u201d Ingrid said.</p> <p>\u201cI never forget.\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s face swam into her mind and a pang of grief soured Rosalind\u2019s embarrassment. She still felt his loss each night, when she slid into her blankets and he wasn\u2019t there. The days weren\u2019t so bad, but the nights... She had nothing to distract herself then.</p><p>The blue bloods had taken him away from her forever. It might have been Balfour\u2019s hand, but it was by the Council\u2019s edict. The threat of the humanist movement had been so terrifying to them that they\u2019d had a harmless dreamer of a man murdered.</p><p>She was not harmless however. Their mistake. For Nathaniel had been an orator, not a fighter. His war would have been fought in courts and in rallies. Hers would be fought in the streets, metaljackets against the enormous metal Cyclops army she\u2019d been building in Undertown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find Jeremy,\u201d she said hollowly. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to finish the Cyclops project and destroy the Echelon. I will never, ever forget how much they\u2019ve taken from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lynch?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind clasped her hands behind her back and stared unseeing at the wall. This time a new image overtook Nathaniel\u2019s. One of carved features with the sharp aquiline nose and piercing gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with him,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cOne way or another.\u201d</p><p>Lynch eased open the door and slipped inside the room. The surgery was small with only the most basic of operating facilities. The craving virus healed almost anything short of decapitation, hence there was no need for more, and the Council funds barely covered the men\u2019s wages and upkeep.</p> <p>The sound of rasped breathing filled the air. It wasn\u2019t loud, and yet in the midnight silence of the room, it seemed as if every man in the place should hear it.</p><p>A phosphorescent glimmer ball turned the room a sickly green. Tucked in the narrow bed, the stark sheets pulled up underneath his chin, Garrett slept restlessly. There was no sweat on his forehead\u2014a blue blood couldn\u2019t perspire\u2014but the sickly pallor of his skin spoke of fever.</p><p>Perry slumped in the chair beside the bed, her head resting in her hand as she dozed. Lynch let the door click shut behind him and her eyes blinked open, her hand straying to the knife at her side.</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>Lynch gestured for her to relax, then crossed to the bed, staring down at the wounded man. He\u2019d had frequent reports from Doctor Gibson all evening, but he still had to ask. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked for you,\u201d she said, a touch of reproof in her voice.</p><p>Lynch nodded. He came because he had to\u2014and because the not coming would haunt him all night\u2014but he didn\u2019t want to be here. Any blue blood that was so injured as to be bedridden was unlikely to get up again. And Garrett... Damn him, Garrett was one of his.</p><p>\u201cI should have...\u201d His words trailed off. He didn\u2019t know what to say. I should have taken one of the others. I should have stopped Falcone. I should have been faster...</p><p>The truth was hard to admit. \u201cI failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than I did. I was right there, sir. I saw Falcone coming and\u2014I didn\u2019t expect it. I froze. Garrett didn\u2019t. If I\u2019d been one second faster he wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be lying there instead,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cHas his breathing changed?\u201d</p><p>Perry shook her head, her dark hair curling around her face. She\u2019d clipped it short enough that no one could get a handful of it, and he\u2019d seen hints of blond at the roots over the years to know she dyed it.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d The words were soft. Broken.</p><p>Lynch looked at her sharply and saw her dark gray eyes were gleaming. He went still, his stomach clenching. Bloody hell. He rarely thought of her as a woman. He\u2019d never needed to. Perry always did her job, rarely voicing a word of dissent. Rarely voicing anything, as a matter of fact.</p><p>She\u2019d come to him nine years ago, a trembling waif in the rain, her dyed hair tumbling around her shoulders and the hunger burning in her eyes. The clip of an aristocratic accent had flavored her words and though he knew some of her secrets, he never mentioned it. Perry wasn\u2019t the only Nighthawk hiding from her past.</p><p>Perry was an accident, he guessed. Women were never offered the Blood Rites for fear that the hunger would overwhelm their delicate sensibilities. The only other exception was the Duchess of Casavian, and she had the power of a great house behind her.</p><p>She\u2019d shorn her hair that first night and swathed herself in the uniform he\u2019d presented to her\u2014having a shortage of any other garments\u2014and that was how she\u2019d stayed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d Perry took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cGarrett\u2019s my partner. I just feel...so helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He squeezed Perry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIf anyone could survive, it\u2019d be him, the stubborn bastard.\u201d Then he winced as he heard what he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, with a weak smile. \u201cI just hate seeing him like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate seeing any of them like this.\u201d</p><p>Forty years since he\u2019d formed the Nighthawks. A lot of good men had died in that time. The Council didn\u2019t care. They were only rogues. But they were his, each and every one of them. Lynch frowned, feeling the steady muscle of Perry\u2019s shoulder beneath his palm. It grounded him and he realized he rarely touched anyone anymore.</p><p>He had once. He\u2019d shared his meals with his men, even laughed with them, but that had died over the years, as they had. And slowly he\u2019d stopped taking his meals with them. He\u2019d buried himself in the job, until the names of the dead meant another strike, another failure on his behalf\u2014but nothing more.</p><p>So why did Garrett lying here like this effect him so much?</p><p>He knew the answer immediately. Garrett refused to keep his distance, his humor wearing away at even Lynch\u2019s determination to keep his distance.</p><p>Cor, sir, don\u2019t you look dapper this evening. Why, put a smile on your face and half the gentry morts from here to the city would be lining up.</p><p>Perry leaned her head against his hand, as if she took some solace from his touch. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he did it. Garrett always said heroics are for fools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he was trying to impress someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Marberry,\u201d Perry said with a frown.</p><p>The thought of Garrett and Mrs. Marberry together darkened Lynch\u2019s mood. To hide it, he said, \u201cWell, the only other option is you or I\u2014and I don\u2019t think he wants to get either of us into bed.\u201d</p><p>Perry stilled. \u201cNo, sir. I believe not.\u201d She drew her knees up to her chest and rested her chin on them. The motion jerked her shoulder out of his grasp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, sir. You\u2019re right, after all.\u201d A smile edged her lips, as if she were trying to make him feel better, but her gray eyes were still lost. \u201cYou\u2019re not his type in the least.\u201d</p><p>Lynch almost choked. \u201cHell, I should hope not.\u201d</p><p>She patted his hand. \u201cYou should go and get some sleep. I\u2019ll keep watch.\u201d</p><p>It was the opening he needed. Lynch pushed himself to his feet, though sleep was the last thing on his mind. He desperately needed it, but there was too much to do. And guilt was ever a harsh mistress. He snuck a glance at Garrett. No. No sleep tonight.</p><p>\u201cSend word,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIf the situation changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Perry knew precisely what he spoke of. Her hand slid over Garrett\u2019s, as if she unconsciously sought to keep him from death\u2019s door, through pure persistence if nothing else.</p><p>Lynch took his leave with quiet efficiency. Through the door he could still hear the faint rasp as Garrett\u2019s abused lungs sucked in another tortured breath.</p><p>His chest constricted and Lynch shoved away from the door. Sickrooms. Bloody sickrooms. He hated them.</p><p>Six</p><p>Lynch wrenched his head out of his hands as the door to his study burst open, pain flaring behind his eyes. His vision slowly adjusted and he blinked, looking at the scattered paper strewn across his desk. Messy handwritten notes covered half of them\u2014scrawled ramblings he\u2019d made last night as he let his mind sort through the previous day\u2019s events. The tumbler balls. A sticky residue on the sill. Some sort of sweet smell that lingered on Falcone\u2019s body. And underlined three times. Mrs. Marberry: Why does she have a pistol?</p><p>Doyle went straight to the fire and stoked it, sending a gush of smoke through the room. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been three solid nights in a gin \u2019ouse. Smell like it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Lynch replied, scraping his hair back out of his face. He must have dozed off. \u201cI know what a gin house smells like.\u201d</p><p>Pushing to his feet, he staggered toward the liquor cabinet in the corner. Thick, viscous blood pooled in one of the decanters. For a moment his vision sharpened, the color leeching out of his sight. His hand shook as he unstoppered the decanter and poured himself a short glass.</p><p>Staring out through the windows at the gray morning, he drained the blood. The taste of it burned through him, igniting desire in his belly like the hot stroke of a woman\u2019s touch. Lynch forced himself to put the glass aside and stoppered the decanter again. He rationed himself strictly\u2014a necessary evil. No matter how much he thirsted for more, he never allowed it. It was one of the few methods he used to control his unnatural hungers. Meditation was another.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Garrett?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cStill breathin\u2019,\u201d Doyle replied, wiping his hands on his trousers as he turned. His own expression was inscrutable. They never spoke of it amongst themselves, but every Nighthawk knew the risks of the job.</p><p>Every hour Garrett survived meant increased hope that the craving virus was healing him. He might survive. Might.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Doyle muttered, tugging a letter out of his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s got the gold seal on it.\u201d</p><p>The Council then. Lynch snatched it and broke the seal with his thumbnail. His gaze raked over the words, any warmth draining from his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Doyle asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cA summons,\u201d he replied, striding toward the set of rooms he kept off his study. \u201cAt eleven at the tower.\u201d</p><p>Doyle followed him into the bedroom. \u201cAye, its not good news then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d The last time he\u2019d received a summons, it had come with a threat. This reeked of the prince consort\u2019s touch. A reminder of his absolute power? Or something far more sinister? He was growing bloody tired of being jerked around like a puppet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSend for my horse to be saddled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Doyle replied.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll need a pair of lads to escort me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be waitin\u2019 at the stables.\u201d Doyle restrained himself from giving Lynch a telling look. He knew his job. \u201cA pair of the latest recruits. Still so new they piss their pants at the sound o\u2019 your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreferably not in the Council chambers.\u201d</p><p>Lynch poured a pitcher of warm water into his shaving bowl and made short work of the task. Doyle wasn\u2019t far wrong. With his bloodshot eyes and the thick, dark stubble along his jaw, he looked rather more like a miscreant than the respectable Guild Master.</p><p>Doyle yanked open his closet and fetched the black velvet coat Lynch wore to court and a crisp, white shirt that had been starched to within an inch of its life. \u201cWe\u2019d best get you ready then. The gray waistcoat? Or the black checked one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack.\u201d Lynch dragged the heavy leather carapace of the breastplate off over his head, then shrugged out of his undershirt. He stripped completely and gave himself a brisk wash.</p> <p>\u201cI want last night\u2019s reports on my desk by the time I return,\u201d he instructed. \u201cAnd Doctor Gibson\u2019s final autopsy results on Lord Falcone. If you can, have his blood run through the brass spectrometer again. I know his CV count came in normal, but I want to see if it\u2019s changed at all. The craving virus tends to survive in the tissues after death for several days. Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s still within its normal ranges. And send Byrnes to question the Haversham heir again.\u201d</p><p>Doyle threw the shirt at him. Lynch toweled himself off, then dressed quickly. The stark white of the shirt was the only sign of color. Doyle tossed him a black silk cravat and Lynch tied it swiftly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lynch said, on his way out the door. \u201cMrs. Marberry is due at nine. Show her to my study and instruct her to begin transcribing my notes into the formal case file.\u201d He paused. \u201cSee that somebody sends her some tea or...something.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d realized last evening that he\u2019d barely fed her the previous day.</p><p>Doyle nodded. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Lynch opened his mouth. Then shut it again. Doyle was giving him a long-suffering look. The man had been with him for forty years, as evidenced by the gray in his hair. He might be only human, but he knew his job.</p> <p>\u201cVery well then,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Lynch entered the atrium of the Ivory Tower, bowing his head to the seated Council members.</p><p>Two chairs remained empty. Barrons was most likely still indisposed from Falcone\u2019s attack and the chair of the Duke of Lannister had been shrouded in black since his murder.</p><p>The sign of mourning was a mockery. Lynch had proved that the duke had known of the bombing before it occurred and still said nothing. If the duke hadn\u2019t died in the assault, then the prince consort would have had him executed regardless. Even now the Council seat stood empty, the prince consort obliterating the House of Lannister in his rage.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s fingers dipped into his pocket, automatically fingering the scrap of leather there. Hers. There\u2019d been three other people in the same room as the duke when he died, and Mercury had been one of them.</p><p>Ignoring the man in the center of the brass circle that was cut into the tiles\u2014Sir Richard Maitland, that lickspittle\u2014Lynch strode to his side and turned to face the Council. The enmity between the Nighthawks and the Coldrush Guards had always boiled under the surface and Lynch would have liked nothing better than to drop the Master of the Guards off the top of the tower.</p><p>The prince consort\u2019s face was expressionless, the queen\u2019s hand resting on his shoulder as she stood beside him and stared distantly over Lynch\u2019s shoulder. None of the other councilors showed so much as a glimmer of their intentions.</p><p>\u201cSir Jasper, Sir Richard.\u201d It was the young Duke of Malloryn who stepped forward. Despite his youth, Malloryn had been duke for ten years, since the moment he\u2019d reached his majority. The House had been nearly annihilated with his father\u2019s assassination, but Malloryn had hauled it back from obscurity with an almost-aggressive determination. \u201cThe Council has decided that this situation with the humanists in the city must be given priority, most particularly the capture of the revolutionary leader, Mercury. Since little headway seems to be made and you don\u2019t have a single humanist in your grasp, we have decided to set the pair of you on the case.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch\u2019s jaw tightened. That was not precisely true, but they didn\u2019t need to know that. Not yet. Not until he had all the pieces of the puzzle.</p><p>Having more men on the street did not guarantee success. Indeed, it only made the task more difficult. No doubt it looked appealing from their precious Ivory Tower, so far removed from the streets Lynch walked.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything to say, Sir Jasper?\u201d The prince consort\u2019s colorless eyes locked on him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace.\u201d He gave a curt nod. \u201cWhy would I argue with your infinite wisdom?\u201d Make of that what you will.</p><p>The prince consort\u2019s eyes narrowed minutely.</p><p>\u201cIt has also been recommended that we provide some incentive for this capture,\u201d Malloryn continued. \u201cAs such, whoever brings us Mercury shall be rewarded most suitably. Your rogue status shall be revoked and you will be granted the privileges of one of the Echelon.\u201d</p><p>Sir Richard sucked in a sharp hiss of air beside him. Lynch\u2019s gaze jerked to the dais. He knew who to thank for this piece of news\u2014Barrons\u2019s hand, working behind the scenes.</p><p>His mind raced. Enticement indeed. Maitland was almost quivering in anticipation beside him. He\u2019d have every single available man he had on the streets, flooding them with guards. The populace would be in an uproar, men and woman too afraid to venture out.</p><p>And Mercury... Lynch stopped breathing. If Maitland got his hands on her, Lynch would kill him. His vision darkened, bleeding into shadows at the thought.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think my former command has been rescinded, Lynch,\u201d the prince consort said coldly. \u201cIt stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, battling to control himself. He knew his eyes had darkened as the hunger sank its claws through him. They\u2019d notice his state\u2014and wonder. \u201cI still have almost two weeks.\u201d His voice sounded as though it came from miles away, a rushing sound filling his ears.</p><p>\u201cIs there a time limit I\u2019m not aware of?\u201d Maitland\u2019s voice sounded like an echo as he took a smooth step forward.</p><p>A foolish move to present his back to his enemy. Lynch eyed him. It would be ridiculously easy to snap his neck. Not even a blue blood could recover from such an injury.</p><p>He was letting the hunger rule his thoughts, his emotions. He ached to rip Sir Richard\u2019s smirking head from his shoulders\u2014to stop him before he ever got a chance to look for Mercury.</p><p>Making a supreme effort, Lynch reined in his impulses, forcing his mind to empty of all thought, most particularly the revolutionary he had a score to settle with. Three shallow, controlled breaths and the shadows dropped from his vision, though they lingered at the edges as though he\u2019d not quite banished them. That had never happened before.</p><p>Sound snapped back in upon him, the world suddenly gleaming with too much light. The Duke of Bleight watched him closely. He wore barely any fripperies and disdained to powder his hair the way most of the court did. It was white enough as it was and heavy creases lined his predator eyes.</p><p>They\u2019d never been allies. When Lynch had pleaded his case before the council forty years ago, Bleight had been the only duke to vote no to his proposal to form the Nighthawks. \u201cLet the rogue die,\u201d he\u2019d said bluntly. \u201cI see no use in him.\u201d</p><p>Of course he hadn\u2019t. Lynch had been a threat and Bleight didn\u2019t like to leave an enemy alive, despite the fact he\u2019d been all of fifteen.</p><p>\u201cShall we make it fair?\u201d Bleight intoned with a malicious little smile. No doubt he was hoping Lynch would fail. \u201cTwo weeks for both of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSporting odds,\u201d the Duke of Goethe replied seriously. He was one of the few dukes that Lynch admired; indeed, they\u2019d once been contemporaries, before the death of his cousin catapulted Goethe to power. Now his close-cropped black beard was salted with silver and his eyes, once as dark as obsidian, had begun to lighten\u2014faint signs of the Fade. Goethe had only ten years or so left in him before the color drained out of him completely.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks.\u201d An oily smile spread over Maitland\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ll have Mercury in half that time.\u201d He saluted briskly. \u201cBy your leave, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>The prince consort nodded and Maitland strode past Lynch, his pale gaze fired with ambition.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see a man so enthusiastic about his task,\u201d the prince consort said.</p><p>\u201cHe needs the head start. Is that all you wished of me? I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d the prince consort replied. \u201cThe Falcone attack?\u201d</p><p>The way he said the words, as if testing them, made Lynch alert. The prince consort wasn\u2019t the only one with an interested gleam in his eyes. Each of the Council had stilled, resembling a painting of heightened anticipation.</p><p>Or fear.</p><p>\u201cI believe both the Falcone and Haversham cases to be connected. I have no information on the agent that drove them into bloodlust, but witness statements and my own conclusions draw a parallel between them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d the flame-haired Duchess of Casavian murmured. \u201cThey were both in a state of uncontrollable bloodlust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey acted as if the Fade were upon them,\u201d he replied. \u201cHowever, both their CV counts came in quite low. I believe something exacerbated the condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReports state that your hand killed Falcone,\u201d the prince consort stated. \u201cHe was a distant cousin of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d slaughtered his entire household. I had no choice. If he got loose in the city, we\u2019d be awash in panic-fueled riots this morning.\u201d</p><p>The prince consort dropped his gaze. With relations between the Echelon and the working classes as they were, it wouldn\u2019t take much to set off a riot and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cI want a report on the case,\u201d the prince consort demanded. \u201cMercury must be your priority, but I can\u2019t allow this madness to become an epidemic. You don\u2019t think it some disease that afflicts blue bloods, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d considered that. \u201cThe attacks came on too swiftly. By all accounts, Lord Haversham enjoyed a night at the opera with his consort before ripping her to pieces. There were no symptoms of disease, no sign that he was out of sorts. I believe it to be influenced by some sort of toxin or poison, though I have no conclusive evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Both men slowly nodded at each other.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re dismissed. I want your report by tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Fire burned in a barrel on the street corner, though not even a single soul gathered around it. Night had fallen and with it the brutal choke of martial law. Metaljackets prowled the city in troops, their iron-booted feet ringing on distant cobbles.</p><p>Lynch ignored the biting cold, striding through the night with his cloak swirling around his ankles. Three nights with no sign of Mercury. After the council meeting, he\u2019d increased the flood of Nighthawks he had on the streets to counteract the sea of Coldrush Guards. A part of him was almost thankful that Mercury had gone to ground. He\u2019d rather cut his own throat than see the woman in Maitland\u2019s hands.</p><p>Hearing the heavy tread of a metaljacket legion nearby, Lynch cursed under his breath. Grabbing hold of the edge of a drainpipe, he hauled himself up, hand over hand, onto the roof of the nearest house. The vantage gave him a good view of the city and would keep him hidden from most eyes. He didn\u2019t want Maitland breathing down his neck, trying to find out what leads Lynch had on Mercury.</p><p>No doubt there\u2019d be one or two Nighthawks who reported back to the Council or even Maitland; that was the way of the world. But if they hoped to find anything in the guild, they\u2019d be sorely mistaken. He kept everything important in his head, where no one could decipher it.</p><p>Hurrying across the rooftops, he saw the wall of the enclaves looming ahead. The last time he\u2019d been here, he\u2019d had his whole world shaken by a slip of a woman in a mask. Desire ran its smoky hand through him. How he burned. He wanted her desperately, wanted to get his hands on her and exact his revenge.</p><p>Leaping off the roof, he landed lightly in the street and started toward the gatehouse. A heavy-set guard with the sleeves cut off his vest stepped forward, a dark look in his eye. \u201cHere now, you ain\u2019t s\u2019posed to be out at night\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lynch opened his cloak, flashing the stark black leather of his body armor.</p><p>The man bowed, mutiny flashing in his eyes before his lowered gaze hid it. \u201cMy apologies, me lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a lord.\u201d Lynch stepped past him, toward the gatehouse. \u201cI need access to your records.\u201d</p> <p>At that the guard\u2019s head shot up. \u201cNow, sir, I ain\u2019t s\u2019posed to give that without Council orders.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stared at him. \u201cThe key,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Lips thinning, the guard muttered under his breath and looked around. \u201cI don\u2019t want no trouble from this.\u201d He dragged a key chain over his head and held it out flat, in his palm.</p><p>Lynch took it and turned toward the gatehouse. \u201cI was never here.\u201d</p><p>Inside the gatehouse, the stench of stale coffee and long congealed ham struck him. The room was dark but he traversed the shadows easily until he reached into his pocket and struck the flare stick he carried with him.</p> <p>The records chamber was just past the main room. It was a long room, filled with filing cabinets. Inside each were files, all of them listing names, descriptions, and each mech\u2019s serial number along with a grainy photograph. Lynch ignored the men\u2019s files and stopped in front of the women\u2019s. He discarded the flare stick on top of the filing cabinet, then unlocked the first drawer.</p><p>By law, each mech had to be registered with the city. Mercury would be in here somewhere. All he needed was to find a woman of around 5\u20198\u201d with an enhancement to her left hand. A specialty order, fitted with blade and needle, and no doubt more.</p><p>Then he would have her.</p><p>If only to figure out what to do with her.</p><p>The door to Lynch\u2019s inner sanctum was locked.</p><p>Rosalind glanced at the door to the hallway as her fingers meticulously folded a letter and sealed it inside its envelope. There\u2019d been no sign of Lynch for the last two days. The room reeked of his presence; the maelstrom of untidy paperwork, a brass spectrometer in the corner for his CV count, the liquor stand with its vile flasks of blood, and that ever-damning map on the wall, but the man was as elusive as the wind.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know if that were blessing or curse. While it had given her ample time to search through his papers for word of her brother\u2014or even the mechs\u2014frustration filled her.</p><p>The part of her that played at Mercury\u2014that dangerous, thrill-seeking part\u2014itched over her skin like a hair shirt. She was growing restless with the inactivity. Forced to keep her head down due to Lynch\u2019s increased efforts to find Mercury, she had sat at home each night playing at the good widow. Without him here during the day, there wasn\u2019t even the challenge of matching wits with him.</p><p>Rosalind put aside the pair of letters she\u2019d been preparing and crossed to the window, tapping the letter opener against her skirts. Late afternoon sunshine struggled through the gray clouds, washing the world with a melancholy tint.</p><p>She lasted barely a minute. Slowly her head turned toward the door to Lynch\u2019s private study. There\u2019d been no mention of Jeremy here, but perhaps she hadn\u2019t looked hard enough?</p><p>Or perhaps she was simply that restless.</p><p>The guild was quiet this time of the day, most of the Nighthawks seeking their beds in preparation for the night ahead. Rosalind crossed to the door and pressed her ear against it. Lynch\u2019s rooms were accessible through his private study only, so there was no risk of him entering through that door. Her fingertips twitched and with one last glance around, she eased the letter opener inside the lock.</p><p>The thin stiletto tip rasped over iron. Rosalind cocked her head and listened to each click, feeling her way like a blind man with a whore. The tip caught and she held her breath, easing it, carefully, carefully...</p><p>A click.</p> <p>The lock tumbled open.</p><p>A shiver ran down her spine and she licked her lips with one last look at the door to the hallway. The rush of heat that swept through her veins was almost dizzying.</p><p>Moving swiftly, she slipped inside. The room was dark, the heavy swag curtains drawn over the casings. Rosalind dragged one of them back and brightness spilled into the room, dust motes swirling through the stark spotlight that flood-lit the Turkish rug.</p><p>As her eyes adjusted, she glanced around, absently flipping the letter opener over and under her fingers. Lynch\u2019s private study was larger than she\u2019d expected from the size of her study outside. She had to move quickly, yet despite her resolve, her gaze was drawn directly to the door on the other side of the room. His bedchambers. Curiosity bit at her. She knew he wasn\u2019t there. He never slept, it seemed. The lock to his rooms tempted her but that was surely madness.</p><p>Don\u2019t. Rosalind closed her eyes and took a deep breath, feeling that same restless urge sweep over her.</p><p>Sliding the letter opener between her breasts and into the stiff-boned fabric of her corset, she hurried to the other window and wrenched the curtains back, forcing herself not to think. He would scent her in here surely, but she could explain that away, protesting an unlocked door and the desire to tidy things up a bit for him. After the ruthless way she\u2019d filed his paperwork in her study, he\u2019d believe her.</p><p>But the trace of her scent in his private rooms could not be explained away.</p><p>Why, sir, I wanted to see where you sleep\u2014if you ever do...to see your bed, your sheets, your coat discarded over a chair. To touch the fine fabrics of his cloak and breeches, and run her fingers over the slick leather of his body armor.</p><p>To leave Mercury\u2019s mask in the center of his pillow.</p><p>Rosalind bit back a nervous laugh. She didn\u2019t dare. The thought was foolish\u2014stupid. But the idea made her skin tingle.</p><p>Keep your mind on the job. The smile on her lips died and she forced herself to remember the way Balfour had taught her to discipline herself as a child. Every last flicker of humor vanished and she hurried to Lynch\u2019s desk.</p><p>The monstrosity dominated the room, smothered in piles of paperwork. Honestly, the man had not met a piece of paper he could part with, though she\u2019d swiftly learned that he could set hands on anything he wanted within a minute. Sometimes she found herself shifting things just to aggravate him\u2014another unnatural urge. She shouldn\u2019t be playing such games, but she couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>Running her gaze over each sheet of paper, Rosalind rifled through the piles on his desk. The range of subjects fascinated her: scientific theories, what appeared to be treatises on rare plants and distillations of poisons, beautiful watercolor leaflets of exotic blooms she\u2019d never even heard of, and anatomy sketches that would have made Ingrid feel ill just to look at.</p><p>There was, however, nothing on his desk that had anything to do with his work.</p><p>Rosalind tapped her fingers on the mahogany. An orchid dozed on the windowsill, its bonneted white head dripping with a florid pink tongue. She began to truly look around. One wall was nothing but bookshelves and Rosalind stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat type of books would you read?\u201d The tips of her gloves rustled over the linen-bound spines and Rosalind\u2019s eyes tracked the titles.</p><p>Dull, dry scientific treatises. More plants. Dusty monologues of foreign places and ancient wars. An entire shelf dedicated to the Chinese Empire\u2014that would be an interest in his blue blood origins, she presumed. And at the far end an entire wall of mysteries. How predictable. A smile touched her lips and she dragged one out, examining the cover. No doubt he solved the mystery a good ten chapters before the protagonist.</p><p>Sensation crawled across the back of her neck, lifting the hairs there. Rosalind\u2019s fingers froze on the book. She knew, without looking around, that he was watching her.</p><p>The restless urge slid through her veins like molten honey, the thrill of being caught. Her lips parted and she eased the book back between its neighbors, listening for any betraying sound from him, to try and place him in the room.</p><p>There was none.</p><p>Rosalind turned slowly, pressing her back to the bookshelf. Lynch leaned against the door to her study, his arms crossed over his broad chest and his eyes narrowed with a considering expression. She couldn\u2019t read him. Her blood fired at the thought, urging her to run, to fight, but she forced it down, lifting her eyes to his.</p><p>\u201cI do believe that this is my study,\u201d he said in a cool, emotionless tone. \u201cThe door of which was locked this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be mistaken,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe knob turned in my hand the first time.\u201d</p><p>Not even a hint of doubt flickered on his face. \u201cYou often test my...doorknobs?\u201d Easing away from the door, he started to shrug out of his coat. The stark black velvet slid from his shoulders, revealing a crisp white shirt that dazzled her for a moment. Braces rode over his powerful chest, tugging the shirt taut against his shoulders.</p><p>With a careless toss, he discarded the beautiful coat over a dusty armchair strewn with newspapers. Rosalind\u2019s gaze followed it for a moment, her lips thinning. \u201cLocked doors make for tempting targets.\u201d Picking up his coat, she crossed to the hatstand by the door, her gloved hands kneading the luxurious velvet. There was no body heat in the soft folds. His skin would be cool, she thought, like smooth silk. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve sorted all of the papers in my study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour study?\u201d His brow arched.</p><p>She ignored the gibe, smoothing out the folds in his coat with absent fingers. \u201cI wanted to tidy up in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestroy my carefully disordered sanctum, you mean?\u201d</p><p>A smile edged over her lips. \u201cI\u2019m a woman, it\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted someone manipulating my life, I\u2019d have married.\u201d Shaking his head, he crossed to the liquor stand near the window.</p><p>\u201cIf you learned some charm, you might have found someone willing to take on such a role.\u201d She eyed the flask in his hand. Blood. She\u2019d seen the way the thirst for it fired Balfour\u2019s eyes, and the other blue bloods\u2019 around him. Humanity drained away, leaving them little more than monsters, their eyes flooded with a demonic black.</p><p>Lynch poured himself a measured shot and threw it back with cool efficiency. Rosa couldn\u2019t look away. His throat muscles worked, the fingers of his hand curling around the glass in a betraying motion. Then he slammed the glass down and swiftly capped the flask.</p><p>Barely enough to keep his hunger at bay. Yet he turned as if the action had never occurred, dragging at the crisp white cravat at his throat with an absent scowl on his face.</p><p>Some semblance of her discomfort must have shown. He paused before his desk, his shirt open at the throat and the cravat dangling from his fingers. \u201cMy apologies. I didn\u2019t think to restrain myself.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind forced herself to stir. \u201cYou never have before. I don\u2019t see the point now.\u201d</p><p>With a guarded look, he tossed the cravat on the desk. \u201cI\u2019ve restrained myself greatly.\u201d Resting against the desk, he crossed his arms once more, a familiar pose. \u201cTell me... Did you find anything of interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were rifling through my things.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she thought he\u2019d caught her out. Then she realized that there were faint creases at the corner of his gray eyes and just a hint of a smile edging his harsh lips. Her heart started beating again, thundering in her veins.</p><p>And she liked the feeling.</p><p>\u201cThere were many things of interest,\u201d Rosalind said, circling the desk behind him. His head turned to the side then stopped, and she knew he was tracking her by sound now. His thick dark hair was cut brutally short, barely edging against the stiff starched cut of his collar. Rosalind eyed the broad span of his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re an interesting man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019re afraid of me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sense it. In your scent, in your voice, the soft catch of your breath.\u201d He looked over his shoulder then, his gaze smoky. \u201cYou cannot hide anything from me, Mrs. Marberry.\u201d</p><p>Lie. She smiled and kept moving, her skirts swishing against her legs. \u201cMrs. Marberry?\u201d she mocked. \u201cI wonder why you call me that at times.\u201d</p><p>He was good. His body didn\u2019t even stiffen, his eyes watching her dangerously. \u201cIt is your name,\u201d he reminded her, in that rough-as-velvet voice.</p><p>Rosalind edged closer. Dangerous. So dangerous. But that old thrill was there again, tempting her to madness. She trailed her fingers across the desk, close to his thigh. \u201cI like it when you call me Rosa.\u201d</p><p>This time she called his bluff. The black breeches tightened over his thighs minutely. Rosalind\u2019s gaze lifted and she smiled up at him.</p><p>Lynch stared back, his body unnaturally still. The stillness of a predator, eyeing its prey. The bunching of muscle, the shortness of breath. Rosalind took another step and her skirts brushed innocuously against his calves.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come in here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTo drive you mad.\u201d Shock drove his gaze to hers and Rosalind\u2019s smile grew. \u201cWith your paperwork,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cI wanted to put it all away while you weren\u2019t here. You have an obsession with paper.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSome might argue that so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like things to be tidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like things to be where I put them,\u201d he replied, a slight hint of huskiness in his voice.</p> <p>She was slowly coming to understand him. Though desire roughened his voice, he\u2019d not make a single move toward her.</p><p>Their gazes met. All of a sudden she could remember the cool exhale of his breath against her throat and the feel of his fingers cupping her arse. A part of her wanted to shatter that icy control, to drive him panting to the edge of desire, the way she\u2019d done in the enclaves.</p><p>A troubling thought.</p><p>Rosalind graced him with a smile to hide her inner turmoil and turned away, the hem of her skirts swishing over his boots. The smile slid off her face as soon as her back was turned.</p><p>\u201cHow is Garrett this morning?\u201d she asked, pretending that nothing had just happened.</p> <p>\u201cRecovering.\u201d Behind her, Lynch let out a low exhale she almost didn\u2019t hear. \u201cThank goodness. I thought for a moment...\u201d His voice trailed off, then strengthened. \u201cBut Doctor Gibson tells me he should recover, if somewhat more slowly than usual.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have expected it, but she was honestly grateful. \u201cThat is good news. And the rest of your morning? I thought you gone for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently. You\u2019ve written those letters?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind rested her hands against the back of the settee and glanced over her shoulder. \u201cOn my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. There are some files there too. Can you bring them to me? I need you to take some notes.\u201d</p><p>When she turned, she found him bent over his desk, rifling through the stacks of papers as if to see what she\u2019d done. The weak sunlight fell across his pale skin and the roughened stubble of his jaw. Dark shadows smudged his eyes, making the gray almost crystalline. He\u2019d been out all night, she\u2019d bet. Searching for her. Or for Mercury.</p> <p>The thought should have made her smile, but instead she frowned. \u201cHave you slept at all?\u201d</p><p>A quirk of those dark brows. He didn\u2019t bother to look up. \u201cAre you still interviewing for the role of wife?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind bit back her initial retort. \u201cI was concerned, sir. You look like hell, but I\u2019ll refrain from acknowledging such in the future. My apologies.\u201d Sweeping past him, she headed into her own smaller study and immediately saw the files on her desk. He must have sat them there when he realized she was in his own study.</p><p>When she returned, Lynch eased back in his chair and looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve caught me at a bad time. I\u2019m out of sorts and exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind sat the files on his desk. She\u2019d not have expected an apology. The force of his control, his exquisite manners, and his cool politeness were all things she\u2019d not expected. He was an enigma and she enjoyed trying to understand him.</p><p>Far too much.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d she found herself saying. \u201cYou\u2019ve made no progress with the case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither of them.\u201d He closed his eyes and leaned back in the chair, raking tired hands through his hair. For a second his expression was unguarded; frustration warred with exhaustion, and she found herself almost tempted to reach out and touch him. To cup his cheek in her palm and turn his face to hers.</p> <p>The moment shook her. To forsake it, she asked tartly, \u201cEither of them? Lord Haversham, do you mean?\u201d</p><p>At that his eyes opened. The light struck them, rendering them almost blue-gray and something tightened in her chest. An ache. A longing. She turned away, fussing with her skirts.</p><p>\u201cNot Haversham, no,\u201d he replied quietly. \u201cHave you heard of the humanists?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind schooled her features. \u201cIt seems to be all anyone speaks of these days. People are concerned about what the Echelon intend to do about them and whether it will spill over into their world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to find them first,\u201d he said bleakly. \u201cBefore anything can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt you will,\u201d she said, though she meant not a word of it\u2014not if she had anything to do about it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. It just takes time and that is something I don\u2019t have.\u201d Lips thinning, Lynch pushed to his feet. \u201cHere. Sit. I need you to take dictation. My own writing is appalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p><p>He circled her as she crossed to the chair, his head turning as she passed. That prickling awareness between them shivered over her skin and Rosalind took refuge in the chair, picking up the spring pen. Lynch crossed to the hearth and stared into the cold fireplace, his hands clasped behind his back. The pose drew attention to the long, smooth muscles of his spine and the way his trousers caressed the taut curve of his buttocks. Rosalind nibbled on the end of the pen and looked her fill. There was no point in not admiring him after all. Searching for weaknesses, she told herself with a self-deprecating smile.</p><p>And finding none.</p><p>\u201cAnnie Burke. Serial number 1097638,\u201d he said briskly. \u201cMissing her entire left arm. The arm has been replaced with a hydraulic bio-mech piece manufactured by Craven\u2019s. The hand is standard issue\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was more, but her pen paused and Rosalind stared down at the piece of paper, her mind going blank as his words droned on.</p><p>Clever man. Looking for a mech, was he? In all the wrong places, of course, but still, the tenacity of the man bothered her.</p><p>\u201cRosa?\u201d</p><p>She looked up and found him watching her over his shoulder. He\u2019d evidently heard the pen trail off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured, hastily scrawling down the last of his words. \u201cI wondered how you can remember all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember nearly everything,\u201d he replied. \u201cI trained myself to do so years ago after a fire swept through the first building and took all of my notes. Now I rarely put anything important to paper.\u201d</p><p>The pen nib pressed hard on the paper, leaving an ink blot she silently cursed. Damn him. She\u2019d spent days hunting through his files for naught. She\u2019d wondered where he kept the important information. Now she knew. It was in that head of his. And she had no way of getting at it.</p><p>Unless... He would have to tell her of it. And if she played her game well, he might just take Rosa Marberry into his confidence.</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d she asked boldly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve examined the files of all of the mech women in the enclaves and after viewing them, found that none of them match the one I seek. Which means she must be elsewhere.\u201d The hard note in his voice took her aback. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve taken down my thoughts, I\u2019ll compile them into a description of the woman and what I know of her bio-mech hand. Then I\u2019ll send Byrnes through the enclaves to question all of the blacksmiths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><p>That steady gaze flickered to hers, as if he\u2019d just realized she was still in the room. \u201cThe humanist leader, Mercury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound quite...enamored of her.\u201d She idly traced several letters on the paper, concentrating hard.</p><p>\u201cShe made a fool of me. I won\u2019t suffer to be made a fool of. That is all.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t all. Not by a long shot. Rosalind looked up beneath her lashes and saw the intensity of his gaze drift past her, out the window. He was thinking of Mercury. She could see it in the sudden tension of his hands and shoulders.</p><p>A faint smile touched the edges of her lips and she dropped her gaze again. \u201cShall we continue?\u201d</p><p>Candlelight flickered in the night, lighting up the ceiling of his room. Lynch stretched his arms back and pillowed his head in his hands, staring up at the dancing shadows. He needed sleep desperately, but it wouldn\u2019t come. Instead, all he could think about was the taste of his revolutionary\u2019s mouth and the way she\u2019d writhed against him, her legs locked around his hips.</p><p>His cock swelled, the end of his nightshirt riding over the sensitive flesh tormentingly. Fuck it. He bared his teeth, jerking his hand out from under his head. He\u2019d never get to sleep if he didn\u2019t take care of this. It was bad enough during the day, the encounter with Mercury whipping him into a lather of frustration and desire and now Mrs. Marberry flirting with him. If he didn\u2019t control this, he\u2019d break apart, torn by hunger and need, when he most needed his senses in place.</p><p>His hand wrapped around his cock in a brutal grip and he hissed as pleasure tightened his balls. Closing his eyes, he threw back his head and thought of that moment in the alley when Mercury had kissed him. Driving her lithe little body against him, her tongue darting into his mouth. And then, once the shock of it had left him, how she\u2019d rubbed her body against his as he shoved her against the wall and possessed her with his mouth.</p><p>He came with a gasp, all too quickly. Collapsing back on the sheets, he groaned as his body trembled, his need barely sated. Witch. Licking his lips, he cursed her name. His body was half-hard again, desire a raging inferno that couldn\u2019t be quenched. No woman had ever left him so undone before, not even Annabelle.</p><p>Slowly, he touched himself again, stroking his sex-slick skin. He would rid himself of this hunger, this need. No matter what it took.</p><p>Then he would hunt her down and do what needed to be done.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain the woman wasn\u2019t in the archives?\u201d Caleb Byrnes asked, his arms folded across his chest as he leaned back against the laboratory bench. Sunlight from the high windows bleached the tips of his brown hair and sparked off his very blue eyes. A cold bastard. And dangerous too. But at least Lynch knew he could trust him to do his job; Byrnes was a force of nature when it came to tracking his prey. Intense and furiously focused. Indeed, he liked it a little too much.</p><p>\u201cCertain,\u201d Lynch replied absently, slowly turning the page on one of Fitz\u2019s books. A History of Biomechanics. Horrendously dull reading, but the diagrams were what he was interested in.</p><p>There was a distinct smoky flavor to the air, no doubt a previous experiment of Fitz\u2019s that had gone awry. Scars and frequent little burn marks covered the battered workbench he leaned against. The rest of the men referred to this as the dungeon, and it was the frequent epicenter of explosions and small fires.</p><p>\u201cYou ever known \u2019is lordship to be wrong?\u201d Doyle snorted.</p><p>Lynch flipped a page and then paused. He lifted the book and turned. \u201cI only glimpsed her hand, but she had something like this designed into the mechanics.\u201d He showed it to Fitz.</p><p>\u201cA Carillion blade? That will help to narrow it down. There\u2019s only a handful of craftsmen in the city who know how to forge one correctly.\u201d Fitz\u2019s thick eyebrows shot into his hairline and he smiled in rare anticipation. Burn marks turned the center of his left brow into a stubbly mess and the tweed suit he wore was acid-stained at the cuffs. A young rogue blue blood who had found his calling here, working with strange devices and inventions.</p><p>A fluttering started in Lynch\u2019s gut. He was getting closer to finding Mercury. He knew it. \u201cI want their names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is...\u201d Fitz murmured, taking the book and peering at the diagram. \u201cThey belong to the Council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the devil does a revolutionary get work created by one of the master smiths?\u201d Byrnes asked.</p><p>How indeed? Lynch\u2019s mind raced. \u201cWhat makes a woman hate a blue blood so much that she wants to destroy them all?\u201d This was his forte, his genius, predicting his adversary\u2019s moves and motives. \u201cShe\u2019s come into contact with the Echelon, I\u2019m certain of it. Perhaps the loss of her hand itself is key?\u201d He frowned. He could have his men question the members of the Echelon about a young human woman who\u2019d lost her hand, but that would start people asking questions he didn\u2019t want them to. He needed to find her, not deliver her straight into someone else\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cYou think one of \u2019em took her \u2019and?\u201d Doyle frowned. \u201cThat don\u2019t seem a strong enough motive to want to destroy \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows how people perceive such things? To some, such a loss might be reason indeed,\u201d he retorted, pacing the small laboratory.</p><p>\u201cIf one of the Echelon cost her the hand, then someone helped her get a mech replacement,\u201d Byrnes said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking a blue blood again. Master smiths don\u2019t come cheaply and the only merchant\u2019s who might be able to afford one wouldn\u2019t have contact with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they weren\u2019t asked to create it,\u201d Lynch suggested.</p><p>\u201cAgain, that brings me back to a blue blood,\u201d Byrnes frowned. \u201cAnd it would have had to be done quietly or some rumor of it would have reached our ears. The master smiths don\u2019t create mech parts, not for mere humans anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo missing or kidnapped master smiths in the past twenty years?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll look,\u201d Byrnes promised.</p><p>A knock started at the door. All four of them turned.</p><p>Perry bumped the door open with her hip and dragged a wheeled chair into the room. Garrett slumped in the seat, looking completely indignant with the contraption.</p> <p>\u201cHere we are, sir. It took me a little longer than anticipated to fetch him,\u201d Perry said.</p><p>\u201cShe practically wrestled me into it,\u201d Garrett snapped. \u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until Doc says you can,\u201d Doyle replied bluntly. \u201cHow\u2019s your breathin\u2019 been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Black heat swam through Garrett\u2019s eyes. After such a grievous injury, his craving virus levels had increased dramatically, as if his body hadn\u2019t been able to fight the virus off while it tried to heal.</p><p>Lynch exchanged a glance with Doyle. He\u2019d have to keep a close eye on his second. Garrett\u2019s CV levels were now around the sixty percent margin, but such an increase in a short amount of time might lead to brief losses of control. Garrett wasn\u2019t used to fighting off such increased hungers.</p> <p>\u201cAnd your stitches?\u201d Doyle asked.</p><p>\u201cItching like a sailor with the pox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut them out this morning,\u201d Perry replied, ignoring his glare as she wheeled him into place beside Lynch. \u201cAre you cold? Do you want a blanket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bury you in the garden if you don\u2019t leave off.\u201d Garrett clapped a hand to his forehead in frustration, scraping his hair out of the way.</p><p>Perry snorted. \u201cAs if you could. Even when you\u2019re at your best, I can have you facedown in the dirt nine times out of ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only need once\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Lynch said quietly.</p><p>Both of them fell silent.</p><p>\u201cI need you on your feet,\u201d he told Garrett. \u201cIf that means suffering through Perry\u2019s ministrations, then so be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides...\u201d A slow smile crept over Byrnes\u2019s mouth. \u201cShe can\u2019t help fussing, its part of her nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that an oblique reference to my gender?\u201d Perry asked, her eyes narrowing to thin slits.</p><p>If he left them at this, they\u2019d be at each other\u2019s throats within a minute. Lynch held up a hand, staring them all down. \u201cConcentrate,\u201d he said, stabbing a finger toward the book. \u201cFitz, what\u2019s the difference between enclave work and the master smiths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnclave work doesn\u2019t have synthetic flesh,\u201d the young scientist frowned. \u201cIt tends to tear in their line of employment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t bother with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHowever the addition of the Carillion blade argues for master smith work. We all know a blue blood\u2019s saliva has chemical components in it that can heal a cut\u2014or the slash of a blood-letting knife\u2014without transmitting the virus,\u201d Fitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they use to create bio-mech limbs. They can meld steel tendons or muscle sheeting with flesh by using a blue blood\u2019s saliva. The interior of the bio-mech limb is grafted to a man\u2019s body as if it belongs, each contraction of muscle creating flex in the steel hand. It\u2019s truly an extension of the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd enclave work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFar rougher. They don\u2019t have access to a blue blood\u2019s saliva. A hand relies on clockwork pieces inside it to drive the mechanism and hydraulic hoses in the arm to lift it. Mech\u2014not bio-mech. Far less accurate.\u201d</p><p>Lynch scratched at his mouth. \u201cIts master smith work, I\u2019m sure of it. She had full use of her fingers and hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019ve got some smiths to question,\u201d Byrnes said with a heated smile.</p><p>\u201cYou and Perry work together on that,\u201d Lynch directed.</p><p>Perry shot him a look. She and Garrett always worked as partners; Byrnes preferred to work alone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re entering Echelon territory,\u201d he said, though he rarely bothered to explain his orders. \u201cYou need someone to watch your backs. Keep it quiet\u2014but I want to know if any master smith created something like this within...the last ten or fifteen years. The hand\u2019s fully sized, so she had to be an adult by the time it was melded to her flesh.\u201d</p><p>And keeping Perry away from Garrett would stop them being at each other\u2019s throats. His head was pounding as it was. Lynch nodded sharply. \u201cDismissed.\u201d</p><p>Later that afternoon, Lynch stripped his coat off and tossed it on the armchair in his study, which was now free of debris. Pausing, he looked around the room. Evidence of Mrs. Marberry\u2019s meddling existed everywhere. Ever since he\u2019d found her in here two days prior, she\u2019d been making her presence known in myriad, subtle ways.</p><p>He\u2019d been too busy to take her to task for it, but now he paused, taking a good hard look around the room.</p><p>The bookshelves were spotless and dust free, the orchid on the windowsill shifted to a warmer location. By the fireplace, all of the translations of an old Tibetan document he\u2019d been making were gone and the desk was entirely clear of paperwork.</p><p>He turned on his heel and strode back through the door into her cheery, sunlit study. Steam drifted off the teapot on her desk and her head was bent as she carefully wrote something. Sunlight gilded the burning copper of her hair, tracing the fine downy hairs at her nape.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Marberry.\u201d He leaned on the desk, looming over her.</p><p>The pen stilled. Rosa looked up slowly, as if she\u2019d heard the very controlled way in which he spoke. Those solemn brown eyes locked on his. \u201cSir Jasper,\u201d she replied in that composed manner that drove him beyond endurance. \u201cWhat may I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Shoving away from the desk\u2014before he strangled her\u2014he stabbed a finger toward his study. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. My papers, my treatises, that bloody Tibetan document that is worth more than your life! All of it!\u201d</p><p>She put the pen down. \u201cThe filing cabinet behind you is empty. I put all of your papers in there. If you look, you\u2019ll find them all in order. As for the Tibetan document, I have no idea what you speak of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe papers in front of the fireplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat pile of chicken scratchings that was spread all over the settee, two armchairs and the rug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The words came out between clenched teeth.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was important.\u201d</p><p>The blood pumped through his veins. He shut his eyes and pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth, silently counting to ten. \u201cThat document was written in blood,\u201d he said, \u201cby an ancient Tibetan scholar. It is irreplaceable. They say the origins to the craving virus are hidden within its transcriptions. What did you do with it?\u201d</p><p>When he opened his eyes, hers were as wide as saucers. Her lips trembled and a sharp stab of guilt threatened him, before the slight twitching at the corners of her mouth made him realize she wasn\u2019t scared. She was trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Marberry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t be so wicked. I placed them very carefully on one of the remaining bookshelves, out of the light.\u201d Laughter erupted from her and she tried to restrain it with a slender, gloved hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve never seen you in such a...such a state!\u201d The laughter broke free and she bent over the desk, several coppery curls tumbling from her chignon.</p><p>The sound swept through him. Lynch froze, his mouth half open and his finger still pointing. She was laughing at him. The damned woman was laughing!</p><p>Looking up, Rosa dissolved into a fresh wave of giggles at the look on his face. The anger faded out of him as abruptly as it had come and he shook his head. Bloody woman. Lynch swore under his breath, marching toward his study. He slammed the door shut behind him, then paced to the bookshelf. She\u2019d been right. The document had been here all along, neatly tucked beside his histories of the Chinese empire.</p><p>He could still hear her laughter through the door. Transfixed by the sound, he cocked his head and listened. Despite the situation, he couldn\u2019t stop a smile from edging his lips. She was tempting the wolf every day and she well knew it. His prim little secretary had a wicked side.</p><p>You wanted someone who wasn\u2019t scared of you.</p><p>With a sigh, he turned toward his desk and sat down. The polished mahogany gleamed in the late afternoon shadows. Lynch stared at it. He didn\u2019t think he could recall the last time he\u2019d seen it. The neatness disturbed him. The presence of its perpetrator disturbed him even more. He shot another heated look toward the door. The low-cut, dark green gown she wore hadn\u2019t escaped his notice.</p><p>Seducing his secretary was completely beyond the pale, but damned if he wasn\u2019t considering it. Scraping a shaking hand over his jaw, Lynch forced his body to behave. The brief, frenzied way he took himself in hand at night wasn\u2019t helping. Mercury had ignited his dormant sexual desire and now he was even considering Mrs. Marberry as substitute.</p><p>Or not quite. Mrs. Marberry had her own unique effect; she was no woman\u2019s substitute.</p><p>A commotion caught his attention and he stilled, turning with predatory interest toward Rosa\u2019s study.</p><p>\u201cLynch!\u201d</p><p>A rap came at the door, then Byrnes stuck his head in. The swarthy features were strained and spattered with blood. \u201cThere\u2019s been another massacre in Kensington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d The mirth faded from Lynch completely as his third-in-command opened the door farther. Behind him Mrs. Marberry watched with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...75 Holland Park Avenue,\u201d Byrnes replied grimly. He knew, as well as the others, what the address meant.</p><p>Cold spiraled through Lynch, taking him off guard. No. \u201cAlistair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to kill him, sir. I couldn\u2019t...I couldn\u2019t get him off her.\u201d</p><p>No. The thought was the merest whisper. The world narrowed around him and he swallowed hard. \u201cAnd Lady Arrondale?\u201d Somehow his voice came out low and cool. Emotionless. When inside he felt as if the world had exploded.</p><p>A short shake of the head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have gone home,\u201d Lynch told her, staring up at the mansion with simmering reluctance in his eyes. Every light along the street was lit and dozens of Nighthawks flooded the scene as early evening settled its mantle over the city.</p><p>Going home was out of the question. Rosalind needed to find the mechs behind these massacres as much as Lynch did.</p><p>Lord Arrondale was the Duke of Bleight\u2019s heir, but she suspected there was more to this story than there seemed. Lynch had been icily composed on the way here, but he carried himself even more stiffly than usual. He\u2019d checked his pocket watch several times in the carriage and spoken not a word. Grim tension rode his shoulders like a well-cut coat and the bleak, oh-so-expressionless look on his face made her instincts twitch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite all right, sir,\u201d she replied, watching him with assessing eyes. They\u2019d argued briefly about her coming with him, but he\u2019d been too distracted to force his will on her. Rosalind had promised to make herself useful taking his notes, when in truth she was desperate to see if this was another mech attack. Her voice lowered. \u201cDid you know Lord Arrondale?\u201d</p><p>Lynch shot her a harsh, raw look, his pupils swallowing his irises and shadows carving deep planes beneath his cheekbones. For a moment she stared into the face of the demon within, and her breath caught behind the stiff boning of her corset.</p><p>\u201cHe was my cousin,\u201d Lynch stated, turning back to look at the house once more.</p><p>The absence of that black-eyed gaze made it easier for her to breathe. Rosalind rubbed her knuckles self-consciously against her skirts. She knew he\u2019d been born of the Echelon once, but she hadn\u2019t bothered to search for more detail. As far as the world was concerned, Lynch had been cast aside as a rogue and made his own place in the world as a Nighthawk. There was never any mention of family or of his House, because none of it was important anymore.</p><p>The man he\u2019d called Byrnes strode toward them, his dark features obscured by the shadows of early evening. He moved with a sinuous and deadly grace, the coldness in his blue eyes rivaling Lynch\u2019s. Around his throat a red kerchief lingered and a long sword was strapped over his back. \u201cThe house is secure. I\u2019ve had word sent to the Duke of Bleight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he arrives, have the men stall him and send word,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him anything he doesn\u2019t need to know at this point.\u201d Lynch shot her a fierce look. \u201cIf I tell you to get out, then don\u2019t argue. Go straight out the back and find one of my men. Instruct them to get you back to Chancery Lane and protect you with their life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d Rosalind grabbed a handful of skirts and followed him, the synthetic skin that covered her mech hand pulling against the soft kid-leather insides of her gloves. Tonight she\u2019d planned to let him catch a glimpse of it\u2014just enough to make him think her hand was real. It wouldn\u2019t stand up to intense scrutiny, but in the dark and at a distance... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, he had other matters on his mind. Tonight might not be the best opportunity. Lynch held the door open for her. \u201cBleight despises me. There was some business when I was named rogue concerning Alistair and me. If he\u2019s stricken by grief, I find it highly likely he\u2019ll make some move against me\u2014or go so far as to blame me. This could become quite a scene.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind stared up at him, the hard body but a breath away from hers. She could scent the coppery wash of blood through the open door. No doubt Lynch could too. His jaw was tight with strain.</p><p>\u201cDo you have your pistol?\u201d he asked quietly.</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use it unless I tell you to.\u201d Then he pressed his hand to the small of her back and propelled her through the door.</p><p>Inside, the hall was charged with silence. It almost felt as if the house were listening. Each creak of timber beneath her boot heel made her wince. Lynch\u2019s presence behind her was almost comforting.</p><p>The firm hand in the small of her back directed her through another door. \u201cThis way,\u201d Lynch murmured and she knew he could smell the death within.</p><p>As soon as she saw what lay on the floor, Rosalind stopped in her tracks. Her mind struggled to make sense of the mess, of the red pool that bloated the carpets and the frozen, screaming visage of the elderly woman dead on the floor. Half her throat had been torn out and gashes marred her lavender skirts. From the dark blue-red blood that covered her fingers, it was clear she\u2019d tried to protect herself.</p> <p>Firm hands slid over Rosalind\u2019s shoulders and she relaxed into the touch. Death had never frightened her; she\u2019d dealt it with little remorse, but that had been out of a sense of duty. Not personal. Not murder. This...this had been a woman just sitting down to her white soup, perhaps a smile on her face as she listened to her consort\u2019s account of his day. Most consort agreements in the Echelon were business items, nothing more, but the woman had worn her good pearls and the scent of perfume lingered in the air. The silvery-blonde hair had been curled artfully over her shoulder, as if for a beau, and from the roses spilled out of the vase on the table, they\u2019d perhaps been celebrating something.</p><p>Rosalind melted into the hard body behind her, feeling numb all over.</p><p>\u201cWait outside,\u201d Lynch instructed quietly.</p><p>Rosalind turned, tripping on the carpet. Her worst fear\u2014to be bloodied like that, torn apart by a rampaging blue blood. Pausing by the door, she held on to the frame and glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>Lynch knelt by the woman\u2019s side, his gaze hooded and his mouth a stark line. With a sigh, he reached out and held his palm over the woman\u2019s face, then slowly closed her eyes. His hand hovered there, as though to hide the dead woman\u2019s face. Then he clenched his fist and dragged it tight against his chest.</p><p>The privacy of the moment struck Rosalind. She hesitated at the edge of the dining room. He knew the woman. There was so little in his expression she might have thought him uncaring, but something about the aura of grief around him almost physically hurt.</p> <p>A clatter of sound as he scraped the plates out of the way and dragged the white tablecloth from the table. Kneeling down, he folded the woman\u2019s hands over her chest and then carefully draped the tablecloth over her. It stained with red immediately, the edges soaking up the pool of blood beneath the woman\u2019s hair. Lynch slowly turned, emotionless once more.</p><p>\u201cLady Arrondale,\u201d he said, as if in explanation. Brushing past her, he strode along the hall, ignoring each door and tributary. Little spatters of dark blood trailed along the checkerboard floor and paintings hung haphazardly as if something had smashed up against the wall. By the stairs, a large smear of blood puddled on the marble tiles and the carved mahogany railing had been destroyed, splinters littering the floor.</p><p>Byrnes appeared at the top of the stairs. \u201cHe\u2019s up here. I didn\u2019t think it appropriate to leave him like that. Not with Bleight on his way.\u201d</p><p>Lynch nodded, taking the stairs two at a time. \u201cHow did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>Byrnes peered over the rail. His cerulean eyes were almost bright with hunger, as if they saw something she didn\u2019t. Long dried blood clung to his right hand and his black sleeve was wet with it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get him off Lady Arrondale. She was still screaming by that stage\u2014somehow she\u2019d locked herself in the dining room and someone heard her cries for help. I was coming back from interviewing the head of the master smith guild and overheard the commotion. From the look of the house, Arrondale killed everyone else, then went for her.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cI put my gun to the back of his shoulder and pulled the trigger to get his attention. Unfortunately, it was too late for Lady Arrondale.\u201d</p><p>Lynch glanced over the rail, assessing the bloody marks on the floor and the shattered paintings along the hall. \u201cJust once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have time for a second shot. He turned on me and I went down. Somehow we ended up there\u2014\u201d Byrnes pointed at the spot below. \u201cI\u2019d lost the pistol by then.\u201d He looked up, hard gaze locking on Lynch\u2019s. \u201cI had to rip his heart out of his chest. He was trying to gut me.\u201d A shudder. \u201cChrist, he was strong.\u201d</p><p>Lynch surveyed the scene one last time then turned. \u201cShow him to me.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d taken the body to the main bedroom upstairs. The cloying scent of blood stained the air and Rosalind swallowed hard as she stepped inside. Someone had dragged a sheet over the body and Lynch strode to it, twitching it aside. His large body blocked her view and for that she was grateful. She\u2019d seen enough macabre sights tonight.</p><p>Dropping the sheet, he turned, candlelight washing over his too-smooth features. \u201cI want your report on my desk by morning. You\u2019d best leave. If Bleight sees you, he\u2019ll want your head\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shout sounded outside. They all spun toward the window and Lynch pushed past, twitching aside the curtains. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cOut the back and return to the guild. Take a small guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely the duke wouldn\u2019t attack anyone,\u201d Rosalind murmured. Bleight was a vulture who sat on the council and circled for prey, but her dossier said he was once of the most cautious of the Council, choosing to pick his fights and rarely proclaiming them.</p><p>Lynch shot her a hard look as Byrnes left the room. \u201cDon\u2019t leave my side. Try to be inconspicuous.\u201d He swore under his breath, grabbing her arm. \u201cI should never have brought you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLynch!\u201d someone roared. The sound came from inside the house.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s grip tightened, then he cursed again and started toward the door.</p><p>\u201cGet your goddamned hands off me, you cur!\u201d The voice was sodden with rage. \u201cLynch! You bastard, where\u2019s my son? Where\u2019s my bloody son?!\u201d</p><p>Lynch stepped up to the rail by the stairs. \u201cRelease him.\u201d His voice rang through the entry.</p><p>Rosalind hovered in the shadows as much as possible. Below her, the old Duke of Bleight threw off the restraining grip of two Nighthawks. His own men, in their dashing red livery, had followed him in and the hallway looked like a sea of red and black. The black outnumbered the red, but not by much.</p><p>Dozens of blue bloods. Rosa\u2019s eyes narrowed fractionally, her gaze raking the hall. No faces she recognized. Her shoulders relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Bleight bellowed. \u201cYou vengeful prick! You\u2019re behind this! You wanted everything he ever had!\u201d</p><p>Lynch stepped forward, tugging at the soft leather gloves he wore. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said sharply, \u201cperhaps you\u2019d care to discuss this in private? Your son\u2019s body has been removed to the bedroom. If you\u2019d like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll discuss nothing with you,\u201d Bleight hissed, starting up the stairs. \u201cGet out. Get out before I kill you.\u201d The old duke\u2019s hand lowered to rest on the hilt of his sword. His pale face was even whiter with stress, his eyes glittering with malice.</p><p>Below them a half dozen men stiffened at the implied threat. Rosalind straightened as her vision narrowed on the duke. She could almost feel the cool ring of sweat around her garter, where it held her pistol in place.</p><p>The sword hissed as it cleared its scabbard. Below, a pair of Nighthawks leaped toward the stairs but Lynch took a commanding step forward, holding up his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll leave, Your Grace. But if you would consider having some of my men remain, to examine the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Bleight swung the sword, cool gaslight glimmering off the razor edge of the blade.</p><p>Lynch ducked and the sword sheared through the elegant railing at the top of the stairs and stuck. Bleight snarled, yanking it free with a force that belied his evident age.</p><p>Lips thinning, Lynch stepped back, his hands held in a placating manner in front of him.</p><p>What the devil was he doing? Why did he not fight back? Rosalind had seen him in action; the duke didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>Swinging wildly, the duke slashed forward as Lynch stepped out of the way, his back hitting the wall. Lynch\u2019s gaze met hers for a moment and narrowed in warning. Rosalind just had time to realize she\u2019d stepped forward, her hand dipping automatically into her pocket when Bleight followed the direction of Lynch\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cIs she yours?\u201d the duke asked in a soft, threatening voice.</p><p>This close, Rosalind could see the darkness of his pupils threatening to overtake his irises. Her corset tightened and her fingers clamped around the smooth grip of her pistol through the slit in the bottom of her pocket. If he made one move toward her, she\u2019d blow his head off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Lynch warned. For a moment, she thought he referred to the duke, then she realized that his stark gaze was locked on hers.</p><p>Reality flooded in. Kill the duke and she\u2019d be executed by dawn. Rosalind\u2019s finger rubbed the trigger hesitantly. Trust that Lynch knew what he was doing? Or take action? She hovered on the precipice, staring into the mad duke\u2019s eyes. She\u2019d never stop him in time if he attacked her; a blue blood was simply too fast.</p><p>Her hand slowly withdrew and she took a shaky breath. Trusting Lynch went against all of her instincts, but she had no choice.</p><p>Bleight turned on her with a snarl, the sword cutting through the air. Rosalind threw herself backward, tripping over her skirts and tumbling to the floor. The sword gleamed eerily in the bluish light as it arced toward her.</p><p>Then Lynch was between them, slamming his body hard against the duke\u2019s. A sharp hiss of pain filled the air and blood spattered her face. The pair staggered into the railing, which gave with a sharp crack.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She snatched at Lynch\u2019s cloak, her fingers closing over air, and then they were gone.</p><p>The dull smack as they landed dragged her to the edge. She peered through the broken gap of rail as Lynch smashed his elbow into the duke\u2019s face. Somehow he\u2019d gotten the upper hand and forced the duke\u2019s sword hand to the floor. Grabbing Bleight by the throat, he crouched over him with a snarl.</p><p>Around them, both the Nighthawks and the duke\u2019s men had danced back, clearing a circle. One of the red-clad guards stepped forward and Lynch looked up, baring his teeth. \u201cEnough!\u201d</p><p>Looking down, he smashed the duke\u2019s hand to the tiles. The sword clattered free, and as he stood, Lynch kicked it away. He staggered back, clapping a hand to his side.</p><p>Blood dripped on the floor.</p><p>Rosalind shoved to her feet, hurrying for the stairs. The moment when he\u2019d leaped in front of her flashed before her eyes. He\u2019d taken the blow meant for her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite name the emotion that gripped her. Lynch shot her a quelling look and Rosalind slowed, her steps flagging. She couldn\u2019t see how badly he was bleeding against the black of his leather body armor. Nor could she ask him, not now, in front of the duke and his men. Any sign of weakness and Bleight would be on them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d Lynch commanded. He nodded sharply to his men. \u201cI want all preliminary reports completed by morning.\u201d Gesturing her to his side, he put his free hand in the small of her back\u2014an almost protective gesture\u2014and ushered her close to his body.</p><p>Bleight struggled into a sitting position, spitting blood. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head for that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lynch turned swiftly and the duke flinched, some of his men stepping forward with their hands dropping to their weapons. All eyes were upon him as he glared down at the duke. \u201cIf you ever make a move against one of mine again, you\u2019ll face me in the atrium. I swear it.\u201d Then Lynch shoved free and, taking Rosalind by the arm, ushered her to the door.</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cHow badly are you bleeding?\u201d</p><p>Lynch pressed back against the carriage seat as the door closed, locking them in darkness. He could hear Perry outside, snapping at the men to get out of her way as she clambered up onto the driver\u2019s seat. A rumble started beneath him as Perry kicked the boilers into gear.</p><p>\u201cLynch?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He dragged his attention back inside as Mrs. Marberry knelt on the seat beside him, her skirts tumbling across his legs. He shouldn\u2019t be feeling this weak\u2014damn Bleight. Taking a shuddery breath, he peeled his hand away from the wound in his side and winced. The scent of blood flooded his nose, saliva springing into his mouth. His world was spinning slightly, the warm press of the body beside him his only anchor.</p><p>So hot. So tempting. The color drained out of his vision, leaving him with the silvery patina of moonlight across the pale skin of Rosa\u2019s throat. Instantly the demon within him leaped to the surface, threatening to drown him. Desire was a sharp ache that cut like a knife, his gut clenching in need. Christ.</p><p>He grabbed her upper arm, intending to push her away. The muscle beneath his touch tightened but Rosa didn\u2019t withdraw. Lynch loomed over her, the subtler scent of lemon and linen washing through him.</p> <p>He shuddered. \u201cDevil take you, leave me be!\u201d The words were a harsh croak as he clung to sanity by the finest of threads.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said grimly, withdrawing something from her reticule. Silver flashed in the moonlight as the steam carriage lurched into motion with a teakettle hiss. The sound of a flask being unscrewed drew his focus and then Rosa was pressing it to his lips.</p><p>Blood washed over his tongue. Lynch caught her wrist in surprise, then tipped the flask up. He needed blood. Lots of it\u2014anything to focus his mind and leash the demon within.</p><p>Draining the flask, he collapsed back against the plush carriage seats, panting. Rosa took it from him and neatly screwed the lid back on.</p><p>He could feel her watching him. The world seemed to fade until it was just the pair of them, breathing softly in the dark interior. Even the pain in his side ebbed to a dull throb as the craving virus began to heal him. Come morning there wouldn\u2019t even be a scar, courtesy of his high CV levels.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rosa let out a low breath. \u201cI should be thanking you. That blade was meant for me. Here.\u201d Leaning closer, she fumbled at his chest. \u201cLet me have a look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will heal.\u201d</p><p>Tugging at her gloves, she eased them off, her pale hands finding the buckles to his body armor and snapping one open. Even in the faint moonlight, he caught a glimpse of the scarred back of her left hand and the paler skin. My father... He suddenly wanted to know what the man had done to her but he didn\u2019t ask. This was the first time she\u2019d ever removed her gloves in front of him and as he glanced up, he realized that she knew he\u2019d been staring at her slightly thickened fingers.</p><p>Rosa swiftly glanced down, tugging at another buckle. Heat darkened her cheeks as if embarrassed by his attention. Lynch didn\u2019t give a damn about the deformity, but he would respect her wishes in the matter and not mention it.</p><p>He winced as the leather breastplate gave way. Built to stop a knife or a blow, it had been poor defense against Bleight\u2019s sword.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did he do it?\u201d she asked softly. Taking hold of his undershirt in both hands, she ripped it up the side, baring his skin to her gaze.</p><p>Lynch shivered at the chill, feeling the cool blood pulsing down his hip. The blade had taken him high, just beneath the ribs. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>Gentle fingertips probed the slash. \u201cAttack you. Why did he think you had something to do with his son\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Alistair and I were cousins.\u201d Lynch bared his teeth in a silent hiss as she touched a particularly tender spot. \u201cBleight has long held the position that I desired Alistair\u2019s place as heir of the House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the truth,\u201d he told her, watching her expression in the flickering light from the passing gaslights. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>Her silence was almost unbearable. A hungry, curious yearning filled her expression. \u201cOf course. You were Lord Arrondale\u2019s cousin\u2014which makes you the duke\u2019s nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird in line to the duchy,\u201d he said with a bleak smile. \u201cMy father and Bleight were never friends. My father was born an hour after Bleight and he never forgot it.\u201d</p> <p>Her gloved thumb stroked against the bare flesh of his side. \u201cHe wanted you to be duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe pushed me to compete with Alistair in all things, to prove myself. Alistair was heir by right of birth, but I could overthrow him if I chose. All I had to do was duel him in front of the court when we came of age. And kill him.\u201d Memory was a sharp stab. He would have done anything for his father, but not that.</p><p>Lynch looked down beneath his lashes at the soft fingers that unconsciously stroked his hip. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weak,\u201d she said, her white teeth flashing a quick smile. \u201cAnd I\u2019m taking advantage of the moment.\u201d Sitting back with a sigh, she tugged her skirts up.</p><p>The sight stilled him. Acres of frothy white petticoats gleamed in the weak moonlight, revealing smooth, stocking-clad calves. Taking hold of the hem of her petticoats, she tore them with a sharp rip that made his gut clench.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking advantage of you in that way. You may relax.\u201d Wadding the fine linen into a ball, she tore another long strip, yanking sharply on the material with little care to the fact that his eyes were locked on her ankles.</p><p>Tossing her skirts down, Rosa knelt on the seat, bending forward. Shadows enveloped her upper body, but he could still see the faint outline of her breasts as she pressed her makeshift pad to his side. Sliding her arms around his waist, she tugged the long piece of linen around his back and dragged it clear with a determined expression.</p><p>Her teeth worried at her lip as she worked. Lynch watched, entirely frozen. He could feel the heat off her body and sense the scant inch between them. She was nothing but darkness and warmth, a shadow of a woman who ignited his desire, his dreams. And instantly he knew that when he was finally alone, he\u2019d dream of her like this.</p><p>The thought shocked him. It had been Mercury on his mind, night after night, but there was something about the shadow-wreathed woman in front of him that drew him. A sense of...tenderness.</p><p>His own secretary. Bloody hell. If he was one of his men, he\u2019d have strung himself up by the heels.</p><p>A tendril of hair brushed his cheek in the dark interior of the carriage, silky-smooth and lemon-scented. With Rosa busy tending his wound, she barely noticed as he turned his head and breathed in the scent of her. Whatever perfume she used, it bathed her skin and drenched her hair as if she\u2019d washed in it. He could barely discern her natural scent. His mouth went dry at the thought. He yearned to press his face to her throat, to drink in that scent, his body reacting with swift need.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she murmured, tying off the ends of the piece of petticoat. The instant she was done, she tugged her gloves back on as if the lack of them left her vulnerable. \u201cThat should hold until we get to the guild.\u201d</p><p>Lynch sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cThank you. You\u2019re most efficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all matters.\u201d She shot him a soft smile, her dark eyes flashing in the silvery moonlight. Her gaze slowly lowered as she sobered. \u201cYou knew Lady Arrondale.\u201d</p><p>The words were no question.</p><p>\u201cAnnabelle?\u201d The thought sheared through his desire like a knife.</p><p>\u201cYou were very gentle with her body.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath and dragged himself upright. Annabelle. Guilt was a sour taste in his mouth. \u201cShe was my cousin\u2019s consort.\u201d</p><p>He knew she heard the sharpness in his voice and cursed himself for a fool. He despised speaking of himself; the story had been all through the papers at the time, with every journalist taking it upon himself to form an opinion on the circumstances. Few of them had come close to the truth, but that didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d suspected Bleight behind half of the damned stories, and truth was but a varnish to the duke.</p><p>He\u2019d never given a damn before, but something about the close nature of the carriage and Mrs. Marberry\u2019s curiosity bit at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d She floundered for words, a flush of color darkening her skin. His gaze charted the path of it, across her throat and cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIdle curiosity is not something I encourage.\u201d</p><p>The words might have been a slap. Her magnificent eyes jerked to his. \u201cBecause I suspect you took more than one wound today. I wanted... I was offering comfort, nothing else.\u201d Shoving away from him, she leaned against the door of the carriage and peered out, limned by soft shadows and moonlight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not curious?\u201d</p><p>Lashes fluttered against her pale cheeks as she gazed down at her lap. The line of her nape drew his eyes. He wanted to press his lips there, to lick the lemon scent from her skin and taste her body\u2019s salt.</p><p>Lynch stilled, arrested by his hunger again. The roar of it surged through his veins. Just one little taste...to have her beneath him, the knife to her throat, hot blood in his mouth as she struggled weakly. She was a temptation he never should have brought beneath his roof. For forty years he\u2019d contained his blood urges, and she stomped all over his control as if it were worth nothing. The thought was troubling.</p><p>I will beat this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d she admitted. \u201cOf course I am. But the motivation is not vulgar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your curiosity is personal?\u201d</p><p>Silence. It lingered for long moments, during which he found himself examining her again, his fingers tightening their grip on the carriage seat.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s personal.\u201d A sharp look away.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one afflicted by this madness. Fighting his body, he forced himself to think of Annabelle, lying on the floor with betrayal written all over her face.</p><p>It worked, like a splash of ice water to the face.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he said simply, \u201cAlistair and I competed in all things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was fifteen.\u201d He breathed a harsh laugh. \u201cI was consumed by her with all the rabid fascination of a young man. And I wanted to win her. Neither Alistair nor I wished to push our rivalry so far as a duel, so Annabelle became the prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he won?\u201d</p><p>Silence. This time of his own making. Lynch slowly shut his eyes, the image of Annabelle painted behind his eyeballs. He hadn\u2019t seen her in years. The shadow of age had surprised him, but he could recognize her still, in the elegant lines of her cheekbones and those lips that had been made to laugh. Guilt was a twisting sensation within his chest. Guilt, regret, and sorrow...</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how strongly you still cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not seen her in more than thirty years,\u201d he replied. An old wound, but this had only seemed to knock the scab off it. \u201cThey tell me he was kind to her.\u201d</p><p>Rosa seemed to wrestle with something. Slowly she reached out, her hand sliding over his. A gentling touch, but still a tentative one, as though she had to force herself to do it.</p><p>\u201cMy husband...\u201d she began, and faltered. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t...wasn\u2019t love for me. Not at first. Indeed, I set about luring him into the marriage quite purposely.\u201d At this, she darted a glance at him, as if to see how he took this revelation. \u201cI hate that now that he\u2019s gone. He loved me so much and I regret...so many things.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stroked her thumb through the kid leather, simply listening.</p><p>\u201cThe guilt never goes away but the feeling fades,\u201d she admitted bleakly. \u201cAt the end, when he realized what I\u2019d done... I saw it in his face, you know? He hated me in that moment. But if he had survived, I wouldn\u2019t care if he still hated me. As long as he were alive. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off, and he listened to the sound of her breathing, the feel of her hand anchoring him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d Rosa whispered. \u201cIf your cousin cared for his wife, as you say, what could have made him kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lynch\u2019s gaze drifted to the window. He squeezed her fingers, feeling strangely vulnerable. \u201cBut I intend to find out.\u201d</p><p>Rows of gaslights gleamed in the night as the carriage rolled past a park. Something caught his eye as his gaze lowered to Rosa\u2019s hand and Lynch\u2019s head snapped back to the window. There, standing by a grove of trees was a familiar figure smothered in a black silk cloak.</p><p>Mercury.</p><p>His heart leaped into his throat, throwing off the pall of grief. Exhilaration flooded through him. \u201cStop the carriage!\u201d he bellowed, yanking at the door and dropping Rosa\u2019s hand.</p><p>The masked figure blew him a kiss, then stepped back into the grove. Lynch opened the door while the carriage was still moving and leaped out, staggering as he landed. He clapped a hand to his ribs. Cursed weakness. Of all the times for his body to give out on him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSir?\u201d Perry shut off the boilers and knelt on the edge of the driving seat, peering into the darkness intently.</p><p>\u201cMercury,\u201d he snapped, gesturing to the park. \u201cI saw her in the trees. Get after her.\u201d He drew sticky fingers away from his side. No point running after her himself. Frustration soared through him.</p><p>Perry leaped down into the street and sprinted toward the park.</p> <p>Skirts rustled and then Rosa was sliding under his arm to help hold him up, her dark eyes raking his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d She looked down and paled. \u201cYou\u2019ve torn your wound open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will heal.\u201d He stared after Perry. On the other side of the park an engine hissed to life as a steam carriage pulled away from the curb. \u201cDamn it.\u201d He\u2019d bet his last penny that Mercury was in that carriage. Perry would lose her and he didn\u2019t know how to drive the carriage himself in order to give chase.</p><p>Rosa pressed her gloved hand against his side. \u201cYou need to sit back down and rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t kill me,\u201d he said absently.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019ll end up bedridden for days at this rate,\u201d she replied tartly.</p> <p>That caught his attention. Lynch looked down in bemusement as his secretary clucked and scolded him back into the carriage. Her expression was furious as she tugged his undershirt back up and reexamined her bandaging.</p><p>\u201cOf all the rotten timing,\u201d she muttered under her breath. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look too bad. The bleeding is slowing. However, if you move suddenly again, I shall be most put out with you. Sit there and don\u2019t move until we reach the guild.\u201d</p><p>One didn\u2019t argue with a woman with that kind of tone. Lynch sank back into the leather seats.</p><p>Perry arrived at the door, breathing hard. \u201cLost them, sir. They had a driver waiting\u2014a man wearing similar cologne to what Garrett prefers. Looked like he was wearing some sort of half mask over his lower face. And a tall woman on the back of the carriage, like a footman. She helped hustle the masked woman into the carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d Lynch\u2019s eyes narrowed in the direction Mercury had disappeared into. \u201cThey planned this meeting.\u201d</p><p>But why? Nothing had come of it. Mercury had meant to be seen. Was she sending him a message? A taunt? Or was her presence in connection to the death of Alistair?</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to track them?\u201d Perry asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d Rosa\u2019s head jerked up.</p><p>\u201cPerry can trace scents even I can\u2019t,\u201d he admitted, then turned back to Perry and shook his head. Most of the men would be returning to the guild. There was no way he was sending Perry after the revolutionaries on her own\u2014not so soon after nearly losing Garrett.</p><p>\u201cWhen we return to the guild, I want you to take three of the men and see if the scent trail\u2019s still alive,\u201d he murmured, easing back in the seat. \u201cDon\u2019t confront them and don\u2019t be caught alone. You can give me your report in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Whatever Mercury\u2019s purpose, for tonight he had other concerns he was forced to prioritize.</p><p>Lynch hadn\u2019t been able to examine the body or the house and knew Bleight would never allow either now.</p><p>Fitz had stitched the wound in his side and they\u2019d propped him here hours ago. Staring across the dark shadows of his study, Lynch silently ran through what he knew of the case. He\u2019d examined both Haversham and Falcone himself. There\u2019d been no sign of needle marks, no toxins or poisons in either of their cups and no evidence in the house to suggest a reason behind this insanity.</p><p>Just that sticky sweet smell he\u2019d noticed in both houses.</p> <p>He could only assume that Alistair\u2019s bout of insanity would be the same.</p><p>Scraping his hair out of his face, he stared at the desktop. His mind felt dull tonight\u2014grief, most likely. He could barely think. Every time he chased a thought, it skittered away, dissolving into mist. The confrontation with Mercury kept leaping to the forefront of his mind, despite the need to focus on Alistair.</p><p>Why had she appeared tonight? Had she tracked him from Alistair\u2019s house? Was she involved with his death? If she was... His fist clenched. There would be no mercy if she was.</p><p>A sharp rap at the door sounded.</p><p>Perry. He could tell by the way she waited for his response. \u201cYes?\u201d he called, glancing at the clock. She\u2019d been gone only three hours. This wouldn\u2019t be good news.</p><p>Perry slipped in through the door, a light rain misting her hair and eyelashes. \u201cLost them,\u201d she said. \u201cI got a trail on them for several streets, then it started to rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich direction were they heading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe docks by the East End.\u201d</p><p>Lynch sat back in his chair and eyed the way she clasped her hands behind her back. \u201cYou have something else to report.\u201d</p><p>Perry sighed. \u201cWhen I lost the trail, I went back to Holland Park Avenue. I managed to pick up a scent from the man wearing cologne in the opposite alley. He never approached the house, but I assume he was watching for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot involved in the attack then,\u201d Lynch muttered. \u201cWhich means their interest was in me. But why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say, sir.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cThere\u2019s something else. The taller woman is verwulfen. I\u2019ll swear it.\u201d</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent two of the men out to check the registry, to see if they can identify a woman,\u201d she said.</p><p>The treaty with Scandinavia had introduced a change in the laws, freeing all of the verwulfen in the Empire from slavery. Yet, all newly freed verwulfen were required to register at each city and town they passed through.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d The pieces were starting to fall into place. Lynch had always been patient; the spider\u2019s web was starting to tingle, the trap slowly drawing in on Mercury. A flutter of anticipation stirred in his gut.</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d he said. \u201cClock off and get some rest. You did well tonight.\u201d</p><p>Perry didn\u2019t quite smile at the rare praise, but she nodded and took her leave.</p><p>Slowly his gaze focused on the desk in front of him and he realized there was a piece of folded vellum popped beside his inkwell.</p><p>Scent wafted off the paper\u2014Rosa\u2019s scent, reminding him of spring days and sunshine, of laughter and linen sheets. Despite his mood, he felt his shoulders ease. He\u2019d wanted a secretary who wasn\u2019t afraid of him, though he had no idea what to do with her.</p><p>Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>Well, she certainly didn\u2019t fear him, and he had to admire her ingenuity with the flask of blood. He also admired certain other aspects of her person but those were better left unthought of.</p><p>Flicking open the letter with his thumbnail, he ran his gaze across the sheet. Moonlight glanced over his shoulder, giving him just enough light to understand the slanting script.</p><p>Dear Sir,</p><p>They say that cleanliness is next to godliness, which explains your lack of reverence. I have therefore taken it upon myself to save you from sinning. You\u2019ll find your papers filed in my office; sorted, alphabetized, and ironed flat.</p><p>I would appreciate it if you could keep them this way, though I have low hopes. With all due respect...</p><p>Your servant,</p><p>Mrs. Marberry</p><p>She must have written it prior to this afternoon. And he in his blustering state had not noticed it.</p><p>Lynch traced the curl of her name, his lips softening. Blasted woman. She had an audacity that astounded him.</p><p>She had also managed to distract, if only momentarily.</p><p>Lack of reverence indeed. He knew precisely who lacked reverence, whether he and his kind had been excommunicated or not. The admission spoke of her middle-class upbringing; the Echelon had long since turned its back on a church that disavowed them for being demons. As if in retaliation, faith was becoming a surprisingly strong counterpoint amongst the poor and middle classes these days. They had no churches\u2014the Echelon had torn them down\u2014but he\u2019d heard of secret gatherings in shadowy places.</p><p>Lack of reverence. His eyes narrowed and he put the letter down, reaching for his drawer to try and find where she\u2019d put his paper.</p><p>Bloody woman.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think to ask me if you should make an appearance tonight?\u201d Rosalind snarled, striding along the dark, damp passage.</p><p>\u201cFinding someone of your height to play Mercury were your suggestion,\u201d Ingrid reminded her. \u201cKeep his lordship from suspecting you, eh?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s lips compressed. \u201cHe was injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I could smell the blood on him when he come out of that mansion.\u201d There was a long moment of silence and Rosalind realized that Ingrid was wondering why she would care. \u201cKnew he couldn\u2019t give chase,\u201d the other woman muttered. \u201cPerfect opportunity to dress Molly up in a cape and mask. We just took advantage of the situation.\u201d</p><p>Which was precisely what she would have done in Ingrid\u2019s situation. Rosalind slowed as she neared a door. What the hell was wrong with her? Lynch hadn\u2019t been injured, not badly... Though she felt an odd discomfort at the thought of his blood on her fingers. The ruse with Molly would assuage any doubts he might own if she slipped up by accident. Act. Don\u2019t react, Balfour had always said.</p><p>Holding the flickering gas lamp high, Rosalind slipped through the door. \u201cI just wish you\u2019d have given me some warning,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Shadows melted away from the encroaching light, revealing enormous man-shaped statues in the dark. Light gleamed on steel, reflecting back off the empty glass eye slit of the creature in front of her.</p><p>\u201cOne hundred and twelve,\u201d Rosalind said, staring down the rows of automatons. \u201cAnd not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalculations indicate each of our Cyclops are worth four of the Echelon\u2019s metaljackets,\u201d Ingrid said with a shrug. She tucked a cheroot between her full lips and struck a match. Red phosphorus burned in the cold, dark cellars, then Ingrid shook it out.</p><p>The other woman disdained the chill, wearing naught more than a gentleman\u2019s shirt rolled up to the elbows and a pair of tight, men\u2019s breeches. Her thick, dark hair was pulled back tight into a chignon that left her high cheekbones bare. Sucking back on the cheroot, she blew the sweet-scented smoke through the room, running a bare hand over the steel-plated arm of the Cyclops.</p><p>Rosalind sighed. \u201cAnd they have over a thousand of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d At that, her lips thinned. Ever since the mechs had abandoned the humanist cause and vanished, the secret production of the Cyclops had ground to a halt. She could be patient\u2014she would be\u2014but she was fast running out of options. And now that Lynch had discovered her supply smuggling route out of the enclaves, she had even fewer. \u201cHave you finished inquiring in the enclaves for a blacksmith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMordecai\u2019s evidently beaten us to it. Not a mech amongst them will offer us help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we look elsewhere. Kidnap one of the Echelon\u2019s master smiths.\u201d</p><p>Ingrid choked on her cheroot. \u201cAre you insane? The Echelon has them locked up tighter than a virgin\u2019s drawers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where?\u201d she snapped, spinning on her heel and staring at the silent, motionless giants. Based on the metaljackets\u2019 blueprint, they\u2019d been designed so that each heavy breastplate opened wide for a human to haul themself inside and manipulate the metal monster from within. It gave them a greater dexterity and manipulation, with a human\u2019s reactions safely guarded behind the thick steel body armor. Coupled with the cannons that were fitted to each arm, they could belch Greek fire accurately up to twenty feet.</p><p>\u201cI need men to wield them,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd men to build them. I don\u2019t have either at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been patient enough to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before Jeremy vanished!\u201d Cursing under her breath, Rosalind slapped her hand against the nearest Cyclops. Pain stung her palm, bringing with it a clarity she knew she needed. She was failing\u2014failing her brother, failing Jack and Ingrid by this odd softening toward her enemy, and failing Nate\u2019s final dream to restore human rights in Britain. Somehow, speaking of him tonight to Lynch had stirred her guilt to tormenting levels. \u201cDid you circle the guild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. No sign of Jeremy\u2019s scent. I\u2019ve been in the city too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIngrid!\u201d she snapped, turning on her friend. \u201cYou take too many risks. One look at your eyes and every blue blood in the city would know precisely what you are.\u201d</p><p>As if to spite her, Ingrid lifted her gaze, those metallic golden irises catching the light. \u201cThe laws against verwulfen have been revoked. And there\u2019s enough trickling in from Manchester and the Pits for one more not to be noticed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re safe.\u201d A blue blood was a verwulfen\u2019s natural enemy. Even Ingrid\u2019s berserker-fueled strength wouldn\u2019t help her if there were enough of them. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t take any more risks. Don\u2019t go near the city again\u2014don\u2019t show your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Ingrid\u2019s shoulders swelled, a look of burning indignation narrowing her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve as much a right as you,\u201d she growled softly. \u201cI\u2019ve hidden these bloody eyes half my life, down here in the dark. Now that the blue bloods have signed a truce with the Scandinavian verwulfen clans, I don\u2019t have to hide anymore.\u201d Her expression turned stubborn. \u201cI won\u2019t. It kills me to be cooped up down here, in these bloody tunnels.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind clasped Ingrid\u2019s hand between her own\u2014one of the few who would dare when Ingrid was in this mood. The skin beneath her right palm was burning hot. The loupe virus that made Ingrid what she was had done more than just make her super-humanly strong. \u201cI know.\u201d Rosalind\u2019s voice softened. \u201cI\u2019m just worried that the truce is still too new. The blue bloods have long memories and some of them are so old they still live in the past.\u201d She squeezed her friend\u2019s hand. \u201cIf you go above, take several of the men. Or Jack, even.\u201d</p> <p>Ingrid tossed the cheroot to the floor and ground it beneath her heel, expressionless. The very blankness of her face told Rosalind how upset she was. Ingrid had long since learned to keep her temper leashed for fear of hurting someone, and her control showed in the stiff line of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTruce?\u201d</p><p>Ingrid glared at her moodily, then nodded. Rosalind grabbed her hand in a rough shake, squeezing with her iron fingers. Ingrid\u2019s nostrils flared, but she squeezed back. The seconds dragged out, then Ingrid shoved her away, cursing under her breath.</p><p>Rosalind hit the wall and laughed\u2014an old ritual that never failed to soothe Ingrid\u2019s savage temper. She flexed the metal fingers, feeling the muscle grab through her forearm where the steel cables met tendon.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve broken my hand, you\u2019ll have to pay for it,\u201d Rosalind warned with a smile.</p> <p>Ingrid rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll kidnap a master smith.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s mirth faded at the reminder. She pushed away from the wall. \u201cCome. We\u2019d best get going after these mechs. I\u2019ll need some sleep tonight if I\u2019m going to manage my lord Nighthawk on the morrow.\u201d The thought tightened something within her\u2014a feeling of shivery anticipation.</p><p>She was so distracted she didn\u2019t even notice the sharp look her friend gave her.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Rosalind yawned as she entered her study at the guild. She\u2019d spent half the night searching for the missing mechs. There was no sign of them anywhere in the blacksmiths, the iron foundries, or the enclaves, where they might be working steel. There were plenty of whispers about the massacres in the city, however.</p><p>Closing the door, she blinked. Something seemed out of place.</p> <p>The sense of wrongness became immediately evident. Her desk was piled with a mishmash of folders, abandoned paperwork hanging precariously from the top of the pile.</p><p>The culprit was nowhere in sight.</p><p>He\u2019d found her note. Rosalind took a step forward, surveying the scene of devastation. In the wake of all that had occurred last night, she\u2019d quite forgotten it.</p><p>Poor timing on her behalf perhaps, though she\u2019d been unable to help herself at the time\u2014that rash, impulsive feeling she could never quite escape.</p><p>Control helps, she told herself, eyeing the massive pile and trying to smother her first instinct, which was retaliation. Balfour had taught her that, and while she hated him, she would use the lessons he\u2019d given her to master her own impulses.</p><p>Finding order in this chaos, however... She sighed and reached for the top sheaf of paper. The writing was barely legible, an impatient type of script, as if Lynch couldn\u2019t get the words out swiftly enough.</p><p>Mrs. Marberry,</p><p>Since you evidently have so little to do, I have found some old case files for you to sort. Some of them\u2014the 1863 files, I think\u2014refer to a rash of odd poisonings in the city. I want those files on my desk by noon. There are also lists of the blacksmiths in the city. I want them all cross-referenced against the metalworking guild\u2019s records to see who is capable of creating bio-mech parts. The guild records are...somewhere in the pile.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p><p>Lynch</p><p>P.S. I rarely sin, and when I do, it is completely intentional. I have no need of saving.</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s lips parted as she stared at the enormous mess in front of her and then curved up in a rare smile. If he thought this was the end of it, he was wrong. Eyes narrowing, she reached for a piece of paper and her pen.</p><p>The clock on the mantel ticked twelve.</p><p>Rosalind put down the last of the files and stared at it. There\u2019d been no sign of Lynch all morning, which should have been a good thing. It left her with time enough to dwell on her next move regarding the mechs and Jeremy\u2019s continued absence.</p><p>Jeremy. There had to be some sign of him somewhere, some word. She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d perished in the bombing. She\u2019d know. Wouldn\u2019t she? He\u2019d practically been hers to raise.</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d ever considered that possibility. All the bodies had been accounted for, according to the newspapers. But what if the newspapers hadn\u2019t been allowed to know the full body count? What if, for some reason, the true body count had been kept quiet?</p><p>Her breath quickened. The unfamiliar corset clamped around her ribs like an enormous fist, slowly squeezing, and heat sprang up behind her eyes. Don\u2019t. She shoved away from the desk, moving unconsciously toward the soft afternoon light that streamed through the window. Don\u2019t think about it. Keep moving. Keep hunting him. You\u2019ll find him.</p><p>Rosalind rubbed at the knuckles of her false hand, feeling the smooth join of each ball and socket through the thin satin gloves that stretched to her elbows. It ached sometimes, as if the limb were still there. Now was one of those times.</p><p>Below her, the world came and went, tiny little men in caps and coats, the ladies sporting sober bonnets and dark dresses. This wasn\u2019t the heart of the city where the Echelon roamed in all their peacock finery. The people below her were staid, middle class, human. Her kind of people. Those she fought for. Those she\u2019d sacrificed for.</p><p>To the point where she\u2019d forgotten her impressionable little brother, guilt whispered. So focused on the Cyclops plan that she\u2019d barely had time for him, focused on what she owed Nate.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she find him? The ache in her chest was so fierce she could barely breathe.</p><p>Action. Take action.</p><p>Emotion crippled a man\u2014or woman. If you couldn\u2019t lock it away, then it was best to distract oneself with affirmative action.</p><p>Rosalind took a slow, steady breath. Lynch was the answer. She needed to get inside his head and find out what he knew about Jeremy and the bombing of the tower.</p><p>No matter what she had to do to get that information.</p><p>The observatory was cool, despite the warmth of the autumn sun outside. Lynch crossed to the north wall, with its map of the stars and the crank that opened up the roof to the skies above. Grabbing the shaft, he unlocked it with a swift flick of the finger and pulled the lever that would open it. The process had been a laborious one, featuring crank and handle, until Fitz had taken one look at the system ten years ago and mechanized it.</p><p>Probably a good thing, as the newly knit wound in his side gave a warning pull as he released the lever. Though he\u2019d protested his fitness to his men, Doyle had taken one look at him and instructed a day of rest. Frustration had no handle on the feeling that ran through him.</p><p>His gaze narrowed on the beakers across the room and the steady drip of distillation. The observatory wasn\u2019t only used to stargaze; indeed, with London\u2019s smog he rarely used it for that purpose at all anymore. Instead, it had become part laboratory, part retreat. It was only here that he could force himself to stop thinking about work.</p><p>The brass dome opened with a steely rasp, like a flower revealing its petals to the sun. A fresh breeze stirred the lapel on his coat and sunlight spilled across the stone floor of the observatory, cutting off just before it reached him. Lynch skirted its edges and peered into the first beaker and the pale, tasteless liquid within. A rare poison he\u2019d been working with for months, which could create a catatonic, almost deathlike trance.</p><p>No sign of Mercury, either on the streets or in his dreams. No, last night had been a torment of its own making, featuring the temptation that was currently sorting out his folders and keeping him from his rooms\u2014fever dreams full of all manners of sin.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s mouth firmed and he turned on the distillator Fitz had designed for him. The small boiler pack shuddered to life, the water within vibrating quietly. He\u2019d give it five minutes and then steam would be filling this small corner of the observatory, quietly distilling his poisons.</p><p>Quiet footsteps caught his attention. Almost too soft to be any of the men. The first light traces of lemon perfume caught his nose.</p><p>Not yet. He wasn\u2019t ready yet. He growled a curse under his breath and turned just as Mrs. Marberry carried a tray into the room. Sunlight spilled over her and she looked up, her eyes widening in shy surprise as she took in the open roof. The expression on her face was muted and yet struck him as more real than any other he\u2019d seen from her.</p><p>Genuine, he thought, and wondered why that felt so right.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, noting that the gray gown she wore fit like a glove. Black velvet buttons ran from her throat to her waist, but the fabric there curved over her hips tightly before spilling to the floor. Her bustle hinted at the soft curves of her bottom as she turned in a slow circle, looking up, and his mouth went dry at the long slope of neck revealed by the action. Coppery red hair trailed in loose tendrils from her chignon, caressing her throat. In the sunlight she was a creature of fire, her porcelain skin almost ethereal.</p><p>He wanted to put his hands on that fabric, to tear at it until he\u2019d stripped her naked. The color slowly drained from his vision and Lynch took a sharp breath, jerking his eyes away. His pulse ticked heavily in his ears, a dull throbbing beat that should serve as warning to any blue blood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s afternoon I believe,\u201d she said, placing the tray on a messy desk. \u201cDoyle said you asked me to bring a tray to your observatory.\u201d Her voice faded as she evidently turned her back on him, examining the contents of the room with interest. \u201cWhat the devil is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lynch looked up just as she reached for a curious spiked object on one of his workbenches. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d he snapped, leaping across the room toward her.</p><p>His arms locked around her waist as her gloved finger brushed over the steel tips on the back of the mechanical hedgehog. Once activated, the pressure build-up caused each spine to explode outward.</p><p>Lynch ended up with a soft, warm armful of serge and velvet that gasped against his chest. Rosa caught a handful of his cravat, a steely, frightened expression on her face before it suddenly smoothed out.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d she said, her breath catching. \u201cYou startled me.\u201d</p><p>The fingers of her left hand were locked around the crisp white linen of his cravat. Lynch cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re strangling me.\u201d</p><p>Instantly she let him go.</p><p>Lynch reached for her right hand then paused. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>She considered his outstretched hand dubiously, then slowly placed her fingers within his grasp. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He tilted her hand over, reaching for the tips of her gloves. Rosalind sucked in a sharp breath and Lynch stilled, his gaze lifting to hers. \u201cThe tips are poisoned with curare, a very dangerous poison from South America.\u201d He slowly tugged at the glove, sliding it over her hand. \u201cI need to make sure you didn\u2019t break the skin.\u201d</p><p>Reluctance made her spine steel. He could feel her body trembling beneath the hand that stroked the small of her back as he dragged the glove free.</p><p>\u201cI barely touched it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Her hand was small and pale, the skin soft against his. Lynch slowly turned it over, examining the unmarked pads of her fingertips. Relief spread through his chest, and his thumb stroked the indentation across her palm. \u201cNo cuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have told you that.\u201d The tremble was gone from her voice, but something about her tone caught his attention.</p><p>She was watching his thumb through half-lidded, wary eyes. Lynch stopped the movement, suddenly aware of how intimate this was. The blue veins of her wrist were splayed vulnerably in front of him\u2014a temptation and a mockery. As if she were aware of where his gaze had dropped, she stiffened.</p><p>He let her go. \u201cI don\u2019t take my blood directly from the source,\u201d he said, putting a step between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rosa jerked her hand to her chest, meeting his gaze with smoky, dark eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and crossed to the tray on his desk, heart still thundering in his ears. The world was gray, but somehow Mrs. Marberry seemed like a shining light within it, the sound of her own rapid heartbeat drawing his attention like the predator he was.</p><p>Someone\u2014Doyle, no doubt\u2014had seen fit to provide him with blud-wein. He poured a shot of it and threw it back, so aware of her that he could almost feel her gaze on the back of his neck.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a rogue, Mrs. Marberry. I buy my blood from the draining factories\u2014or what\u2019s left of them.\u201d Blood that was taken in the blood taxes the Echelon had forced upon the populace for years. He slowly stoppered the decanter. \u201cI don\u2019t have the kind of living to support a thrall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied firmly. \u201cI\u2019ve never taken from the vein.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled heavily over the room. Lynch gathered himself and turned to face her. Rosa still clutched her arm, staring at him with that burning curiosity he often saw in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know why,\u201d he said, and the gray washed out of his vision suddenly.</p> <p>Color flooded into her cheeks. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprising,\u201d he noted, almost to himself. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown little restraint in the past, unless it happens to involve yourself or unless you\u2019re referring to me directly as a blue blood.\u201d He saw the little flinch she couldn\u2019t hide and refused to give in to guilt. \u201cYou don\u2019t like to think of me as a blue blood.\u201d No shock this time, but he knew he\u2019d hit a nerve. \u201cYou make me very curious about your history, Rosa. And your humanist tendencies.\u201d</p><p>The blood drained out of her face. \u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>Interesting. He picked up the glass he\u2019d used and grabbed the decanter. Taking a seat on the settee, he cocked his boots on the table and poured himself another. Rosa still hadn\u2019t moved, but tension radiated through her frame, as though she were prepared to flee at any moment. Her bare hand clutched the glove as if it were a lifeline.</p><p>\u201cYou read the pamphlets,\u201d he said, taking pity on her. \u201cYou know enough to make me think you sympathize with the humanist cause if nothing else. Very few humans have an understanding of hemlock and its applications. I would also suspect an incident in your past involving a blue blood.\u201d</p><p>Some color had returned to her cheeks. \u201cAnd why would you suspect that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe pistol,\u201d he replied bluntly. \u201cYour fear of me and my men, the way you don\u2019t like to be touched or locked in a small space with me. The only time you weren\u2019t frightened to be in the carriage together was when I was wounded and therefore, in your mind, vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him like a cornered animal. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Lynch cocked a brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she snapped, her fists clenching.</p><p>\u201cThen you are wary. And that makes me suspect you have run afoul of a blue blood.\u201d</p><p>She dragged her glove back on as if it were armor. \u201cMy father was a blue blood,\u201d she told him. \u201cMy mother had been his thrall but she fled when...when my younger brother was born. Unfortunately, she passed away; the streets were not kind to her and we had to learn to make do, which should explain the pistol. Old habits die hard.\u201d Dark lashes closed over her eyes. \u201cMy father found us when I was ten, so I have...a healthy respect for blue bloods and what they can do. That is all.\u201d</p><p>The truth perhaps, but far from the whole of it. If her father was a blue blood, that meant she had genteel origins. Who? He forced the thought away; time for that later. He could be patient, and everything he knew about her said he would need to be.</p><p>Lynch sipped at his blud-wein, knowing that the sight of it disturbed her. \u201cYour father hurt you\u2014?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she replied icily, \u201cI believe this is completely outside conventional conversation. You have no right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo poke and pry? Perhaps I share your curiosity, but instead of breaking into locked rooms\u2014the means of which interests me, by the way\u2014I am asking you.\u201d</p><p>The look she shot him was by no means friendly. \u201cI didn\u2019t break in; the door wasn\u2019t locked.\u201d</p><p>Lynch sat forward, putting his glass down. \u201cNow that,\u201d he said, \u201cis a lie. Though you do it so well I almost cannot tell.\u201d Another sobering silence. He gestured to the seat opposite him. \u201cSit. Why do we not dispense with this dancing around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll very generously grant you a lunch hour.\u201d</p><p>Still she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cAnd I shall offer you a truth in exchange for one,\u201d he said, knowing that curiosity was her downfall. He reached out and lifted the lid off the tray in front of him, revealing a spread of small cucumber sandwiches, a plate of spiced cake, and a platter of biscuits. A pot of tea steamed beside it. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t request this food for myself, obviously. I have been remiss in feeding you since you started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean,\u201d he said, looking up over the tray, \u201cthat you do not wish to tell me your truths.\u201d He watched the mutinous flare in her eyes. \u201cI have four hundred and fifty Nighthawks, Mrs. Marberry. Don\u2019t make me too curious. And I\u2019ll warn you that you are most certainly stirring my interest, though I doubt that was your intention.\u201d</p><p>She sat, though the stiff way she perched across from him indicated her mood. Lynch leaned back in the chair, his long legs stretched out in front of him. He had dozens of questions and not nearly enough answers about her, and every evasive response only gave him more questions.</p><p>\u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>He observed her. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always so accurate, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have had a lot of years to learn when someone is lying to me.\u201d He leaned forward and poured her tea. \u201cLemon,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd one sugar, I believe?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Marberry stared at him. \u201cYou know how I take my tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI observe everything, Rosa.\u201d The use of her name was entirely deliberate. This wasn\u2019t an interrogation\u2014not yet\u2014but there were certain questions about her that he needed to know the answer to. Certain...doubts. And while he had the time\u2014enforced rest, so to speak\u2014he might as well satisfy his curiosity.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, accepting the cup and saucer. She sat it on her lap, as if it were a barrier between them.</p><p>Good. He wanted her uncomfortable. He wanted her to spill her secrets.</p><p>Rosa\u2019s hands curled around the teacup as if seeking its warmth. \u201cMay I go first then? Since I have given you many truths already.\u201d</p><p>He spread his arms over the back of the chair and inclined his head. \u201cI believe only some of them were truths, but as a gentleman I\u2019ll allow my lady to go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo kind.\u201d She sipped her tea, consideration warming her eyes. \u201cYou loved Annabelle. Have you ever loved another woman?\u201d</p><p>A direct volley. She was seeking to put him on the back foot. Lynch smiled lazily. \u201cNo. I learned my lesson once, Rosa. I am not so eager to repeat the experience.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cBut its\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he cut her off. \u201cYou never denied my suggestion that you have humanist tendencies. I find that very curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She took refuge in her tea. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have humanist sympathies?\u201d</p><p>Porcelain chimed as she put her cup down and examined the tray of sandwiches. \u201cI\u2019m human, sir. Of course I have humanist tendencies.\u201d Her eyes met his, flashing with an emotion he couldn\u2019t quite name. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand. You have rights. I don\u2019t. Every man and woman in the city secretly wonders if it might be better if the humanists succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have rights, do I?\u201d Lynch mused, half to himself. \u201cI might have to explain that to the prince consort the next time we meet.\u201d</p><p>Rosa selected a sandwich for her plate, her black satin glove hovering over them. \u201cI don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re a rogue. But you\u2019re certainly in no fear of being molested in the street for your blood.\u201d Her fingers dipped and swooped, filling her plate. \u201cI\u2019m not strong enough to fight a blue blood off. They could leave me to bleed to death in a gutter and no one would dare say a thing. So yes, I do have humanist sympathies.\u201d</p><p>Nibbling at her sandwich, she looked completely at ease. But she\u2019d put her glove back on. Sitting down to eat was considered the only respectable time a woman could show her wrists to a blue blood and she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He filed that thought away, wondering why she thought she was safe with her gloves on. Did she not consider her bare throat, with the edging of black lace that taunted him?</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t watch me eat,\u201d she murmured, wiping her lips with a napkin.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t. He dropped his gaze. There was a chessboard seated on the lamp table beside him. He gestured to it. \u201cDo you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>She was toying with him. Lynch dragged it across to the table between them and cleared a space. \u201cIt will give you some sense of privacy.\u201d And himself further insight into the mystery of her character. He swiftly set it up, placing the pieces on the smooth lacquered board.</p><p>\u201cNot black, sir?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the white pieces in front of him. \u201cWhite moves first.\u201d A flashing of his teeth, perhaps a smile. \u201cI\u2019m a man. I attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar too blatant a proposition,\u201d she shot back, watching as he placed his first piece. \u201cThat is an aggressive move\u2014but there are others that are more aggressive. I think you\u2019re trying to screen me from your true purpose. And that\u201d\u2014she eyed him with a dangerous little smile\u2014\u201cis far more like your nature than such a bland assessment.\u201d</p><p>Lynch actually smiled. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I must presume you have another strategy in mind,\u201d she replied, examining the board with interest. Her dainty little hand hovered over her knight, then back to a pawn. She placed it directly in front of his. A challenge to see if he would take the bait.</p><p>He moved his knight to a threatening location, giving her a bland look. She\u2019d wanted to attack first but had restrained herself. Interesting. \u201cI always have another strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She dragged her chair closer, leaning over the board with her chin cupped in her hand. \u201cMy turn: What did you mean when you told the Duke of Bleight you\u2019d see him in the atrium if he moved against you and yours again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always feared my ambition,\u201d Lynch replied, watching her fingers hawkishly. Knight to the center. \u201cAnd he\u2019s getting older, with no direct heir except for a tangle of distant cousins. The thought that I might challenge him for the duchy is the only thing that can keep him in check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you ever consider challenging him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a rogue, Rosa.\u201d He ignored the fact that this was a second question and moved his knight to counteract her. \u201cI can\u2019t hold titles or any position in society. He should realize that, but he\u2019s too blinded by his fear of me.\u201d</p><p>She slipped a pawn across the board as if the move were inconsequential. \u201cAnd if he does break the pact, will you challenge him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said firmly, capturing her pawn. She was playing almost recklessly. He frowned. Recklessly or trying to lull him? \u201cI told him I would; therefore, I will. I can\u2019t afford to go back on my word, though. It would gain me nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t break your word, even if you could, would you?\u201d she asked, looking up. The sight of her eyes arrested him for a moment; they glittered with an intense emotion he couldn\u2019t name. \u201cI admire that, my lord. You\u2019re not the man I expected to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLynch,\u201d he corrected, holding her gaze. \u201cI am no lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could have been.\u201d Her gaze softened. \u201cYou must hate them for what they took from you.\u201d</p><p>A tight little smile crossed his lips. \u201cTook from me? Whatever makes you think the choice wasn\u2019t mine?\u201d</p><p>She knocked over her own rook in surprise. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? You haven\u2019t heard the story? You must be one of the few who haven\u2019t.\u201d He reached forward and picked up her rook, his fingers brushing her glove. Rosa flinched but she allowed the touch. \u201cAllow me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Some devil took hold of him. He set the rook upright and slid his little finger around hers, linking them. The satin was delicious and warm, so smooth against his skin. His lids lowered, thinking of that small hand on other parts of his body, stroking, soothing. Her gloves still on but nothing else as she knelt before him. All of that gorgeous red hair tumbling down her naked spine, caressing the tops of her thighs. His mouth went dry at the thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their gazes locked.</p><p>Rosa\u2019s lips parted breathlessly, as if she could see exactly what he was picturing. The room felt thick with silence, each slow tick of the clock on the mantel striking loudly in the background. The air between them was charged with tension. He could have let her go. He should have, but the tiny interlocking of their fingers seemed so innocuous. So innocent.</p><p>Hardly dangerous at all.</p> <p>He looked down and soothed his thumb over the backs of her knuckles. Why the fascination with her hands? Perhaps because she hid them from him? He was tempted to peel the glove off and press his lips to the smooth skin of her wrist, to feel the kick of her pulse against his tongue. Blood pounded through his temples. For once, he understood why a woman\u2019s hands should always be gloved.</p><p>Rosa sucked in a sharp breath, as if she hadn\u2019t taken one since he\u2019d touched her. \u201cMy lord?\u201d A whisper, tight with need.</p><p>Damnation. He let her go, digging his fingers into the hard muscle of his thigh. His erection strained against the tight leather of his breeches, the muscles in his abdomen clenched. \u201cMy turn,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>He raked through questions in his mind. Why don\u2019t you like having your hands touched? What did your father do to them? Who taught you to use a pistol? All of them sensible questions he wanted answers to. Instead, another arrested him.</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t love your husband at first. Did you ever love him?\u201d</p> <p>Rosa yanked her hand back to her side and pressed them both into her skirts. \u201cThat\u2019s very forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you about Annabelle,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not pretend you are shy or retiring. Tell me what he was like.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cNathaniel was a good man. Ambitious but kind. I thought it a fault at first, for he was always looking for the good in people, even when it wasn\u2019t there. So different from myself.\u201d She stilled. \u201cI never realized what I felt for him until he was gone.\u201d</p><p>Finally, some truth from her. Though it bothered him in a way he wouldn\u2019t have expected. Lynch eyed the chessboard and realized he\u2019d lost his entire strategy\u2014with just one touch of her hand. He shoved a knight forward and leaned back.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me what you meant about the choice of becoming a rogue being yours,\u201d she said. Hot color stained her throat. The question about her husband had somehow touched a nerve.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t finished yet. I answered three questions in a row before. You owe me another two.\u201d</p> <p>A flare of temper in her eyes. Swiftly concealed. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did your husband pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight years,\u201d she said too quickly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you never married again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you never loved again, neither did I,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever get lonely?\u201d The soft words were a mistake as soon as he said them.</p><p>Rosa stilled. She glanced his way, and despite himself, his treacherous mind chose to replay the image of her on her knees, sliding those satin gloves up the naked muscle of his thighs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s three,\u201d she replied, her tongue wetting her lips.</p> <p>\u201cAnswer it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>Fury and desire vibrated through her. The dichotomy of character intrigued him; Mrs. Marberry had been calm and flirtatious in all situations, except now, when he pushed her. He wanted to push more, to break that cool control and find out just how far the depths of her passion ran.</p><p>Such a move was dangerous though, for he was not immune to her. Not at all. The flush of blood through his body only served to remind him that she was scant inches away, a flimsy table between the pair of them. It would be a simple matter to kick the table aside and drag her into his arms.</p><p>If he were a lesser man.</p><p>She glared at him, the heat of her gaze cutting through him like a knife. \u201cOf course I get lonely. I\u2019m a widow, not a virgin.\u201d Jerking her gaze away, she grabbed her knight and took his rook. \u201cThe question is,\u201d she said, tossing the rook carelessly beside his captured pieces, \u201cwhether you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man. There are other avenues open to me,\u201d he replied, trying to examine the board to see where the play had moved.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He could feel her hot little gaze on him. \u201cThat\u2019s not an answer though, but an evasion. Which you are quite skilled at, I notice. Don\u2019t you like being under the microscope, my lord?\u201d</p><p>A faint tightening of the muscle in his jaw. He took a pawn and began to outline a campaign that would see her swiftly finished. \u201cI\u2019m too busy to think about female companionship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that,\u201d she murmured, \u201cis a lie.\u201d</p><p>Taking her rook, she smashed his pawn off the board. As he\u2019d intended.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cYou think about me,\u201d she challenged, leaning back in the chair and rolling the captured pawn between the black satin of her fingers. A slight smile curled over her lips; whatever advantage he thought he\u2019d taken, she\u2019d evidently recovered. The tip of the pawn brushed against her lips, then back again, tracing that enigmatic smile.</p><p>Lynch forced himself to shrug. \u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re a handsome woman of a certain age, and I am forced to spend a great deal of time in your company. I\u2019m only a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...passionate a declaration.\u201d Her smile deepened, eyes shining bright. \u201cDo you know what I think sometimes when you\u2019re around?\u201d</p><p>Danger. He accepted the challenge with a cool look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She curled the pawn in her palm, slowly dragging it down over the lace at her throat and across the gray French serge. It dipped over each curve and his gaze went with it. \u201cI think about all these buttons I want to unlatch.\u201d Her small pink tongue darted out and wet her lips. \u201cStarting perhaps with this one?\u201d The pawn was gone; he hadn\u2019t even noticed the sleight-of-hand. Instead her gloves found the velvet button directly beneath her chin. One deft move and it popped open.</p><p>Not even a hint of skin revealed, but suddenly the room felt far too small. He swallowed hard, leather creaking as his thighs clenched. What the hell had happened? How had he lost control of this entire situation?</p><p>\u201cI love how fiercely you control yourself,\u201d she murmured. Her smile was entirely coy, her gaze watchful. She felt safe now, when it was he who was so evidently distressed. \u201cAnother button, sir?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned and he leaned back in the chair. Curse her, but he wouldn\u2019t cry foul. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, not even a hint of concern. You\u2019re very good, my lord.\u201d The second button gave. This time skin gleamed through, warm with her body heat.</p><p>The scent of her perfume grew stronger. Everything in him wanted to shove that fucking table out of the way and drag her into his lap. A vein in his temple throbbed. But he hadn\u2019t learned control over all these years for nothing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very tempting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you like more tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like,\u201d she purred, \u201cto undo all of these wretched buttons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you start this game,\u201d he warned her, \u201cI will finish it.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes locked. Dueled. The damned woman smiled. \u201cI dare you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, he poured her another cup of tea, anything to keep his mind and body busy. The knuckles of his hands tightened as he heard her fingers whisper over another button. He didn\u2019t dare look up.</p><p>\u201cI would like to undo all of your buttons too, my lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand shook and tea spilled across the polished silver tray. Fuck. He shot her a dark look and then froze at the sight of her bare d\u00e9colletage. It barely revealed more than her green dress the other day, but the way she was sitting there, calmly unbuttoning her gown nearly did him in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have buttons,\u201d he replied sharply, cursing the hoarseness of his voice.</p><p>\u201cNot on your coat, no.\u201d Her gaze dipped, dark lashes fluttering against her smooth cheeks. Leaning forward, her bodice gaping, she took the teapot from him and accepted her cup and saucer. \u201cBut then, I wasn\u2019t speaking of your coat.\u201d</p><p>The only buttons he had were on his trousers. Mercy. His cock swelled and he shifted to hide the sight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in yours.\u201d He smiled tightly, determined to regain the upper hand. \u201cAnother button, my dear?\u201d</p><p>She sipped her tea, holding the saucer elegantly. \u201cWhat will you give me?\u201d</p><p>Anything you wish. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>Those vibrant brown eyes warmed in victory before she looked down demurely. \u201cTell me, why would you choose to become a rogue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate not knowing, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy affliction.\u201d She smiled, fingers trembling over the next button. \u201cHow much would you like to see more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen answer me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hooded. \u201cThe year I turned fifteen, I told my father I had no intentions of dueling Alistair. He was furious, but no matter how much he raged, I would not give in. So he forced my hand. He orchestrated it so that when it came time for the blood rites, the Council offered me a choice: duel Alistair for the right of heir or be denied the rites.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tensed on the button, as if surprised. \u201cYou chose to deny yourself your birthright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth it. Not if I had to kill my cousin.\u201d He gestured. \u201cNow, I believe that has answered your question.\u201d</p><p>His hot gaze devoured her. Mrs. Marberry gave him a coy smile and slowly, slowly undid the next button. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>His body burned. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>That earned another smile. They were almost as devastating as her slow manner of undressing.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she murmured, \u201cyour turn.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like being questioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to play fair, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Another enigmatic little smile that made his cock clench. She sipped her tea.</p><p>Where to begin? Hell, what had he even asked her so far? He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cHow long were you married to your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive months.\u201d Shadows flickered through her gaze, then vanished. She stared at him, her gaze cutting right through him. \u201cA button, my lord. That is the forfeit, is it not?\u201d</p><p>It took him moments longer than it should have to understand what she meant. Heat flushed into his cheeks and he pinned her ruthlessly with his gaze.</p><p>Rosa sipped her tea. Patient. Waiting. Practically daring him.</p><p>If he wanted to know more, he had to indulge her\u2014even if indulging her was the worst mistake he could ever make.</p><p>I can control this. He gave her a brief nod, acknowledging her victory, then dropped his hands to the top button of his breeches. His coat was long enough to cover himself decently, though any sense of decency had long since left this room.</p><p>Yet slipping the button free felt like the first step to the hangman\u2019s noose. His vision was swimming again, dipping between gray tones and color, his entire body on edge. He grabbed the decanter and poured himself more blud-wein\u2014anything to take the edge off.</p><p>\u201cHow did you become a blue blood then, if you were denied the rites?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was Alistair\u2019s idea. He said he felt guilty for what had happened to me and suggested a plan. He would infect me with his blood and we would both be blue bloods, free of our father\u2019s influences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA curious choice of words,\u201d she murmured. \u201c\u2018He said he felt guilty...\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have always wondered,\u201d he replied. \u201cTo go against Council edict was foolish and I knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnabelle came to me that night professing her...her feelings for me. We could be together, but only if I were a blue blood. Her father would never allow her to forge a consort contract with a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they were working together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the duke wanted to make sure that I could never overthrow his son,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhat had occurred with me was unusual, and there were members of the Council querying it. If I were named rogue, however, my chances were forever lost.\u201d</p><p>Rosa sipped her tea, thoughtful. \u201cSo Annabelle gets to become duchess, Alistair remains heir\u2014and by all means pleases a father I suspect was rather forceful\u2014and the duke gets everything he wants. They trapped you very neatly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suspect they did.\u201d</p><p>Rosa frowned. \u201cYou seem very calm about it all. I would be furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good would it have done? I was very fond of Annabelle, no matter whether she lied to me or not. I had no wish to hurt her, nor Alistair. You\u2019re right in your assessment of his father. In truth, Alistair might have gotten what he deserved\u2014he still had to live with that monster.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze dropped, her frown deepening. \u201cYou\u2019re a better person than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen revenge, Rosa. So many times and in so many different ways. I\u2019ve pulled the bodies out of the Thames and arrested hysterical wives or husbands. Revenge is a cold, lonely place, and it consumes a person until there is nothing else left but bitterness and ashes. And it always affects so many more than the people involved.\u201d He scratched at his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was ever furious. Hurt, yes. Frustrated and afraid. I\u2019ll even admit to the odd vengeful thought against the duke, though I never took action on it.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cMy father was a brutal man, and the world I walked in was a cesspit of ambition and game playing. When I walked out of the Ivory Tower, with only the clothes on my back and a rough plan of what I would do, I felt free, for the first time in my life. I could be the man I wanted to be, and I could fight them, find some sense of justice in the world.\u201d</p><p>Rosa stared at him, the teacup forgotten in her hands.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, sitting back in his chair, \u201cI do believe you owe me some buttons. Three to be precise, for you asked three direct questions.\u201d He smiled hawkishly, letting his gaze drop to the inch of chemise that beckoned him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be half naked if you keep this up.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I don\u2019t want buttons. I want hooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHooks?\u201d Her corset. Rosalind\u2019s hands stilled.</p><p>\u201cHooks,\u201d he repeated firmly.</p> <p>\u201cPlaying for high stakes now, sir.\u201d The words were breathless. She couldn\u2019t believe that he was doing this. What on earth had she been thinking, to ever call him cold?</p><p>And why the devil had she started this?</p><p>If you start this game...I will finish it. A shiver went through her. She\u2019d never felt so excited in her life.</p><p>What are you doing? He\u2019s a blue blood. But her thoughts on what constituted an enemy were beginning to fracture. She couldn\u2019t look at this man, with his rare smiles and his icily controlled hungers, and call him what she called the others. Lynch was nothing like the Echelon.</p><p>As if of their own resolve, her fingers slipped the first hook on her corset. Then the second and the third. Lace parted with a soft whisper; it was the palest of pinks, so creamy it was almost white. Smooth white flesh swelled over the top, tempting the straining hooks to part. A dangerous path she walked, but the rashness in her was overwhelming. She couldn\u2019t control this. She wanted him so desperately, her thighs were wet with it.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he said, shifting in his chair. \u201cHow did you meet your husband?\u201d</p> <p>The equivalent of a dash of cool water to the face. Guilt was a marvelous method in controlling the baser side of one\u2019s nature. \u201cNathaniel worked for the London Standard. He interviewed me for an article on one of my previous employers and asked me to dinner. We were married a week later by special license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow rash of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so fascinated with my husband?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t answer that; Rosalind saw the truth in his eyes though and her heart dipped. Lynch wanted her. And not just in his bed. He was beginning to soften toward her, his emotions engaged. It should have been a triumphant moment, but instead she froze, staring at him breathlessly.</p><p>For she herself had forgotten one of the cardinal rules in manipulation. Don\u2019t ever fall for your opponent. She stood on the edge of the precipice; she couldn\u2019t stay cold against the onslaught of this.</p><p>Yes, I can. I will. Her lips compressed.</p><p>\u201cAnother button, I believe,\u201d Lynch said, jolting her out of her shock. His hands dropped, and she stared hungrily as the second button on his pants emancipated itself.</p><p>Concentrate. She was here for a damned reason.</p> <p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d she said, taking a deep enough breath for her breasts to heave. Those gray eyes locked on her.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind licked her lips. \u201cYou said you were on the hunt for humanists. Have you ever caught any, sir?\u201d</p><p>Though he\u2019d been staring at her breasts, his eyes leaped to hers and she wondered if she\u2019d taken that one step too far. This was not the type of man to lose himself so completely in staring at her. He might forget himself, but he was no fool.</p><p>\u201cOne or two,\u201d he said.</p><p>Curse him. She couldn\u2019t ask more, not with him looking at her like that. But at least the answer gave her hope. Summoning a smile, she set another hook loose. Her nipples strained against the tight corset, the dusky tops of them peeking over the frill of lace.</p><p>Their eyes locked. He swallowed. Hard.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a damned thing to ask.\u201d Scrubbing a hand over his mouth, he shifted in his seat again. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind smiled, unable to take her eyes from his. \u201cRight now, I believe it is gray.\u201d Her lips parted... Did she dare? Yes. \u201cI\u2019m having some trouble with my hooks, sir. Would you help me?\u201d</p><p>Lynch went still, his eyes softening dangerously. \u201cRosa,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cYou did say you would finish it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>One long, drawn-out moment where she thought she\u2019d pushed him too far. Then he erupted, shoving the small table with its chess pieces out of the way and coming for her.</p><p>Black and white pawns spilled everywhere and Rosalind sucked in a sharp breath as he parted her knees with his, kneeling on the edge of her chair. His knee trapped her skirts, pinning her. \u201cI think you want me to finish it,\u201d he said, cupping her jaw and tilting her face to his. \u201cYou are a devil of a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hook, sir,\u201d she whispered innocently.</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d His gaze dropped, his spread hand sliding over the curve of her breast. \u201cSuch a difficult task. I understand why you couldn\u2019t manage it yourself.\u201d One deft flick of his fingers and the corset gaped.</p><p>Her nipple slid free of the lace edging. Lynch sucked in a sharp breath. Rosalind couldn\u2019t move. The knee between hers was dangerously alluring.</p><p>\u201cAsk me a question,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She looked up. \u201cDo you dream of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hissed through clenched teeth. His hands dropped, but hers were quicker.</p><p>She caught his wrist. \u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s hands dropped to his sides. \u201cI dream of you with your gloves on my thighs.\u201d The pulse in his temple throbbed. \u201cYour fucking gloves. I can\u2019t stop thinking about them.\u201d</p><p>Heat spilled through her. Wetness. Rosalind slid the palms of her hands lightly up his thighs, staring up at him daringly. The bulge in his pants was hot and hard. She couldn\u2019t stop her fingers from brushing over it, then again, stroking harder, her right hand clenching over his heavy length.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI can\u2019t quite seem to find the button.\u201d</p><p>Lynch speared a hand into her hair with a sharp hiss. \u201cI should take my belt to you for this.\u201d He spilled her back into the chair, his body driving hers into the soft cushions. His eyes were black again but she wasn\u2019t afraid. Not this time. She knew exactly what sort of hunger she\u2019d roused in him.</p><p>She was winning.</p><p>\u201cWould you like that, my lord?\u201d She arched her back, sliding her hands up his chest. \u201cWould you like me to bend over your desk and remove my drawers?\u201d</p><p>He groaned, tilting her head back sharply. \u201cFuck.\u201d His other fingers traced her lips. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that. I want to kiss you, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it,\u201d she whispered, her hot breath on his mouth.</p><p>Those hawkish eyes met hers, his cruel fingers cupping her jaw. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dangerous eyes. Had it been so long ago that she\u2019d thought him cold and merciless? Rosalind sucked in a breath. How wrong she\u2019d been. There was such heat in him, such passion.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His gaze dropped to her lips. \u201cNot on your pretty little mouth.\u201d Lifting his knee, he shoved her skirts up. Capturing her right hand, he slid it low, between her legs. \u201cPart your drawers.\u201d</p><p>Shock sliced through her. Then heat, stirring between her thighs, wetting the linen between her legs. She almost died at the thought of what he intended. \u201cMy lord!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot so amusing when the shoe is on the other foot. I told you I would finish it. Now do it.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid over hers, pressing her fingers against her damp drawers. A shiver trailed down her spine and Rosalind gasped, the sensation shooting all the way through her.</p><p>The coolness of his palm was rough and demanding. Rosalind\u2019s thighs tightened, trapped by his knee. She could barely see their hands, her frothy skirts tumbling over them, but she could feel it, feel the pressure of his fingers, guiding her own to a secret part of herself.</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me,\u201d she whispered, her mouth but an inch from his. A desperate part of her wanted to press her lips to his, to lick his own, to captivate him. But she held. This was a new game, with new rules, and the shiver of delight at the thought of his mastery almost undid her.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she parted her drawers, cool air stirring against her sensitive flesh. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Lynch\u2019s lips brushed her own, feather light.</p><p>She almost cried out then, half reaching for him, but his mouth trailed lower, his lips dancing over the lace of her dress, roughening it against her skin\u2014darting over her nipple. Then lower still, brushing the smooth silk of her corset, tasting her, touching her, as if it were bare skin and not clothing. She shivered, wishing she were naked, wishing it was his mouth on her body, wreaking such delicious torment.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s hand fisted in the spill of skirts, dragging them up and Rosalind lost her breath on a gasp. She couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. \u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered, her iron fingers digging into the soft cushion beneath her bottom.</p><p>A knock sounded on the door.</p><p>No! Rosalind lifted her head, trying to recapture her breath. Lynch stilled, her skirts almost baring her completely to his gaze.</p><p>\u201cTell them to go away,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He looked at her then, harsh desire burning in his gray eyes. Swallowing visibly, he glanced over his shoulder, fist clenching and unclenching in her skirts. \u201cWho the hell is it?\u201d he called, in a tone of voice that threatened dire consequences on the knocker.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, sir.\u201d A faint cough. \u201cI understand you\u2019re busy, but there\u2019s a lad at the front gate, insisting he speak with you. One of your game boys, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered, his gaze locking on hers. \u201cFuck.\u201d He lifted his voice. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeriwether.\u201d</p><p>Lynch closed his eyes, a muscle in his jaw jumping. \u201cI have to go.\u201d His voice was rough and low. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind caught his wrist as he drew his hand away. \u201cStay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet Garrett deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a helpless look, and she realized then just how much he wanted to stay. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Lips thinning, he shoved her skirts down. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting over a month for this message.\u201d Capturing her face, he tilted it ruthlessly toward his own. \u201cStay here. We have unfinished business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might just finish it myself,\u201d she said, pushing herself upright. Her thighs quivered with thwarted desire.</p><p>Lynch was in the process of standing, but at her words he caught her wrist and drew her close to him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. A quick brutal kiss, then he pushed away from her. \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind tumbled back against the armchair as he strode for the door, tugging the buttons on his pants into place. He looked almost unmoved, while she sat in a puddle of skirts and the gaping sway of her bodice, her entire body seemingly melted.</p><p>He\u2019d destroyed her. Torn all sense of control from her with one move. A dangerous man, for she wanted more desperately.</p><p>Oh God, what had she done? She needed to win back her control and desperately too, before she lost all sense of her purpose here.</p><p>\u201cCheck,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The game was afoot.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing out of your sickbed?\u201d Lynch demanded as he shut the door behind him.</p><p>Garrett\u2019s face was pale and almost waxen. Those perceptive eyes met his. \u201cFitz says I need to walk around the building at least three times a day. So I volunteered to deliver the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell. You\u2019d best get back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grimaced. \u201cPerry\u2019s driving me insane, fluffing my damned pillows and offering to fetch something for me at every second moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe nearly lost you. It frightened her.\u201d It had frightened him, though he didn\u2019t speak of it. Men generally didn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Garrett fell into step beside him, or tried to, his breath coming harshly. \u201cProbably a good thing it was me, sir.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stopped in his tracks and cut a glare toward his second. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Garrett arched a brow. \u201cYou smell like lemon verbena. If you want some advice, I\u2019d wash before you see anyone else. Unless I assume wrong; unless you don\u2019t want to keep this quiet.\u201d</p> <p>His jaw clenched. \u201cI\u2019ll take your advice then. But breathe a word of this and you\u2019ll be back in the infirmary.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s mouth curled in a slow smile. \u201cIt\u2019s about bloody time you had a woman.\u201d A hint of his old humor surfaced. \u201cBesides, if she takes the edge off you, maybe you\u2019ll let up on the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t presume so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see, sir.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p> <p>Lynch sighted his prey as she stepped out of the jewelry shop, clutching a package in her mink-gloved hands. Her brisk steps swished her burgundy skirts around her ankles as she darted into the stream of pedestrians. A young mother pushing her perambulator glanced up, saw the woman\u2019s eyes, and then jerked her child out of the way.</p><p>She was alone. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he murmured, passing a five-pound note to Meriwether, the young boy he paid to watch Mrs. Carver\u2019s house. Shoving away from the corner of the building he was leaning against, he cut directly into the oncoming traffic. Striding in front of an omnibus, he ignored the blaring horn and curse as a pneumatic rickshaw tried to veer aside. The woman in front of him glanced over her shoulder just as he reached the curb and Lynch ducked behind a tall gentleman in a top hat.</p><p>He stalked her for several streets, keeping an eye out for her husband. Mrs. Carver might be dangerous, but at five and a half feet she was manageable. Her husband however was another matter. This was the closest Lynch had come to getting his hands on Mrs. Carver since her transformation a month ago.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help matters that she\u2019d once been Barrons\u2019s ward. Taking on the newly minted verwulfen ambassador was one thing; going up against Barrons another. But she\u2019d been in the tower the day the Duke of Lannister was murdered and the bomb went off, as had her husband. Of the two of them, he knew which one was more likely to talk to him about the identity of Mercury.</p><p>A steam coach idled by the curb ahead with the distinctive snarling wolf sigil of the new ambassador. A coachman lingered beside it, his hands cupped around a cheroot as he lit it. Towering over the crowd, his blond hair brushing the collar of his great coat, he bore faint traces of his Nordic ancestry. As he slowly shook out the flame on his match, his golden eyes watched the crowd with a hungry, cold look. One of the newly released verwulfen, no doubt. Trying to fit back into society and failing badly.</p> <p>Lynch surged forward. If Mrs. Carver reached the coach, he\u2019d not get his chance. And time was running out for him.</p><p>Sidestepping through curious onlookers, he grabbed her by the upper arm, his fingers sinking into the soft velvet of her coat. The muscle of her arm tightened and he bent low before she could react.</p><p>\u201cWalk with me,\u201d he murmured. His gaze met the coachman\u2019s over the top of her head and the man stiffened. \u201cI mean you no harm.\u201d</p><p>Lena Carver shot him a lowered lash look, the bronze ring around her eyes catching the sunlight. The slightly flirtatious glance was entirely at odds with the tension running through her slight frame. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to, Sir Jasper. Max is recently come from the Manchester Pits. He made his living killing men in the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile at him then. Before I\u2019m forced to cut short his newly freed circumstances.\u201d</p><p>She considered his entreaty, then graced the burly coachman with a smile that would have shaken any normal man\u2019s wits. Sliding her hand over Lynch\u2019s, she made as if they were any other couple, out for a stroll.</p><p>The bodyguard\u2019s shoulders relaxed but his eyes never left them. Lynch turned her down a side street, toward a park.</p><p>\u201cMy husband will not approve of this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s...protective.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s verwulfen,\u201d Lynch replied, which meant everything. He let her go as they reached the park. Leaning back against the iron rails of the park fence, he stared at her. \u201cI have questions for you.\u201d</p><p>Those pretty brown eyes with their newly minted gleam widened slightly. \u201cQuestions? I\u2019m afraid I know little of my husband\u2019s work\u2014\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cQuestions about the package in your hands perhaps? No doubt if I look I\u2019ll find a half dozen ruby rings filled with hemlock.\u201d</p><p>The smile slid off her face as if it had never been. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if you are carrying poison rings.\u201d In a way, he approved. Mrs. Carver had once been a debutante, and as such, prey to the blue bloods that prowled the Echelon. Gossip had it that certain members of the younger generation thought it old-fashioned to take a debutante as their thralls, when they could take their blood by force. Only rumor of course and Lynch hadn\u2019t had time to look into it, but if so, the sudden rash of poison rings on every debutante\u2019s finger was something he was willing to turn a blind eye to.</p><p>\u201cFirstly, I want to know if there are any verwulfen women in London,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are none listed in the registry. I know. My men checked.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Carver\u2019s anxiety faded a little, as he had intended. \u201cOnly myself. The rest returned to Scandinavia once the treaty was signed.\u201d</p><p>Then where had Mercury\u2019s verwulfen companion come from?</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d she asked, fluttering her lashes.</p><p>\u201cA month ago the Duke of Lannister was stabbed, shot, and partially decapitated in the Ivory Tower,\u201d he stated, watching her reaction. Her sudden pallor took all the warmth from her pretty features. \u201cI don\u2019t care who stabbed him or tried to tear his head off\u2014and mind you I have suspicions, considering the scent trail left in the room\u2014what I\u2019m interested in is the woman who shot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I know nothing about it,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cI could make it my business to discover who decapitated the duke,\u201d he replied. Mrs. Carver, he suspected, would run straight home to her husband if he made a threat against her. But if the threat were against her husband... It was all simply a matter of applying the right pressure points.</p><p>Of course, he could never follow through with the threat. Mrs. Carver had once been Barrons\u2019s ward and he\u2019d sworn an oath to the man that he wouldn\u2019t reveal who\u2019d been in the room that day.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to know that however.</p><p>Mrs. Carver\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Relaxing slightly, he offered her his arm as a pair of elderly gentlemen strolled their way. Mrs. Carver took it, the unnatural heat of her skin permeating even through her gloves. He led her along the path, skirting a pair of squirrels chattering at each other near a park bench. \u201cThe explosion during the treaty signing was an attack by a group called humanists.\u201d The lack of surprise on her face made his mind race, but he didn\u2019t think she was involved. Will Carver wouldn\u2019t have allowed that. Still... Thought for later. \u201cThey are led by a woman who calls herself Mercury. She is always masked and her identity is unknown. I need to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prince consort has tasked me with delivering the revolutionary to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere she\u2019ll be executed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bombing cannot go unpunished, Mrs. Carver.\u201d</p><p>Nibbling on her lip, she paused. \u201cWhat if she had nothing to do with the bombing?\u201d</p><p>Interesting. The precise same statement his masked nemesis had made in the enclaves. Lynch\u2019s gaze sharpened on her. \u201cWhy would you say such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping in mind that this is all supposition,\u201d she replied, \u201cperhaps you\u2019re hunting for the wrong group? Perhaps there were humanists who broke from the revolution and decided to take matters into their own hands? Suppose she tried to stop them?\u201d</p><p>The breath went out of him. \u201cDangerous supposition, Mrs. Carver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArresting the wife of the verwulfen ambassador is bound to incite tension between Scandinavia and Britain. I\u2019m trying to cooperate as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>She knew the rules of society well. The prince consort wouldn\u2019t stand to have his new treaty smashed apart by Lynch. He wanted Mercury, but there were some prices he wouldn\u2019t pay.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to protect someone. The interesting question is who. And why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to reveal certain sensitive information, as long as I have your word not to move against me or my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on the information revealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not inclined to be obliging.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stepped in front of her. \u201cI like your husband. Don\u2019t force me to do something I don\u2019t wish to.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Carver stared up at him for a long moment, searching his gaze. \u201cYou smell like desperation, sir,\u201d she finally said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Lynch took a deep breath, trying to still the tension radiating off him. If Mrs. Carver\u2014newly a verwulfen\u2014could recognize his distress, then it must be evident indeed. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get my hands on Mercury soon, then I fear the prince consort will resort to desperate measures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019d send out the metaljackets in force?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Blunt words but true. \u201cHe\u2019s not acting entirely rational at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Carver sighed. \u201cIf I knew anything at all, I might suspect that what you were searching for can be found in Undertown.\u201d She looked up. \u201cI can\u2019t say any more than that. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lynch grabbed her arm as she turned to go, desperation driving him. \u201cYou know who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no friend of mine, though I wouldn\u2019t wish her ill.\u201d Mrs. Carver\u2019s fingers curled over his own, the strength of her grip belying her small stature. \u201cI have told you what I can, Sir Jasper. Though I fear you are hunting for the wrong person. You should be hunting for a group of escaped mechs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWho is she? Give me something, anything... A name?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Carver pried one of his fingers loose. The sudden blaze of bronze in her eyes warned him. \u201cI am terribly sorry for your predicament, sir. But I have given my word and I won\u2019t betray it. That is all I can tell you. Now get your hands off me before I am forced to call Max.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stared through her for a second more then let her go. She staggered slightly, gave him a curt look, then straightened her skirts.</p><p>\u201cWar is coming, Mrs. Carver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar\u2019s already here,\u201d she replied bluntly, then turned toward the park gate and hurried away.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Rosalind paced the hallway, clenching and unclenching her fists. The longer she\u2019d waited for Lynch, the more she\u2019d begun to question herself. In the heat of the moment, all she\u2019d wanted was him. It was only after, as her body slowly cooled, that she realized how dangerous events had become.</p><p>Losing her head like that, losing control of the game... If she wasn\u2019t careful she would find herself in deep water.</p><p>She\u2019d had to get away.</p><p>Twitching aside the curtains, she glanced into the street. No one had followed her home. Not that she expected them to, but still... Today\u2019s sudden interrogation made her wary. Did he suspect something?</p><p>I have four hundred and fifty Nighthawks, Mrs. Marberry. Don\u2019t make me too curious.</p><p>Was his curiosity satisfied? She knew hers wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHave we got a problem?\u201d Ingrid\u2019s husky voice startled her.</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s gaze jerked up as the other woman took a stealthy step into the room. \u201cAre you trying to catch me unawares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been remarkably easy of late. You need to get your mind off whatever\u2019s distracting you before Jack notices.\u201d</p><p>She stared at her friend.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like a man\u2019s cologne.\u201d Ingrid folded her arms across her chest as if daring Rosalind to reply.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I work in a whole building full of them.\u201d Lifting her arm she sniffed at herself. \u201cIt\u2019s most likely Garrett.\u201d She ignored the way Ingrid\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. Not fooled one bit. \u201cNo news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sign of Jeremy,\u201d Ingrid replied.</p><p>Restlessness itched down her spine. Rosalind started working on her gloves, frowning worriedly. \u201cI need to push plans. Lynch has nothing in his study about Jeremy or the mechs\u2014the dratted man keeps it all in his head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you may as well abort the mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She dropped her glove on one of the frilly little table covers that haunted the room. Every inch of space was taken up with knickknacks and lamps and lace doilies. \u201cI\u2019m learning too much and I\u2019m in the perfect position to hear the latest news from the Echelon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he discovers you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Rosalind affirmed.</p><p>Ingrid growled under her breath. \u201cSo what next?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind paused by the liquor cabinet and unstoppered a decanter of whiskey. She poured the pair of them a generous shot. \u201cLynch needs to find the humanists who bombed the tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m going to point him toward the mechs. I think it\u2019s time Mordecai had a taste of what it\u2019s like to look over your shoulder.\u201d</p> <p>Ingrid took her glass and clinked it against Rosalind\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d She threw the glass back. \u201cHow do you propose to do that without blowing your cover?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind swirled the contents of her glass in the lamplight, watching the play of light. Exhilaration beat in her breast and lower\u2014a longing unfulfilled. \u201cI\u2019m not. Mercury is.\u201d</p><p>Time to take a risk.</p><p>And time to assuage the restless ache inside her. She threw the whiskey back, feeling it burn all the way through her.</p><p>Feeling thwarted, Lynch sank under the waters in the pump room, the biting hot bringing a flush of warmth to his flesh. Scraping his hands over his tired face, he surfaced, blinking through the water droplets.</p><p>Steam lingered on the surface of the bathing pool and clung to the stone pillars that supported the heavy domed ceiling. The drone of the enormous furnaces and the pumps that drove water throughout the building echoed in the walls. Years ago, Fitz had taken one look at the plumbing and devised a system of hot water that not only supplied the entire guild but ran heated pipes through the stone floors too; the by-product of that bit of genius was this. The heat from the furnaces had to go somewhere, Fitz had said. Why not use it for a bathing room, much like the ones the Romans built centuries ago?</p> <p>If there was one indulgence Lynch owned, it was this.</p><p>Easing against the edge of the pool, he shut his eyes and let his body float. His cold blood made him crave the heat like one of the mythical dragons the Chinese Empire spoke of.</p><p>The steady throb of the pump engines filled the room, vibrating against his skin. Lynch let his mind float free, trying to forget about the afternoon and the incident with Mrs. Marberry. She hadn\u2019t been here when he returned and guilt added a sour flavor to his mouth. Did she regret what had happened? Perhaps it was for the best. He couldn\u2019t imagine what he was going to say to her on the morrow. Seducing his own employee...</p><p>Water rippled against his chest, gentle little waves that lapped at his skin. Lynch scraped his wet hair back and then froze.</p><p>There was nothing to stir the water but his own body.</p><p>He cracked his eyes open and stared at the shadow-wreathed figure on the other side of the pool. She knelt at the tiled edge, steam obscuring her face as she traced her fingers through the water.</p><p>His body screamed its awareness as Mercury smiled at him. Her eyes were covered, this time with a leather half mask that reminded him of Carnevale. Brass studs curled up one side in decoration and the thin gleam of her eyes watched him through the cat-slit eye holes.</p><p>\u201cWhy look,\u201d she drawled huskily, \u201cit\u2019s me Lord Nighthawk...in the flesh.\u201d</p> <p>The double entendre stirred through his gut with hot fingers. Lynch lowered his hands slowly, relaxing his arms back on the edge of the pool. A muscle ticked in his jaw. She\u2019d come here on purpose, no doubt to disarm him.</p><p>She would learn. He was never disarmed, never anything short of lethal and right now his temper was roused.</p><p>Barely eight feet of water separated them. He could cover that distance in a second, but from the way she edged onto the balls of her feet, she was expecting that. No doubt there were more than a few weapons hiding under that overwhelming brown coat.</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t have come here without reason. His curiosity was aroused.</p><p>Lynch forced his body to relax, though it was hard. Mrs. Marberry had destroyed him this afternoon and he could barely gather his thoughts\u2014or his rampant lust\u2014long enough to deal with the revolutionary. \u201cYou do realize there are over a hundred Nighthawks in this building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet not one of them noticed me.\u201d Her smile taunted him. \u201cNot even you.\u201d Pointing a forefinger at him, she made a shooting gesture that wasn\u2019t lost on him.</p><p>His gaze hooded. \u201cIf you wanted me dead, I would be.\u201d He\u2019d give her that. \u201cI just didn\u2019t realize you wanted me naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the better to seduce you, me lord.\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh. \u201cSo you can overwhelm me again? I think not. I make mistakes, my dear, but only once and only rarely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a mistake, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t precisely know what you are. But I will.\u201d He let his own smile edge over his lips. \u201cI never intended it to be difficult to get into the guild. Getting out is another matter.\u201d</p><p>Mercury slowly unfolded herself, revealing dark red skirts hooked up just enough to reveal a flirtatious froth of petticoat and a bronze corset-style bodice that thrust her pale breasts high. The same brass studs that decorated her mask ran along a heavy belt that held her pistol and her dark hair curled over her shoulder. It wasn\u2019t coincidence that her coat had fallen back, barely clinging to her pale shoulders.</p><p>His throat went dry. He\u2019d never seen a woman dressed like that before. It was indecent. Scandalous. And he wanted her more than ever.</p><p>His dreams lately had been of another woman, but right now, temptation roared. His slender secretary who liked to drive him wild, or a woman he barely knew, his sweetest obsession?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lemme go,\u201d she said with a careless shrug. The coat slipped a fraction more, revealing her rounded shoulder. \u201cThe alternative\u2019s the Echelon\u2019s dungeons and I ain\u2019t thinkin\u2019 you want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want doesn\u2019t always matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever give into your urges, me lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRarely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should.\u201d Another slow suggestive smile that sunk through his gut with iron-tipped claws. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come out of the water?\u201d She kicked the toe of her boot through the surface, sending a shower of droplets toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to get meself wet.\u201d</p><p>Lynch pushed away from the edge. He kept his eyes on her, not trusting her an inch. Steam curled around him as he stood, shaking off the water.</p><p>Mercury took a wary step back. \u201cI\u2019ll get your towel,\u201d she said, dragging it off the hook it hung on. Turning, she held it out, staying a good five feet away from the water.</p><p>Lynch found the steps that led out of the bathing pool and ascended with cool disregard for his nakedness. Water sluiced down his skin, steam rising from his bare arms as he lifted his hands and raked his wet hair back. When he glanced at her, the little smile had died, replaced by something far more watchful.</p><p>He took his time, flicking off water droplets before holding his hand out. \u201cThe towel?\u201d</p><p>A husky laugh greeted him. \u201cNow, why would I want to do that?\u201d Another slow, heated look that caressed his body. \u201cMe lord Nighthawk, imagination does you no justice at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to be able to say the same.\u201d He stepped closer.</p><p>Her smile remained, but he sensed the coiling of muscle within her at his abrupt nearness. So she was not so certain of his intentions? Good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to indulge,\u201d Mercury replied, her iron hand clenching in the toweling. \u201cBut I think we\u2019d both prefer it if I kept me mask. Adds a little, what\u2019s them Frenchies say? Jay nay say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe ne sais quoi.\u201d A certain little indescribable something. An edge. For the first time, he had the impression that she was toying with him. She knew exactly what she meant to say. He frowned slightly. The cockney was distracting, which was precisely the point, he imagined.</p><p>Who was she? His hands ached to remove the mask, to reveal her identity to him. He could do it too, before she even knew he\u2019d moved.</p><p>And then?</p><p>She was right. He liked the mask, the mystery. It drove him to distraction and yet he was not quite prepared to solve the puzzle of her identity. To do so would mean he had to act on it and reluctance sat heavily on his shoulders.</p><p>Lynch grabbed her hands where they clenched the towel and dragged them around his waist. The soft toweling brushed against his groin as Mercury landed flush against him, her sharp intake of breath telling him he\u2019d succeeded in disarming her.</p><p>\u201cDesire cuts both ways, my dear.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, her corset pressed flush against his chest. The angle thrust her breasts into smooth globes he ached to touch. \u201cSo it does.\u201d</p><p>Letting go of her hands, he drew the ends of the towel tight and tucked one edge into the other. Mercury\u2019s hands trailed over his hips, her head lowering in curious exploration and Lynch suddenly understood her. Whatever had happened between them in the enclaves\u2014whatever he thought he had lost\u2014she had lost too.</p><p>\u201cSo what makes you think I won\u2019t just hand you over to the Echelon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her fingertip trailed down the smooth trail of hair beneath his navel, tangling in the dark strands. It brushed the edge of the towel and hooked against the fabric as she tugged, just gently enough to be suggestive. Lynch sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cI think you want me for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous assumption to make considering where you are.\u201d She seemed so certain he wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Could he? That shadowed gaze met his behind the mask. He couldn\u2019t see her eyes, but he felt the connection as their gazes locked. It ran a hot hand through his body, wrapping tightly around his cock. His erection stirred against the toweling and Mercury noticed. She wet her lips, her finger sliding more securely behind the towel.</p><p>\u201cDid I presume wrong?\u201d The mask challenged him; he desperately wanted to see behind it.</p><p>And just as desperately did not. A hollow feeling pooled in his gut. Instinct. Whatever her secret was, a part of him didn\u2019t want to know it.</p><p>Why? His expression turned hard. He\u2019d learned to trust that instinct over the years, but what was it telling him?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t presume wrong.\u201d</p><p>The air between them changed. Stillness radiated through her as if he\u2019d surprised her. Lynch\u2019s gaze dropped to her mouth. He knew he was going to do it. Call it madness or insanity, he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>One hand slid around the curve of her nape, cradling the stark line of her skull. The edge of a wig cut into his hand and his mind filed that away for future pondering, even as his mouth descended on hers.</p><p>The moment their lips touched he felt the spark of it all the way through him. He wanted her. Not to capture her, not to turn her over to the prince consort, but just to have her. As his.</p><p>The thought was madness. There could be no future in this, nothing behind the heat of sex and hunger. Mercury was a shadow; he knew nothing about her. But she was his shadow, his challenge, his obsession. Mrs. Marberry was a temptation he couldn\u2019t afford, a dream of something he\u2019d long since thought gone, but this...this was safe enough to risk.</p><p>Violent need swept through him, ignited by passion and frustration. He growled deep in his throat and slid a hand down the smooth curve of her back to the full flesh of her arse. Pressing her against him, he sucked in a sharp breath as his hips rode against the soft juncture of her thighs.</p><p>Lynch squeezed his eyes shut, sensation spearing through his groin with white-hot abandon. Her tongue darted into his mouth and he crushed her against him, trying to drink her all in, to take everything he could of her. Lifting her against him, he drove her back against one of the marble columns, her thighs locking around his hips and her skirts riding up between them. A little gasp drove from her throat, then she was kissing him again, her iron hand sliding over his nape as she rolled her hips, straining against him.</p><p>Lynch tore his mouth free, gasping as his hips pinned her to the column. He didn\u2019t think. Couldn\u2019t. Need was a vicious beast within him, so hungry for release that he could barely see through the gray haze of his vision. Somehow his hunger had risen and he grabbed her wig and wrenched her head back, his lips sliding over the smooth skin of her throat. The heady kick of her pulse vibrated against his tongue and Lynch bit down, his teeth sinking into the soft flesh with a warning.</p><p>Mercury stilled, her iron fingers curling in his hair, just this side of painful. Her heart thundered like a panicked animal in her chest, her breath coming in little gasps that punctuated the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d he whispered, pressing his lips gently to the area he\u2019d just bitten. He licked her, suckling gently to soothe the hurt. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d do it?\u201d The words were reckless. That was precisely what he wanted to do. To put a knife to her throat and spill the sweet blood beneath her skin. To drink it down, to assuage the hungry ache that never completely left him.</p><p>His hands quivered as he cupped her backside, lips brushing temptingly over the smooth muscle of her trapezius. He wanted it so badly, the scent of her fear sending hunger cramping through him with iron claws. But he was better than that. He could control this. He would.</p><p>Mercury\u2019s hand slid over his throat and down his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p> <p>Lynch pulled away with a gasp, pressing his forehead to hers. Swallowing hard, he fought to rein himself in. He\u2019d never been this tempted, never come so close to losing control. It was his greatest fear and his own secret agony. \u201cI want to,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut it frightens you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t food,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\u201d He shook his head and dragged his hands up to cup her face. \u201cI want you. I want to claim you as mine, and this...this is part of it.\u201d He breathed hard, biting her lip, her chin. Lower. Pressing his face to her cheek as he moaned. \u201cI want to own you.\u201d</p><p>Mercury\u2019s iron fingers locked around his wrist. \u201cLike a thrall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He trailed his mouth down her throat and felt her head drop back stiffly. She was clinging to him, as if to hold on to some semblance of control. Lynch\u2019s lips rasped over the bite mark, feeling the imprint of his own teeth. \u201cAs mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou barely know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me something about yourself,\u201d he demanded, bringing his drugged gaze back to her flushed face.</p><p>Mercury\u2019s hands slid down his chest, one warm, the other cool iron. They trembled. \u201cYou scare me,\u201d she whispered, and he didn\u2019t think she was referring to what he could do to her.</p><p>His hands stilled. Her full mouth was parted and swollen, her breasts heaving with her breath.</p><p>Slowly, he stroked a thumb over her mouth, feeling the wetness on her lips. \u201cYou scare me,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Lynch almost caught a shadowed glimpse of her eyes as they darted to his. Then she turned her face away, shutting them. A shudder ran through her. A reckless laugh. \u201cI never expected this.\u201d Slowly her hands ran over his shoulders, fingertips trailing over his skin. \u201cI should ne\u2019er \u2019ave kissed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d She leaned forward and kissed his chest. Opening her mouth she licked his skin, her small blunt teeth sinking into the muscle of his pectoral.</p><p>Lynch sucked in a sharp gasp at the flare of pain, his hands clenching into fists beside her face. His hips gave an involuntary flex, and heat flared through his mouth. Need.</p><p>Mercury\u2019s hips slowly unlocked and then she was sliding down him with sinuous grace, her lips trailing over the smooth skin of his abdomen. Muscle clenched and Lynch shoved a hand against the marble column to hold himself up, his gaze locking on her. Mercury slid to her knees, her palms gliding over his thighs and her lips grazing the roughness of the towel, dangerously close to his groin.</p><p>She looked up and Lynch\u2019s knees almost gave at the heated look on her face. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d she whispered, a slow smile spreading over her lips. Slowly she kissed him through the towel, the touch spearing through his engorged member.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s other hand hit the column as he shuddered. \u201cNot even an inch,\u201d he told her on a rough laugh, almost an exhale.</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u201d\u2014her eyes ran over him\u2014\u201ca good ten inches?\u201d</p><p>His breath caught. Slowly, she reached up and hooked her fingers in the towel. The tucked end came loose and the rough toweling rasped over his erection as it dragged free.</p> <p>He knew what she intended. Still, he could barely breathe as she slid her palms up his thighs, her tongue darting out to wet her lips.</p><p>The shock of her hot mouth almost drove him out of his skin. His hand speared down through her hair and he thrust against her, feeling the wet glide of her mouth over his cock. Her teeth scraped against him as if in warning and behind the mask he saw the gleam of light off her eyes.</p><p>Yes. His head bowed in defeat, a guttural groan tearing through his throat. She had the upper hand for the moment, but for once he didn\u2019t give a damn. She was his unholy fascination, simply his in a way that he couldn\u2019t yet comprehend and he needed this so damned much. The week\u2019s torment had driven him out of his mind. He still didn\u2019t know what he would do about Mercury, but luckily this didn\u2019t require thinking at all.</p><p>That hot little mouth worked him wetly, stealing his breath and the few wits he had left. Lynch\u2019s mouth parted on a gasp, his eyes hooding as his fist clenched in the wig she wore.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>A smile widened over her full mouth and her iron hand fisted around the base of his cock, making him suck in a sharp breath. Hell, that felt so fucking good. He was so close, he needed her to stop, but somehow his lips wouldn\u2019t say the words and she knew it.</p><p>She\u2019d put a spell on him. One kiss in the enclaves like a bullet to the chest and now he couldn\u2019t stop feeling it, no matter what the consequences were.</p><p>Mercury took him deep, her tongue stroking his shaft with wet abandon and he was lost.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s fist clenched and he gasped, thrusting hard against her mouth as he came with a guttural groan. Those pink, swollen lips suckled the sensitive head of his cock and he collapsed against the column, breathing hard.</p><p>Mercury pressed a kiss against his thigh, stirring the fine hairs against his skin so that he shivered. \u201cWell,\u201d she whispered, licking her lips. \u201cMe lord Nighthawk, you do impress.\u201d She smiled up at him, cool and mysterious, then slowly slid up his body, pressing herself between him and the column.</p><p>If she thought that would undo him, then she was mistaken. And if she thought that was the end of what lay between them... He watched her with cool eyes, stroking the back of his fingers against her swollen mouth.</p><p>\u201cI have barely begun,\u201d he murmured, leaning closer and breathing in the sweet taste of her breath. A smile curled over his mouth as he looked down, his fingers trailing lower, brushing over the smooth curve of her up thrust breast. \u201cYou, my love, are no lady.\u201d</p><p>Her breath quickened at the teasing stir of his touch. \u201cDo you want me to be one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He slid his hand over her nape and spun her around, pressing her hands against the column. She tensed, then stilled as he smoothed the long, dark tail of her hair out of the way and pressed his open mouth against the back of her neck. Suckling hard, he brought the blood to the surface in a red bruise then nipped at the damning mark. Mercury shivered, a soft little gasp of surrender crossing her lips, and Lynch smiled.</p><p>He ran his lips down the soft curve of her shoulder, biting her just enough to leave a mark, then soothing the sting with his tongue. Slowly his hands slid up beneath her coat, tracing the curve of the corset she wore. The feel of it stirred desire through him and he pressed his hips against her bottom, letting her know just how much he wanted her.</p><p>Mercury sucked in a sharp breath, half turning. \u201cMe lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her hands and shoved them against the column. \u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d Then his hands were cupping her breasts, holding the plump weight in his palms.</p><p>Mercury\u2019s head tilted back with a groan. \u201cMercy,\u201d she moaned. \u201cWe need to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we?\u201d He edged the lip of the corset down and her nipple sprang free, hard and tight. Sliding his other hand against her abdomen, he drew her hips back against him, rolling the turgid peak of her nipple between his fingers. \u201cI thought you came here for this?\u201d</p><p>Mercury arched into him, her head falling forward with a helpless gasp. He could feel the surrender in her body and the shaking in her knees.</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes.\u201d She shook her head and moaned. \u201cYou want to know who blew up the tower?\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s hand tightened on her hip. The words cut through him like a knife. To hide it, he pressed a kiss against the tender skin below her ear and was rewarded with another shiver. She liked this. \u201cYou still claim you didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor did I burn the draining factories.\u201d Her hand splayed over the column, her iron fingers flexing unconsciously. The other hand slid between them, wrapping around his growing erection. \u201cA year ago,\u201d she gasped, \u201cI set a group o\u2019 mechs free o\u2019 the enclaves. They wanted vengeance and I...I needed \u2019em for somewhat.\u201d</p><p>His lashes lowered and he thrust into the grip of her palm. The steel boiler pack he\u2019d taken from her at the enclaves. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a power struggle. They broke from me leadership and burned the factories. I were tryin\u2019 to stop \u2019em when they \u2019it the Tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. Her tight fist made the vein in his temple throb but he could contain the fierce need now. Her clever ministrations had seen to that. She, however, was not so satisfied. \u201cThat explosion nearly killed half the blue bloods of the court. I thought that was what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonal reasons,\u201d she replied, tilting her head to the side to glance back over her shoulder. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t succeed, did it? Now I\u2019ve got every blasted Coldrush Guard and Nighthawk on me trail. You think I wanted that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re in a lot of danger.\u201d</p><p>She laughed under her breath, an almost sad sound. \u201cI chose this path. I knew the risks.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. Damn her, but he was starting to soften toward her. Was she telling the truth? \u201cGive yourself up,\u201d he said, edging his hand down her abdomen, \u201cand I\u2019ll demand a lenient sentence.\u201d</p><p>The stiffness in her body was almost anticipatory. Tension radiated through her and she dragged her iron hand to his, urging it lower. \u201cYou can\u2019t make the prince consort do anythin\u2019 \u2019e don\u2019t wanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ways to play the game,\u201d he replied, his fingers sliding between the heat of her legs, bunching up her skirts. \u201cIf you tell me everything you know about the mechs, I\u2019m inclined to be lenient.\u201d</p><p>She was tempted. Gasping hard, she pressed her lips to the column, her hips driving back into his groin as his fingers dipped into the wet heat between her thighs. She wasn\u2019t wearing drawers. \u201cMordecai,\u201d she gasped. \u201c\u2019Is name\u2019s Mordecai. I don\u2019t know where \u2019e is, but I do know this: \u2019e\u2019s got somethin\u2019 to do with the massacres in the Echelon. I seen \u2019im near the second crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow convenient that you were nearby,\u201d he murmured, his mind racing. The mechs had something to do with the madness sweeping the Echelon? That meant it had to be a toxin or a poison. It was man-made and that meant he could catch them.</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t lying.</p><p>Grabbing her wrists, he spun her around and shoved her against the marble column, holding her hands over her head.</p><p>Slowly his hands relaxed on hers, sliding down over the betraying pulse of her right wrist. \u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded, \u201cthat you had nothing to do with the massacres. With Lord Arrondale\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Mercury pulled against his grip but didn\u2019t fight him. \u201cI \u2019ad nought to do wit\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse ticked through her wrist, as steady as before. She was telling the truth. Either that or she was such a good liar she could control her body\u2019s reflexes.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d he said.</p><p>His thumb stroked the soft skin of her wrist. The other one was cool metal, woven so seamlessly into skin that he recognized it as a master-smith job. No wonder her reactions were so exquisite; metal hydraulics had been linked to flesh tendons, and muscle sewn to the thin fibrous sheeting of the interior of her gauntleted wrist. The limb worked almost as naturally as her right hand.</p><p>\u201cYou want me, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been chasin\u2019 me for months.\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s gaze hooded. He let her go, hands sliding down her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t need to chase you,\u201d he whispered in his ear. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Lynch pushed away from the column and dragged the towel around his hips. \u201cI won\u2019t be played for a fool twice. But you...you\u2019re burning for it.\u201d He backed away, watching her shocked expression as she realized he had no intentions of finishing this.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d \u2019ave to fight me way free,\u201d she whispered, her pupils dilated with desire.</p><p>He should capture her. Lock her up now. But what to do with her? He was certain the prince consort had spies in the guild, and although he\u2019d managed to keep one or two humanists quietly guarded in his time, the possibility of the prince consort getting his hands on Mercury made him feel physically ill. He couldn\u2019t guarantee her safety. Not at the guild and not anywhere in his little hidey-holes in the city. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lynch took a step away. \u201cGo via the south wing and wait until the clock tower chimes ten. The guards will be changing their shift.\u201d He tucked the towel into itself, uncertain whether he was doing the right thing. A thought flashed into mind: if he couldn\u2019t hand her over to the prince consort now, how was he going to do it in when the time came?</p><p>Mercury\u2019s head. Or his.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said, before he changed his mind. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p> <p>It was a long, slow climb to his rooms and he barely noticed any of it. Once he\u2019d left the warm steamy chamber, his mind had started working again.</p><p>What the hell was he doing? Lynch knew what she was doing and doing well\u2014testing his resolve, slowly turning him away from his purpose. He hadn\u2019t missed her words about a challenge to her leadership. She\u2019d meant to set him upon the mechs tonight and they both knew it.</p><p>But had she meant anything else she\u2019d said? Or was seducing him just a way to soften him? His fist clenched. He highly suspected she was playing him, though whether he\u2019d managed to inflict some damage on her own psyche, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>This had to stop. He had less than a week to \u201cfind\u201d Mercury and deliver her to the Echelon. The first part seemingly the easier of the two tasks. He needed to focus himself and think about what he was going to do before he found himself played for a fool.</p><p>Lynch stopped in front of the door to Mrs. Marberry\u2019s study, the scent of lemon-infused perfume flavoring the air. Here was another reason his footsteps dragged. Guilt suffused him. He\u2019d left Rosa this afternoon only to find her gone when he returned. After his actions in the observatory, it was little wonder.</p> <p>When he was in her presence, he hadn\u2019t once thought of Mercury. Rosa eclipsed all thoughts of any other woman. Yet one steamy encounter in the bathhouse had proven him as susceptible as any other man.</p><p>Both women intrigued him in their ways. Mercury was a mystery, designed to be solved. A challenge. Sex.</p><p>And Rosa? His stomach clenched. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what she meant to him. Her slightly bawdy humor intrigued him and he found himself seeking her out increasingly. The shocking truth was that he liked spending time with her. She drove him insane with her little games, but the thought of them made him smile\u2014a feeling of lightness when she was around, as if the sun shone just that little bit brighter.</p><p>So why then had he betrayed her in such a way? Each step away from the steam room only made him feel more uneasy with his actions. He\u2019d lost his head for a moment, taken pleasure for pleasure\u2019s sake. The agony of it speared through him. He wasn\u2019t the sort of man who could bed two women at the same time. His actions tonight had taken the choice from him, and for a moment he almost hated Mercury for taking Rosa from him. It wasn\u2019t a fair thought though\u2014he\u2019d been the one at blame. The one who hadn\u2019t been able to deny himself.</p><p>And it damn well shouldn\u2019t matter. Today had beguiled him in ways he had to turn his back on. He had a job to do and a week to do it in. If he didn\u2019t wall himself off from these distractions, then none of this would matter. He\u2019d be executed in the atrium.</p><p>Rubbing at his chest, he pushed into Rosa\u2019s study. She\u2019d gone home long ago, but the ghost of her remained in her fragrance and the meticulous neatness of the room. A vein in Lynch\u2019s temple throbbed. He had to forget her. She appealed to a future that didn\u2019t exist for him.</p> <p>The heady trail of her perfume, however, wouldn\u2019t let him forget. He followed it through his study, to the previously locked door of his private rooms. Warm candlelight filled his bedroom, the candle sitting in a puddle of wax. She\u2019d evidently expected him long before.</p><p>There was a note on his pillow and something small and black beside it. Lynch frowned before realizing what it was.</p><p>He crossed slowly to the bed. The letter tempted him. His fingers almost itched to touch it, but he\u2019d made his decision. Mrs. Marberry needed to be forgotten\u2014for her own sake as much as his. No matter how much he longed to see her again.</p><p>Pull yourself together. Focus. He crumpled the letter in his fist and threw it in the cold grate where it landed with a soft exhale of white ash. The velvet button however...that he kept, slipping into his pocket as a reminder of what could have been.</p><p>Then he turned and headed for his armoire and the stark leather body armor that awaited him. He had work to do.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Fog boiled through the East End, filling the close-knit streets and obscuring the houses below. Lynch peered across the disembodied rooftops, rubbing at his knuckles absently. This was a dangerous part of town, ruled by cutthroat human gangs and the Devil of Whitechapel himself, one of the few rogue blue bloods who\u2019d fought free of his fate and carved his own living outside of Echelon power.</p><p>The city walls loomed in the distance, keeping the Echelon in and the human rabble out. Both groups seemed to prefer it that way, and it was an easy way of distinguishing who belonged where.</p> <p>Sound skittered off the tiles behind him and a half glance alerted him to the arrival of Byrnes. The other man moved with catlike grace along the ridge of the house, fog stirring around his boots as he silently surveyed the world. The taste of coal was thick in the air, like the exhale of a pipe-smoker\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Lynch asked.</p><p>\u201cI found an entrance to Undertown,\u201d Byrnes murmured, kneeling beside him. His cold gaze raked the fog. Garrett was a leader of men, but Byrnes was the only choice when it came to hunting in dark spaces. He liked to be alone, liked the shadows. \u201cI wish you\u2019d brought more men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had that lecture from Doyle already. I want to observe tonight, not attack.\u201d Lynch scratched at his jaw. He\u2019d let her go but that meant nothing. He needed Mercury\u2019s secrets, to discover if what she had said about the mechs was true. \u201cWhere\u2019s the entrance to Undertown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind a whorehouse in Limey,\u201d Byrnes replied. \u201cTrapdoor around the back that looks like it leads to a cellar. Someone\u2019s cut a hole down into the ELU tunnels.\u201d</p><p>No doubt the brothel fronted as a smuggling den then. Undertown existed for enterprising types. Lynch\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cA guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slipped him,\u201d Byrnes replied. \u201cHe\u2019s too busy fondling the merchandise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move, then.\u201d</p><p>The tiles were slick beneath Lynch\u2019s boots, but he moved like liquid through the night, knowing that Byrnes followed. Fierce joy arose in him as he leaped across a narrow alley and landed on a nearby roof, his feet barely touching before he raced up the steep slope of the roof. This was the only time he felt truly free, unhindered by responsibility and duty. Byrnes might frown on him taking such an active role in the hunt, but Lynch needed it, now more than ever.</p><p>With a sharp gesture, he indicated Byrnes to take the lead once they reached Jamaica Street. The silence of the world was strangely eerie now that martial law had descended. People no doubt prowled the streets\u2014there weren\u2019t enough guards to police every rookery\u2014but they kept their outings quiet.</p><p>A whispered argument caught his ear, ghosting through the fog. He ignored it, trying to stay low on the roofline and out of the stark moonlight.</p><p>And then something about the words caught his ear. A voice he knew only too well. \u201cYou must be mistaken,\u201d Mrs. Marberry said quite clearly, her voice echoing through the reaches. \u201cI\u2019ve paid my lease for the month.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stopped in his tracks. What the hell was she doing out? One glance showed Byrnes vanishing into the shadows. Lynch ought to move on; duty beckoned. He\u2019d made his decision earlier about Mrs. Marberry and he intended to stick with it.</p><p>Then a man\u2019s low-laughed reply made every hair on the back of his neck lift, the world muting down to gray shadows tinged with red. Lynch knew that sort of laugh. He was moving before he could think.</p><p>Rosalind leaned against the brick wall, trying not to breathe too deeply. Her temporary landlord reeked of gin.</p><p>The butcher leered down her bodice, not even making pretense at decency. \u201cI don\u2019t recall that transaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to fetch the receipt?\u201d she replied through her teeth. She knew precisely what he was up to. A widow was considered fair game here in the East End and she\u2019d been lucky to be unmolested for so long. Of course, if he knew what she was planning\u2014how easy it would be to slit his throat\u2014then he might not be so interested.</p><p>She stilled her impulses. A body in the streets would raise questions that she didn\u2019t need right now. Someone like Mrs. Marberry would deal with this in other ways.</p><p>\u201cI shall look for it,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps you would prefer to speak to my brother Jack about the misunderstanding?\u201d It rankled to involve a man, but sometimes it was quicker. Rosalind wasn\u2019t above using whatever tool was needed for the task.</p><p>Taking a step to the side, she jerked back as the butcher slammed a meaty hand against the wall beside her face. \u201cLet\u2019s not cause trouble we don\u2019t need,\u201d he said, looking around. \u201cYou and I, we can come at some sort of arrangement.\u201d</p><p>The press of his body almost made her gag. She was half tempted to trigger the blade in her iron hand and shove it up underneath his fat chin, just to see the piggish gleam in his eyes disappear.</p><p>\u201cListen here\u2014\u201d she began, when a shadow swooped down from above.</p><p>The butcher disappeared. One moment, his gap-toothed smirk was in her face and the next he was slammed up against the wall by a cloaked figure. The stranger held the butcher by one hand, his fingers digging into the man\u2019s throat with ease. Rosalind\u2019s mouth parted in shock as she recognized the harsh, aquiline features and cold burning gleam of Lynch\u2019s eyes.</p><p>What was he doing here? Her stomach twisted itself in knots as she mentally raked her attire. She wore nothing of Mercury\u2019s and she\u2019d liberally sprayed herself with perfume before leaving her home. Unless the imprint of what had happened in the steamy bathing room beneath the guild had left some sort of invisible mark\u2014a scarlet letter painted against her forehead.</p><p>Had he followed her from the guild? She was rarely careless, but she knew her head had not been in a clear space of mind. Instead, frustration and sexual desire had raked through her, driving her half-mad with impatience. She\u2019d had to get out of there before she marched back in and demanded her dues. This was twice now he\u2019d left her on the edge, her body thrumming with unfulfilled need.</p><p>I don\u2019t need to chase you... You\u2019ll come back to me.</p><p>He was right. Even now her body betrayed her, fierce hunger beating in her breast as she eyed that hard, muscular frame\u2014a body she knew almost every inch of now.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Lynch asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYe-es.\u201d A hoarse reply. The scent of urine filled the air. \u201cPlease\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your mouth shut.\u201d Lynch\u2019s voice was almost unrecognizable, almost metallic. A knife appeared in his other hand and he pressed the sharp edge to the man\u2019s throat and leaned on it just enough to break the skin. \u201cThis woman is under my protection, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Those piggy eyes widened and the butcher made a whimpering sound that could have been assent. Rosalind took a nervous step back. The demon rode him hard tonight. Her hand slid into her pocket and gripped the hilt of the pistol strapped to her thigh. Then let go. She didn\u2019t quite know what to do.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever come near her again, I\u2019ll cut your throat,\u201d Lynch whispered. \u201cAnd nobody will ever find the body.\u201d His gaze dropped as the knife moved an inch, slicing through skin like it was paper. Blood slid between the rolls of the butcher\u2019s chin. \u201cHer lease is free for six months, do you understand? And all the other women who rent off you\u2014you don\u2019t touch them either.\u201d He leaned close, menace radiating from him. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think I won\u2019t have someone watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d the butcher gasped, swallowing against the blade.</p><p>Another rasp of the knife. Rosalind watched in morbid fascination as Lynch sliced the man from ear to ear, the pressure just firm enough to part the skin. The butcher was barely even bleeding but he\u2019d remember it. And when he looked in the mirror in the morning to shave, he\u2019d see evidence of this night.</p><p>Lynch shoved away from him and the man tumbled to the cobbles, crying in great, racking sobs. \u201cGo,\u201d he said coldly, wiping the edge of the knife against his breeches. \u201cBefore I change my mind and have you arrested for breaking curfew.\u201d</p><p>A quick scramble on the cobbles, then the butcher staggered past her, so frightened he didn\u2019t even seem to see her. Rosalind pressed back against the bricks to avoid him, then slowly looked up.</p><p>Lynch breathed hard, staring down at his gloved hands. He closed his eyes, his entire body trembling.</p><p>Something was wrong. Rosalind wet her lips and pushed away from the building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she whispered. He hadn\u2019t followed her. He couldn\u2019t have\u2014or else he wouldn\u2019t have stayed his hand with just the butcher. This was pure chance that their paths had crossed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hoarse words. He reached out and splayed a hand over the pitted brickwork. The very preciseness of his movements made her still, the hairs on the back of her neck lifting. She\u2019d seen this before in Balfour.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the man she knew; his hunger was in ascendancy, Lynch holding on to it by the thinnest of leashes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing out?\u201d he asked harshly. \u201cIt\u2019s martial law. I should damned well arrest you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for my brother,\u201d she said, a pang of sadness twisting through her. \u201cHe\u2019s not come home yet.\u201d</p><p>The words almost bought tears to her eyes. She was holding on to sanity herself by the slightest grip. Every day only tightened the knot inside her heart, where Jeremy belonged. No matter how busy she kept herself, the quiet moments still crept up, where she couldn\u2019t help but dwell on her growing sense of loss.</p><p>Still no sign of him... She couldn\u2019t give up. She wouldn\u2019t... But why couldn\u2019t she find him?</p><p>Lynch turned black eyes on her, the irises completely obliterated by darkness. \u201cHow often has that man harassed you? Has he ever\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she hastened to assure him. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t dared before. I came across him on the way home and he\u2019d been drinking\u2014\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAnd I have my pistol. For men like that.\u201d</p><p>Lynch pushed away from the wall. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you draw it?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind was tempted to back away but didn\u2019t dare. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I needed to. I was in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like it.\u201d</p><p>She gaped for words, not understanding the change in him. His anger was so fierce she could almost feel it on her skin. \u201cWell. I don\u2019t think I shall have to be concerned in the future. Word will spread after that little performance.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm. \u201cI would force you to stay at the guild, but I don\u2019t think that wise. I\u2019ll set a man to watch over you instead.\u201d</p> <p>The closeness of his body set her on fire, her heart hammering in her chest. She couldn\u2019t quite forget the feel of those clever fingers between her thighs and the rasp of his teeth against her throat. Concentrating was hard, but she would not be undone like she had been in the bathing room. \u201cNo,\u201d she blurted. The worst thing possible. \u201cThat\u2019s quite all right. I don\u2019t need a Nighthawk on my doorstep.\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cAnd why don\u2019t you want me staying at the guild? I thought...after this afternoon\u2014?\u201d</p><p>His gaze lowered, but he wasn\u2019t staring at her breasts as the butcher had. \u201cThis afternoon was a mistake,\u201d he said gently but firmly. \u201cI should never have taken such liberties and I beg your forgiveness.\u201d He met her gaze then. The black was fading, but the implacability of his resolve was not. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again, Rosa. It can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She should never have provoked it in the first place. Yet her heart clenched at his words, a dangerous sense of...something...filling her. Disappointment?</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she blurted recklessly.</p><p>Lynch seemed to withdraw into himself as if he were putting up walls. \u201cYou\u2019re my secretary,\u201d he said, \u201cand I your employer. I would be taking advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI wanted what happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed another woman tonight,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cYou should know that.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known. Of course she\u2019d known. Yet the way he threw it in her face actually hurt. She could feel the heat draining from her skin, her heart suddenly pounding sharply in her ears. How ridiculous... To feel such jealousy over what was essentially herself.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lynch drew away, raking a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she... Is she someone you know?\u201d It seemed ridiculous to ask, but she was suddenly desperate to know what he truly thought about her. Or about Rosa Marberry.</p><p>Anger filled her. She wasn\u2019t Rosa Marberry. The woman was just a role. Yet it felt real. A tiny little part of her wanted to be Rosa Marberry. Someone without the crushing burden of her past or the pressure of a missing brother. Someone that Jasper Lynch had wanted, even for a second.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s bleakness surprised her. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s no one I know, no one...important.\u201d</p><p>That made the ache fiercer. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have touched you. The shame is all mine,\u201d he replied. A faint hesitation. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll walk you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She jerked away. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can find my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosa.\u201d A hand caught her upper arm.</p><p>She lashed out then, balling her right hand into a fist and driving it into his gut. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me! Just leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>He exhaled sharply but the ribbed padding of his armor deflected the blow and she was left clutching at her hand, heat bubbling up behind her eyes.</p><p>The shock of it took her by surprise. Then she was crying and she couldn\u2019t stop, wet messy tears sliding down her cheeks and a sob catching in her throat. She jammed her fist against her teeth to stop it from escaping, a hot flare of pain sliding through the wounded limb.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Lynch cursed. He stepped closer, the toes of his boots coming into her watery vision. \u201cDamn it, Rosa. Please don\u2019t cry.\u201d His hands slid over her upper arms and she stiffened, but he was only rubbing them. Her metal hand was far from his touch.</p><p>Then his arms wrapped around her, crushing her close. Rosalind fought for a second, hot angry tears scoring her cheeks, then collapsed into his arms. Hesitantly, she put her hand against his chest. Sexual desire she could fight, but not this... She wanted to be held as if someone cared, just this once.</p><p>Hurt bubbled up inside her at the thought. A sudden lurching wave of grief went through her; she missed her husband so dreadfully. Or perhaps simply the touch of a man, the warm companionship, the feeling that someone would look after her, instead of always being the one to look after everyone else.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind curled into Lynch\u2019s arms, silently pleading with him to hold her. Shaking her head, she buried her face against his chest and let the tears come.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she was strong enough to deal with this but she was coming apart at the seams, fracturing, her entire world shattering like a stained-glass window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be strong,\u201d she blurted, not knowing where the words were coming from.</p><p>\u201cYou are strong\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she cried. \u201cEverything is going wrong. Everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he replied, frustration edging his voice. He rubbed her back, his hand curling protectively against her spine. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Rosa? What is \u2018everything\u2019? Is it the butcher? Or...me?\u201d</p><p>Longing filled her. Rosalind wanted to tell him, to blurt out all of her troubles and stay here in his arms. To have someone else deal with the problem for once. As if someone cared, as if someone would look after her. What a mess. She dragged strands of wet hair off her cheeks and shook her head. If she told him the truth, the caring tone would leech out of his voice immediately. He wasn\u2019t her ally nor even her friend. Not truly. She had to forget this feeling and forge ahead on the path she\u2019d set herself.</p><p>You are alone. That\u2019s how it had to be\u2014or had been since Nate\u2019s death.</p><p>Dragging in a breath, she wiped her eyes, her cheeks. The tears slid silently now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosa,\u201d he whispered, cupping her face. An echo of her pain lingered in his expression, as if it actually hurt him to see this. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Her breath caught again. \u201cI can\u2019t find my brother. I haven\u2019t seen him...for a long time. I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s still alive.\u201d Her mouth kept saying the words even as her horrified brain screamed at her to shut up.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s hands cupped her face and tilted it up. \u201cI can help you, Rosa. I can find him. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. Nobody can help me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze turned watchful. \u201cAre you afraid of what might happen if I do find him? Rosa, you said once he\u2019d fallen in with a bad crowd. Is he... Is he a humanist?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened on his sleeve in fear and she looked up, a swift denial on her lips.</p><p>Lynch pressed his finger against her mouth, stilling the words. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he demanded in a silky-harsh voice. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, please.\u201d The backs of his fingers brushed against her cheek, tracing the path of her tears. \u201cI\u2019m not a monster, Rosa. I wouldn\u2019t hurt him. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve turned a blind eye.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief shivered through her. \u201cYou lied to the Echelon?\u201d</p><p>His hands were almost hypnotic, tracing over the curve of her lip. \u201cSometimes the Council misreads a situation.\u201d His fingers hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not the enemy, Rosa. I never have been.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, taking a deep, trembling breath. Did she dare trust him? It was so tempting, but she\u2019d had her lessons beaten into her over the years with brutal efficiency. Could she go against everything she\u2019d ever learned?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>It broke something inside her. She trembled beneath his touch, another hot tear sliding down her cheek. \u201cI wanted to try and find him. That\u2019s why I took the job as your secretary,\u201d she whispered. She needed this, she realized. Needed some sense of honesty between them. \u201cI thought you might have word of him. That\u2019s why I went through all your papers. That\u2019s why I picked the lock on your study. I\u2019ve...lied to you several times.\u201d</p><p>He was so still. She looked up, catching his wrist as if he sought to draw away.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a humanist,\u201d she replied. The words almost shriveled on her tongue. \u201cJust a boy though. I tried to protect him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut boys will do as they will.\u201d Lynch frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>Again she couldn\u2019t speak the words. This went against everything she believed in. Lynch watched her silently until she finally tore her gaze away. \u201cJeremy,\u201d she murmured. \u201cJeremy Fairchild.\u201d Her voice dropped wistfully. \u201cI call him Jem. He\u2019s so much younger than I. My mother died when he was two, so I had the raising of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>Another grim silence. \u201cThat\u2019s old enough to be tried in the tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head desperately. \u201cHe\u2019s just a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p><p>The words were starting to come easier now. \u201cHe has red hair, like me.\u201d She fingered a strand of hair that hung over her face. \u201cAnd freckles, though they\u2019re fading now. He\u2019s perhaps six foot, although it seems like he grows an inch each time I look at him.\u201d</p><p>Lynch sucked in a sharp breath as if she\u2019d struck him. \u201cAnd how long has it been since you\u2019ve seen him?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Another hard question to answer. \u201cAugust 24th.\u201d</p><p>They both knew what it meant. The date the Echelon signed the treaty with the Scandinavian verwulfen clans. The date the mechs had tried to blow up the tower.</p><p>\u201cDid he have anything to do with the bombing?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Then hesitated. It was so terribly difficult to answer this question. Did she trust him? Truly trust him? He had said this wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d turned a blind eye to events, but she was playing with Jeremy\u2019s life here. \u201cYes.\u201d A whisper. A plea. \u201cI think so. The men he was involved with...\u201d</p><p>Lynch sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d He looked at her, then scraped a hand over his jaw. \u201cYou realize what this means? A humanist is one thing, but an act of such magnitude?\u201d His voice broke. \u201cRosa, do you know what you\u2019re asking of me?\u201d</p><p>Hope deflated, her chest squeezing tight. Of course she\u2019d asked too much. He couldn\u2019t help her. Nobody could. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lynch swore under his breath. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut I need more facts than this. I need to know that if I found him and set him free for you, he wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t promise you anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That he was even willing to help her was so much more than she would have ever suspected. On impulse, she reached out and took his hand, sliding her fingers through his. \u201cI know you\u2019ll do what you must.\u201d</p><p>As would she. But the weight that had been dragging at her for weeks seemed to have lifted. A flood of feeling swept through her, as alien and uncomfortable as a knife itching against her skin. She didn\u2019t understand it; or perhaps she understood it all too much. This was what had almost destroyed her so many years ago, when she\u2019d slammed the door open on the cell and staggered inside, only to watch Balfour drag the blade across her husband\u2019s throat.</p><p>A cold chill swept through her, her eyes swimming with tears again. Balfour had ripped her heart from her chest in one move, destroying her entire world. She\u2019d sworn then that she would never weaken herself ever again, never place another man in such a situation.</p> <p>Lynch\u2019s head lowered, his lashes falling half-closed over those glacial blue eyes. Rosalind\u2019s heart stuttered in her chest as she realized his intentions. It was one thing to kiss him as Mercury, to tease him as Rosa Marberry, but now she was neither. She had bared part of her soul to him, the first time she had done so in many years. The feeling left her surprisingly vulnerable. This, more than anything, was her truth. Not the words she had just spoken, but her own admittance that she had growing feelings for him.</p><p>A blue blood.</p><p>Abruptly she tugged her fingers from his grasp. Panic curled through her abdomen and she turned away, almost tripping on her skirts. Balfour had taught her to fear neither pain nor death. But...this... And the devastation it left in its wake...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cI did not mean to do that.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind nodded, tucking her hands into each other. What was she thinking? Maybe Ingrid was right. Perhaps it was time to cut her losses... But then he had just promised to help her try and find Jeremy.</p> <p>She needed to see this through to the end.</p><p>If she could. For the first time, Rosa had serious doubts about her ability to remain cool and unaffected.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t think it wise to pursue this... this...\u201d She had no name for it, as if in the giving of a name, she gave the weakness power over her. \u201cI think perhaps we should remain as we were. Employer and employee.\u201d</p><p>She waited for his answer, her head tilting to the side to see him. Uncertainty filled her, she who was never uncertain. What was he doing to her? She had to keep her distance.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut I must insist on walking you home. I hate to think of you out here on the streets.\u201d</p><p>She could handle almost anything she found on these streets. The irony was that her one weakness was him. Rosalind took a slow breath, collecting herself. \u201cIf you must.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to accept his sleeve. Lynch staggered into her, his hands clutching at hers before she could stop him.</p><p>Horror filled her. His hand closed over the hard metal of her left wrist. She couldn\u2019t feel the touch of course, though she felt as though she should. She felt as though it should burn right through her.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Then his knees went out from under him and he slumped against her, his hand catching at her skirt, her fingers, anything to stop himself from falling.</p><p>That was when she saw the dart sticking out of the back of his neck.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>A mocking laugh filled the alley.</p><p>Rosalind looked up as a shadow separated itself from the rest. A tall man wearing a heavy leather seaman\u2019s coat lumbered forward. He didn\u2019t bother to hide the sharp hook he wore instead of a left hand, his heavy-lidded gaze sliding over her.</p> <p>\u201cWell, now. Look what we got, boys. A Nighthawk by the looks of it. And a well-rounded tart.\u201d A smile split his broad face. \u201cThe craver for Mordecai, and the bitch for me.\u201d</p><p>She watched the hook, her gaze following its hypnotic motions. Years ago, seeing a glimpse of that would have been any East-Ender\u2019s worst nightmare. The slasher gangs that had roamed these parts used whatever scrap metal they could find to enhance themselves. Some said they even cut the limbs from their own flesh to replace with cruel hooks and sharp blades in order to join the gangs. The better to drag a body to Undertown, where they\u2019d strap it to a gurney and drain it of blood for profit.</p><p>Three years ago, a vampire had taken care of most of them, with the Devil of Whitechapel cleaning up the rest. Obviously some few had escaped.</p><p>And Mordecai must have allied himself with them, giving them the secret of hemlock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve got a prior engagement.\u201d Rosalind watched the shadows. Slashers used to run in packs, hunting their prey like wild dogs. There\u2019d be more of them.</p><p>A second man slid free of the encroaching fog. Then a third. Rosalind glanced up as something shifted in her peripheral vision and saw more on the roof.</p><p>At her feet Lynch made a helpless noise in his throat. A sudden burning fierceness in her chest took her by surprise. They weren\u2019t going to get their hands on him. She\u2019d make sure of that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet her,\u201d the slasher said with a contemptuous wave of his hook. \u201cAnd tie that bleeder up before he comes to.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s hand dipped to her pocket and came out with the pistol. She took a step away from Lynch to give herself room to work. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d she said coldly, aiming the pistol at the lead slasher\u2019s forehead. \u201cOr all the metal in the world won\u2019t fill this hole.\u201d</p><p>He grinned slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty little toy, lass. You know how to use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you care for a demonstration?\u201d Rosalind pulled the trigger.</p><p>The slasher staggered back, his eyes rolling up in his head and a red dot blooming in the middle of his forehead. His body hit the ground hard and Rosalind was moving, leaning low to take the knife from her boot. She preferred a pistol but in these streets it wasn\u2019t wise to draw too much attention.</p><p>The two remaining men stepped forward, expressions blunt and hard. One of them took the lead, his ugly face marred by what looked like a half dozen scars.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep you alive for that,\u201d he promised. \u201cFor a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no such compunctions.\u201d She leaped over Lynch\u2019s broad back, grateful that he was lying face-first and couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>The man met her blade with one of his own; a knife grafted to his forearm, no doubt drilled into the bone. Rosalind swirled, the skirts barely hampering her as she released the Carillion blade in her iron hand. It slipped between his ribs with a surgeon\u2019s ease, then she slashed down with her other knife, dragging it across the inside of his thigh. Blood sprayed across her skirts, hot and coppery as she hit the femoral artery.</p><p>He went down with a scream and she spun low, hooking the toe of her boot behind the other man\u2019s heel with feral grace. Anger burned hot in her throat. She wanted this, needed it. Anything to drive away that helpless feeling and unleash the tide of hopelessness within her.</p><p>As he hit the ground, she was upon him, slamming her heel into the vulnerable bones of his throat. A satisfying crunch filled the air.</p><p>Noise whistled in the eerie fog. Rosalind spun, knife held flat. Then something heavy dropped over her and she went to her knees under a net, the ends weighted with lead.</p><p>Damn her skirts! She tried to kick, but the net was tangled hopelessly with her bustle and she\u2019d dropped the bloody knife. A pair of boots landed in front of her, then the sound of another. Rosalind slashed desperately at the net with her Carillion blade. It sawed through the thick hemp with ease, but then hands caught her by the upper arms and she was dragged upright, the net wrapped round and round her ankles.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She jerked hard, the first hint of unease seeping insidiously through her veins. \u201cWhat are you doing? Get your hands off me!\u201d</p><p>The world upended as someone dragged her over their shoulder. Through the net, she glimpsed a pair of men kneeling over Lynch and something flared white-hot within her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201d She kicked desperately.</p><p>\u201cTake her down below,\u201d someone snapped. \u201cThrow the bitch in a cell while we get the bleeder contained.\u201d</p><p>The giant beneath her turned around and Rosalind lost her view of Lynch. \u201cNo! Help! Someone help!\u201d she screamed, feeling dread for the first time in years.</p><p>If they hurt him... She shook her head. He was invincible. A blue blood. Surely he could get free and save himself.</p><p>But they\u2019d paralyzed him with hemlock. She of all people knew only too well how to incapacitate blue bloods\u2014and keep them that way.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>They strapped him into a set of manacles and dragged him high using a winch. Lynch jerked into the air, unable to do a damned thing to stop himself from being hung like a slab of beef. He hated this, hated the vulnerability.</p><p>The cell was deep in Undertown. They\u2019d blindfolded him and wrapped him tight with chains, but that didn\u2019t mean he hadn\u2019t been able to make some sense of where they\u2019d taken them. The smell of tar and rope lingered in the air as they entered the tunnels\u2014somewhere near Sailmaker\u2019s Lane if he wasn\u2019t mistaken. From there, it had been a brief journey down through the chilly tunnels to this godforsaken cell where they\u2019d ripped the blindfold off.</p><p>The leader strode through the door with a scowl of frustration. \u201cString \u2019er up too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off me!\u201d</p><p>Lynch fought to lift his heavy head, trying to see what they were doing to Rosa. Red flared through his vision as two men dragged her into the cell. Her hands were bound behind her, blood sprayed across her skirts, but she squirmed in their grasp as if she thought to free herself.</p><p>One of them balled his fist and smashed her in the abdomen. Rosa gasped, crumpling over the man\u2019s arm with a soft cry. Kill them... Lynch stirred, his leg kicking faintly. The muscles in his shoulders ached as he strained to get some movement into his body. Anything other than hanging here uselessly.</p><p>Where the hell was Byrnes? He should have doubled back once he noticed Lynch was missing.</p><p>The leader stepped back as they dragged Rosa\u2019s gloved hands into another set of manacles and yanked her high. The toe of her boots dragged on the ground, then she cried out as they winched her into the air. Whatever sort of operation they were running here, they knew what they were doing.</p><p>The barest light gleamed through the heavy cell door. Lynch caught Rosa\u2019s gaze and saw the frustration and pain echoed there. She stopped kicking when she saw him, taking a deep, shuddering breath, her dark eyes rich with fear.</p><p>\u201cDid...they hurt you...?\u201d he managed to rasp.</p><p>Rosa shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, the leader slapped Lynch\u2019s thigh, sending him swinging, the toes of his boots dragging over the cold stone floors. \u201cDon\u2019t need to.\u201d A broad smile lit his ugly face. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re \u2019ere for.\u201d</p><p>Words. Just words. But ice ran down his spine at the thought. He looked at Rosa, her coppery hair bedraggled and tumbling around her pale face. She bit her lip and shifted against the weight dragging on her shoulders. Lynch\u2019s gaze raked over the cell. It was bare, but he could see faint splashes of darkness against the walls. Blood. Sprayed across the walls as if someone had torn a man\u2019s throat out.</p><p>He went cold.</p><p>That\u2019s what you\u2019re \u2019ere for...</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t have to hurt Rosa. He would. He knew it as certainly as he knew his own name. These men were involved with the massacres somehow. The mechs that Mercury spoke of.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d done to Haversham, Falcone, and Alistair, but he had a suspicion he was about to find out.</p><p>No. He jerked\u2014or tried to. Every muscle in his body felt sluggish, as if they\u2019d weighted his bones down with steel implants.</p><p>\u201cAll right, boys,\u201d the leader called. \u201cLet\u2019s leave \u2019em to their fate.\u201d He met Lynch\u2019s eyes with a leer. \u201cI\u2019ll be seein\u2019 you in an hour or so, Sir Nighthawk.\u201d</p><p>Then the cell door clanged shut behind them.</p><p>\u201cRosa.\u201d</p><p>She kicked uselessly. The muscles in her abdomen ached and she still hadn\u2019t quite gotten her breath back, or else she\u2019d have protested more.</p><p>\u201cRosa.\u201d Lynch\u2019s voice was cool, but something warned her\u2014some underlying hint of tension.</p><p>She looked across at him. Bars of light striped his face from the small barred window in the cell door. Movement stirred in his limbs, signs that the hemlock was finally wearing off. They must have hit him with a huge dose in order to keep him down for so long.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>For a moment, an unknown emotion crossed his face, there and gone so swiftly she didn\u2019t recognize it. Her breath caught and she stilled, staring across the shadowed expanse at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey took your pistol, didn\u2019t they?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you have anything at all that might be used as a weapon?\u201d</p><p>Only herself and her training, but he could not be allowed to know that. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve got nothing to fight them with.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened. He cursed under his breath and looked around. \u201cAre your manacles fastened tight? Can you get free?\u201d</p> <p>His urgency burned through her. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the damned question!\u201d he snapped.</p><p>It shocked her. He\u2019d never once been frightened. And that was what she recognized in his clenching fists as he strained against the manacles.</p><p>Rosalind licked her lips and looked up. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI have several pins in my hair. I might be able to pick the lock on these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p> <p>Pressing her lips tightly together, she put all her weight onto her right wrist and reached up to grab a loop of chain with her left. Her iron hand clutched tight around the links and she hauled herself up, high enough to dig her right hand into her hair. Her fingers finally locked around the edge of a pin and she tugged it free with a gasp, her body weight tumbling back against the manacles. This would have been easy ten years ago, but she no longer trained every day as she had under Balfour\u2019s care. Then she\u2019d been fit and limber and far stronger than she was now.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she gasped, her shoulders aching against the swing of the manacles.</p><p>Voices sounded in the corridor outside the cell. Their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out, Rosa,\u201d he said. \u201cPick the lock and get out. Get as far away from here as you can.\u201d</p><p>A laugh outside. Her gaze jerked that way as someone yanked open an iron trapdoor in the door.</p><p>\u201cGive \u2019er me regards, Sir Nighthawk.\u201d</p> <p>Rosalind flinched as something was thrown into the room. The iron ball was barely the size of Lynch\u2019s closed fist and it rattled across the stone floors, bouncing off the far wall before spinning to a halt in the center of the room. It looked almost like the clockwork tumbler balls that children played with in the alleys aboveground, chasing them until they finally wound down. Like one of the balls they\u2019d found in Falcone\u2019s dining room.</p><p>She stared, cold sweat lining her lip. What the devil was it? And why was Lynch staring at it as one would eye a live snake? He strained against the manacles, a silent snarl on his lips as he jerked and twisted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to stay and watch the final test,\u201d the stranger called. \u201cBut you cravers don\u2019t take kindly to being locked up. We\u2019ll be nearby...for when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>The iron trapdoor slammed shut and then the laughter was edging away.</p><p>\u201cLynch,\u201d she whispered, fear knifing through her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>The iron ball quivered, a thin line becoming apparent around its circumference as though some internal pressure fought to force it open.</p><p>\u201cThis is what they did to Falcone,\u201d Lynch snarled. He fought furiously, twisting his body up to try and wrench the manacles from the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. You have to get out.\u201d</p><p>What they did to Falcone... She stared at him for a long moment as his words penetrated. He\u2019d known. Somehow he\u2019d known what was to come\u2014just as he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself from hurting her.</p> <p>She saw the truth in his eyes as he flailed helplessly, then fell still, panting hard. He couldn\u2019t free himself. He had been weakened by the hemlock until he was almost human in strength, but if the bloodlust hit him the way it had done to Haversham or Falcone or his cousin...he would be unstoppable. That\u2019s why he\u2019d asked her if she had anything on her that might be a weapon. It wasn\u2019t to use against the mechs. No, it was to use against him.</p><p>The heat drained from her face, her hand tingling with numbness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d She looked away, frightened by the defeat in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you kill me.\u201d She sucked in a deep breath and let it out slowly. Think, damn you. She\u2019d survived worse than this. If there was one gift that Balfour had ever given her, it was this\u2014the urge to survive against all odds.</p><p>The ball started shaking so hard it quivered across the floor. Almost open.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cto think of buttons.\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s gaze shot to hers. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy buttons, to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to escape,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019ve heard that a blue blood has strong... urges. Strong hungers.\u201d</p><p>He caught her meaning. \u201cThe bloodlust is stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll test that theory as a last resort,\u201d Rosalind replied, her fingers tightening around the pin in her hand. \u201cYou want me, my lord. So think about my breasts, which you can never quite take your eyes off, and that afternoon in the library where you left me quite unsatisfied.\u201d Kicking her legs up, she locked an ankle around one of the chains, her skirts falling over her head.</p><p>The iron ball popped apart with a hiss, steam pouring through small vents around its middle.</p><p>Lynch coughed. \u201cHurry!\u201d</p><p>A sweet scent caught her nose as the cloud of steam drifted across the cobbles, hanging low for the moment. It wound around Lynch\u2019s dangling legs and for a second she saw his fear again.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t give into the fear. If he did, then he would be lost completely.</p><p>Rosalind swallowed, her pin sliding into the lock. Success. She let out her breath. \u201cYou never asked,\u201d she said, forcing her voice to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cNever asked what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether I obeyed your final instruction in the observatory that day. Whether I waited for you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Lynch\u2019s gaze locked on hers. Shadows flickered through his eyes, stealing the color from them. He shut them tight. \u201cThis isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose control,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cTry and think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not going to lose control,\u201d he snapped, a muscle in his jaw tightening. \u201cI can\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The steam writhed around him with hungry tendrils. And Rosalind finally understood him. The reason he had never taken from the vein and strictly controlled his intake of blood. This was his greatest fear\u2014the loss of control, the bloodlust. For the first time, she realized what it would be like to be stricken with the craving, to fight against instinct and need, when it would be so much easier to give into it.</p><p>\u201cI know you can fight this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust me,\u201d he gasped. \u201cGet your hands on a weapon\u2014anything\u2014and don\u2019t be afraid to use it.\u201d</p><p>The steam rose, obscuring her view of his body. Lynch strained, trying to lift himself above it.</p><p>Rosalind turned her attention to the lock. She slid the pin inside it, fumbling blindly in the near dark.</p><p>The lock finally clicked.</p><p>Wrenching the manacle open, she flexed her steel fingers, then gripped the chain above her right hand. She didn\u2019t have time for finesse. Instead, she yanked hard, her bio-mech hand breaking the links of the manacle.</p><p>\u201cBollocks!\u201d Her eyes flew wide as she started to fall. Hitting the ground hard, she lay for one panicked, breathless moment.</p><p>\u201cRosa? Are you free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free.\u201d She rolled onto her hands and knees with a wince. Steam obscured the room and she coughed as the cloying, sticky-sweet smell of it clotted her lungs.</p><p>\u201cCan you... get out?\u201d</p><p>Feeling along the wall, she saw the bright bands of light against the foggy darkness. The door!</p><p>Lynch was a dark shadow in the mist. Rosa kicked the iron ball away into the corner, stilling when she saw his gleaming eyes lock on her. Like prey.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d he gasped, clenching and unclenching his fists. A shudder ran through his body.</p><p>\u201cDid I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you wait?\u201d</p><p>She backed away from him as his eyes turned black with fierce need. He clenched them tight, trying to hold on to himself.</p><p>\u201cI waited,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she reached out behind her for the door, feeling for the lock in the darkness. Her pin had twisted. She\u2019d need another. But she couldn\u2019t, for the moment, take her eyes off him. Steam obscured him completely and he jerked, still fighting, even now, not to lose control of himself.</p><p>Rosalind could barely see him. But she heard a low hiss of breath, a sound that terrified her, despite her intentions. And then the sound of metal straining as he tore at his manacles.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d he pleaded. Another strained laugh, as if he fought to hold it back. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, run!\u201d</p><p>Rosalind turned and jammed another pin into the lock, her heart rabbiting in her chest in terror.</p><p>He\u2019d just lost the battle.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>The door opened and Rosalind didn\u2019t waste time to see if he\u2019d gotten himself free. She could hear him straining, a low growl of frustration echoing in his throat as he fought the manacles. The steel wouldn\u2019t hold him in this state. Not for long.</p><p>Shoving her shoulder against the door, she staggered into the tunnel\u2014looked like an old maintenance tunnel of some sort, with a pair of torches burning steadily in their niches.</p><p>Grabbing a handful of skirts, she started running.</p><p>Behind her, a thwarted roar echoed as she escaped. The sound sent a chill down her spine, her footsteps lengthening in response. Had to get away. If he caught her\u2014</p><p>The door at the end of the tunnel was locked. Rosalind jerked at the knob, then slapped her steel hand against it in frustration. \u201cDamn you!\u201d</p><p>Behind her silence fell.</p><p>Rosalind turned slowly, the hairs on the back of her neck lifting. At the end of the tunnel, a dark figure stepped free of the cell, moving with an eerie, predator grace. He stopped and stared at her, his eyes black with fury and need and hunger.</p><p>Rosalind yanked a pin from her hair and spun around, jamming it in the lock. \u201cCome on,\u201d she murmured, jiggling it until she felt it catch. \u201cCome on!\u201d A glance over her shoulder showed him stalking toward her, taking his time, knowing she couldn\u2019t escape. Rosalind slammed her fist against the door, dinting it. By some stroke of luck the lock clicked. She yanked at the door, sucking in a frightened hiss of breath between her teeth as it opened.</p><p>\u201cNO!!!\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s scream of rage echoed in the tunnel and Rosalind barreled through the door, slamming it behind her. There was a key on a hook beside the door and she thrust it into the lock and twisted it, staring through the thin window slit as Lynch thundered toward her.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, come on!\u201d The lock snicked and Rosalind staggered away from the door as he hit it.</p><p>The hinges screamed in protest, dust shaking off the stone walls. Rosalind met his eyes and saw nothing human there. Not the man she knew. Not the man she cared for. Here was her own secret fear, staring at her with cold, hungry eyes.</p><p>His fists wrapped around the bars and he wrenched. The iron screamed, bending like Indian rubber. Rosalind turned and ran up a flight of stairs.</p><p>Behind her, an enormous crash echoed.</p><p>Faster, her lungs screaming for air. She threw a glance over her shoulder and saw something move in the shadows behind her.</p><p>A door appeared in the wall. Rosalind crashed through it, slamming it shut behind her and locking it before she turned and collapsed against something in the dark. Her fumbling fingers found a smuggler\u2019s lantern and a packet of matches. Striking one, she lit the lantern\u2019s wick with shaking fingers.</p><p>Something hit the door. Rosalind jumped. A table stood in the center of the room, with benches around the sides. She hurried behind it, though the table would be small help.</p><p>Crates of iron balls gleamed in the flickering light, with little clock faces strapped to them. Rosalind ran her fingers over one, feeling the thin seam that ran around the middle. There had to be dozens here. Enough to drive a whole horde of blue blood\u2019s mad. Just what were the mechs planning?</p><p>Another jolt shuddered the door. Rosalind spun, her gaze raking the room for anything to help her. Metal tools hung on the wall, signs of a mech\u2019s trade. She grabbed a file and clenched it in her fist, hunting for something sharper. A rack of bottles lined the far wall, the glass gleaming as she lifted the lantern and brought it closer. Taking out the cork, she sniffed at the colorless liquid. The same sickly sweet scent she\u2019d recognized in the cell made her jam the cork back in.</p><p>A deafening silence fell, making her heartbeat thunder in her ears.</p><p>Then a fist came through the door.</p><p>Rosalind screamed, dropping the lantern on the bench and spinning to face him. Her gaze fell on a pile of goods on a small table near the door. A dart gun with the bright blue feathers of a hemlock dart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lynch groped for the key, turning it in its lock. Then his hand withdrew, the knuckles bloody. Slowly, so slowly, the handle turned.</p><p>Rosalind pressed herself back into the bench. Nowhere to run. Nothing to fight him with. If only she could get to the dart gun.</p><p>The door slowly opened. Darkness entered, materializing into a man she barely recognized. His black hair gleamed in the lantern light, the flame flickering off his obsidian eyes. Stark light carved out the refined features of his face and broad shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cLynch?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He was breathing hard, his chest rising and falling. Slowly he shut the door. Then locked it. For a moment his head bowed, as if some part of him still fought for control. Then he started toward her.</p><p>Each step was mesmerizing, his power and grace so dangerous it stole her breath.</p><p>Rosalind swallowed. No point running or fighting. Either would only rouse his hungers. \u201cWould you like...another button?\u201d she whispered, lifting her hands to the tiny buttons that curved up her bodice. Her fingers jerked and the top button tore, pinging away to the floor. The lavender cotton was almost ruined anyway.</p><p>Lynch stilled, his gloved hand sliding over the end of the table as if in thought. Rosalind tore another button free, discarding it with haste.</p> <p>Then another.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the observatory?\u201d she asked, tugging the tiny buttons free desperately.</p><p>His gaze dipped, running heatedly over the exposed skin of her d\u00e9colletage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she whispered, taking a sidelong step around the table. Closer to the door\u2014and the dart gun.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that. Rosalind stilled as the muscles in his thighs bunched. Reaching up, she slowly shook out the last few pins in her hair, letting it tumble down over her shoulder in bright, coppery coils. Lantern light made it gleam richly against her pale skin and the hungry look in his gaze hardened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he said coldly.</p> <p>Then he was on her. Rosalind barely had time to suck in a sharp breath as his hand sank into her hair and wrenched her head back. She caught a fistful of his shirt and bit back a scream as his mouth slashed down over hers.</p><p>Lynch devoured her, slamming her back against the wall. A crate dropped off the bench and those little metal balls rolled everywhere as his tongue thrust, hot and hard, against hers. Rosalind melted against him, her knees giving way as a surge of relief filled her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she almost sobbed, grabbing a fistful of his hair.</p><p>Lynch caught her up beneath the thighs, sliding her onto the bench as he kissed her desperately. She couldn\u2019t draw breath, couldn\u2019t escape him. He was all over her, his huge body wrapping around hers with a possessiveness she couldn\u2019t fight. His teeth sucked her bottom lip between them and he bit her, one hand shackling her right wrist.</p><p>But at least he hadn\u2019t drawn blood. Yet.</p><p>Rosalind whimpered, wrapping her legs around his hips as she kissed him back with a fierceness born of relief. She couldn\u2019t let him go. Not for a second. If she did, then she might lose him.</p><p>The door slammed open and a man burst in, dressed all in black leather.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed as Lynch tore himself from her arms and leaped toward the stranger. The Nighthawk.</p> <p>If she didn\u2019t know any better, she would have thought he placed his body between them, an almost protective gesture. But then it couldn\u2019t be true. He wasn\u2019t thinking right now. Only reacting.</p><p>Their bodies met, Lynch slamming the Nighthawk against the wall. The man\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill you!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>The stranger\u2019s icy blue eyes flickered to hers, then he shoved an elbow into Lynch\u2019s face that snapped his head up. A grim expression crossed the stranger\u2019s face\u2014utterly ruthless.</p><p>Lynch went for his carotid but the man chopped a fist into Lynch\u2019s throat and locked an ankle behind his. They both went down, the Nighthawk fighting desperately.</p><p>There was no finesse to Lynch\u2019s movements. He was stripped down to the basics of survival, barely protecting himself, intent only on the kill. Yet his rage and strength were unstoppable.</p><p>Rosalind slid off the bench slowly, her eyes on the dart gun. Inching toward it, she flinched as Lynch drove his man face-first onto the ground. His head lifted, tracking her movements. Rosalind swallowed, her fingers closing over the dart gun.</p><p>He came at her so quickly she could barely see it. Only years of training saved her life. She shot him from three feet away. He took one more step, his knees going out from under him as the hemlock raced through his veins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered as those black eyes met hers, strangely human in that moment. Betrayed. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Awareness came slowly.</p><p>Lynch fought his way toward it, straining, yearning, hunger gripping him so hard he screamed. Something held him back. Men shouting. The hot coppery scent of blood in the air and then the splash of it against his lips. It was never enough. He wanted it hot and fresh, aching to take it from someone\u2019s throat. To tear and kill, to rip apart flesh like it was paper and drown himself in blood.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find her. No matter how hard he strained, peering past the swirl of faces in the room, she wasn\u2019t there. Fear drove him. Fear and a protective fury he couldn\u2019t fight. His woman. His. And someone was keeping her from him.</p><p>A face swam into view, hands gripping his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s me, sir. Garrett!\u201d</p><p>The words were oddly distorted. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d he screamed, tearing at the metal cuffs that kept him pinned on his back.</p><p>A hand slid over the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe ain\u2019t there anymore, lad,\u201d an older man said gruffly. \u201cLet \u2019im go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Give him more of the hemlock.\u201d Light gilded the man\u2019s coppery hair and all Lynch saw was the color of blood. \u201cWe wait him out. He\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>Then he was slipping into darkness, his body slackening against the steel that kept him pinned. No matter how hard he strained, he couldn\u2019t catch even a hint of that familiar lemon scent.</p><p>Ten hours since she\u2019d seen him last. Screaming and straining in his manacles...</p><p>Rosalind wrapped her arms around her and peered through the gloom. Beside her the soft rasp of Jack\u2019s breath through the air filter itched over her nerves.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d she murmured, shivering against the cold. She felt it so deeply tonight. As if the fright of last night had leeched into her bones. She\u2019d thought Lynch would be fine when they got him back to the guild. But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here,\u201d Jack said, his voice smooth and melodious. His throat was the one part of him that hadn\u2019t been damaged by Balfour and his steady drip of acid. His lungs were another matter, hence the air filter in the mask. The thick coal-choked air of London was too rich for him, sending him into paroxysms of coughing without it. Sometimes she wondered if he wouldn\u2019t be better off in the country, or somewhere along the Mediterranean, where the air was clear and warm. Maybe Italy, where there were no blue bloods and the church ruled supreme. He\u2019d like that.</p><p>Rosalind dragged her pocket watch out of the tight waistcoat that cinched her curves and examined it. The back was a clear bubble of glass, revealing the winding brass cogs and gears within it, while the face was sheeted in pearl. A flicker of gaslight caught the pearl and turned it into a rainbow shimmer.</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d she muttered. As if to spite her, a bell rang nearby, over the rooftop spires of an old half-burned church. Once, twice, thrice... It droned on, cutting through the thick fog.</p><p>\u201cI should have gone with Ingrid,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Jack shot her a look, his monocular eyeglass gleaming eerily in the low gaslight. \u201cWe only just got you back. I\u2019m not letting you out again, not with those bleeders out there.\u201d His voice roughened. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you near them ever again.\u201d</p><p>She had nothing to say to that. If he found out the truth\u2014the reason for the blood on her skirts when she\u2019d fled back to the house and the shaking that she couldn\u2019t quite stop in her hands\u2014he\u2019d have gone after Lynch with a pitchfork. As it was, she\u2019d had to make up some story about being accosted on her way home by an anonymous blue blood.</p><p>It was the first lie she\u2019d ever told her older brother. Growing up in the grim streets had hardened them both to the world and made them cling to each other. They couldn\u2019t trust the world. Only each other. He\u2019d had her back and she his for years, until that fateful day when she\u2019d dipped a pocket and Balfour had seen her.</p><p>He\u2019d recognized her as his own, one of the three children her mother had taken from him when she\u2019d broken her thrall contract and fled from him. Rosalind had never truly known why her mother did that, though she could perhaps guess. By that stage, she\u2019d been long dead and both Rosalind and Jack had done what needed to be done to survive. Jack knew her down to the very last inch of her soul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt was nothing that I couldn\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it?\u201d He opened the small, copper air filter in the middle of his leather half mask and cupped his fingers around the hole, breathing into them to warm them. \u201cYou\u2019ve been distracted of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d The dipping baritone of his voice drew her gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Of course I\u2019m worried about him.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Jack lifted a gloved hand, his index finger sweeping a strand of her hair out of the way. His finger brushed against her neck tentatively. \u201cYou have a bite mark on the back of your neck. The kind a man gives his lover.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. Lynch. In the bathing room. He\u2019d bitten her there, suckling the skin until she bruised and she\u2019d forgotten all about it. Rosalind ducked away from his hand, tugging the collar of her coat higher. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re troubled,\u201d Jack said quietly. \u201cThe last time I saw you like this was when you were sent to spy on Nathaniel.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind turned away, staring out over the narrow alley. The brick was pitted and scarred and sheathed in thick coal dust, but she didn\u2019t see any of it. Instead, Nate\u2019s face swam into her mind.</p><p>Head of the humanist movement in London, he\u2019d been an irrepressible fool who\u2019d argued in the streets for human rights and had then dared take his arguments to the Ivory Tower. Organizing an interview with him, she\u2019d had him wrapped around her finger before he\u2019d even finished stammering a greeting. A ripe plum for the plucking. A week later, they\u2019d been wed and she was Mrs. Nathaniel Hucker, the snake in his bed, reporting everything she heard back to Balfour.</p><p>A dreamer, yes. Naive. Blind. Yes. And the very best of men. Four months for him to melt her heart and make her start questioning everything Balfour had ever told her. She\u2019d kept her doubts secret from Balfour, but not from Jack. Slowly the tides turned. She reported back to Balfour but only enough to ease his suspicions. And as she\u2019d started listening to what Nate preached about human rights, she\u2019d started to believe.</p><p>The conflict of loyalty had torn her in two. She\u2019d fallen hopelessly in love with her husband, but by that time, Balfour had owned her body and soul for eight years. She\u2019d killed for him. Spied for him. His little falcon. She\u2019d have done anything for him.</p><p>Except kill Nathaniel.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jack asked simply.</p><p>Tears burned in Rosalind\u2019s eyes. She shook her head and kept her gaze turned irrevocably away. What would he think if he knew what secret thoughts her heart kept producing? Nathaniel had been human but Lynch was not. Lynch was the very creature that Jack most feared.</p><p>\u201cLynch?\u201d he asked, a hint of anger warming his voice. \u201cDid he do this to you? Did he force you into his bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake Jack, do you think any man\u2014blue blood or not\u2014could ever force me to do something I didn\u2019t want to do?\u201d</p><p>His gaze sharpened and she realized her mistake. \u201cSo you wanted him to bed you?\u201d</p><p>Scraping a hand over her face, she looked for Ingrid. \u201cHe can help me find Jeremy. I need to lure him close, to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo seduce a blue blood? You could let him actually touch you? To lay his blood-soaked hands on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>Jack fell silent. \u201cThis is exactly like Nathaniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI loved my husband. This is nothing like that, but I can\u2019t deny...Lynch is... He\u2019s nothing like the rest of the blue bloods. He tries to fight it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know better than anyone what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what the hell does that mean?\u201d Jack grabbed her arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She pressed her lips together. This morning she\u2019d stopped by the guild to see if he was recovering, but he still couldn\u2019t recognize anyone. Garrett had refused to let her see him, stating that all Lynch wanted was her.</p><p>It scared her. She\u2019d thought at the time that the worst thing he could do to her would be to drink her blood and drain her dry, but she\u2019d been wrong. Instead, the demon inside him had claimed her as his own.</p><p>Mine, he\u2019d snarled.</p> <p>Imagine his fury when he discovered how she\u2019d played him. Imagine...his hurt. Rosalind swallowed hard. She felt like she\u2019d trapped herself in her own sticky spider web of lies and the weight of it was crushing her. She didn\u2019t want to hurt him. He was too good for that.</p><p>Jack watched her, no doubt drawing his own conclusions. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go back there. He\u2019s making you stray from your course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the right thing to do?\u201d she whispered, thinking of the silent Cyclops army sitting in the dark in Undertown.</p><p>Jack stiffened. \u201cDon\u2019t doubt it. We made this pact eight years ago, after Nathaniel was murdered. Anything to bring them down\u2014to destroy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it worth Jeremy\u2019s life?\u201d she snapped, turning on him. \u201cIs it? Because if that is what is has cost me, then I cannot do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you certain it\u2019s only Jeremy you\u2019re worried about?\u201d</p><p>She groaned under her breath. The truth. If she continued as she was, one day she would have to go up against Lynch. Was it worth it? Could she truly strike him down for her cause?</p><p>No. The answer was a sickly whisper in her mind. A betrayal of everything she had stood for over the last eight years. But how could she avoid him? He stood between her and the Echelon and she knew that his sense of duty and honor would force him to move against her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d How?</p><p>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d Jack said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget where your loyalties lie. With your family, with your own people\u2014with the humans who live in this wretched city and look to us for the only cursed hope they have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where my damned loyalties lie,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cDevil take it, I can hear you two all the way to Limey,\u201d someone cursed. Ingrid materialized out of the fog, dragging a young lad with a missing eye and three iron fingers.</p><p>The tightness in Rosalind\u2019s chest eased. She stepped forward as Ingrid shoved the lad to his knees in front of her. \u201cFound \u2019im in the Pits, betting on the blood sport,\u201d Ingrid said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t take him there so I had to wait till he\u2019d blown his quid.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind knelt down, resting her elbows on her knees. \u201cHello, Harry.\u201d</p><p>The mech grimaced, dragging himself up into a sitting position. Blood dripped from a slash in his forehead. Ingrid hadn\u2019t been gentle, then.</p><p>The youth was of an age with Jeremy and the pair had always gotten along smashingly well, even if Harry\u2019d looked to Mordecai for leadership, rather than herself. His lips thinned as he scanned Jack\u2019s menacing form behind her. \u201cDon\u2019t know nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d Rosalind smiled, then held up a finger to stall his protests. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend that you won\u2019t tell us everything you know. The question is, whether you will do it now and be sent on your way unharmed, or whether Ingrid must break every bone in your body first.\u201d</p><p>His blue eye rolled to Ingrid and he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cFirstly, I want to know if you\u2019ve seen Jeremy. Or gotten word from him at all.\u201d</p> <p>Harry\u2019s shoulders relaxed, as if realizing he wouldn\u2019t be asked to betray his fellow mechs. \u201cAin\u2019t seen \u2019im since the tower,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThought \u2019e were dead\u2014or taken by the Nighthawks.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelashes lowered as she fought to control her emotions. Her last hopes were drying up. If none of the mechs had seen him... \u201cWhy would you think the Nighthawks took him?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged. \u201cI were kinda \u2019opin\u2019, you know? They were all over the tower after the bomb went off.\u201d</p><p>He knew nothing then. Rosalind sat back on her heels, her throat dry and tight. Jack\u2019s hand slid over her shoulder and she clutched it, squeezing his gloves gently as the world dissolved around her. The last hope she had lay with Lynch, and she wasn\u2019t sure if he would recover from his bloodlust.</p><p>Ingrid sighed. \u201cBe off with you then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Rosalind looked up. \u201cWait,\u201d she added softly, forcing her thoughts to focus. \u201cTell me about the clockwork balls. The ones you use to drive a blue blood mad.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s face paled under his mop of dark hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIngrid,\u201d she said. \u201cCut his thumb off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Harry squealed, scrambling back on the cobbles\u2014directly into Ingrid\u2019s legs.</p><p>Ingrid grabbed his hand and dragged an enormous knife from her belt. \u201cWhich one?\u201d she asked Rosalind. They\u2019d played this game many times.</p><p>Rosalind shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t particularly matter. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one then,\u201d Ingrid said, yanking the lad\u2019s hand back.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he screamed. \u201cNo, stop! I\u2019ll tell! I\u2019ll tell you anythin\u2019 you wanna know about the Doeppler Orbs!\u201d</p><p>Rosalind gestured Ingrid away and leaned closer. \u201cThen tell me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is in the orbs that drives a blue blood mad? Is there a cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Dr. Henrik Doeppler in the East End,\u201d he blurted, staring at Ingrid\u2019s knife. \u201cSome kind of nutter but \u2019e was tryin\u2019 to come up with a cure for the cravin\u2019, and found this formula instead. Don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a cure. We don\u2019t let \u2019em live long enough after...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the tests,\u201d she encouraged.</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she smiled. \u201cBe careful that you tell the truth, Harry. You don\u2019t know how much I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe done tests,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cJust a few down below. It were \u2019ard to get our \u2019ands on a blue blood, you see?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo Mordecai thought we oughta try it on the Echelon. Get \u2019em runnin\u2019 scared and see \u2019ow well it works before we attack.\u201d</p><p>Her instincts had been right. This was bigger than it had seemed. \u201cAnd where\u2019s the final attack going to happen?\u201d</p><p>Harry stared at her helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t rightly know.\u201d He jerked his hands up in front of him as she frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t! I swear it! Mordecai only tells me what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind frowned. \u201cI saw crates filled with the orbs. There were enough there to drive half the Echelon into a frenzy. He has to be planning an attack on something big, somewhere a lot of the Echelon will be trapped together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly thing I know is its \u2019appenin\u2019 in two days\u2019 time,\u201d Harry added helpfully. \u201cStarted shipping the crates out to the gangs tonight.\u201d</p><p>Two days time. None of her spies in the Echelon had mentioned anything important.</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Rosalind murmured, then narrowed her eyes on Harry. \u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t breathe a word of this meeting to Mordecai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me\u201d\u2014he gave a shaky laugh\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The next morning found Rosalind on the guild steps after slipping out without waking Jack or Ingrid. Yesterday morning they hadn\u2019t let her in. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered under her breath. \u201cPlease let him be himself again.\u201d Whether the plea was to a God she\u2019d never prayed to before, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Rapping sharply at the main door, she waited with bated breath. The minutes dragged by and she was just about to rap again when Doyle jerked it open.</p><p>His glare faded when he saw her, a soft sigh in his throat. \u201cAin\u2019t no change, Mrs. Marberry. Garrett dosed \u2019im with \u2019emlock again. You\u2019d best be on your way, its may\u2019em round \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>She shoved a hand against the door as he sought to close it. \u201cDo we know what the long-term effects of hemlock will do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Marberry, we don\u2019t even know if \u2019e\u2019ll be \u2019imself again. \u2019E\u2019s been wild this mornin\u2019.\u201d Again he moved to shut the door.</p><p>\u201cCan I sit with him?\u201d she blurted, shoving herself between the narrowing crack. \u201cJust for a half hour. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2019old as that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>At the top of the stairs a dark figure distinguished itself from the shadows and Garrett leaned on the railing. \u201cLet her through.\u201d</p><p>Doyle scowled. \u201cYou know what\u2019s \u2019e\u2019s been like. Ain\u2019t the done thing to let a lady in there with \u2019im like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Nothing we\u2019ve done has made one ounce of difference. He doesn\u2019t recognize any of us; indeed, he sees us only as threats.\u201d Garrett\u2019s expression softened as he looked at her. \u201cBut he\u2019s called for you, many times. Maybe she can do what we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind pushed past before Doyle could say another word, feeling breathless. \u201cIs he dangerous?\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s lashes brushed his cheek as he looked down. \u201cWe have him restrained. He only becomes violent when we enter the room.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the hard lump in her throat. That moment in Undertown where he\u2019d pinned her to the wall had frightened her. She shouldn\u2019t even be here; both Jack and Ingrid had argued against it until she\u2019d agreed not to go, if only to placate the pair of them.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t leave it alone. She needed to see him, needed him to be all right.</p><p>She missed him.</p><p>Gathering her skirts in her hand, she swept up the stairs, falling into step beside Garrett.</p><p>\u201cI remembered something,\u201d she said, \u201cabout the attack. They mentioned a Dr. Doeppler\u2014the man who created the drug that...that did this to him. Perhaps he has an antidote?\u201d</p><p>Garret shot her a sharp look. \u201cDr. Doeppler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the East End,\u201d she replied, her gaze narrowing on the door to her own study. She felt light-headed, each step deliberately laid.</p><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019ll send someone to see to the doctor.\u201d His gaze dipped to her clasped hands. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d hurt you or else I wouldn\u2019t allow this.\u201d</p><p>Garrett opened the door and ushered her inside with a cool hand in the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t want to see me?\u201d she whispered suddenly. The silence in the rooms was almost deafening. \u201cWhat if it sends him over the edge again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that risk,\u201d Garrett admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s bound. He can\u2019t get to you, Rosa.\u201d A hesitation. \u201cBut I fear you might have to do this alone. If he sees me\u2014He doesn\u2019t react well to the sight of any of us, and I fear if he sees me by your side...he\u2019ll perceive a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of you?\u201d</p><p>Another odd hesitation. \u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett, please.\u201d She actually laid her hand on his arm. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re not saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe darkness inside him\u2014his demons, whatever you wish to call them... They\u2019re focused on you, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>A frisson of fear\u2014and something else\u2014traveled over her skin.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it happens with a blue blood,\u201d he added quietly, \u201cwhen he desires a woman beyond all else. It\u2019s a possessive, driving force within him. To protect you, to have you with him, to\u2014\u201d He actually colored. \u201cA need to claim you as his own. I believe it\u2019s the only thing that saved your life in Undertown. His bloodlust was stirred, but with it roused the darker side of his nature, the part that recognizes you as his.\u201d Something bleak traveled through those pretty blue eyes. \u201cWe all have the capacity for it, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>A disaster. She could never escape him if this was the truth. And Lynch would demand more of herself than she could give. \u201cWhat would happen if I don\u2019t go to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t find a way to bring him back, then we\u2014I\u2014will have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Pain filled his eyes and with it came the realization that Garrett was a better man than she\u2019d ever suspected. To do such an act would hurt him beyond reparation. But he would do it if he needed to\u2014that ingrained sense of duty that she suspected Lynch had had a hand in instilling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d The part of her that had been trained by Balfour was screaming at her, forcing her to look at this strategically.</p><p>Heat burned behind her eyes and she gathered herself and stepped to the door of his study. Her careful strategies be damned. No matter how much she\u2019d tried to deny this, she felt something for Lynch. Something strong. Something that almost made her feel human again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t leave him behind if she was the only chance he had of recovering.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Rosalind knew as soon as she touched the door handle that Lynch was awake. She could almost hear him listening and sweat touched a damp hand to her spine.</p> <p>Courage.</p><p>Resolutely, she turned the handle.</p><p>The sight of him stole her breath. Spatters of dull, drying blood flecked his chest and the bed sheets, his arms yanked high above his body and bound with enormous iron manacles that someone had driven into the wall with what looked like railway spikes. The sheet covered his hips, but they\u2019d bound his feet in much the same way and from the vial and pair of needles on the bedside table, they were dosing him regularly with hemlock.</p><p>She slowly closed the door behind her. Lynch watched her, those black eyes gleaming in the flickering dance of candlelight. A predator\u2019s eyes. Not the man that she longed for. Not her clever adversary, her dearest enemy.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Rosalind whispered, trying to still her racing heart. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, my lord.\u201d Her voice sounded loud in the room, silence broken only by the slight shifting of sheets as his head turned to track her.</p> <p>This was what she had hated and feared for so long. Balfour\u2019s eyes had been like that, black and emotionless, when he\u2019d cut Nathaniel\u2019s throat in front of her. You are the devil, she\u2019d screamed at him then, and she\u2019d believed it.</p><p>Rubbing at her chest, Rosalind crossed to the window and jerked the curtains back, unable to stand the dark anymore. What did she believe now?</p><p>Behind her, the low exhale of his breath caught her ears. When she turned, Lynch twisted his face away, hiding from the almost-blinding light. Of course. Blue bloods tolerated sunlight, but they preferred darkness, with their overly sensitive eyes and pale skins. The higher their CV count, the harsher they felt it and right now, with the bloodlust ruling him, he\u2019d be even more sensitive.</p><p>Rosalind tugged the curtains half-shut. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But I can hardly see.\u201d Her nose wrinkled up. The room smelled like blood. She opened the window and a cool breeze stirred the curtains.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d she asked, her voice strengthening. She eyed the rusty stains on his shirt. \u201cHave they bathed you at all?\u201d</p><p>The answer of course was no.</p> <p>Crossing briskly to the door, she reached for the handle. It was only then that she realized how relaxed his body had been, for he jerked to attention, the manacles cutting into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Rosalind paused. Their eyes met. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m only going to send Garrett for some fresh sheets and water.\u201d</p><p>Breath heaved in his chest, his eyes glittering dangerously. Rosalind slowly turned the handle. \u201cI won\u2019t leave the room,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Garrett waited in Lynch\u2019s study, leaping to his feet with a desperately longing expression as soon as he saw her.</p><p>She shook her head, not daring to step over the threshold. \u201cI need warm water and soap,\u201d she told him. \u201cFresh sheets for his bed too, and some blud-wein.\u201d</p><p>Garrett nodded, his shoulders slumping in relief as he sprang toward the door. Rosalind didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him there had been no change.</p><p>Closing the door, she turned back to Lynch. His lip curled and he glared through the wall, an angry purr sounding in his throat.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d she said, stepping between him and the door. His gaze lit on her and she shivered. Dangerous.</p><p>The corded muscles in his throat clenched and he strained against the manacles that bound him. Rosalind hurried to the bed. \u201cStop it,\u201d she said, laying her hands on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>The reaction had been instinctive. Hard flesh flexed beneath her gloves and her lips parted as she looked down. Those eyes watched her again, but the look was no longer dangerous. Stark primal need crossed his expression, desire burning in the black heat of his eyes.</p><p>It lit within her, her body reacting as if he\u2019d put flame to oil. Rosalind lifted her iron hand tentatively, stroking her other hand over his bare chest. The buttons on his shirt were torn, gaping over hard flanks and the rippled muscle of his abdomen. Instantly she was transported back to that night in the bathing room, not so long ago. The feel of his teeth on the back of her neck and his hands cupping her breasts and sliding lower, into the vee of her thighs. His hips thrusting against her, warm lips tracing the curve of her shoulder...</p><p>A little shiver ran over her skin, her nipples hardening behind the thin lawn of her chemise. Fear died a short death in her breast.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hurt her. He never had. To claim her as his own yes, to sink his teeth into the smooth skin of throat and drink her blood. Whether he could have stopped himself, she didn\u2019t know, but he had no intentions of hurting her.</p><p>Just of claiming her.</p><p>Pain she could deal with\u2014the idea of belonging to him, to anyone, so completely, sent a nervous thrill through her. Not entirely unpleasant, almost the same play of nerves that she enjoyed in dangerous situations\u2014and yet so much more terrifying. Her feelings for Nate had been the warm joy of friendship and shared respect, a love that didn\u2019t challenge her yet left her feeling safe and protected. Whatever this was\u2014whatever she felt for Lynch\u2014was a maelstrom in comparison, and she wasn\u2019t sure if she could hold herself together through it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to do, but she did know that she had to try and help him through this. The idea of losing him to the bloodlust almost choked her.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Rosalind murmured, kneeling on the bed and leaning over him. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there.\u201d</p><p>Her whispered breath traced his ear. Lynch turned his head with a snarl, breathing hard as he drew her scent into his lungs.</p><p>Her heart thundered in her veins. Slowly, Rosalind brushed her silky glove over his lips, leaning closer. Lynch stilled beneath her like some enormous jungle cat, violence bunching in each muscle. But she wasn\u2019t frightened anymore. He was bound and chained and she had the upper hand.</p><p>The thought was almost titillating.</p><p>Leaning down, she traced her gloved finger over his lip, dipping wetly into his mouth. Then lower, down the cleft in his chin and then the smooth hollow of his throat. The muscles beneath her hardened like marble, but he held still, a fine tremor in his arms. Reined in by her touch, the look in his eyes darkly curious. As if warning her that he was by no means tamed, he turned his face into her hand, his teeth sinking into the fleshy pad of her palm.</p><p>A gasp wet Rosalind\u2019s lips, the sensation seeming to tug all the way through her, right to the heart of her sex, until she throbbed with liquid fire. The pleasure of his bite was almost painful, almost a little too harsh. She rocked onto her knees, biting her lip, her fingers curling helplessly around the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she moaned. Begged.</p><p>His teeth released her skin and feeling flooded into the flesh, making her eyes clench shut and a shudder run through her.</p><p>A knock on the door tore her head up, a hot flush of heat burning through her cheeks. Had Garrett heard her? Tension rode through the hard body on the bed and she stroked his face, turning it toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d she whispered, leaning down to brush her lips against his cheek. The rasp of his stubble roughened her sensitive mouth. \u201cThen we will finish this.\u201d</p><p>Dark lashes hooded his eyes. He liked that.</p><p>Rosalind hurried to the door. Jerking it open just wide enough for her body, she saw Garrett\u2019s gaze lift over her shoulder. Some protective urge almost made her straighten, as if to block Lynch from his sight.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, accepting the bundle in his arms. A pair of sheets, with a bowl of water balanced on top and a butter-yellow bar of soap to the side.</p><p>\u201cIs he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she told him, pushing the door shut with the toe of her slipper. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The door shut in his face.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Marberry,\u201d Garrett called through the door.</p><p>Rosalind glanced over her shoulder as Lynch stirred, staring malevolently at the door. \u201cYou\u2019re making him worse. Leave us alone. I\u2019ll send for you when I need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s blud-wein in the liquor cabinet in the corner.\u201d Then Garrett\u2019s footsteps echoed on the other side of the door as he walked away, the sound vanishing as he shut the other door between them.</p><p>Steeling herself, Rosalind turned around, her arms aching from the strain of the sheets and the water basin. She put them down, then swiftly tore the shirt from his arms. There was no point in retaining it; it was quite ruined.</p><p>\u201cCome closer,\u201d Lynch commanded, his voice a harsh whisper as his gaze locked on her throat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, dragging the sheet out from under him. Her expression softened when she saw the helpless fury cross his face. \u201cPlease. Let me take care of you.\u201d Her lashes lowered. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll even enjoy it, sir?\u201d</p><p>Stillness. He watched her though; she could feel it prickling over her scalp.</p><p>Once she\u2019d stripped and remade the bed, she tucked towels around his body and then placed the basin on the chest of drawers by the bed. As she washed him, he seemed to calm, his eyelids drifting half-closed. She knelt over him with the washcloth, dragging the sheet lower.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s black eyes locked on hers and his hips gave a suggestive thrust as he sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cNot until you come back to me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Those eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cI never left.\u201d</p><p>His dark side tempted her. Rosalind slid the soapy washcloth beneath the sheet, her hand cupping the surge of his erection. Lynch froze, his back rigid.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want,\u201d she whispered, fisting his cock. Heat speared through her abdomen...and lower.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo claim me,\u201d she murmured, unable to tear her gaze from his. Twisting her wrist, she drew another snarled gasp from him. Her nipples hardened and Rosalind swallowed. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll claim you?\u201d she suggested, the thought burning through her with wicked intensity.</p><p>Tossing aside the washcloth, she dried him with the towel, taking her time and paying taunting attention to his straining erection. She\u2019d thought the expression in his eyes couldn\u2019t get any darker, but he was almost writhing now, fury and need choking him. The manacles rattled as he yanked against them.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d she countered, grabbing a handful of her skirts and straddling him.</p><p>Those merciless eyes locked on her. \u201cI am him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are all the darkness in him,\u201d she corrected, leaning low and pressing a kiss to his chest. The combination of fear and power made her feel frightfully dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he is?\u201d the demon inside him whispered.</p><p>Rosalind reached out and traced her tongue over his nipple. Lynch jerked. \u201cHe is good,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd loyal and honest and brave.\u201d She took her time, her teeth sinking into the delicate flesh of his nipple.</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest? The darkness,\u201d he demanded with a snarl. \u201cYou belong to me too. Don\u2019t ever forget that.\u201d</p><p>His hips thrust beneath her, hot flesh driving against her thigh. Rosalind gasped, her own hips flexing. Somehow the end of his cock rasped against her, riding the wet silk that clung to her quim.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGive yourself to me. Need you... Want you...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think. Rosalind groaned, then shook her head. \u201cNo. Not until you let him surface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...stopping him...\u201d</p><p>The tip of his cock breeched the slit of her drawers. Rosalind sank her nails into his rippled abdomen. She could feel him now, silky slick against her wetness. Those wicked black eyes met hers and then the broad head of his cock dipped inside her.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she was in control. She was wrong. A gasp tore from her lungs and Rosalind flexed involuntarily. She wanted this, needed it. But she wanted to be here with him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered, her thighs burning as she held herself above him. \u201cWhat is he\u2014are you\u2014afraid of?\u201d</p><p>Lynch smiled, a dark, wicked look that made her melt. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of me.\u201d He gave a thrust. Earned another hot inch. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of letting me go.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind clenched around him, riding just the head of his shaft. She took a calculated risk. Lynch\u2019s darkness, his hungers, were just another part of him. If she couldn\u2019t accept it, then how could he?</p><p>She threw her head back and sank down, embedding him to the hilt. Her skirts flowed over his stomach and chest and Lynch cried out in need as she took him.</p><p>So long since she\u2019d had a man. So long since she\u2019d wanted one. But she\u2019d wanted this one from the start and that thought had terrified her. Rosalind met those black eyes and slowly, slowly arched up until just the tip of him penetrated her. A blue blood. Her worst fear once, but she was starting to realize that he was just a man, like any other. She sank her teeth into her lower lip with a groan and sank back down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell.\u201d Lynch arched, his back jerking. \u201cYou feel so fucking good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d she whispered, riding him slowly, firmly.</p><p>\u201cWant to touch you...\u201d His fists clenched and he tore at the chains.</p> <p>Dare she? Rosalind\u2019s eyes narrowed as she rolled her hips. She wanted his hands on her. Needed them. Reaching up, she tugged a pin from her hair and gave him a smoldering look.</p><p>Short work to undo the manacles around his wrists. Lynch grabbed her by the hips, jerking his body down the bed so that his knees bent and she was driven forward, impaled on his cock. The darkness in his eyes looked back at her, captured her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, riding him faster, harder, as his hands on her hips urged her on.</p><p>Deft fingers slid beneath her skirts. \u201cYou look so prim,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI like it.\u201d Then they were parting her drawers, stroking the hot, wet flesh that trembled so desperately.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d she groaned. \u201cLike this. I like you out of control, uninhibited.\u201d</p> <p>Doubt assailed the darkness. She saw it and moaned at the victory, even as his fingers wrought such delicious damage. They froze.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you,\u201d he said, as if remembering. \u201cIn Undertown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She rubbed against his fingers, urging him on. Grabbing his wrist, she pressed him harder against her. \u201cYou never hurt me. You never wanted to. All you wanted was this. To make me yours.\u201d</p><p>Lynch shuddered, slivers of gray creeping into his eyes. Rosa sensed her victory and slowed, grinding herself against him. \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d he gasped. \u201cI see...flashes of it... Of shoving you up against the wall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI like it when you\u2019re rough with me. Besides...\u201d Biting her lip on a groan. \u201cWhat makes you think I can\u2019t handle you? All of you?\u201d</p><p>She came with an explosive jerk, her entire body singing with need. A soft scream died on her lips, her gloved fingers digging into his chest as she slumped over him.</p> <p>\u201cGod,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Somehow she met those wide eyes\u2014gray eyes. Rosalind almost cried out again, her hand sliding over his cheek in tender desperation as he grabbed her hips and took control. She couldn\u2019t move, could barely breathe. All she could do was gasp as he thrust into her, driving them both to the edge...and over.</p><p>This time there was no coming back. Rosalind collapsed over his heaving chest, her body molten as the fingers on her right hand laced with his.</p><p>Lynch lifted his head, gasping. \u201cRosa?\u201d</p><p>She sensed the difference in his tone and knew she\u2019d won the battle. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she replied softly, then kissed the cool skin of his chest. His cock gave a little teasing clench inside her.</p><p>His hand slid into her hair and held her there, his other arm sliding around her in panic. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me. Don\u2019t let me go.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind nuzzled closer, her eyes closing sleepily. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go. You don\u2019t ever have to fear that again.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p> <p>A knock on the door woke him up.</p><p>Lynch dragged himself into a sitting position, the sheet pooling in his lap. Darkness skated through his vision and his fist clenched in the mattress before he took a deep breath. How long would it be like this? Every sudden move and sound stirring the hunger inside him? It terrified him that he was still so close to the darkness within. One wrong move and he could be lost in the shadows again, seeing nothing but prey.</p><p>Looking at his own men as if they were the enemy and as for Mrs. Marberry... He looked around then. There was no sign of her, beyond the faint, elusive scent that lingered on his sheets and his skin. Last night had been a revelation, both of the flesh and of herself. In the dark, he\u2019d made love to her twice more as the hunger rose in him, sating himself on her flesh. In between, she\u2019d curled in his arms, whispering with him. Quiet words. Little secrets. Bits of herself and some of the life she\u2019d led on the streets before her father had found her. Of him, she said very little, and yet the not saying was telling enough.</p><p>She must have left him sometime during the night.</p><p>No, the darkness inside him roared.</p><p>Scraping a shaking hand over his jaw, Lynch swallowed. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Doyle backed into the room, bringing a breakfast tray with a flask of warmed blood and the Standard neatly folded atop it. Lynch\u2019s gaze narrowed in on his friend\u2019s throat and he looked away, his face draining of color.</p><p>How long, damn it?</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Doyle stared at him, as though searching for signs of it in his face. \u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 better this morn.\u201d</p><p>Lynch nodded brusquely. \u201cI feel it too.\u201d Awkward silence descended and he gestured to his side table. The scent of the warmed blood spilled his vision over into tones of gray again, and his nostrils flared as he took tight rein of himself.</p><p>\u201cGot the paper, sir.\u201d Doyle rambled on, the same as any other morning. Or not quite the same. Tension stiffened his shoulders. \u201cAnd your letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything of interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of them. The Council wishes a progress report\u2014and to remind you that you got only two days left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind of them.\u201d His mood soured, black heat spilling through his eyes. Perhaps he should accept a meeting and show them what he thought of their solicitousness.</p><p>\u201cAnd this.\u201d Doyle held a scrap of paper up between his fingers, his brows arching. \u201cOne o\u2019 your little pigeons, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Lynch took the folded note, eyeing the frayed edges and the stained parchment. None of the boys he paid for information could read or write. Anticipation became a sharp edge within him. He tore it open, gaze raking the few lines.</p><p>\u201cI know something you don\u2019t. Meet me at the Dog and Thistle, Shoreditch, at twelve.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t recognize the writing, but he knew who it was from immediately. Tension coiled in his gut muscle, the thought of Mrs. Marberry springing to mind. Her husky laugh as she lay in his arms last night, her eyes sparkling with teasing humor as she lifted her lips to press a tender kiss against his pectoral muscle. By going to meet Mercury, he was effectively pretending nothing had changed when the entire world had shifted around him.</p><p>But the letter... Dare he ignore it?</p><p>He crushed it in his fist. If he didn\u2019t find a way out of the looming jaws of the Echelon\u2019s trap, then either way, it wouldn\u2019t matter. He had to do something to appease the prince consort. \u201cGet my body armor.\u201d</p><p>A pair of Coldrush Guards in nondescript clothing tried to follow him, but he lost them at the wall, ducking into the thick weave of the East End. This was his world, not theirs, and he knew it like the back of his hand.</p><p>The Dog and Thistle bustled with drinkers; working class laborers and grizzled old seamen. Lynch dragged the collar of his coat up around his throat and pushed between them, the press of bodies arousing his predatory instincts. He could hear the steady pulse of every man\u2019s heartbeat, the sight of the barmaid throwing back her head with laughter arresting him for a moment. Her carotid throbbed thickly with blood, a flush of color staining her cheeks. Lynch tore his gaze away, his eyes locking on a solitary figure across the bar.</p><p>Mercury watched him as if she knew exactly what he was thinking. Glancing down, she peered into her mug of ale, waiting for him.</p><p>Lynch choked down the thick need, shoving past a burly man who reeked of sardines. A haze of tobacco smoke hovered in the air above his head, tarnishing the heavy beams that supported the roof. Someone cheered as a dart launched itself into the heart of the dartboard and a few lads clapped the thrower on the back with good cheer.</p><p>Mercury trailed her gloved fingers in small circles, stirring the sticky ring of ale that lingered on the bar. It was dark back here, shadows pooling across the heavy coat that she wore and the mop of thick close-cropped curls around her head. Someone had pasted a very authentic moustache to her lip and there was enough coal dust\u2014or grime\u2014shadowing her jaw that he almost mistook it for stubble.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, thick, dark lashes fluttering against her cheeks as she slowly lifted her gaze.</p><p>He stared into a pair of the bluest eyes he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Blue eyes.</p><p>Somehow the thought struck him as wrong, as if he ought to recognize her from somewhere. Lynch frowned, leaning on the bar beside her. \u201cYou deserve to be up on stage.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her mug to him, taking a heady sip. \u201cPer\u2019aps I were once.\u201d</p><p>That set his mind racing. Until he saw the faint gleam in her eyes. She was toying with him, knowing that the mystery of her identity fascinated him.</p><p>\u201cIs that where you came into contact with blue bloods?\u201d he asked coolly, gesturing the barmaid for another ale. Folding his arms on the bar, he observed the room. Mercury had a good view here. She could see everything while few could observe her. And from the draft at his back, there was a door somewhere behind in case she needed to get out in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cWhatd\u2019ya mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t just decide to join a cause,\u201d he replied, slipping a pound note toward the barmaid as she handed him a foamy mug. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d</p><p>Sipping at the ale\u2014it wasn\u2019t what he wanted but it would do\u2014he turned his head to look at Mercury.</p><p>The humor faded from her face and suddenly he felt the room narrow around them, as if someone had slammed an invisible window shut between them and the raucous laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou ran afoul of a blue blood once,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s why you do this. Whoever it was, his face haunts you, night after night, or you wouldn\u2019t feel this way.\u201d</p><p>The color drained out of her face, her fingers clenching around the heavy mug. She jerked her gaze down, staring into the foamy dregs. \u201cYou don\u2019t know a damned thing about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>She hissed between her teeth, shoulders stiffening. \u201cLet it alone, me lord Nighthawk. Ain\u2019t no bloody business o\u2019 yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. You made it my business the moment you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fact I still regret, me lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Reaching out he brought his fingers to her cheek. He could feel her trembling.</p><p>She laughed bitterly. \u201cI do. Every day I regret meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d It wasn\u2019t his imagination. The cockney accent had faded there for a moment. Her voice sounded almost familiar.</p><p>She looked up, blue eyes gleaming. The flicker of light off the irises made his breath catch. An occipital lens, if he wasn\u2019t mistaken. Designed for spies by the Echelon\u2014by Balfour himself, the prince consort\u2019s spymaster. How the devil had she gotten her hands on a set?</p><p>And what color were her eyes if they weren\u2019t blue?</p><p>His heart was beating so fast he suddenly realized that shadows washed his vision. Her distress beat at him until the devil inside roused. A craving. A fierce need to protect her.</p><p>He shut his eyes and breathed through it. He had two days. Two days before the executioner\u2019s blade descended on one of them. A sick feeling invaded him and as he opened his eyes and saw the fine trembling of her lips, he knew what his choice was going to be.</p><p>Lynch let her go, the taste of regret like ash in his mouth. He couldn\u2019t do it. He barely knew her, but he could no more hand her over to the Council than he could have plunged a dagger in her heart. The wave of regret that swept through him was almost intense enough to buckle his knees. Rosa... All the missed opportunities. For years he\u2019d wanted to find someone and now he had... And it was too late.</p><p>\u201cYou know why I regret it.\u201d Sucking in a deep breath, Mercury reached out and pressed her iron fingers against the center of his chest, a tortured expression on her face. \u201cYou were right. I do picture \u2019is face every night. I \u2019ate \u2019im so much I wanted to burn the whole Echelon, but\u2014\u201d She hesitated, her eyes lifting to his. \u201cWhat if I were wrong? What if they weren\u2019t all bad?\u201d</p><p>The last few words were a whisper.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s heart constricted in his chest as if she\u2019d punched him. \u201cDo you take me for a fool?\u201d he asked harshly.</p><p>Those stricken eyes stared at him without recrimination. \u201cNo.\u201d She wet her lips with her tongue, emotions battling their way across her face. \u201cI should never have kissed you. Never.\u201d</p><p>Then she was on her toes, her hot little mouth seeking his in the shadows. The taste of her exploded through him, his hand coming up unconsciously to cup the base of her scalp. No.</p><p>Yes, the demon in him purred. She is mine.</p><p>Lynch dragged his mouth away with a gasp, turning his face so that her lips brushed his cheek and not his own. Her heart thundered in his ears, matching the racing gallop of his own, and for a moment, the memory of holding Rosa in his arms rose to the fore. Both of them fit so easily there and both of them kissed as though seeking to drown in it. He could almost taste Rosa on his lips but that was...insane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lynch shook his head. Ridiculous. No doubt it was guilt that brought the image of Rosa to mind. Guilt that left the taste of her in his mouth. And that revealed his heart\u2019s intentions more than anything else. The shock of it pushed him away from her, so that he could find some sense of breathing room. Some sense of distance.</p><p>\u201cMe lord?\u201d Mercury whispered, hands stroking the shuddering planes of his sides.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cMy heart lies elsewhere.\u201d The confession burned through him and he caught her wrists and held them away from him. The shock on her face was almost tinged with hysteria as she pulled at her hands.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, voice getting stronger. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he replied, letting her wrists go. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>Taking a step back, she leaned heavily on the bar. \u201cIt\u2019s the redhead, ain\u2019t it?\u201d She looked up, her expression so lost. Then it hardened. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I can make you forget her?\u201d</p> <p>He caught her wrist as she reached for him. \u201cFor a few minutes, yes. But I\u2019m not that type of man.\u201d</p><p>A sound of faint regret whispered through her throat. When he opened his eyes, she was staring up at him again, helplessly.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he told her, \u201cis just need. Just desire. She is more to me. She is...everything that I thought I\u2019d never feel again.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she dragged her arm back to her chest, clutching it as if he\u2019d hurt it. \u201cYou can\u2019t have her. You know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Two days. He smiled bitterly down at his untouched ale. \u201cBut I won\u2019t betray her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go again, shatterin\u2019 me perceptions.\u201d A hurt smile ghosted over her lips, but her cheeks were still white. She took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cIt were easier when the blue bloods were just monsters. You oughta know, me lord Nighthawk, that I won\u2019t move against you. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Her fists clenched and she shook her head. \u201cAll this plannin\u2019 and you destroyed it in the matter of a few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Her lashes fluttered against her cheeks. \u201cI know what the mechs are up to. The massacres in Mayfair were just a test. They\u2019re plannin\u2019 on goin\u2019 after the Echelon with their Doeppler Orbs, creatin\u2019 a widespread massacre. Lettin\u2019 you blue bloods rip each other apart.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stilled. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She held up her hands when she saw his expression. \u201cI don\u2019t. Mordecai\u2019s keepin\u2019 \u2019is cards close to \u2019is chest. But it\u2019ll be somewhere where a lot o\u2019 blue bloods are gathered. Somewhere as\u2019ll make the biggest impact.\u201d</p><p>Where? His mind raced. There were no major political events planned nor even social ones. The Season was winding down, most of the thrall contracts signed.</p><p>A commotion caught his ear and he spun, sighting a pair of immaculately shaven gentlemen shoving their way into the pub. His gaze caught Sir Richard Maitland\u2019s, though the man was lacking his distinctive Coldrush livery. Fury flared white-hot in him and Lynch stepped in front of Mercury, shielding her with his body.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he told her. \u201cOut the back. Don\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him, then back to Maitland. \u201cWho is \u2019e?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he repeated, harshly this time.</p><p>Her eyes met his. \u201cThis is good-bye then?\u201d</p><p>Lynch nodded, the hunger in him screaming its rage. A vein in his temple throbbed, his color dipping to shades of gray, then flashing back through color again.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, me lord Nighthawk,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye,\u201d he repeated, then he turned and shoved into the crowd, not looking to see her go. The hunger in him, his inner demon, roared its silent fury.</p><p>No! Take her!</p><p>Lynch ignored it, shoving the thought deep. Neither of them could be his.</p><p>He had a date with the executioner.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>\u201cRoz?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her fingers away from the window guiltily.</p><p>Ingrid\u2019s expression was watchful as she stepped over the threshold of the bedroom. \u201cDid you get any sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rosalind\u2019s eyes burned, her thoughts chasing themselves around and around in her head, the same way they had done all night. Those devastating words he\u2019d spoken in the pub, as if there could be a future between them.</p><p>There was no future. Not without her brother. And if Lynch found out her secret, he would never look at her\u2014at Mrs. Marberry\u2014the same way.</p><p>It isn\u2019t me he loves! It was a person who didn\u2019t exist, a role that she had played all too well it seemed over the past few weeks. The hurt knifed through her. She was finding it difficult to keep herself separated from Mrs. Marberry. Balfour had taught her to place as much truth in her lies as possible, and that lesson had been her downfall.</p><p>For Mrs. Marberry was everything that she secretly wished to be. Unburdened by hate, by the violence of her past, the subject of a good man\u2019s love. She touched her lips lightly, as if she could still feel the phantom touch of his caress there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ingrid demanded, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. \u201cYou ain\u2019t been acting like yourself lately. You been lying to us, avoiding us...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you yesterday then? You said you were only stepping out, getting some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind saw the truth in her friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou followed me.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head in disgust, Ingrid stalked to the window and yanked the sash up. \u201cAye, I saw you at the Dog and Thistle. I saw him. And the day before, when you were supposed to be sleeping all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with him,\u201d Rosalind admitted, feeling tired of all the lies. \u201cI went to help him recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t bear to see him like that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Ingrid\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What changed? You hate them\u2014or you did. Fact was, once, you would never have let one of them lay a hand on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He wasn\u2019t as I expected him to be. He\u2019s...nothing like I expected.\u201d</p><p>The sound of footsteps on the stairs broke the standoff. Ingrid breathed deeply. \u201cJack,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell him. Please.\u201d</p><p>Ingrid gave her an uneasy look, then nodded.</p><p>By the time Jack reached her door, he was winded\u2014a residual effect of the scarring. He paused by the door, gaze darting between the pair of them. \u201cDid you tell her?\u201d</p><p>Ingrid shook her head. \u201cDidn\u2019t get a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Rosalind demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe next shipment came through,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIncluding a mech to do the work for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mech from the enclaves? They\u2019ve changed their mind and will work for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one will,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ingrid looked up sharply. \u201cSaid he was paid good money.\u201d</p><p>Her contact in the Echelon. Rosalind turned and stared out the window. She\u2019d always thought her contact had ties to the Humans First Party that spoke in parliament\u2014perhaps Sir Gideon Scott himself, the head of the party. They provided the money and she created the Cyclops.</p><p>The hairs on the back of her neck rose. \u201cScott doesn\u2019t have the sort of money we\u2019ve been receiving this year. None of the party does. Steel\u2019s expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people donate to the cause.\u201d In the reflection, she saw Jack shrug.</p><p>That was true. Still, she didn\u2019t like the feeling that itched its way down her spine. \u201cI think it\u2019s about time we discovered precisely who is donating to this cause.\u201d When she\u2019d first taken over Nate\u2019s work, she\u2019d found most of his contacts in place already. The money had been a trickle then, until she\u2019d come up with the Cyclops plan. Then it had become a flood. Too much, in fact, for her suspicions not to be roused.</p><p>Someone wanted her to create a metal army and she\u2019d been too preoccupied with Jeremy lately to wonder why.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d Ingrid asked.</p><p>\u201cGet some of our humanists in place\u2014the ones we know are loyal to us\u2014and have each member of the Humans First Party watched. If there\u2019s a money trail, we should be able to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll take months,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Rosalind nodded. \u201cYes, it will. But I want answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze boldly. \u201cGet the mech started on the next Cyclops,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue as is for the moment, so that no one grows suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>She thought of Lynch and the threat of attack. \u201cI am going to go see that my lord Nighthawk thwarts the mech attack.\u201d</p><p>And make sure that he wasn\u2019t injured in the midst of it.</p><p>Ingrid\u2019s gaze shot to her, but Rosalind pretended she didn\u2019t see. \u201cIngrid, would you help me into my corset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is everything, sir.\u201d Garrett tossed a variety of newspaper clippings and invitations on the table.</p><p>Lynch snatched them up, raking through them. \u201cA few soirees, a poetry reading, Lady Callahan\u2019s charity dinner...\u201d He paused, unfolding a pristine sheet of parchment. \u201cThe Baiting of the Wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe opera,\u201d Byrnes murmured, leaning closer to see. \u201cLast showing of the Season. Everyone will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d It had to be. The prince consort himself was most likely to attend, as would anyone of influence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous building,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThey could already be inside and we would never know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ll never let us inside,\u201d Byrnes said quietly.</p><p>Lynch looked up, tapping the parchment against his hand. Byrnes was right. Only the purest of bloodlines would have an invitation. No rogue would be allowed in, no matter what Lynch said\u2014especially when Maitland\u2019s men would be guarding the opera house.</p><p>Someone rapped on the door to his study.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he called.</p><p>Perry stepped through the door, her short-cropped dark hair pomaded closely to her scalp. Rosa followed at her heels, wearing dark green cotton that swished around her ankles. Her gaze met his, then flickered away, a faint pink flush rising in her cheeks. It reminded him of the wicked pink flush in her cheeks as she\u2019d sat astride him, her small white teeth worrying her lip as she slowly, slowly lowered herself down over his cock.</p><p>The sensation shot through him, dashing his control and his wits. She was shaded with shadow now, the pinkness of her cheeks lost to the monotony of the predator\u2019s vision. A hand pressed into his chest and he looked down in surprise as Garrett pushed against him, a warning look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes,\u201d his second murmured. \u201cControl it.\u201d</p><p>And just that suddenly, he recognized the fierce need surging through him and the intent way in which he\u2019d moved toward her\u2014a movement that he could not remember beginning.</p><p>They were all looking at him. Byrnes\u2019s eyes narrowed in thought and he glanced at Mrs. Marberry as if suddenly realizing what Garrett\u2019s words meant.</p><p>Lynch swallowed hard. \u201cRosa.\u201d He inclined his head politely.</p><p>She returned the salute and he realized that she was pale this afternoon. The light had drained from her creamy skin, leaving her faintly ashen.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I missed?\u201d Perry asked.</p><p>\u201cWe think we know where the mechs are going to attack,\u201d Lynch replied, snapping his gaze back to the opera notice. He didn\u2019t dare look at Rosa\u2014not even to wonder why she looked so strained. Was it him? Did she regret what had happened between them? \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be today. The only event of any social import is the opera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Garrett asked. \u201cCall it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He rubbed his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019ve spent months playing this safely and\u2014\u201d His voice caught. \u201cI\u2019m running out of time. If we call the opera off, then the mechs will simply fade back into the populace and we won\u2019t be able to bring them before the court...\u201d He almost added in time.</p><p>\u201cThen how do we get inside?\u201d Byrnes asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Lynch replied. \u201cThe only one with any chance of being accepted at the door is myself. The rest of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The word was soft and came from behind him. Lynch glanced over his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re all rogues, Mrs. Marberry, but at least my knighthood might finally provide something of use.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, stepping forward with her fists balled. \u201cYou\u2019re not going in alone. If they\u2019re planning on releasing the orbs, then I won\u2019t have you there. You know what happened. I won\u2019t allow it! Not again.\u201d</p><p>Lynch stared at her, feeling everyone\u2019s eyes upon them as he struggled to find the words. She wouldn\u2019t have said this if she didn\u2019t care for him, would she? Elation soared in his chest, but he choked it off ruthlessly. He had nothing to offer her. No hope of anything beyond today, no matter how much he wished it.</p><p>Because he couldn\u2019t bring himself to betray Mercury to the Council.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not in a position to deny me,\u201d he reminded her quietly, though the words spoke of so much more. He hated having to do it\u2014hated watching the furious flood of heat surge through her cheeks as if he\u2019d slapped her\u2014but this was for her own good. If he let her have hopes, then he would only cruelly dash them. Let it end now. Before the damage became too great.</p><p>Garrett winced but Mrs. Marberry tipped her chin up. \u201cYou\u2019re correct,\u201d she replied. \u201cI have no authority\u2014no...no right to deny you. Do as you will, you stubborn fool, but don\u2019t doubt this. You won\u2019t be going alone. I\u2019m a respectable widow with a\u2014\u201d</p><p>This time it was his turn to start. \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you propose to stop me?\u201d she replied, lacing her arms across her chest. \u201cLet me assure you that I can and will find myself a ticket to the opera if you try to keep me out of this. I can be extremely ingenious when I wish to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut that should be rather difficult\u2014even for you\u2014if I chain you up in my bloody bedroom!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir, really,\u201d she drawled, a glint of humor warming her dark eyes. \u201cA gentleman never reveals his intentions in public as such.\u201d</p><p>He gaped.</p><p>Rosa took a step toward him, her smile growing victorious. \u201cBesides, what makes you think I won\u2019t simply pick the lock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will remove all of your pins.\u201d That vein in his temple was starting to throb again. Did the woman have no sense? This was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cAll of them? My lord, you are thorough.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have sounded more like innuendo if she\u2019d tried. Garrett coughed, and Perry\u2019s lips were pressed so tightly together she looked like she was going to burst.</p> <p>\u201cI believe you are being outmaneuvered.\u201d Garrett murmured. \u201cI\u2019d suggest a healthy capitulation now, before you say something you truly do regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Lynch narrowed his glare toward Garrett. \u201cI am not taking her into the opera alone. You at least look the part. I want you in court clothes within two hours. You don\u2019t stray an inch from her side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a nursemaid,\u201d Rosa protested.</p><p>Perry grinned. \u201cThose pretty looks have come in handy again, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s gaze cut to hers. \u201cAnd you can find a dress.\u201d</p><p>Perry\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cNot a chance, sir.\u201d</p><p>He stabbed a finger toward her. \u201cI\u2019m not asking. Find a dress and a wig or else I will find one for you. Then I will stuff you into it myself if I need to!\u201d</p><p>Silence greeted this outburst. Even Garrett\u2014who was struggling to suppress his laughter\u2014didn\u2019t dare say a word. Lynch straightened. \u201cByrnes, I want you to have men in place surrounding the building. I also need a contingent sent to each of the other events on the list, just in case we\u2019ve picked the wrong one.\u201d He knew he hadn\u2019t, but there were enough Nighthawks to cover each place.</p> <p>\u201cHave a man sent to Barrons and alert him to what is happening. He can get the queen and the prince consort out if matters go awry.\u201d He started picking at his cuff links. \u201cGarrett, on your way, send Doyle up to help get me ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d Garrett snapped a salute.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about me?\u201d Rosa asked.</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re coming, you need to look the part. It\u2019s going to be difficult enough convincing the doormen to let us through as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake Perry,\u201d Garrett added blandly. \u201cYou may have to show her what a dress is.\u201d</p><p>Perry\u2019s sudden glare was one step short of murder. \u201cI hope you choke on your cologne,\u201d she snarled, stalking toward the door and grabbing Rosa by the arm.</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>Through the door, Lynch barked orders, snapping one last briefing to his men. Rosalind took a deep breath, smoothing the trim skirts over her hips. The gown fit almost too snugly, her breasts threatening to spill over the top of the peach-colored silk\u2019s square neckline. Bands of chocolate brown chenille passementerie foliage trimmed the neckline and the soft drapes of her skirt. A cream foile hip scarf spilled to the ground behind her, making a rustling sound every time she moved.</p><p>Perry raked her with an experienced eye. \u201cYou\u2019ll do. Turn around.\u201d</p><p>Perry herself was almost unrecognizable. Gone was the cold-faced woman in harsh black leather with her pomaded hair. Instead, a white ostrich feather danced in her hair, the curls of the black wig trailing over her shoulder. She wore red silk, the bias-cut panels of the bodice creating slight curves out of the woman\u2019s slender figure. An underskirt of Point d\u2019Angleterre lace peeked out from beneath the drape of her train, and she wore pearls wrapped thrice around her throat. Rosalind knew all of this, because Perry had explained it in quite explicit detail while they raided the French couturier that afternoon. One flash of Perry\u2019s leathers and the madame had been most accommodating, no doubt for fear of incurring the wrath of the Nighthawks.</p><p>A strip of black velvet ribbon circled Rosalind\u2019s throat and Perry tied it. A single teardrop-shaped pearl hung from the center, warming against her skin.</p><p>\u201cLynch is going to have an apoplexy,\u201d Perry muttered with a nasty smile as Rosalind stared into the cheval mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good at this,\u201d Rosalind noted, meeting the other woman\u2019s eyes in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to wear pants. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know what a dress is for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wear dresses,\u201d Rosalind pointed out. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what half of this is called.\u201d She pointed at the lacy frill that draped her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to use a knife?\u201d Perry asked, ignoring the question in her words.</p><p>\u201cBetter than I know how to use that fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d Perry grabbed the fan off the bed with a sharp flick of her wrist. The copper-plated blades fanned out, creating a deadly half circle that looked like it could be thrown.</p><p>For the first time that afternoon, Rosalind leaned forward in interest. \u201cAre the edges sharp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharp enough to shave with,\u201d Perry replied, folding it back into itself. She hung it from her own wrist and took a small six-inch shape off the bed. \u201cThis is a bodice dagger.\u201d Drawing the small blade from its velvet sheath, Perry flipped it in her fingers with a dexterity Rosalind almost envied. \u201cDo you want it?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind nodded and accepted the blade, tucking it between the fine boning of her corset, the handle sitting snugly between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cAnd this\u201d\u2014Perry grabbed a thin shiv off the bed\u2014\u201cis designed to be worn in the hair. See how the handle is ornamental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery pretty.\u201d</p><p>Perry grinned, handing it toward her hilt first. \u201cDon\u2019t let Lynch lure you into any dark corners. He might cut his fingers off by the time I\u2019m through with you.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind glanced at her beneath her lashes. She was almost starting to like the other woman. \u201cI thought he looked more likely to throttle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. I was expecting you to deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack suits you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The sultry voice came from behind. Lynch\u2019s fingers jerked on his cuff links and he turned around...then stopped.</p><p>Rosa sauntered down the staircase, fanning herself with a scrap of white lace as her skirts trailed behind her. His breathing quickened. Hell. Someone had poured her into that dress. If she took a sharp breath buttons were going to suddenly become a fatal hail around her.</p><p>His gaze dipped. Buttons trailed down the nipped in waist of her gown and vanished into the gauzy fabric bunching at her waist. He couldn\u2019t breathe all of a sudden, an image of her clever little fingers working on similar buttons springing to mind.</p><p>\u201cYou look like your collar\u2019s too tight.\u201d A little smile flickered over her lips as she reached up and gently toyed with the white bow tie around his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing.\u201d His gaze dropped again, a faint darkening shadowing the edges of his vision. Every man at the opera was going to be staring at her...buttons.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scowl.\u201d Rosa\u2019s smile faded, her fingers lingering on his collar for longer than was appropriate. She stared at his throat, a small hint of nervousness flickering through those dark eyes. \u201cI want you to be careful tonight, sir.\u201d</p><p>The thought that she was worried about him drew a harsh laugh. He\u2019d spent hours trying to work through his own arguments about why she shouldn\u2019t attend.</p><p>Slowly her hands slid down to his chest, resting lightly against the lapels of his coat as if she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to stop touching him.</p><p>\u201cRosa,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her dark lashes fluttered against her smooth cheeks and those luminous eyes hit him with all the power of a punch.</p><p>\u201cRosa, I wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d A bleak word. Her gaze dropped, her hands fluttering helplessly against his chest. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Light gleamed over the coppery shine of her hair. Lynch took a deep breath, drawing in the lemony scent of her as he closed his eyes. He felt as if they stood alone, the world a thousand miles away. Silence fell over them like a mantle, and he simply listened to the soft sigh of her breathing, the racing, throbbing beat of her heart... The sound of it was its own form of communication and he felt it echo deep within his chest.</p><p>Reaching out, he traced his fingertips over her lips. He\u2019d sworn he wouldn\u2019t do this. It would only hurt her if he failed at his task tonight, yet he was as helpless as a moth drawn to flame. Slowly his head lowered, his forehead leaning against the soft silk of her hair. He could taste her breath between them and as she shifted, her own face lifting ever so slightly, he felt the stir of it against his own lips.</p><p>Lynch couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t press closer. Instead he lingered, drawing her breath into his lungs, where it belonged. Feeling her so deep inside him, as if she had wrapped chains around his heart and bound them together.</p><p>Rosa tilted her face, a soft whimper sounding in her throat. Her mouth brushed his. Once. Twice. Silk rasping over his sensitive lips. His hands fisted at his sides and he brought them up, stroking the backs of his knuckles against the velvety skin of her jaw.</p><p>I wish that it didn\u2019t have to be this way.</p><p>Again their mouths brushed against each other, more of an inhale than a kiss. Rosa\u2019s body surrendered to his, her hips pressing hard against his thighs. Yet despite the softness of her body, her hands still curled around his lapels as if she was afraid to let go entirely.</p><p>\u201cBe careful tonight,\u201d he whispered, tracing her mouth with the words. \u201cI could not bear to see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, her tongue wetting his own. A groan echoed in his throat and he took a deep breath and pulled away. The world spun. When he met her eyes, they held the same unfocused breathlessness he himself felt.</p><p>Slowly, her pupils focused on him. \u201cI won\u2019t let you be hurt,\u201d she said, swallowing hard. Her voice strengthened. \u201cNo matter what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>The edge of ruthlessness was so at odds with what he\u2019d known of her, yet he could remember the dark shadows in her voice the other night when she lay in his arms and told him of her life. Rosa was sunshine and smiles, yet an edge of hardened steel existed beneath the exterior. She had known pain and she had survived it. As she looked up at him, he realized then that he had underestimated her.</p><p>She would do whatever was necessary to protect him.</p><p>He saw in her eyes the truth of what she wouldn\u2019t tell him, the truth she wouldn\u2019t let him tell her. Fear wouldn\u2019t allow her to give voice to it, yet it existed between them, as heady as opium.</p><p>Lynch nodded slowly and stepped away, her hands falling helplessly from his coat.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d she murmured, her pulse still throbbing in her throat. Reaching down, she drew a leather mouth mask out of her reticule. \u201cI know someone who makes them and I bought as many as I could while Perry and I were out...shopping.\u201d</p><p>Easier to speak of this than everything that remained unsaid. His gaze cut to her face, noting the stiffness of her shoulders. Something had changed between them that night they\u2019d been taken to Undertown, and though self-doubt told him it was because of what he\u2019d almost done to her, his gut clenched with instinct. It had happened before that; the moment she told him he couldn\u2019t kiss her again, the moment panic had edged its way across her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For so long he\u2019d been afraid to let another woman close after Annabelle\u2019s betrayal. It had hurt so badly, though the ache of it was like an old scar now. He\u2019d never wanted to feel that way again.</p><p>Somehow Rosa had gotten beneath his skin. He hadn\u2019t even realized what was happening until it was too late. And now he was falling for a woman who was afraid to love him back.</p><p>Oh, yes, he recognized the deliberate distance she kept between them. The only time she\u2019d ever come close to revealing herself\u2014that secret core she kept hidden\u2014she\u2019d been in his arms and his bed, and neither of them had been focused on speaking.</p> <p>He knew she had secrets. He simply didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The taste of her fear rode over his tongue, despite the weak smile she flashed him. If she wanted to pretend that nothing had happened, then he would let her\u2014he had to. Anything else would only prolong the pain of his death if he couldn\u2019t figure out a way to give the Echelon what they wanted without betraying Mercury.</p><p>So he didn\u2019t push her to face this fear. He didn\u2019t ask what it was that she was keeping from him. Instead, he took the half mask in dubious fingers and examined it. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>A small round disk centered over the mouthpiece, bound with mesh that roughened the pad of his thumb as he scraped it over it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a filtration mask. It helps those suffering from the black lung, or other lung diseases, to breathe without the choke of London air.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think it will stop the bloodlust from effecting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It might. It\u2019s supposed to filter out all noxious gases and pollutants.\u201d</p><p>She knew. Knew the fear that lurked in his own heart. The vulnerability should have concerned him\u2014he hated having anyone know his weaknesses\u2014but Rosa was different. He trusted her implicitly, despite the secrets that lurked between them. This meant more to him than any gift. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have three more.\u201d The look in her eyes told him she knew exactly what he was thinking. \u201cOne each for Perry and Garrett and one left over for whoever you feel needs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cByrnes,\u201d he said instantly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be leading the outside contingent.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps intruded. \u201cI heard my name,\u201d Garrett announced, striding out of the shadows and into the light, his attention focused on his cuff links. He straightened them and looked up, light gleaming off his chestnut hair and the stark white shirt beneath his black coat.</p> <p>One would think a member of the Echelon had arrived; from the pristine folds of the white scarf dangling around his neck to the crisp white gloves Garrett tugged into place, he looked like any other dashing young rake.</p><p>His body was focused however, stillness radiating through sleek muscle. A weapon at Lynch\u2019s side and one he had to trust enough to use. Garrett would survive, he had to believe that. Lynch couldn\u2019t protect them all, especially not when this time he was the one who needed help.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Perry?\u201d Garrett asked. \u201cStill trying to figure out which end of the dress goes where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I managed,\u201d Perry drawled, from the top of the stairs.</p><p>Even Lynch\u2019s eyebrows shot up when he saw her. Languidly waving a fan, Perry slid her blood-red skirts into her other hand and started down the stairs. Her natural predatory grace made it seem as though she were stalking them, a small triumphant smile on her painted lips as her blue eyes locked on Garrett.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll do?\u201d she asked in a surprisingly girlish voice as she reached the foot of the stairs. Glancing at Garrett beneath her lashes, she gave a little twirl that flared the skirts around her trim ankles.</p><p>At his side, Rosa pressed her gloved hand to her lips and coughed. Lynch looked down sharply. That had sounded suspiciously like a laugh. When he saw the smile she couldn\u2019t quite hide, he raised a questioning brow.</p><p>She tilted her head toward Garrett, who was frozen in the act of straightening his coat.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d Perry repeated, coming to a halt, with her red skirts wrapping around the bottom of her legs and an excited, breathless flush in her cheeks.</p><p>Garrett cleared his throat. \u201cGood God. Mrs. Marberry you work wonders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had nothing to do with it,\u201d Rosa replied. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re not giving Perry her dues. It seems she\u2019s been hiding more than a knife or two under that body armor all along.\u201d</p><p>The color drained out of his second\u2019s face. A dawning suspicion began to grow on him and Lynch glanced between the pair of them. Rosa\u2019s face came into view as she straightened his coat and she winked up at him as if she knew precisely what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ruin it,\u201d she mouthed silently.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Garrett said in a crisp, distant tone that sounded not at all himself. His eyes were wild. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Light gleamed over the heavy Grecian columns that supported the opera portico. Dozens of brightly dressed ladies littered the marble stairs that led to the doors, fans fluttering like ghostly wings in the night.</p><p>Lynch stepped out of the plain black steam carriage, raking the crowd with a ruthless gaze. Blue bloods thronged all around him, some of them casting curious glances at the carriage as if wondering what he was doing there. He\u2019d earned a knighthood over twenty years ago for finding the kidnapped cousin of the queen, but he rarely moved amongst them. They might call him \u201csir\u201d to his face, but they still considered him little better than a rogue. Indeed some of the younger members of the Echelon didn\u2019t even bother with the \u201csir,\u201d too young to remember a time when he\u2019d walked amongst them with the same rights and dues as they owned.</p><p>He offered his hand to Rosa. Her glove rested on his, then she slid down from the carriage with effortless grace, fanning herself. The bored expression on her face perfectly matched every other lady there, as though they didn\u2019t dare reveal too much emotion for fear of appearing gauche.</p><p>Her eyes however raked the crowd with the same attention to detail as his\u2014almost as if she were looking for someone. Lynch slid his hand into the curve of her back and urged her toward the opera house, bending low to murmur, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. I won\u2019t allow anything to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Her spine was steel, reluctance tight in each muscle beneath his fingertips. \u201cDo you expect your father to be here?\u201d</p><p>Rosa stopped in her tracks. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d Then she stopped and he had no difficulty deciphering her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s of the Echelon. And I know he hurt you. One of these days, you will tell me what he did\u2014\u201d At the sudden jerk of her head, he lifted a soothing hand. \u201cBut not now. Just rest assured that you will come to no harm. If you wish to wait in the carriage, you may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I see my father, then I know I shall not come to any harm.\u201d Her expression tightened. \u201cI cannot say the same for him.\u201d</p><p>Cold foreboding traveled down his spine. \u201cDo you have your pistol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s strapped to my thigh.\u201d She pasted an impressively convincing smile on her face. \u201cFear not, my lord, for I don\u2019t intend to hunt him down.\u201d She reached up and trailed the edge of her fan over his lips. \u201cI also have no intention of waiting in the carriage.\u201d This time her smile softened with genuineness.</p><p>\u201cIt was worth a try.\u201d</p><p>She laughed under her breath, low and husky, the sound stirring over his skin like soft fingers.</p><p>\u201cCan you see Garrett or Perry?\u201d he asked, looking around. \u201cI wish I could wear the aural communicator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett is probably still gaping like a breeched cod,\u201d Rosa murmured, catching a handful of her skirts as she smoothly took the first stair at his side. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to leave the hackney out of sight and walk on foot. I shouldn\u2019t expect them very soon, not with this crush.\u201d</p><p>More people turned to glance at them as they reached the top of the stairs, whispers sprouting.</p><p>At the door, a pair of Coldrush Guards gave him an uneasy glance. The prince consort and queen must be in attendance then. Lynch\u2019s gut clenched. As if tonight wouldn\u2019t be difficult enough.</p><p>Handing over his tickets at the door, he and Rosa slipped inside the marble foyer. A black-and-white checkerboard of tiles extended all the way to a gilded pair of spiral stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Rosa whispered, looking up at him. She was almost breathless with excitement, her eyes sparkling in the candlelight.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d he murmured, shielding her from the buffeting crowd with his body. Dozens of gold-plated servant drones wheeled through the crowd and he snatched a pair of glasses off the flat tray on one of their heads. Offering her the champagne, he sipped at his own blud-wein. The crowd was starting to move, and across the foyer he saw Garrett protectively ushering Perry inside.</p><p>If the mechs were here, they\u2019d know him on sight. They wouldn\u2019t, however, recognize the pair of Nighthawks unless he did something to draw attention to them. Lynch glanced away, focusing on the liveried servants that mingled with the crowd. None of them looked as though they\u2019d led a hard life and he could see no sign of a distinctive mech limb anywhere.</p><p>\u201cNot the servants,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThese men are from the enclaves. There\u2019s no way they could blend in enough for the Echelon to mistake them.\u201d</p><p>She was right. They\u2019d be somewhere deep within the bowels of the building, perhaps posing as workmen behind the scenes or maintenance workers.</p><p>A blue blood minced past with a pale young woman on a leash, her gaze downcast and a thin, gauzy white robe revealing inches of decadent skin. Rosa\u2019s eyes hardened and Lynch steered her away with a hand to the small of her back. One glance told him she knew exactly what he was doing; that diamond-sharp gaze scored him and for a moment he felt a flush of shame, as though by his very complicity, he himself had put the golden shackle around the young blood slave\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d he told her. \u201cNor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we simply ignore it?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing her champagne, she slammed the glass flute down on the tray of a passing servant drone and jerked away from his touch.</p><p>\u201cWe keep our minds on the business at hand.\u201d He grabbed her elbow in a hard grip and Rosa stilled, her back rigid with barely suppressed fury. Lynch sighed under his breath and stepped closer, lowering his face close to her ear. \u201cI have no influence here. I\u2019m as much an outsider as you are, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>One look at Rosa\u2019s face, at those implacable black eyes told him she wasn\u2019t swayed. \u201cIf you could, would you help her?\u201d</p><p>Something about the stillness of her figure told him the answer was deadly important to her. She looked right through him, as though seeking to bare his soul, to find something inside him that she desperately needed to find.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to ask?\u201d His hand gentled on her arm. Hell, he couldn\u2019t believe what he was thinking, his mind branded with shock. She\u2019d admitted her brother was a humanist, but her own thoughts on the matter were dangerously revealing. \u201cRosa, you need to keep such thoughts close, especially here. If anyone overhears...\u201d</p><p>Rosa sucked in a sharp breath, her entire body quivering beneath his touch. \u201cThey would think I had humanist tendencies. Perhaps I should say something. Perhaps this eternal damned silence\u2014this hold-your-tongue-or-die attitude is what keeps women like that in shackles. This lack of a voice\u2014it\u2019s the very reason we are here. The reason there is a war going on, played out in secret beneath the Echelon\u2019s very noses.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking so violently he could barely contain her. Darting a look over his shoulder, he pressed her against the wall, using his body to screen hers. For once, he was relieved at the oppressive laughter and gossip nearby, for it kept Rosa\u2019s damning words from common ears.</p><p>Their eyes met. She was angry and he didn\u2019t quite understand.</p><p>\u201cIf I said something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you would die, and I with you,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>Rosa\u2019s lips parted, her eyes widening. He watched thoughts racing in rapid emotion across her face, like the shadow of cloud cover over the ground.</p><p>\u201cThey would have to go through me first,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut I would die, and you too, and perhaps there would be some to cry \u2018martyr,\u2019 but in the end it wouldn\u2019t matter. Nothing would change. That girl will go home with her collar and leash, and her master will take as much blood from her as he desires.\u201d The back of his gloved fingers trailed over her jaw. She looked so lost, so crushed. \u201cThat is why I must stop these humanists, these mechs. They will bring war and death down upon the Echelon, but they will trample the innocent in their path just as much as the enemy. If we don\u2019t find them, theirs will be a hollow victory, earning them nothing but hate and fear. And when the Echelon fear something, they destroy it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She quivered, her lashes drifting shut\u2014but not before he saw the diamond glimmer of a tear in her eye.</p><p>\u201cThousands will die,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know I\u2019m hunting humanists, but the Echelon shall not be as discreet. They\u2019ll simply round up whoever they can and execute them all until they get what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. \u201cThere has to be a way. We have to have some way to fight\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His mouth tasted like ash, his worst fears springing to life. We... She\u2019d named herself amongst them as surely as if she\u2019d claimed it directly to his face. Doubt assailed him\u2014a moment where he wondered just how deeply she was involved, how much trouble a spy in the Nighthawks could cause.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t feign everything, could she? If she was a humanist, then she never would have kissed him, never would have...</p><p>Mercury did.</p><p>That was different. That was lust, a burning brand between them. A flickering match thrown on a puddle of oil. Whatever lay between he and Rosa, it was more than that.</p><p>Or it could have been, if he let it.</p> <p>Still, his thumb stroked over her chin, doubt crippling him. He had to know. Was this real, or was she the greatest actress to ever grace a stage?</p><p>He took her mouth, capturing a gasp. Rosa\u2019s hands fisted in his coat instantly, her body pressing against his as she kissed him. This was madness to take such liberties here. The corner was in shadows, weak golden light dripping down the red and white wallpaper throughout the foyer, but he knew this would be noticed and remarked upon.</p><p>Still...the taste of her set the darkness roaring inside. A need to claim, to take her as his. Damn her. His hand fisted in the base of her elegant chignon. He was losing himself in her, no matter what he promised himself.</p><p>Just once he cursed duty and pushed it aside. Fuck the Council. The prince consort could go to hell. He wanted this\u2014he wanted her, with all his heart. A lifetime would never be enough.</p><p>And he only had one more night.</p><p>Lynch dragged in a shuddering gasp, breathing hard against her mouth. With barely an inch between them, he could see the wild hunger gleaming in her eyes. It tempted him but he fought it, licking the taste of her from his lips. He could lose himself here, lose himself in her, but if he did, if he took her home and let the mechs do whatever they wanted, then he knew that no matter how frantically he kissed her, he would hear the clock ticking slowly in the background.</p> <p>\u201cI need you to know something,\u201d he breathed, fingers trembling on her jaw. \u201cNo matter what happens...I need you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She clutched at his coat as if some sense of premonition shivered through her.</p><p>\u201cI lied when I said that I wasn\u2019t sure what I felt for Annabelle. I lied when I said that I didn\u2019t once think of revenge,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cI did. Losing her hurt a great deal, so much so that I swore I\u2019d never let myself feel that way again.\u201d Lynch\u2019s gaze cut to hers, forcing her to meet his eyes, no matter how much she stiffened. He didn\u2019t care if she was afraid of this; he needed her to know, before it was too late. \u201cYou make me forget the hurt. You make me wish that there were more days ahead of me. So that we could\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rosa put her finger to his lips, stilling the flow of words. Horror rounded her eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo, you barely know me.\u201d Hysteria laced the last two words.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re frightened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything!\u201d She pushed past, pressing her gloved fingers to her lips.</p><p>Lynch followed, hard on her heels, ignoring the sudden scattering of curious debutantes. They couldn\u2019t say this here. It was too crowded, every ear and eye suddenly turning their way.</p><p>He caught her wrist, his fingers locking around something hard. Rosa spun like a scalded cat, yanking at his grip and clutching her hand to her chest. Lynch\u2019s fingers rubbed slowly together, as if his mind sought to assimilate the sensation of that touch.</p> <p>Hard.</p><p>Like iron.</p><p>She froze like a trapped animal, a vicious, desperate look on her face. \u201cAnd now, me lord Nighthawk? Do you still feel that way now?\u201d</p><p>The noise and laughter around him drained away, the world narrowing in on the woman in front of him as she stared at him, almost daring him. He barely saw it. Everything in him turned to lead, darkness obliterating his vision as the hunger surged.</p><p>No. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Me lord Nighthawk...</p><p>As if a veil had been lifted, everything he knew about her\u2014everything she\u2019d explained away so well\u2014crashed together. Her hands\u2014don\u2019t touch my hands\u2014the pistol she carried, and the way she could pick a lock with barely a thought. No! He\u2019d seen her hand, seen Mercury in the park while Rosa sat in the carriage beside him... Or had he? The truth hit him like a bucket of icy water, washing away the willful blindness, making him feel sick at the deception. The way she\u2019d fooled him and so easily too.</p><p>Or perhaps, if he were honest, he had let himself be fooled.</p><p>\u201cMercury,\u201d he whispered, and realized that she had been right.</p><p>He knew her not at all.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>Rosalind panicked.</p><p>What had she done? The look in his eyes\u2014oh God, his eyes\u2014like little black pinpricks of blazing fury. But she couldn\u2019t cope, couldn\u2019t face the oppressive weight of his declarations without ruining it. She had to. Before he said something she wouldn\u2019t be able to forget. Before the sickening bite of her own secrets strangled her with guilt.</p><p>Rosalind couldn\u2019t face him anymore. Couldn\u2019t stomach the look on his face, as if she\u2019d punched him in the chest with a knife. Betrayal. That\u2019s what she saw and it hurt her so much she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Heart thundering in her ears, she turned and ran toward the staircase. All around her blue bloods pressed close in their powdered wigs and extravagant velvets.</p><p>Rosalind sucked back a sob, the world blurring around her in a golden haze of melted candlelight. Why the devil hadn\u2019t she kept her mouth shut? Let him profess his undying love for her; it meant nothing. It shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Why had she blurted out the truth?</p><p>She\u2019d wanted him to know. So he wouldn\u2019t love her anymore. So he wouldn\u2019t torture her with these false declarations. So she\u2019d never have to see him again, never feel the aching pain of her secret gnawing like a tumor within her. Never let herself wish for something she couldn\u2019t have...</p><p>This felt like a nightmare. The stairs were endless, as if no matter how hard she ran they would never end. She kept waiting for a hand to yank at her skirts, for him to grab her by the shoulder and wrench her to her knees. Finally! The top. She pushed into a pair of blue bloods and came to a staggering halt, trapped by the crowd. Where was he? Why hadn\u2019t he grabbed her yet?</p><p>Rosalind risked a glance. Her eyes met Lynch\u2019s, dark brown clashing with icy gray and something in her chest constricted at the way he stood at the bottom of the steps, staring at her as if she\u2019d ripped his heart out and fled with it.</p><p>Her pulse thundered raggedly in her ears. As if he shared the same nightmare, he shook his head, shaking off the spell. The expression on his face hardened and something hurt deep within her at the sight of it.</p><p>Why? This is what you wanted!</p><p>His first step was slow, deliberate. Light gleamed in the polished shine of his boots, the blackness of his coat absorbing every shadow. Somehow the crowd gave way to him as though sensing the danger that prowled within its midst.</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s lungs caught until she could barely breathe. Panic flared. She took a step back and Lynch\u2019s gaze flattened. He was furious. Beyond furious. Sudden terror made her turn around in a swish of skirts and press into the crowd.</p><p>An elegant little bell rang and the doors to the theatre opened. Laughter echoed, so rough and raucous against her skin that she felt as if it rubbed her raw. The swarm of the crowd pressed through the doors, heading for their seats, and she was dragged along in the tide, trapped by the current of people. Buffeted on all sides, panicked, almost blind to the world around her, she shoved and pushed her way through, not caring what they thought anymore. Lynch was the danger. If he got his hands on her...</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath. Nearly clear of the crowd. Just three more steps and then she was going to grab a handful of her skirts and flee across the blood-red carpets for the exit.</p><p>Two steps. One. A hard hand gripped her elbow, the other settling on her waist. She was shoved free of the crowd, then the grip on her tightened.</p><p>Rosalind stiffened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Lynch murmured, leaning close to her ear. His hard body pressed against her back, driving her against the wall.</p><p>Rosalind spun, the bodice knife clutched in her gloved fingers. Lynch pressed her against the velvet embossed wallpaper, examining the crowd around them with a dangerous glare. As if he felt her gaze on his face, he slowly looked at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to use it?\u201d That voice... So cold.</p><p>\u201cUse what?\u201d she whispered, unable to break the hold of his gaze. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>\u201cThe knife,\u201d he said, enunciating each word with a diamond edge. He let her go, his nostrils flaring and his gaze black with fury. \u201cGo on. Use it.\u201d His arms dropped to his sides, presenting the vulnerable expanse of his abdomen and chest.</p><p>Rosalind stared at him. She had barely realized what she\u2019d done; drawing the blade was always her first instinct. Only there was nothing to fight here. She couldn\u2019t knife the brutal crush of feeling in her chest, the weight that made her feel like she was slowly drowning. Her fingers opened nervelessly and the knife fell to the floor.</p><p>If anything, his gaze narrowed further.</p><p>Then he was hauling her toward the next staircase\u2014the one that led to the boxes. Trapped by the ruthless steel of his grip, Rosalind could do nothing but stumble along in his wake. Her mind was blank. No clever escape routes, no witty rejoinder. She was numb all the way through.</p><p>They staggered into the hushed foyer that led to the boxes. Gilt soared up each column and the roof was mirrored in small tiles of glass. An image of the pair of them, locked together in a horrific embrace, danced through thousands of tiny glass shards. A red liveried servant stepped forward. \u201cSir, you can\u2019t be up here\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lynch shot him a deadly look and Rosalind grabbed his arm in desperation as the darkness within him looked back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said shakily. \u201cTake your anger out on me. Not him.\u201d</p><p>The servant swallowed hard and bolted out of the way. Lynch raked a glance at the heavily gilded sigils on each door: a griffin, a swan, three roaring lions, a serpent... He yanked the door open, the scarlet snake seeming to hiss in her face as she was wrenched through.</p><p>The House of Bleight\u2019s box. Bound to be empty so soon after the death of the duke\u2019s son.</p><p>Plunging into darkness, her knees hit one of the chairs and she tripped, clutching at the velvet seatback. The theatre spread before her, golden light basking over hundreds of pale faces as the blue bloods took their seats. The dull roar of conversation echoed in the cavernous theatre, a monotonous drone that masked the harsh pant of her breathing.</p><p>Rosalind spun.</p><p>Lynch pressed the door closed with a quiet, controlled click, his head bowing for a moment as if he fought for control. The line between his shoulders was rigid with tension. Taking a deep breath, he pushed away from the door and turned to face her.</p><p>Gray eyes met hers, devouring her face as if he\u2019d never seen her before. \u201cDid you enjoy it? Making me a fool? Laughing at me behind my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was never about that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>The harsh word stopped her. Rosalind tilted her chin up defiantly. \u201cMaybe at the start I enjoyed it a little.\u201d</p><p>A bitter smile curled over his mouth. \u201cAnd what happened? Come, entertain me with some story about how it started to change\u2014how I began to matter to you. How long did you intend to carry out this charade? Until you\u2019d broken me? Until you\u2019d won whatever game you thought you were playing?\u201d He stepped closer, looming over her, each word cutting and precise. \u201cYou should have left me in that cell, my dear. I\u2019m certain the mechs would have taken care of me and then you wouldn\u2019t have had to dirty your own hands eventually.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s fists clenched, pain razoring through her. In defense, she felt her own anger rise. \u201cYou had nothing to do with it. I would never have risked such a charade if I didn\u2019t need to, if I...if I could find my brother. You arrogant bastard, stop thinking this was about you! You were never supposed to happen, this...\u201d She choked on the words. \u201cYou ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Lynch stilled, his heavy-lidded eyes examining her. \u201cYou expect me to believe the story about your brother was the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to believe anything. I don\u2019t care whether you do or not. It doesn\u2019t matter one whit to me.\u201d The words would have been so much more believable if her voice hadn\u2019t broken at the end. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shiver of strings whispered through the air, then a mild percussion as the orchestra encouraged everyone to their seats.</p><p>\u201cSo your brother was the only reason you infiltrated the guild? Or were you planning something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you will, but Jeremy was my only concern. I\u2019ve had no hand in anything since he went missing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the boiler pack from the enclaves?\u201d</p><p>Not a lie, not precisely. \u201cSomething that was set in motion years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFitz suspects it\u2019s similar to the model used to power the Echelon\u2019s metaljackets.\u201d His gaze sharpened. \u201cWhat are you planning, Rosa? Or is that even your real name?\u201d</p><p>She had nothing to say to that. Each word only damned her further.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he swore, slamming a hand against the wall beside her head.</p> <p>Rosalind flinched.</p><p>\u201cAnd your husband?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWas he real? Was any of it fucking real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost all of it.\u201d She closed her eyes, unable to bear the demand in his own. \u201cThe best lies are based in truth.\u201d</p><p>The cool rasp of his breath stirred against her cheek as he leaned closer. Rosalind\u2019s breath caught and she steeled herself. A blow she could tolerate. But not this... Not his gentle cruelties.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, meeting his eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d A stark demand, laced with harsh longing. \u201cOr do you only use your body for the sake of the cause? You kissed me once, gave yourself to me. Was that real, Mercury? Or just another way to bring me to my knees?\u201d His hand lifted, hesitated by her face. He wanted it to be real; she read it all over his expression.</p> <p>Rosalind turned her face aside, letting out the breath she\u2019d been holding as she pressed back against the wall. Anything to stop him from touching her. From destroying her.</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that so well. It almost makes me think some part of you gives a damn. But as you say, the best lies\u2014especially this\u2014are based on truth.\u201d His fingers caught her chin and tilted her face to his. His other hand brushed against her mouth and he leaned closer, a cold, almost fanatical light in his black eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare look away. You owe me this.\u201d</p><p>Owe him or not, this was no lie. This was her only real truth, but she\u2019d never convince him of that, even if she found the words to say. She never had the words\u2014to bare herself so completely went against every harsh lesson she\u2019d ever learned\u2014but this...this she could do. Only with her mouth, her hands, her body, could she tell him what her heart could not.</p><p>With his body so close to hers, Rosalind could barely think. Anger vibrated off him, burning her with its intensity. He\u2019d not forgiven her. He probably never would. But he was as trapped by this as she was, desire weaving a thick net around them. In the darkness of the theatre box, with the shivering hiss of the orchestra strings swelling in the background, getting louder, almost angry themselves, she could nearly pretend that they were alone. Somewhere else. Somewhere where the lemon verbena perfume of Mrs. Marberry stained the air and the rustle of sheets shifted beneath them.</p><p>Rosalind wished desperately she could go back to that. To be Mrs. Marberry again, a woman whom he had admired and respected, a woman he\u2019d loved.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t. There was truth again, so painful that she wanted the lie that he offered as he stroked his fingertips across her mouth.</p><p>Rosalind looked up. The naked desire in his eyes was fueled by anger. She didn\u2019t care. Not anymore.</p> <p>For a long heated moment they simply stared at each other. Lynch\u2019s face lowered, his eyes half shuttering and her breath caught. Yes. Please. Her hands fluttered near his chest, not quite daring to touch him.</p><p>He stopped, his face barely a half inch from hers, his breath cool on her moist lips. Just another inch... Lifting onto her toes, she reached for him.</p><p>\u201cI never make mistakes twice,\u201d he whispered harshly, his lips almost brushing hers. Then he pushed away, dark shadows flickering through his eyes. Looking at her as if she were a stranger. \u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it? To be played for a fool.\u201d</p><p>The ache in her chest solidified into something heavy. Rosalind slumped back against the wall, hope dying a short, painful death. This was the end. She\u2019d lost him. Truly lost him.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she whispered without heat.</p><p>\u201cNow that, I cannot claim.\u201d</p><p>Silence reigned throughout the theatre, thick with anticipation. The red velvet curtains swept back with a whisper, a circle of light highlighting a buxom shepherdess on the stage. As the opera singer opened her mouth to sing, a coughing eruption barked from the orchestral pit and the shepherdess flinched, glaring at the conductor before resuming.</p><p>Steam curled up from the orchestral pit. Some of the crowd clapped, no doubt thinking it an effect.</p><p>\u201cLynch,\u201d she called sharply.</p><p>He looked, then strode to the edge of the box, his white gloves curling over the balcony. Another coughing roar echoed in the theatre below. Steam poured from the gaping gilt mouths of the gargoyles that lined the walls and whispered out from beneath chairs. Several of the blue bloods exclaimed in surprise, looking beneath their seats curiously. One of them fell into a paroxysm of coughing, landing on his knees in the aisle.</p><p>It would be a massacre.</p><p>\u201cThey must have set a timer on them,\u201d Rosalind said, her gaze darting around the theatre.</p><p>Lynch shot her a hungry look, then swore under his breath. He ripped his coat off and threw it aside, tugging at the white bow tie around his throat until it eased. A pistol was tucked into the waistband of his trousers in the small of his back, but no other weapon seemed visible.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stepped up onto one of the plush velvet chairs, then leaped lightly to the edge of the rail. \u201cWhat I always do,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cMy duty.\u201d Glancing over his shoulder, he surveyed the crowd below and the curling wisps of steam. \u201cConsider yourself fortunate the mechs are the greater threat at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind swallowed. He was retreating behind that distant, efficient mask, pretending that nothing in the world was the matter\u2014steel walls closing around his already guarded heart. The taste of shame was so thick she almost choked on it.</p><p>The theatre looked like the bowels of hell, frightened screams echoing through the darkened chamber. The singer strode to the edge of the stage and began arguing fiercely with the conductor.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s weight shifted. Rosalind darted forward and grabbed the leg of his pants, making him look down in surprise at her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it even work?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to hit him she was so furious, but a part of her couldn\u2019t blame him. She\u2019d lied to him all along, why would he trust her?</p><p>\u201cIt works. Why would I send you in unprepared? I want to set you against the mechs, remember? I wanted you to destroy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did.\u201d With a tight little smile, he straightened and stepped to the edge of the rail. \u201cIt\u2019s in my coat.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind fetched it swiftly. He hesitated for a moment and she couldn\u2019t stop herself. \u201cIf I wanted to hurt you, I\u2019d push you off the damned balcony. Take it!\u201d</p><p>His white gloves curled around the tan leather. \u201cYou would be wise to use this opportunity to flee. If I see you again, I won\u2019t be so remiss in my duty.\u201d</p><p>Then he bowed tightly, a slight tilting of the head to an adversary\u2014to a stranger\u2014and stepped backward off the rail.</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>A frightened scream pierced the theatre.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d a woman called shrilly. \u201cRobert, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>And then, from further back, near the doors. \u201cWe\u2019re locked in!\u201d A man yelled. \u201cSomeone\u2019s locked the doors!\u201d</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s fingers tightened on the rail. A perfect opportunity for her to get away... Why then did the ache in her chest intensify? She didn\u2019t owe him anything. She didn\u2019t owe any of them, but it was Lynch she was suddenly frightened for.</p><p>Yes, run and you could get away, a little voice whispered. Run while you still have the chance...</p><p>A sweet scent drifted past her nose as the steam rose. The sound of coughing and choking began below. Rosalind hesitated.</p><p>Hundreds of blue bloods in the theatre. Lynch didn\u2019t stand a chance by himself. And knowing the man as she did, he wouldn\u2019t back away from the challenge. He\u2019d risk his own damn head at the best of times and now... Now, wasn\u2019t one of those.</p><p>Walk away now and she\u2019d never forgive herself.</p><p>Rosalind wrenched her reticule open, fighting through the contents until she could drag out her opera glasses. They\u2019d been modified with several different lenses: one that made everything black and white, so that she could view the world as a blue blood did; one that minimized distance, so that it seemed like she stood next to the soprano on the stage; and a phosphorus lens that amplified light, so that one could virtually see in the night, highlighting the faces in the audience below. That was for those theatregoers who were more interested in viewing what was going on around them in the darkened theatre than on stage.</p><p>Rosalind snapped the handle off the opera glasses and yanked at her skirts. Dragging her garter down her thigh, she looped it through the edges of the glasses, creating a makeshift pair of goggles. Yanking them over her head, the garter tugging tight at the back of her scalp, she slid the phosphor light-amplifying lens into place and peered over the rail.</p><p>The theatre was a green-tinted melee; ladies wilted in the aisles and blue bloods shoved their way toward the door as if escape could save them. One of them leaped onto the stage and rode the opera singer to the ground, her frightened screams piercing the air and then dying abruptly. The bright light from the stage left Rosalind momentarily blind.</p><p>Where was Lynch? Her vision blurred, her stomach fluttering with fear. She\u2019d felt this way before: the helplessness, the fear, the guilt... Chained in the darkness while Balfour knelt in front of her and told her that she had five minutes to save her husband.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Rosalind tore her skirts down the sides to free up her movement and then slid her legs over the balcony. Grabbing hold of the polished mahogany, she twisted and let her body fall, the weight dragging at her hands. It was barely a drop for Lynch, but if she landed this wrong, she\u2019d twist her ankle...or worse.</p><p>Glancing down, she let herself drop, catching at a gilt gargoyle at the base of the balcony. The goggles skewed perception of distance and she found her fingers slipping. Somehow she turned the fall into a drop, landing on the plush velvet seat of one of the chairs. Thrown off balance, she tumbled into the aisle and rolled out of the way as a blue blood rushed past.</p><p>The air was humid here, the taste of the sweet scent stronger. Shoving to her feet, she found herself almost hip-deep in a dense fog. There was no sign of Lynch anywhere. An enormous mob of blue bloods hammered at the heavy bronze doors, cringing away from the steam. They might not know what it was, but they could see the effects clearly enough. Several of them had already succumbed and were hunting debutantes through the seats.</p><p>A figure in a white shirt and gleaming silk waistcoat leaped lightly onto a chair back as though it were solid ground and tackled a maddened blue blood lord to the ground as his frightened prey escaped. Lynch. Her breath caught in her chest, but she hesitated, glancing again at the main doors. The steam was rising. If the blue bloods didn\u2019t get out of here, they\u2019d all be stricken with the blood thirst.</p><p>Rosalind had to trust that Lynch could take care of himself for the moment. Better one maddened blue blood than an entire theatre full of them.</p><p>Lifting her foot onto a chair, she slid her skirts up high enough to retrieve the ladies pistol she kept strapped to her thigh. It was barely the size of her palm, but the firebolt bullets within it were packed with enough chemical to make a blue blood\u2019s head explode on impact.</p><p>Shoving grimly into the pack of blue bloods, Rosalind made her way toward the doors, unafraid to use her elbows or wave the pistol in a few faces. Three men strained against the heavy brass doors, stripped to their shirtsleeves.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d she snapped, aiming the pistol. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously barred from the outside.\u201d</p><p>A clever move. Rosalind\u2019s gaze fell on the hinges and she took aim, then fired twice. The hinges, a large section of the door and half the door frame vanished in a small explosion of brass slivers and splinters.</p><p>Covering his face with his sleeve as he coughed, one of the men rammed his shoulder against the door. Someone had shoved a heavy bar through the handles on the other side. There was no way to open it, but somehow a pair of the blue bloods managed to pry the outer edge open just wide enough to slip through.</p><p>\u201cHurrah!\u201d one of the lords cheered, clapping her on the back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy thanks,\u201d another blue blood said sincerely, his pale blue eyes wide and frightened.</p><p>I didn\u2019t do it for you. But then she stopped, watching as he helped a frightened young woman through the narrow gap. She of all people should know that sometimes the monsters were just as human as the rest of the world.</p><p>Rosalind didn\u2019t bother to watch as the first of the crowd slipped through the gap. She had to find Lynch or, barring that, Garrett or Perry.</p> <p>Something caught her eye as she glanced around the darkened theatre. A tall man flashed through the green-tinted lens of the opera glasses, his rough-hewn face watching something in the chairs intently as he stalked forward.</p><p>Mordecai.</p><p>Her blood went cold when she realized who he was staring at.</p><p>Lynch ground his teeth together and wrenched the blue blood\u2019s head sharply to the right. A faint crack. Then all of the fight drained out of the man and the body slumped to the floor beneath him.</p><p>A thrall in buttercup yellow lay on the carpet between the seats, staring up at him in shock and horror. Blood splashed her skirts and there was a bite mark on her shoulder that would leave a scar. Her lips parted as the blue blood collapsed, then she scrambled to her hands and knees at his side.</p> <p>\u201cEpson?\u201d she whispered. Her hands began to shake and she looked up at Lynch with wide blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was either yourself or him,\u201d he replied, struggling to assuage the bloodlust that roared through his veins. The mask helped. Each breath tasted like sugared buns, but though it stirred his heartbeat, he could control himself.</p><p>\u201cLook out!\u201d a woman screamed.</p><p>Lynch spun low, ducking between the seats as a man behind him lifted a pistol. The shot went over his head, an enormous chunk of plaster exploding on the wall.</p><p>The pistol lowered and Lynch stared down the barrel. The man\u2019s face was rough with stubble, his eyes cold and merciless as he thumbed the hammer back. \u201cFare thee well, Sir Nighthawk.\u201d</p><p>A blur of cream silk came out of nowhere just as the pistol retorted. The pair of them tumbled out of view, but he knew who that had been as surely as he knew his own name.</p> <p>Rosa.</p><p>What the hell was she doing here? And where the hell did that bullet go? There was no sign of struggling, no sign of movement... The anger that had consumed him at her treachery lost its fire, a cold hard knot twisting in his chest.</p><p>Leaping over the row of chairs, Lynch skidded to a halt in the aisle. The stranger reached for the pistol on the ground with grim determination\u2014an enormous brute in a workman\u2019s shirt that strained over his enormous shoulders. Scrambling to her knees, Rosa launched herself past the stranger and kicked the pistol under the chairs.</p><p>\u201cCurse you,\u201d the stranger snarled, rolling to his feet. \u201cWho\u2019s damned side are you on?\u201d</p><p>Rosa straightened, her cool glance shifting past him to settle on Lynch. Just a moment, one that burned him right through. \u201cYou want to know what I am? Who I am? Then stay out of this.\u201d</p><p>The stranger shot him an uneasy look.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my brother, Mordecai?\u201d she asked.</p><p>So she had been telling the truth.</p> <p>If she thought he could stay out of this, she was mistaken. She\u2019d betrayed him, lied to him, made him think there was more between them than there was... But to watch her get hurt was beyond him.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t seen \u2019im,\u201d Mordecai retorted, turning so that he could keep them both in view. \u201cProbably the same place as mine.\u201d</p><p>Rosa\u2019s lips thinned. Her expression was tight and focused, so far removed from Mrs. Marberry\u2019s saucy cheer that Lynch suddenly realized he was seeing the reality of who she was. Not Mrs. Marberry. Perhaps not even Mercury. She stood with a self-assurance and determination that were but echoes of the other two women.</p><p>Herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut Mendici went for his gun. I was faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Darkness shadowed Mordecai\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut are you faster \u2019an me?\u201d</p><p>He lashed out with a meaty fist. Lynch leaped forward, then stopped as Rosa ducked beneath the blow as if she\u2019d expected it, her elbow locking Mordecai\u2019s arm in place as her metal hand chopped down in a brutal blow against the fellow\u2019s neck. Mordecai roared in pain and drove her into the seats with his shoulder in her midriff.</p><p>Rosa drove a knee up, bringing her elbow down between his shoulder blades. Each movement was sparse and economical, lacking the flamboyancy of someone who did this to prove his skill. She could have drawn this out, but instead she aimed for blows that would cripple and maim\u2014the swifter to finish this.</p><p>So quick. Mordecai staggered to his feet and Rosa hopped up lightly on the chair to get height, then kicked him in the face. Her skirt tore at the extension of her leg, high and graceful. Mordecai stumbled backward, blood dripping from his nose, but he didn\u2019t go down.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s vision dripped between color and black and white. The Doeppler Orbs had dissipated, but he didn\u2019t dare take off the mask. He wanted to step in, to end this, despite the fact that Rosa had matters well in hand. The darkness in him was a gathering storm. For a moment his vision dulled, fury riding through him. This was his woman. His. And he wanted to kill anyone who threatened her.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Just long enough for Mordecai to lash out.</p><p>Rosa staggered back several steps in the aisle, grinding her teeth against the blow. Lynch dug his fingernails into his palms, fighting every instinct he owned.</p><p>Mordecai swung the enormous metal fist of his right arm. Rosa blocked it with her own bio-mech hand, but the force staggered her back into the seats. Light from the stage backlit them as Lynch took a step closer then stopped.</p><p>Mordecai flexed his metal fingers. \u201cYou hit like a girl.\u201d</p><p>Rosa looked up, her eyes black as night. Kicking out, she drove her heel into his kneecap and Mordecai screamed as it shifted.</p><p>It should have been the end. But even Lynch was surprised when the huge mech lunged forward in an awkward lurch and drove his enormous body directly into Rosa.</p><p>For a moment they hovered on the edge of the orchestra pit, Rosa\u2019s wide, startled eyes meeting Lynch\u2019s and then they were gone. An enormous cacophony of noise drifted up.</p><p>\u201cRosa?\u201d Lynch scrambled to the edge of the pit.</p><p>She lay on her back amongst the strings section, wincing as she lifted her hip. Her groping hand found the edge of a brass cymbal and she clenched it in her mech fingers, the edge a dangerous weapon.</p><p>Mordecai groaned, flat on his face beside her. Rosa scrambled over him, driving a stockinged knee into his back as she jerked his head back by his hair and pressed the cymbal to his throat. It wasn\u2019t sharp but with enough force...</p><p>Lynch leaped down beside her, catching her wrist. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, black eyes gleaming. In that moment, he saw the coldness in her. She\u2019d have done it. Not because she wanted to, but because it was what she should do\u2014The next step to this.</p><p>A trained killer.</p><p>He recognized it, even as the coldness faded from her expression, replaced by breathless misery. Because of him. His hand slid from hers, unable to reconcile the woman he saw in front of him with the woman he\u2019d known.</p><p>\u201cI need him alive,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rosa let go of the cymbal, as if seeming to see it for the first time. Color flooded into her cheeks, emotion heating her expression. He couldn\u2019t read what she was thinking, but at least she was no longer the ruthless assassin he\u2019d caught a glimpse of.</p><p>She knew it too. Her dark eyes flickered to his, saw everything he couldn\u2019t hide and looked away. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Ripping out the strings on several violins, he knotted them together and then bound Mordecai\u2019s hands behind his back. The man groaned but didn\u2019t fight it. From the angle of his knee, he wouldn\u2019t be fighting anything soon. Then Lynch sat down and scraped his hand over his face.</p><p>What was he going to do?</p><p>Fury had died. He felt numb. Numb and so very, very old all of a sudden. The brightness he\u2019d felt whenever he\u2019d been around her had seemed to leech out of him, as if she\u2019d sucked the very soul from him.</p><p>I loved you. He looked at her, waiting patiently on her knees, with her hands pressed so tightly together, he felt as if he\u2019d somehow struck her a mortal blow. Dark lashes fluttered against her cheeks, but she couldn\u2019t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked hoarsely. \u201cYour brother? Only your brother?\u201d Was there ever anything for me?</p><p>She toyed with the fingertips of her gloves, a move so reminiscent of Mrs. Marberry that his lungs arrested. Then he shook it off. He couldn\u2019t keep looking for things that weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cI swear,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI only ever wanted to find my brother.\u201d</p><p>The dull truth of that made the fluttering hope in his chest die. He couldn\u2019t stay here anymore. Shoving to his feet, he buried everything deep inside. This was worse than that moment when he\u2019d realized that Annabelle had played him false. Perhaps it was the healing balm of all those years dulling the memory, or perhaps because he\u2019d finally dared to let himself feel something for someone, only to have it happen again.</p><p>Lesson learned.</p><p>Face expressionless, he yanked the groaning mech to his feet. At least he had something to show for this night\u2019s efforts, though he knew it wouldn\u2019t appease the prince consort. No, the Council wanted blood. Wanted the woman at his side.</p><p>He shoved the mech out of the pit. Jumping up, he caught the lip of it and hauled himself out, ignoring the way she watched him, as if waiting for him to speak.</p><p>He had no more words. Only one more night. And he couldn\u2019t see any way out of it for himself. No matter how much she had hurt him, he could never hand her over. His feelings, at least, had been true.</p><p>\u201cLynch,\u201d she whispered, looking up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know...I know nothing I say could ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t listening to her. A figure stepped slowly out of the darkness, coalescing into a tall man in the aisle, leaning on an ivory handled cane. Strands of white dulled his coppery hair until it was a faded strawberry blonde, and lines fanned out from the corners of his small, black eyes. He wore the crisp black of a long-tailed coat, the stark white of his shirt gleaming in the shadows. A typical uniform for any man attending the opera, he was so unremarkable that the eye begged to skip directly over him.</p><p>As he no doubt intended. Nobody looking at him would know that this man was one of the mighty powers behind the throne, second only to the prince consort in manipulating the events of the realm. Lips thinning, Lynch reached down and offered Rosa his hand.</p><p>He yanked her to her feet beside him, ignoring the man in the aisle. The prince consort could damn well wait. He\u2019d had enough of being played with for one night.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, blinking against the sudden glare of the spotlight.</p><p>Lynch ignored her, stepping down out of the light and meeting Balfour\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Balfour wasn\u2019t looking at him.</p><p>A sudden coldness seemed to trickle down his spine. Lynch had seen that expression before\u2014the faint smile, the piercing blackness of Balfour\u2019s narrow eyes as he\u2019d watched an enemy humbled before him.</p><p>Lynch might as well not even have been there. He followed Balfour\u2019s gaze, his hand reaching for the knife that was no longer at his hip.</p><p>Rosa hovered just out of the spotlight, so still, trembling, like a deer caught in the sight of the hunter\u2019s gun. Her dark eyes\u2014so similar, now he saw them together\u2014narrowed. A thousand emotions crossed her face. Hate, fear, and finally...rage. The cold tremor down Lynch\u2019s spine grew. If I see my father, I know I won\u2019t come to any harm... I cannot say the same for him.</p><p>Lynch moved before the muscles tensing in her legs could even shift her. He caught her around the waist, swinging her in tight against his own body. Rosa snarled, shoving at his chest. She didn\u2019t even look at him, fixated solely on Balfour.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>Lynch caught her back against his chest, his arms locking around her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He knew what she didn\u2019t. There was a shadow behind Balfour. One of his falcons no doubt, disguised as a bodyguard. The man wore black and hovered with seeming indifference in the darkness. Rosa would never get close enough, even if Balfour wasn\u2019t half as dangerous as he truly was.</p><p>For the first time, those dark eyes lifted from Rosa\u2019s face and Lynch met them. He tilted his chin up, extending a silent challenge. Rosa belongs to me... The thought took him unaware, but he didn\u2019t fight it. Not now. His own fractured pride was nothing compared to the dread that filled him.</p><p>\u201cYou have something of mine,\u201d Balfour murmured, his accent so haughtily elite that it spoke of years of breeding. A faint smile played over his lips. \u201cI thought you dead, Cerise. All these years I thought I had lost you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cerise.</p><p>Rosa jerked, fighting his grip. \u201cYou did! I don\u2019t belong to you anymore. I haven\u2019t for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made you,\u201d Balfour said gently. \u201cOne only had to watch that fight to realize that you have forgotten nothing that I have taught you.\u201d He took a step forward. \u201cI thought I saw you earlier tonight, but you are much changed. It wasn\u2019t until I saw you fight that I realized I wasn\u2019t merely feeling maudlin.\u201d</p> <p>Rosa launched herself at him. Lynch swung her back behind him, stepping between the pair of them. He shot her a dark look. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of this,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s more than you can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I can handle.\u201d</p><p>The disturbing truth was that she was probably right. If she was Balfour\u2019s\u2014if she\u2019d ever belonged to him\u2014then she had been created to be a weapon. His gaze dropped to her hands and memory flickered. My hands...don\u2019t touch my hands. What the hell had the bastard done to her?</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t let him get away,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLynch, please. He took everything from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made your choices,\u201d Balfour corrected.</p><p>Rosa glared at him. \u201cI chose Nathaniel. And you killed him because you couldn\u2019t bear for me to have loyalties to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>A slight twitch on that expressionless face. Balfour tugged slowly at his gloves, as if thinking. The move was dangerously reminiscent of Rosa. \u201cYou should have known not to push me in that mood. I had given you everything...\u201d His voice hardened. \u201cAnd you threw it back in my face for that naive fool.\u201d He clutched the gloves in one hand, finally meeting her eyes. \u201cI gave you a new hand in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chained me to the wall, gave me a sword, and told me I had five minutes to save him.\u201d Her eyes were wet with furious tears. She held up the gleaming steel of her fist. \u201cYou did this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did it to yourself,\u201d Balfour replied. \u201cI only gave you a choice. Him. Or me. You didn\u2019t have to take it.\u201d</p> <p>Somehow she\u2019d found a knife. \u201cYou broke your word. You said if I got there in time, you wouldn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Lynch held a hand out, warning her not to do this.</p><p>\u201cYou were late,\u201d Balfour finally said. \u201cI gave you five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Lynch saw the surge of fury in her eyes a second before she went for Balfour. He caught her. \u201cFifteen seconds!\u201d she screamed, kicking and fighting in his arms. \u201cFifteen seconds late! You cut his throat in front of me!\u201d</p><p>Balfour\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cYou only have yourself to blame, Cerise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Cerise! I\u2019m not! My name is Rosalind.\u201d</p><p>At that Balfour smiled. \u201cRosalind Hucker, the humanist\u2019s wife? That was only a role, my dear. A mission I gave you.\u201d He took another step closer, as if sensing that he\u2019d beaten her. She was crushed by grief and rage, unable to do what she wanted so desperately. And Balfour, the viper, knew it.</p><p>He reached for her.</p> <p>\u201cGive me the knife,\u201d Lynch murmured, taking it from her lax grip. He turned her, putting more distance between her and Balfour\u2019s outstretched hand.</p><p>The prince consort\u2019s spymaster noticed it. Those black, devil\u2019s eyes lit on him as if marking him as a potential adversary. \u201cDon\u2019t do something you\u2019ll regret, Lynch.\u201d</p><p>He still had her knife in his hand. Easing her into a chair, curled up upon herself, looking so much like a lost child at that point, Lynch slowly straightened. \u201cI never regret anything I do.\u201d</p><p>In the next second, he had Balfour\u2019s back to his chest, the knife against his throat. The falcon took a sharp step forward, then froze.</p><p>Lynch eyed him. \u201cDon\u2019t move or I\u2019ll cut his throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t kill me,\u201d Balfour murmured.</p><p>The pressure of the knife increased. \u201cDon\u2019t ever doubt me, you smug bastard. If I want to kill you, then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will the prince consort say?\u201d</p><p>Lynch leaned close enough to put his lips to the older man\u2019s ears. \u201cI don\u2019t see any witnesses, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are eyes on us,\u201d Balfour replied. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>His own little network of spies. Lynch glanced at Rosa beneath his lashes. She stared up at him with wide, tearstained eyes, as if she\u2019d never seen him before. As if he were something more than he was.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time for this. He could see the muscle working in the jaw of Balfour\u2019s man. Only so long before the falcon came for him.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She flinched, her gaze darting between the three men. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d A whisper for him alone.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he replied, the words emotionless.</p><p>Then she was gone, disappearing through the back of the stage, her footsteps echoing in the darkened theatre.</p><p>\u201cI never took you as a man who\u2019d ever show a weakness,\u201d Balfour murmured.</p><p>Lynch let him go and gave him a shove in the back. \u201cI never took you as one either.\u201d</p><p>Balfour didn\u2019t bother to rub the thin line of blood at his throat. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might have belonged to you once, but you\u2019ll never leash her again, Balfour. She was meant to fly free, and she\u2019ll never succumb to your will this time. She hates you. You pushed her too far.\u201d</p><p>Thought raced behind the spymaster\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe was the most like me.\u201d A faint tremor of pride traced his words.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lynch replied. \u201cShe was nothing like you. You would never have cut your own hand off to save another.\u201d He sheathed the knife at his belt before he was tempted to use it. \u201cLet her go. If you have any sense of feeling for her, then let her be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never have her either,\u201d Balfour said. He knew. Knew that tomorrow Lynch would be called before the Council to either present Mercury\u2014or himself.</p><p>Lynch nodded slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could intercede.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what price?\u201d Lynch replied, knowing Balfour would ask for her. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy me, Balfour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes you so very dangerous,\u201d Balfour replied. He glanced down at the groaning mech on the floor by Lynch\u2019s feet. \u201cYou do realize that this has nothing to do with the revolutionary?\u201d</p><p>Lynch paused.</p><p>\u201cYou have four hundred and fifty Nighthawks,\u201d Balfour murmured. \u201cAnd you insist on doing the right thing, no matter who you defy. Some might say that\u2019s a dangerous combination. Enough to make...certain people...fear you.\u201d</p><p>The prince consort. \u201cI would never have moved against him.\u201d</p><p>Balfour smiled. \u201cI know that. I never feared you, Lynch. You\u2019re predictable. I know which way you\u2019ll move before you even make it. Honor is such a weight around one\u2019s neck.\u201d He gave a terse nod, his gaze flickering to the door. And the pair of blue bloods who slid through it. Garrett and Perry. Balfour straightened, gesturing to his man to fall in beside him. \u201cEven if you could somehow find Mercury by the morning, there would come another demand. And another. Until you eventually gave him an excuse.\u201d Balfour saluted slowly. \u201cI will see you in the morning, then?\u201d</p><p>For a second, Lynch thought about using the knife. \u201cYou\u2019re attending?\u201d</p><p>With one last smile, Balfour gave him his back and smiled at Garrett and Perry as he passed them. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>Lynch scratched out several words with the pen, then his eyes slowly lifted. The candle flame in front of him danced as if someone had opened a door somewhere.</p><p>Putting the pen down, he rubbed at the tired line between his brows and glanced at the clock on the mantel. Three in the morning. There was no point trying to sleep. He needed to put his affairs in order and see that certain events took place as he willed them.</p><p>A slight whisper of sound.</p><p>He cocked his head. Silence. Still, the unnerving sensation of a presence filled the room, itching over his skin. Lynch shoved to his feet and crossed toward his bedroom on quiet feet, the candle in hand.</p><p>Turning the handle, he edged it open. The curtains to his bedroom fluttered in the breeze, the window cracked halfway. Before he even took a step into the room he knew; he could scent her, clean and fresh, stained with the faint sickly sweet scent of the orbs. And then he could see her, moonlight gilding that porcelain skin with a loving touch.</p><p>Rosa.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d he whispered harshly, bringing the candle up.</p><p>Rosa lifted her chin, staring at him as if she herself didn\u2019t know. Long tendrils of coppery hair clung to her shoulders and hung around her tearstained face, the torn scraps of the gorgeous dress she\u2019d worn still clinging to her legs. With her red hair and pale skin, she wasn\u2019t the type of woman made for crying, but there was something about the defiance in her eyes that made his breath catch. \u201cI wanted... I needed to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Lynch swallowed the hard ball of emotion in his throat and strode past her to the window, placing the candle on the tallboy beside his bed. \u201cI believe everything that needed saying was said.\u201d He peered out, hunting the shadows for hidden eyes. \u201cDo you think I let you escape for nothing? Damn it, woman, I have no doubt Balfour has eyes on the guild. He\u2019ll be expecting me to do something tonight.\u201d</p><p>Slamming the window shut, he drew the curtains across with a harsh jerk and took a steadying breath. Hell, he hadn\u2019t expected her here. His fingers trembled slightly on the curtains. A part of him didn\u2019t want to face her.</p><p>\u201cWhy tonight?\u201d she asked. A note of doubt crept into her voice. \u201cDid he threaten you? What did he say?\u201d The rustle of skirts swept closer. Then stopped. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt you, did he?\u201d</p><p>Would she care? His fingers tightened on the sill, then he slowly pushed away and looked at her.</p><p>A faint flush of color crept up her cheeks and her gaze dropped. Toying with the tips of her gloves, her shoulders slightly hunched, she managed to draw in a deep breath. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have let him live.\u201d Quiet words. \u201cIf you\u2019d let me go, I could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotten yourself killed,\u201d he replied, with just a touch too much vigor. Hell, if she knew what she was doing to him... His hungry gaze ran over her slender figure and despite himself, his body yearned for her. Just one touch. He knew if he went to her, she\u2019d turn her face up to his eagerly, but would it mean anything? He didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d thought himself a great judge of character once, but now she\u2019d shattered his perceptions with the web of lies she\u2019d woven. He couldn\u2019t see the truth anymore and it made him doubt each and every one of her actions.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here tonight?\u201d</p><p>Rosa shrank a little, as if the weight of his gaze drove her shoulders down. \u201cI wanted to say...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d That last was a whisper. \u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2014I had to see you.\u201d</p><p>Running his hand over the back of his neck, he crossed to the liquor decanter and poured himself a generous glass of blud-wein. Hell.</p><p>She took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cI know you won\u2019t believe me. I can\u2019t blame you for that, but I wish\u2014I need you to know that I never meant any of this to happen.\u201d She took a step closer, her skirts swishing. \u201cI\u2019m not good at this. I never have been. It was easier when I was Mercury, easier...as Mrs. Marberry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier to lie?\u201d he asked, tossing back the blud-wein.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all a lie.\u201d</p><p>Lynch put the glass down with a ringing sound. He turned\u2014and then wished he hadn\u2019t. Those vulnerable eyes burned him. He wanted to believe her. Gods, he hungered for it.</p><p>Just let go, whispered his darker side. Take what she\u2019s offering. You\u2019ll never get another chance.</p><p>And a part of him hated her for that, for the fact that his heart and body still wanted what it wanted, regardless of her betrayal.</p><p>\u201cYou should go.\u201d</p><p>His quiet words lifted her head so sharply he might as well have slapped her. Determination stared back at him. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t. I know that I lied to you. I know you\u2019ll never forgive me, but please, what I felt for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stomach it anymore. Turning away, he crossed to the grate and stared into the ashes. Her letter was still there, a forlorn crumpled note in the powdery fine ash. \u201cIt meant nothing. I\u2019ll forget it.\u201d His own lie. \u201cAnd no doubt you will too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lynch glanced over his shoulder darkly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? Which part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it. You want me. I know you do\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned then. His body was as tight as a fucking violin string. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can make you want me,\u201d she declared, giving a little shimmy that slipped her capped sleeves over her shoulders. Her bodice softened, her plump breasts threatening to spill. \u201cYou wanted me once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether I want you or not, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I don\u2019t even know who you are!\u201d he snapped. \u201cI thought that I loved a woman, but she didn\u2019t exist. I\u2019ve had enough of betrayal to last me a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Rosa flinched. But she didn\u2019t back down. Instead, her fingers went to the bodice and the little row of buttons that ran down the front of her finely tailored corset-dress. The light gleamed off the metal of her left hand; she\u2019d taken her gloves off, no doubt to force him to admit to himself that she wasn\u2019t Mrs. Marberry.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know me?\u201d Rosa asked. \u201cThen so be it. I was a thief. On the streets as a child. Then Balfour\u2019s spy and later...later his assassin. I let my husband die because I couldn\u2019t save him in time and I can\u2019t tell my brothers how much I love them because I never have the words. Not when it means something.\u201d Licking dry lips, she continued, \u201cI\u2019m not good, I\u2019m not kind, I don\u2019t seem to be able to feel such things that other people do\u2014as if I can lock a box inside my mind and hide all of the...emotions inside it. But I can\u2019t do that now. Not with you. I hate feeling like this. I hate being so uncertain. I hate the guilt, knowing that I was wrong, that I should have told you.\u201d She struggled with a button, fingers trembling, cursing under her breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. All I have is this, to show you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your husband,\u201d he said, a brutal reminder of the one man she had loved. \u201cYou might have fooled him, but I won\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d</p> <p>Another arrow in the dark. Her skin blanched, still her trembling fingers began tugging at the little row of buttons. And no matter what he said, he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. That was the mistake I made. Pretending to be someone that I\u2019m not. Twice.\u201d Uncertainty stilled her fingers. \u201cI loved him, but...he didn\u2019t know me. Not until the end, when Balfour told him what I was, what I\u2019d done.\u201d Sorrow shadowed her eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to him. I never got that chance. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here now.\u201d She stiffened, as if waiting for a blow. \u201cYou said that your heart belonged to me, but you never truly knew me. All the...the ugliness... Now you do. And...if you want me to go, to truly go away, all you have to do is tell me that you don\u2019t love me. Tell me that I\u2019m not the woman you cared for. That there\u2019s nothing in me that you could ever love.\u201d</p><p>Her whisper cut him, her fingers trembling on the next button as she stared at him and waited for the guillotine to fall.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do it. He wanted so much to believe her. He wanted her too much.</p><p>Two steps and Lynch was in front of her, his hands reaching for her face. Cursing himself. Cursing the weakness in him that made him desperately long for her words to be true. The silk of her hair slid around his hand as he cradled the base of her skull and then her mouth met his and he was lost.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he whispered, yanking her hard against him. \u201cRosa\u2014I wish\u2014\u201d Her tongue, hot and wet. Her hands grabbing him by the shirt so that he couldn\u2019t get away. \u201cI wish I could give you forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take tonight.\u201d</p><p>Then her mouth met his and all thought scattered, except for the desperate desire to have her.</p><p>For a second Rosalind thought she\u2019d failed, that he would turn away, not want her. But even as her lungs deflated he was moving toward her, his mouth swooping down to capture hers. The kiss was hard, desperate. For the first time, nothing lay between them and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from clutching at him, her heart thundering in her ears and hope rearing its head.</p><p>He wanted her. Despite what she\u2019d done. Despite her lies, the betrayal... Knowing everything that he knew about her, he still wanted her. This was what she\u2019d never gotten a chance to see in Nate\u2019s eyes. Instead, he\u2019d died before she could dare ask if he could ever forgive her.</p><p>Forgiveness might not be so swiftly earned, not with Lynch. She\u2019d hurt him so badly... But at least this was a start. At least he hadn\u2019t thrown her out the window like she probably deserved.</p><p>Rosalind drew back for a breath, gasping, her fingers darting under his shirt. Greedy. So greedy for his skin, his body... To show him how she felt when she couldn\u2019t find the words. He slid a hand through her hair, tilting her head back, and then his cool lips were running down her throat, the feel of it echoing between her thighs. Her back hit the wall, his other hand cupping her lush bottom and then she could feel the hard edge of his cock pressing against her stomach.</p><p>Grabbing the back of her thigh, he dragged her knee up, pressing hotly between her legs. Rosalind moaned, her nails sinking into the smooth skin of his back, trailing up the long, lean muscles. Somehow, her hand found his, then she was pressing it lower, over her abdomen and down, hot desire racing through her veins.</p><p>A soft gasp as he found her, wet and ready, his fingers sliding between the slit in her drawers. Her gasp or his, she didn\u2019t know. Her head dropped back, nails digging into him as she bit her lip. He knew exactly where to touch her, exactly how to make her scream. But then this was the only thing she had never lied to him about. He knew her here. Knew every little place to stroke to drive her crazy.</p> <p>Hard fingers sank inside her, his thumb stroking hard over the nub at the heart of all this pleasure. Rosalind couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t see. Her body moving against his, desperate for this, to assuage the ache in her chest, and now the ache between her thighs. It rose with choking swiftness\u2014maybe because she wanted this so much, maybe out of sheer relief that he was touching her, giving her what she needed\u2014and then it overwhelmed her with shocking suddenness.</p><p>Her cry echoed in the room, her body convulsing around his fingers as she clung to him, trying to ride it out. Somehow this was purer and sweeter than anything she\u2019d ever felt before, as if the purging of all that emotion that had been choking her let her body sing.</p><p>Teeth rasped over her throat, biting at the soft skin over the vein. Rosalind\u2019s eyes shot wide, knowing what he wanted, knowing the dark hungers that drove him. But if she dared ask him to trust her, then she had to give him the same trust. He wouldn\u2019t force this on her, wouldn\u2019t take directly from the vein. He never had.</p><p>Her eyes widened further, fear thick in her throat at the idea that sprang to mind. She couldn\u2019t. Could she?</p><p>The thin stiletto rasped in her hair. The more she tried not to think of it, the more she couldn\u2019t help herself. It terrified her. To give such control to another person, even Lynch. Her heart throbbed in her chest. Lynch lifted his head, his eyes half-lidded and dazed, his cheeks flushed with desire. He\u2019d felt her withdrawal and looked to find the cause.</p><p>Rosalind grabbed a handful of his hair and kissed him, trying not to panic. She couldn\u2019t let him go. Not now. Fingertips trailing down his chest, she felt the hard press of the hilt against the base of her skull.</p><p>\u201cRosa?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She had the knife in her fingers before she could even think about it. Swallowing hard, she caught his own hand and wrapped his fingers around the hilt.</p><p>Lynch froze. His smoky gray eyes met hers, heat spilling through them until they were black with fierce need. His gaze dropped to her throat, his lips parting with a little quivering jerk. He wanted it. So much. Too much.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he tried to breathe through it and she watched the harsh emotions chase each across his face. \u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNo, you\u2019re frightened... I won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She dragged his hand to her throat and pressed the edge of the blade against the throbbing vein. Their eyes met. \u201cI want you to claim me. I want to be yours.\u201d</p><p>Another shuddering moment. Then the hot sting as the blade sliced through skin. It clattered to the floor and then his hands cupped her arse and his mouth closed over her throat as her hips nestled around his.</p><p>The surge of feeling shot straight between her legs, igniting her body. Each pull of his mouth, each hot swallow tugged on her clit as if his mouth were there instead. She came, clutching at his shoulders, crying out, her hips rubbing against his, desperate, desperate now to get him inside her... Hands sliding between them, tugging at his breeches and then he was free, the hot surge of his cock filling her hands, rubbing against her wet-slick skin. She came again, crying out, whimpering... It felt like her heartbeat sped up, beating in time to his as his mouth took her blood into his own body, his own veins.</p><p>One hard thrust. Rosalind\u2019s eyes went wide, drugged, candlelight melting into a puddle around them. Firm hands cupped her breast, sliding the buttons free, the very same ones she\u2019d struggled with... Then his clever fingers slid over her nipple, tugging, teasing, his hips pumping as he thrust deep within her.</p><p>A rasped curse. Then Lynch was licking at her throat to close the wound, his hips thrusting her against the wall with furious desperation. His mouth caught hers, and she could taste the coppery tang of her own blood as their tongues clashed.</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s heart thundered in her ears. I love you. She screamed the words inside, where he couldn\u2019t hear, her eyes flooding with heat. Why couldn\u2019t she do this? Why was it so hard to give so much of herself? It shouldn\u2019t be this way. He deserved so much better, but she was so afraid, afraid that a part of him would look at her and not see anything deserving of those three little words.</p><p>\u201cGod, Rosa... Need you so much...\u201d He gasped, fingers digging into her hips, his face tightening with fierce need. \u201cTaste...so damned good...\u201d</p><p>She cupped his face and kissed him, feeling the pressure building within him, within her. She wanted to explode, but she had to get this out before it was too late.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she blurted, a harsh whisper in the gasping stillness. Not what she\u2019d intended but...enough...</p><p>He kissed her. Hard. Capturing the words on her lips as he drove her into the patterned wallpaper. Fingers slid between them and then she was lost, crying out, anchored only by the feel of his hands on her hips as his body shuddered against her, a harsh cry torn from his own throat.</p><p>Heat spilled within her. She held him through it, his face tucked against her shoulder and her hands sliding through his hair. Gasping, trying to catch her breath again, she felt each tiny shudder as it went through him.</p><p>Hers.</p><p>She understood then why he\u2019d longed for her blood. This was the same. Not to own him, not to bind him to her with ties he couldn\u2019t break, but to exist in that moment where the pair of them were one. To give\u2014and to receive.</p><p>To be claimed.</p><p>Completely and utterly.</p><p>She knew that there was still so much between them, so many damned words that hadn\u2019t been said, but for the first time tonight, she felt a tiny little bud of hope swell in her chest. Resting her chin on his shoulder, she pressed a small kiss against his throat.</p><p>She was never going to let him go now.</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>Lynch rolled to the edge of the bed and sat up, scrubbing his hands over his face. Soft dawn light crept through the window and he could hear pigeons cooing on the roof above.</p><p>Panic surged through him and he dragged his shaking hand down over his mouth. So much he hadn\u2019t been able to get through last night. And so much he had...</p><p>He glanced down, at the slumbering woman on the bed beside him. Rosa\u2019s warmth lingered in the sheets, her breath shifting the cotton sheet that wrapped precariously around her, caressing the lush curves of her bottom. His heart stuttered in his chest. The memories of last night hammered at him like pinpricks of image shoved red-hot into his brain. Everything she\u2019d admitted to, everything she\u2019d said, those last whispered words he\u2019d pretended not to hear... The ones that did so much damage to his heart.</p><p>He wanted them to be true. Wanted this to at least be worth it. But could he trust them? Trust her?</p><p>The answer to that was easy; if he believed that they were true, then he wouldn\u2019t even be questioning it.</p><p>Lynch felt utterly drained. Judging by the clock on the mantel, he had only three hours before he was due to present himself before the court. His chest caught again, panic clutching at him with greedy fingers. He couldn\u2019t breathe. His lungs simply refused to open. Reaching out, he grabbed for Rosa\u2019s hand, felt her warm fingers tighten around his as she stirred with a soft moan. He didn\u2019t want to be alone. Not this morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow he sucked in a breath. It was easier, with her hand in his, but not enough. Lynch turned to her, sliding his other hand down over her bottom as he kissed her shoulder. Her eyelashes fluttered against her cheeks as he kissed her, stole her own breath.</p><p>This was good-bye. Those dark eyes met his as she woke and then she slid her iron hand into his hair and yanked his mouth to hers as if she felt the need, the fury that rode him. \u201cJasper?\u201d she whispered, but he didn\u2019t wish to speak. Not now.</p><p>He pushed her onto her back and came over her desperately. The heat of her body drove away the last of the panic as he thrust into her with fierce need. Each soft gasp from her lips anchored him, fighting off the last of his fear. If he could protect her, if she lived because of his sacrifice, then that would be enough.</p> <p>It was fast, furious, desperate. And when it was over, she smiled up at him with dazed eyes, one hand still linked with his, and those iron fingers drifting tenderly over his cheek. His heart squeezed again and he buried his face in her shoulder, holding her beneath him as he fought one last wave of panic.</p><p>\u201cLynch?\u201d she murmured, shifting as if to look at him. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>His throat was dry. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Lynch wrapped his arms around her and shifted her so that her body tucked into the curve of his hip, his face buried in that glorious red hair. So that she couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She brought their linked hands to her lips and pressed a kiss to his white knuckles. \u201cI think I will,\u201d she murmured, in her husky Mrs. Marberry voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve quite worn me out.\u201d</p><p>Her soft laughter echoed through her chest as he held her. For a moment all felt right with the world. He breathed in the scent of her hair, so familiar and yet so uniquely hers.</p> <p>The minutes stretched out, each tick of the clock sounding like the clang of a jail cell. Rosa softened in his arms, her breathing becoming slow and even. He wanted to stay here all day. Forever. But the hour hand struck nine and he knew there was too much to do if he wanted to protect her.</p><p>Untangling himself from her body, he slipped from the bed with careful grace and made his way to the door.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say good-bye.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even leave a note, though he lingered over his desk for long moments in indecision.</p><p>In the end, they\u2019d said everything that needed to be said.</p><p>There was a knock at the door. Rosalind lifted her head off the pillow, feeling the aching bruise of that fall into the orchestra pit. She winced, then realized she was alone.</p> <p>Jerking the sheet up to her chest, she looked around, her heart hammering a little faster. There was no sign of Lynch and from the sunlight streaming in through the window, she\u2019d slept half the morning away. Little wonder, what with the emotional and physical exertion of the night before.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Marberry?\u201d Perry called. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>Scraping her hair behind her ear, she called out an assent. Her eyes felt tight and puffy. Vanity compelled her to admit it was probably a good thing Lynch had left early.</p><p>Or was it?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help feeling nervous. So much had happened between them in the last day, and yet not all of it had been resolved. He\u2019d forgiven her? Hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Perry swept in with Rosalind\u2019s green dress from the previous afternoon over her arm. Dark circles lingered beneath her cerulean eyes; she looked almost as poorly as Rosalind felt.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Perry said, thrusting the dress toward her. \u201cGarrett said it was time for you to get up. He wishes to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>The abrupt tone of her voice made Rosalind\u2019s chest tighten. They didn\u2019t know. They couldn\u2019t. \u201cIs Lynch here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs he...did he want to see me?\u201d</p> <p>Perry stiffened, her gaze darting to Rosalind\u2019s\u2014then away. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Perry left her to dress. Rosalind made swift work of the gown and stockings, butterflies starting to tickle in her abdomen. Instinct\u2014ever a curse\u2014was starting to make her nervous. Something was wrong. Perry had been warming to her last night but this morning they might as well have been strangers.</p><p>When she jerked open the door to Lynch\u2019s bedchambers, she found Garrett drumming his fingers on the desk in Lynch\u2019s office. The fingers stopped, his gaze examining her with an obliqueness that wasn\u2019t normal. One could always gauge Garrett\u2019s thoughts by the expressions that flickered across his face. There was no sign of his usual, slightly self-mocking smile as he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Rosalind asked.</p><p>He eased to his feet, white lines straining around his mouth. \u201cMrs. Marberry.\u201d Those blue eyes were watchful. \u201cI\u2019ve been instructed to escort you to the dungeons.\u201d</p><p>The blood drained out of her face. \u201cWhat?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t. Not Lynch. Damn it, last night had to have meant something. She\u2019d given him everything, until she was almost wrung dry. Unless...she had hurt him so badly that she had destroyed even the glimmer of affection that he\u2019d had for her.</p><p>Garrett gestured her in front of him. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t break. Not here. Not in front of Garrett or any of the Nighthawks she might see on the trip to the cells below. Her vision white with shock, she preceded him through the door, seeing none of the twists and turns they took. All too soon, she was standing in front of what looked like a pair of doors made entirely of interlocking brass cogs.</p><p>Garrett stepped past, his hands darting over the display. Each cog gave a click as he turned them, though she couldn\u2019t fathom by which order he moved them. Then he stepped to the side and pressed a small button concealed beside the doors.</p><p>The whole display began to move, the cogs in the middle beginning to grind, then each subsequent cog turning and shifting the others at its peripheral until the whole door was a whirling rotation. A heavy clunk sounded within. Then another. And a final, dull throb that sounded as if it were low within the door. The cogs ground to a halt, and then the thin crack in the middle began to separate.</p><p>\u201cA clockwork door,\u201d Garrett murmured. \u201cYou must move the pieces correctly the first time, or it grinds to a halt and can\u2019t be resurrected until the entire thing is reset. Lynch and Fitz came up with the idea. Nobody can get in without the first piece of the puzzle\u2014and nobody can get out.\u201d</p><p>The doors parted to reveal the inside of an elevation chamber. Rosalind swallowed hard and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cHe has an extraordinary mind,\u201d she replied quietly.</p><p>Garrett stepped beside her, then pressed the button for the doors to close. The boxcar began to move, the steely rasp of the heavy winch sounding above her.</p><p>\u201cHe has an extraordinary heart,\u201d he corrected, shadows darkening his vision. \u201cHe told me who you are and what you had done.\u201d</p><p>The words were polite; the tone held a core of steel however.</p><p>Each jerk of the elevation chamber reminded her that there was no way out. Worrying at her gloves, she tried to keep her breathing steady. Already little white dots danced in her vision. \u201cDoes he intend to speak to me?\u201d</p><p>She could feel him looking at her, his gaze burning through her. \u201cYou puzzle me, Mrs. Marberry\u2014or whatever your name is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosalind. My name is Rosalind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosalind.\u201d He seemed to be considering something. \u201cI\u2019m not quite certain if you are playing games or if you truly do care. I thought you were rather enamored of him.\u201d</p><p>She kept silent, despising the probing nature of his question.</p><p>He let out a low breath. \u201cAs impenetrable as a damned sphinx. I see. You don\u2019t give a damn what I think of you, do you?\u201d</p><p>The boxcar came to a halt, its doors opening to reveal another set of clockwork doors. Rosalind met his gaze. \u201cNot at all, sir.\u201d After all, she\u2019d been hated and feared and worse in her time. She\u2019d grown used to the sensation, to the thick callus that seemed her only form of protection.</p><p>Or had been once.</p><p>The only one whose opinion mattered wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Garrett turned several of the cogs in the door\u2014she tried to watch this time\u2014and the mechanism swept into a whirling, dizzying dance again.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t often keep prisoners,\u201d he said, gesturing her through the doors. He wouldn\u2019t stop looking at her, as if trying to puzzle out some mystery. \u201cOnly the five of us who make up Lynch\u2019s Hand know of the existence of this one\u2014and have the code to the doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to suggest that there\u2019s no one here to help me escape?\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the middle of the corridor, a row of gaslight\u2019s gleaming on the shiny black leather of his body armor. A moment of surprise, then he bowed his head. \u201cMy apologies. I hadn\u2019t realized that you don\u2019t understand his intentions. We\u2019re not here to lock you in a cell, Rosalind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough your opinion differs from his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. Again he seemed on the verge of saying something, then shook his head with a frustrated expression. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that I was correct. I\u2019m hoping that some part of you did care for him. Here.\u201d He stepped toward one of the cell doors. They were all made of interlocking clockworks.</p><p>Garrett set one in motion and stepped back to wait. Rosalind held her breath, watching the cogs glisten and gleam as they ground slowly through their transition. Whatever was on the other side of this door was going to change her life, she was certain of it.</p><p>The locks clicked. The doors began to part.</p><p>Rosalind found herself staring into a small, dark cell with no windows, a single gaslight shining down on the occupant within. The boy sitting on the single cot winced at the sudden brightness, his arm held up before his eyes. Rosalind\u2019s heart dropped through the floor of her stomach. She knew him\u2014knew him so well she\u2019d practically been his mother.</p><p>\u201cJeremy,\u201d she whispered. There were hands on her shoulders, helping to hold her up. Clinging to Garrett, she blinked, trying to orientate herself, but the world was still spinning and she had the feeling it would never stop.</p><p>\u201cRosa?\u201d Jeremy lowered his arm, the color blanching out of his face. He jerked to his feet, horror painting itself across his expression. \u201cDamn it, I wouldn\u2019t tell \u2019em nothing. What happened? How\u2019d they get you?\u201d</p><p>She took a step forward. Then another. Then he was in her arms, and she was crushed against his chest, her hot tears staining the rough cambric shirt someone had provided for him. So big now. Tall and lanky and pale for lack of the sun.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. You\u2019re...not hurt.\u201d Clutching at his arms, she felt his chest and shoulders, dashing at her tears with her gloves. She couldn\u2019t stop crying. He was real. He was there. All this time... all of the hours she\u2019d spent worrying and searching and he was alive.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d A hiccup took her. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>He shot a glare over her shoulder. \u201cThey got me just after the tower. The Nighthawk\u2019s been hammerin\u2019 me with questions, but I swear I didn\u2019t tell him naught. He don\u2019t come so often anymore. Only this mornin\u2019. Didn\u2019t say much but he knew me name this time. Didn\u2019t figure he had you.\u201d His hands caught her upper arms. \u201cWhat happened? How\u2019d you get nicked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d She looked at Garrett, who lounged in the door with his lashes half-masted over his eyes. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI escort you to the exit and you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d she asked, wiping her face. Surely there couldn\u2019t be any more tears left. But with her fingers clenched through her brother\u2019s, she felt it bubbling up again: anger, joy, disbelief... How? How had this happened? She could remember that night in the alleyway and Lynch\u2019s reticence once he discovered her brother was a humanist.</p><p>He\u2019d known.</p><p>Known and promised her he would do his best to give her brother back to her. No doubt he\u2019d fought his own instincts, knowing that Jeremy had been part of the bombing and wondering if it were the right thing to do. Yet, he\u2019d still given her what she longed for the most.</p><p>Her heart swelled...and broke. Despite her treachery, he\u2019d given her the one thing she desired most in the world.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lynch?\u201d she asked. \u201cWould I... Could I thank him. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to court.\u201d Garrett pushed away from the door. \u201cI\u2019d suggest we get your brother out of here. Quickly. Before someone with less nobler intentions than I realizes what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>She hurried behind him, dragging Jeremy in her wake. \u201cI thought you said only his Hand knew his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Garrett ushered them into the elevation chamber. \u201cYou have to remember that he took us off the streets or the execution block and gave us a way to live. Not all of us think you should go unpunished for this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The doors shut and the elevation chamber started upwards. \u201cByrnes,\u201d she guessed.</p><p>\u201cByrnes is our biggest problem,\u201d Garrett admitted. \u201cThough not the only one. Doyle thinks you ought to be whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fortunate that you obey Lynch\u2019s commands still.\u201d</p> <p>He met her eyes then. \u201cI\u2019m still undecided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosa?\u201d Jeremy asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She stilled him with a hand. Urgency settled heavily on her shoulders. She had to get Jeremy out of here. Then she could deal with Lynch. This was all starting to confuse her. Her nerves\u2014which should have settled\u2014were stretching tighter. What wasn\u2019t Garrett telling her?</p><p>Once they reached the ground level of the guild headquarters, Garrett ushered them down several dark corridors and halls. She kept expecting Nighthawks to leap out from behind each corner, but the halls were strangely silent.</p><p>\u201cPerry\u2019s keeping the others busy,\u201d Garrett murmured, pausing before a heavy-set steel-bound door. When he swung it open, sunlight flooded in, revealing the back entrance to the guild and the alley behind it.</p> <p>Rosalind\u2019s spirits lifted immediately. She looked at Jeremy and met his astonished gaze before giving his hand a tremulous squeeze. She was free and Jeremy was safe. Jack and Ingrid would be so happy. And she\u2014her elation died slightly.</p><p>She would speak to Lynch. Last night had to have meant something, didn\u2019t it? She wouldn\u2019t let this be the end of it.</p><p>Jeremy dashed through the door, tugging her after him. \u201cCome on, Rosa. Let\u2019s get the hell outta here.\u201d</p><p>But she paused in the alley and glanced back at Garrett, Jeremy\u2019s fingertips sliding through hers.</p><p>\u201cTell him that I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank him for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Garrett folded his arms over his chest and stared at her. This was what he\u2019d been waiting for, she suddenly suspected, from the hungry, desperate look he gave her.</p> <p>The hairs along the back of her neck lifted. Something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>That stare. As if it tried to peel the protective layers off her. \u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t tell you. But I think you should know. There was a price for this, Rosalind. And he is going to pay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What did he do? What price?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Council gave him three weeks to find Mercury. Or he would share Mercury\u2019s fate.\u201d</p><p>The world went white around her. She thought she staggered, but she wasn\u2019t sure. No. No! \u201cWhen?\u201d A whisper.</p><p>\u201cToday.\u201d Garrett was merciless. \u201cIt was him. Or it was you.\u201d</p><p>And that was when she finally noticed the gleaming epaulets of the Guild Master on his own shoulders.</p> <p>Twenty-six</p><p>Rosalind had never fainted in her life, but she came close that afternoon in the alley. Garrett\u2019s words took her like a harpoon in the chest.</p><p>It was him. Or it was you.</p><p>Stupid, stupid man! This was exactly what she\u2019d been afraid of. Not of loving\u2014it was far too late for that, it had been for days\u2014but of being loved so much that another man lost his life before hers.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do this. Not again. Clapping her hand over her mouth, she groaned in pain as she bent at the waist. Her fault. All her cursed fault. She couldn\u2019t watch another man die for her. She wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Don\u2019t be weak. Lynch needed her to be strong, especially now.</p><p>Biting on her fist, she swallowed the hard bubble of emotion in her throat. Distantly, she realized that Jeremy was patting her back, his voice rising in increments as he demanded to know what was wrong with her. And she was suddenly so grateful that he was alive and well\u2014that Lynch had given him to her. Yet another debt she owed him.</p><p>Her brother was safe. She\u2019d done what she came to do. And Jack... Ingrid... It was their turn to look after him.</p><p>She looked at Garrett, throat dry and hoarse. Focus. \u201cWhat are you going to do to free him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Garrett shifted. \u201cIf it were just I, I\u2019d take the chance. But I\u2019ve had it explained to me very clearly that if I make one move, then every Nighthawk under my command will be cut down by metaljackets. All the young lads in training... Doyle, Byrnes... Perry.\u201d That last name seemed an oversight but the way his voice softened, she knew exactly which face he was picturing now. \u201cI can\u2019t undo this. Not without starting a war between the Nighthawks and the Echelon. Besides, I\u2019m running out of time. They threatened to execute him today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been gone?\u201d she asked, thinking furiously.</p><p>\u201cAn hour. I came to wake you as soon as he left.\u201d</p><p>Of course. Because Garrett\u2019s hands were tied and hers were not. She knew what he was asking. All of this had been a ploy to test her feelings for Lynch, the length she would go to save his life.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go home to Jack,\u201d she said to Jeremy, the words sounding as if they came from mechanical lips. \u201cThere is something that I have to do.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy grabbed her hands, panicked. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s goin\u2019 on, Rosa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister is going to help me rescue Lynch,\u201d Garrett replied, his shoulders slumping in relief.</p><p>Jeremy shook his head. \u201cAw, no. Ain\u2019t no way I\u2019m letting you do this. You\u2019re goin\u2019 up against the Echelon, ain\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cIf I need to, I\u2019ll have Garrett put you back in the cell until it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTill what\u2019s done?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell him. Her eyes met Garrett\u2019s and she glared at him. Don\u2019t you dare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to free Lynch,\u201d she said. His life or mine. Curse the man. Curse him for a fool. Why the devil hadn\u2019t he told her what he was planning? Or had he suspected this might be her reaction?</p><p>Of course not. He\u2019d doubted her, doubted everything that lay between them. But the only reason he wouldn\u2019t have told her was if he was afraid that she hadn\u2019t been lying about how she felt.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Jeremy demanded, his eyes narrowing. He looked so mature all of a sudden\u2014a man grown, not a boy. Then his eyes lost their worldly look. \u201cAnd why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if I give them what they want,\u201d she suggested, pasting a smile on her lips. \u201cOr some part of it. We captured Mordecai last night. In the wake of the opera attack, I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll be after blood. We give them what they want.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be enough\u2014not if Lynch hadn\u2019t tried it himself. But Jeremy\u2019s narrowed eyes lost their edge. He believed her. She almost choked on the lie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Jack what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t nearly as easy to fool as Jeremy. Rosalind kept the smile on her mouth. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cGive him...give him my love. And Ingrid too.\u201d Reaching out, she stroked her hand over Jeremy\u2019s arm and the fine red hairs there. Tell them to forgive me. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to have you back.\u201d At that she couldn\u2019t help herself. She dragged him into her arms and hugged him tight, the smile dying as she pressed her face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d Jeremy muttered, clearing his throat and shooting Garrett an embarrassed glance.</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cYou\u2019d best go. Before one of the other Nighthawks realizes you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch Jack,\u201d he warned again. Perhaps not entirely fooled at all. Then he backed away, glanced up over the grim building, and spun toward the mouth of the alley.</p><p>She watched him go, her fingers curling into small fists. The rush of feeling was sweeping back into her now. The breaking point.</p><p>When she thought she had herself under control, she looked at Garrett. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent performance.\u201d He bowed his head slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the Echelon off their trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her mouth was dry. \u201cYou play a dangerous game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t entirely certain,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhether you cared enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you know.\u201d</p><p>Garrett scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cNow I know. And so will he.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. She hadn\u2019t thought of that. Lynch was going to be furious. \u201cHe\u2019ll hate you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Garrett offered her his arm. \u201cThat is my price to pay. I intended to present Mordecai to the Echelon but...I don\u2019t think it will be enough. I\u2019m sorry to ask this of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask,\u201d she replied. \u201cJust tell him that I made the decision myself as soon as I heard. Tell him... Tell him that what I said last night... I meant every word.\u201d</p><p>The prison cart was stuffed with straw, a biting wind creeping through every minute crack. Rosalind found herself shoved up into it ungracefully and spun to bare her teeth at Byrnes. He arched a cool brow at her, met Garrett\u2019s challenging look, then turned and strode out of view.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Garrett muttered, reaching up to help her to her feet. \u201cHe\u2019s a cold bastard, but he looks on Lynch like a brother.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind shrugged, sinking onto the narrow plank of wood that served as a seat. Slowly, she looked up and met the eyes of the man sitting opposite her. Mordecai shifted in his chains, squinting at her through a blackened eye. His gaze dropped to her unbound wrists. Not quite sure what she was doing here.</p><p>Garrett shut the door and the light faded. By the time the steam engine throbbed to life, her vision had adjusted enough to make out Mordecai\u2019s grim expression.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re both dancin\u2019 today.\u201d He smiled, revealing a split lip. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll be findin\u2019 out soon if that brother o\u2019 yours is still alive.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to correct him. Instead, she curled her hands into her lap and looked down at them. Her stomach was a mess of nerves. The thought of being executed terrified her. For a moment she thought was going to be sick and shifted in her seat, unable to sit still. Her lungs seized.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it. Shove it all in that nice safe box where you don\u2019t have to think about it.</p><p>Mordecai\u2019s hot gaze drilled into the top of her head. \u201cHow\u2019d they catch you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t particularly wish to speak to him, but at least it took her mind off what lay ahead. The prison cart lurched forward and she grabbed the seat. \u201cI let my weaker emotions get the better of me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cEmotions? You don\u2019t got none. Most coldhearted bitch I e\u2019er met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish that were true.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cSo they got you an\u2019 they got me. Who\u2019s left? I assume none o\u2019 me boys made it out o\u2019 the opera alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe Nighthawks had the place surrounded however.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cAnd that brother o\u2019 yours?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think of this either, for this meant she\u2019d failed. There was a reason she\u2019d led the cause and not Jack. \u201cHe and Ingrid are still unaccounted for by the Nighthawks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mean shit,\u201d he snorted. \u201cJack talks a treat, but I know he\u2019s hidin\u2019 somewhat beneath them clothes of his. He don\u2019t lead no action, far as I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHis entire body was burned with acid.\u201d By Balfour. When she\u2019d chosen Nate over him. By the time she\u2019d woken with a new hand and a fever, it had been too late. Balfour\u2019s temper had cooled and he\u2019d actually admitted some remorse over the action, but the damage had been done. \u201cHis skin\u2019s too tight now. It hurts him to move quickly, though he can if he needs to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he and that verwulfen bitch can \u2019old it together?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind looked up. \u201cI thought you hated them?\u201d</p><p>A slow shrug. \u201cNever liked you lot much. Still don\u2019t. But \u2019ere we both sit. Ain\u2019t no more o\u2019 my mechs. We went at \u2019em \u2019ard\u2014\u2019arder than you e\u2019er did\u2014but the truth\u2019s the truth. All the \u2019umanists left belonged to you and I \u2019ate the Echelon more than I e\u2019er \u2019ated you.\u201d</p><p>So many times she\u2019d fought and argued with this man.</p><p>\u201cWe both made mistakes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI should have included you and your brother in my schemes when you asked.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI let pride and mistrust make my decisions, instead of thinking them through rationally.\u201d</p><p>Interest flickered in his dark eyes. \u201cThat an apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only one you\u2019ll ever get,\u201d she replied tartly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A soft laugh. \u201cAnd now you want me to admit I shouldn\u2019t a gone against you? Bugger that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand why you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll them years...\u201d He shut his eyes and tilted his head back against the timber slats of the walls. \u201cLocked in the enclaves, servin\u2019 me time for a limb I never e\u2019en wanted.\u201d Bringing his iron fist up, he clenched it, staring at the shifting metal. \u201cThey said I owed \u2019em fifteen years for this. Fifteen years in that hell.\u201d A harsh laugh. \u201cThen you with your pretty promises. All I e\u2019er wanted was some action. Some way to even the score. And you kept urgin\u2019 us to wait, build yon fuckin\u2019 metal army.\u201d He spat to the side. \u201cI worked metal for o\u2019er ten years. What you wanted would \u2019ave taken at least another three. I couldn\u2019t wait that long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you did, perhaps we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He rubbed at the bruise on his face absently, then winced. \u201cGot a mean right \u2019ook, you do. Never seen you in action afore. You could \u2019ave done some damage.\u201d Scraping his thumbnail against his mouth, he looked considering. \u201cThe Echelon, they want Mercury bad, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen answer me this; why you given \u2019er to \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes was surprisingly astute. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw the way that dandy \u2019anded you up in \u2019ere. Whatever you\u2019re plannin\u2019, \u2019e don\u2019t like it none.\u201d Narrowed eyes. \u201cWhat are you plannin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He thought this a ploy. Rosalind looked away. \u201cI\u2019m planning to give myself up in exchange for Lynch. They want Mercury, so I\u2019ll give her to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mordecai looked incredulous, then a canny expression crossed his face, a smile. \u201cTole you a woman ought not be in charge. Them weaker emotions be the death o\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cA blue blood, eh. A bleedin\u2019 Nighthawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Nighthawk,\u201d she corrected.</p> <p>\u201cAye. And still a bleeder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I used to believe.\u201d She closed her eyes and leaned her head back against the wall. \u201cThey\u2019re not like the Echelon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A small smile crossed her lips. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I quite suspect the greatest threat to the Echelon won\u2019t be you or I. It will be the Nighthawks. They\u2019ve already got an army; they don\u2019t have to build one.\u201d</p><p>Silence greeted this statement. When she opened her eyes, he was staring at her. \u201cYou believe that?\u201d No matter his bravado, she sensed the need in him. The desire to know that this wasn\u2019t all for nothing.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t so bad,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhen you ain\u2019t so cold. A pity. We coulda worked well together.\u201d</p><p>A humorless smile touched her lips. \u201cI set the Nighthawks on you,\u201d she reminded him.</p> <p>Despite the bruises, he almost smiled back. \u201cThat were clever. I ain\u2019t never suspected that.\u201d</p><p>The words trailed off as both of them peered through the barred window at the back of the prison cart. Her stomach fluttered. Getting closer now. They were nearly at the tower. She could almost feel the looming shadow of it over the prison cart.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you \u2019ave done, if this \u2019adn\u2019t \u2019appened?\u201d Mordecai suddenly asked. \u201cIf \u2019is lord Nighthawk were free and you weren\u2019t facin\u2019 the guillotine?\u201d</p><p>She had to think about it. Indeed, she\u2019d had so much time to think lately\u2014about everything she\u2019d done wrong or right, everything she might have done differently. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t start a war,\u201d she said. \u201cNot in the streets. Not the way I planned. There was something Lynch said...about war not being the way to win. The Echelon are so strong because they are feared, because no one dares to speak against them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d speak against them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d find a way,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019d join the Humans First Party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin?\u201d He laughed, a rough burr. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t follow. Not for long. You\u2019d want to lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ve learned my lesson,\u201d she replied. \u201cOr perhaps not. Who knows? The point is moot.\u201d</p><p>The prison cart slowed down, someone shouting in the background. Then Garrett\u2019s voice, cutting through the shouts as he proclaimed, \u201cPrisoners. For the tower.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. Mordecai paled beneath the swarthy layer of grime. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll call us \u2019eroes out in the streets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible.\u201d Rosalind\u2019s breath caught. She could taste fear, see it in his eyes and knew he saw it in hers.</p><p>\u201cAlways wanted to be a \u2019ero.\u201d He took a deep breath as the lock on the back of the cart rattled. \u201cGuess this is it. A damned shame\u2014after all we did\u2014that it ends \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith nothing gained,\u201d she agreed hoarsely.</p><p>Their eyes met. Mordecai nodded slowly, thought racing behind his eyes. \u201cThey don\u2019t even want me, do they? All they want is Mercury.\u201d</p><p>Rosa nodded.</p><p>Mordecai licked his lips and shifted in his seat. \u201cGuess I\u2019m dead then and the bastards won\u2019t even remember me name. Curse \u2019em. Curse \u2019em all to \u2019ell.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Barrons snapped, stepping to the front of the dais in the closest he\u2019d ever come to confronting the prince consort.</p><p>\u201cYou dare defy your prince?\u201d The Duke of Bleight asked.</p><p>Of course that vulture would be here. They all were, Balfour taking the place left vacant by the demise of the House of Lannister. He drummed his fingers on his chair, the only sign of movement apart from the eagle dart of his eyes.</p><p>Lynch stood with his shoulders squared and his head high. He couldn\u2019t quite control the racing beat of his heart. Death would never have been his choice, but then he had no choice. He could have handed the mech leader over in some attempt to sway the prince consort\u2019s mind but that was dangerous. Too many people knew who Mercury was and Mordecai was the only one whose tongue he couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>\u201cI offer council,\u201d Barrons replied icily, \u201cwhen the rest of you would rather bite your tongues and bob your heads for fear of offending.\u201d He turned to glare at the prince consort. \u201cI know I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this is foolishness. I\u2019m just the only one who dares voice it.\u201d</p><p>The prince consort cut him a sharp look. \u201cYou\u2019re very close to crossing the line, Barrons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we would be down two council seats. Perhaps you would prefer a dictatorship?\u201d Barrons replied.</p><p>A dangerous move. But Lynch saw the thoughtful flicker in several of the councilors eyes. They were clinging to power and they knew it. All it would take would be for them to unite against him and the prince consort\u2019s stranglehold would be over. But that would never happen so long as every councilor served his own purposes first.</p><p>As if he couldn\u2019t control it, Lynch looked at Bleight. The duke was getting older, perched like a vulture in his chair as he glared at Barrons. Firmly in the prince consort\u2019s pocket. For the first time, Lynch wondered what it would have been like if he hadn\u2019t refused to duel his cousin. If that were him sitting up there, trying to hold the Prince Consort at bay.</p><p>His breathing quickened. He didn\u2019t regret a thing, not truly, no matter how much heartbreak both Annabelle and Rosalind\u2019s deceptions had wrought, for to have done things differently would have meant he would have been a different man.</p><p>Yet perhaps it would have been better for others. For the humans, the mechs, and the rogues, the ones the Echelon ignored as inconsequential. He could have held a position of power, of influence.</p><p>The lack of power irritated him now\u2014to live or die by this man\u2019s whim.</p><p>The prince consort finally turned his attention on Lynch, ignoring the speculative looks between his councilors. Or perhaps not fully aware of them. The queen stood at his side, her pale hand resting on his shoulder and her vacant eyes wandering the room. The fact that she stood while her husband sat was indicative of the power shift between them. Slowly her gaze settled on Lynch.</p><p>One powerless puppet to another.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is wise?\u201d she asked quietly of her consort. \u201cSir Jasper has served us so very well over the years. Remember when he found cousin Robert for me?\u201d</p><p>The prince consort shook her off. \u201cNearly two decades ago. He has not served us so well since. The city is almost overrun with humanists.\u201d He glared at the Council. \u201cOr has anyone forgotten that mayhem last night? Is nowhere safe? I can\u2019t even sign a damned treaty in these halls or attend the opera in peace! No.\u201d He turned back to Lynch. \u201cI gave you a chance and you failed. I swore then that you would share Mercury\u2019s fate and you will. Guards!\u201d</p><p>Sir Richard Maitland took great pleasure in kicking his knees out from under him. The man had been stripped of command for failing to find Mercury and wore the ordinary epaulets of a lieutenant.</p><p>Lynch hit the marble hard, a fist in his hair wrenching his head back and the tip of a blade against his throat. Light streamed through the glass ceiling and Lynch suddenly couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>The doors slammed open. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>His heart plummeted. Garrett\u2019s voice. What was he doing here? Lynch jerked off balance, Maitland\u2019s blade pressing hard against his throat. At least one other person didn\u2019t want the disruption.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d the prince consort demanded.</p><p>\u201cLynch\u2019s second, Your Grace.\u201d Barrons sounded almost relieved. \u201cTemporary Guild Master, Garrett Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your companions?\u201d The prince consort\u2019s snarl was lethal.</p><p>\u201cYou said he had three weeks to the day to deliver Mercury,\u201d Garrett announced. \u201cLet him up. I\u2019ve come to bring you what you want.\u201d</p><p>No. No. No. Lynch grabbed the knife and shoved it away, slicing his hand in the process. But he had to look. Landing on his hands and knees, his gaze went straight to the door.</p><p>Garrett stepped aside, revealing a hesitant pair in the doorway. Lynch barely saw the tall mech in chains, with the iron brace holding his knee in place so he could walk. All he could see was Rosa, standing there quietly, swallowing hard as her gaze darted around the room. Their eyes locked. Proud and beautiful and defying him with her knowing gaze.</p><p>Don\u2019t.</p><p>But it was too late. The council\u2019s breath caught, seemingly at once, as attention turned to the pair in the door.</p><p>There was only one reason she could be here. She loved him. Truly loved him. He saw it in her eyes as her weight shifted forward. No! The irony of it tore through him, that she was giving him everything he\u2019d wanted from her\u2014only for it to be the last thing he now desired.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Mercury?\u201d the prince consort asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d Garrett shot back.</p><p>And Rosa took a deep breath and prepared to step forward.</p><p>Twenty-eight</p><p>\u201cYou wanted Mercury?\u201d</p><p>The voice startled her as Mordecai shoved past, pushing her out of the way roughly as he stared cockily at the Council. \u201cWell, \u2019ere I be.\u201d</p><p>Shock tore through her, freezing Rosalind in place. All she could see were Lynch\u2019s furious eyes as he glared at her. He froze too, turning his gaze on the sturdy mech.</p><p>\u201cAfraid o\u2019 just one man.\u201d Mordecai laughed. \u201cLook at you all. Perched up \u2019igh in your Ivory Tower. And \u2019ere\u2019s me, got to you even \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>The prince consort shoved to his feet, his eyes glittering with icy rage. But at least they were no longer resting on Lynch.</p><p>\u201cI want his head,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBring me his head!\u201d</p><p>The Master of the Coldrush Guards gaped at the prince consort, shooting Lynch a disappointed look. As Maitland moved toward Mordecai, Garrett stepped between them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll honor your word?\u201d Garrett dared to ask. He looked nervous; no doubt he was. None of them had expected this. \u201cLynch brought down Mercury. You said it was his life or the revolutionary\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get him out of here.\u201d The prince consort\u2019s hungry gaze never shifted.</p><p>Lynch slowly pushed to his feet. Garrett bowed and stepped out of the way, his hand finding hers in the shadows of his body. She squeezed it back.</p><p>Mordecai glanced over his shoulder. She stared at him, an almost inexplicable sense of sadness sweeping through her. How truly she\u2019d underestimated him.</p><p>He gave a loose one-shouldered shrug before turning back to the Council. \u201cAye, kill me then. And know that I\u2019ll die a \u2019ero. They won\u2019t ever forget me, out there in the streets. And they\u2019ll finish what I started, what we \u2019umanists started. Your days are numbered, you pasty maggots.\u201d His laughter bounced off the roof. \u201cYou think this ends this?\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou think my death will stop us \u2019umans from risin\u2019? This is just the start!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeize him!\u201d the prince consort screamed.</p><p>Mordecai\u2019s words echoed in the chamber, but she knew who they were aimed at. Use it. Use this chance. Do what neither of them had managed so far. His sacrifice floored her. He\u2019d already been dead, but at least this way he earned them a chance.</p><p>The Coldrush Guards grabbed his arms and yanked him to the brass circle cut into the marble floor. His knees were kicked out from underneath him, the whites of his eyes flaring as they yanked his head back. Rosalind jerked, her fist tightening around Garrett\u2019s. She couldn\u2019t look away, couldn\u2019t find that inner coldness that protected her at times like this. She felt it as the sword rasped over Mordecai\u2019s throat, and swallowed hard against the lump in hers.</p> <p>\u201cMount the head on the tower wall,\u201d the prince consort said coldly. \u201cLet the masses see what happens to those who dare defy me.\u201d His voice rose. \u201cLet them come at me and see how defiance ends! I will not be cast down. Not by you. Not by that horde of filthy unwashed humans! You are cattle!\u201d</p><p>Then the sword slashed down, blood spraying over the marble floor. Mordecai\u2019s body jerked, blood fountaining from his throat, then it hit the ground.</p><p>So quickly. Without even a formality. Rosalind stared at the spreading pool of vermillion on the alabaster tiles, as they dragged the body away. That could have been her. Should have been, except for this one small act of mercy\u2014of heroism. Heat sprang up behind her eyes.</p><p>You won\u2019t be forgotten, she vowed. And neither would her own pledge. He hadn\u2019t given her this chance for nothing.</p><p>Garrett squeezed her fingers. She was shaking so badly she could barely stand. But Lynch was alive. And so was she and somehow they had pulled the wool over the prince consort\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>She could hardly breathe for the lump in her throat. And then she saw Balfour.</p><p>He watched her with those emotionless black eyes, his lashes so colorless they were almost white. Not a fool. He never had been and he knew; she saw it in him. He alone of the Council had watched her foot shift as she made to step forward, to claim the name of Mercury. She watched swift expression dance across his face as he made the connections. He was the one who\u2019d sent her to spy on the humanists, on Nathaniel. After years of believing her dead, she had suddenly shown up, just as the name of Mercury was on everybody\u2019s lips.</p><p>One word and he could condemn them all.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t say it. The moments ticked by and he glanced down, toying with the signet ring on his finger. Strain tightened his face. He\u2019d never once betrayed his prince, yet at what cost would this take? What would he demand of her?</p><p>She looked for Lynch, frightened and unsure. Their gazes locked and she knew that he understood her fear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky your man has your best interests at heart,\u201d the prince consort said to Lynch with an oily smile as he settled in his chair. \u201cIf he\u2019d stayed his arrival another minute, he would have been able to cast aside the label of temporary Guild Master and replace it with permanent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t understand loyalty then, Your Grace?\u201d Garrett again.</p><p>Lynch cut him a look and shook his head in warning.</p><p>The prince consort stared at Garrett for an uncomfortable minute. \u201cOh, I understand loyalty.\u201d His smile vanished. \u201cLynch, you may go.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind let out a breath. Please. Let them get away from this awful place.</p><p>But Lynch paused, turning to face the council, his boots almost in the puddle of blood Mordecai\u2019s body had left behind. \u201cI do believe you promised something else, Your Grace. Some incentive, should the revolutionary be brought to justice.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Barrons stepped forward, clad entirely in black velvet with a ruby dangling from his ear. \u201cYou swore that you would revoke Sir Jasper\u2019s rogue status and name him one of the Echelon.\u201d</p><p>The prince consort\u2019s smile died. \u201cSo I did. Thank you for reminding me of that, Barrons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so I declare it. Sir Jasper Lynch,\u201d the prince consort called. \u201cI officially revoke your rogue status and name you one of the Echelon.\u201d A nasty little smile twisted his mouth. \u201cAs such, I strip you of the title of Guild Master of the Nighthawks. No blue blood could remain amongst the rogues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Lynch straightened.</p><p>He was up to something.</p><p>Drawing all eyes, Lynch took a step back, his boot heel cutting over the brass circle. Then another, until he stood fully within it. He met the Duke of Bleight\u2019s gaze and gestured with a mocking little twitch of his fingers. \u201cThis has been a long time in coming, Uncle. I challenge you for the duchy of Bleight. First blood.\u201d</p><p>The prince consort\u2019s grip tightened on his chair, his face going white with fury. And Rosalind understood what Lynch had planned. Her heart leaped\u2014then fell. If he won this fight, he became a duke and would join the council. There would be no place for her at his side.</p><p>But he would be free of the threat of the prince consort\u2019s power. Safer perhaps with power of his own. She couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014deny him that.</p><p>The Duke of Bleight slowly levered himself to his feet, his ancient face expressionless. Most duels were to the death. Not only was Lynch offering a reprieve, but in the Echelon\u2019s eyes, an insult. Would his pride overcome his fear of mortality? They all knew how uneven this match would be, even Bleight.</p><p>The rest of the council waited with bated breath.</p><p>\u201cI accept, you little cur.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>Three days later...</p><p>The wind tore through her hair as she stepped down from the front door of the brownstone manor and Rosalind clamped her gloved hand to her hat. Her heart was still hammering in her chest. She\u2019d done it. Without a shadow of a lie or even omitting a single detail. Everything she\u2019d just won had been with the truth.</p><p>Her burgundy skirts flipping around her ankles, she crossed to the plain black steam carriage that waited at the curb. It was rented, of course. Jack blew warm air into his palms through the open hole in his respirator and then stepped forward to open the door for her. People stared. He\u2019d tugged the collar of his coat up to hide the half mask, but still their eyes lingered and women grabbed their children by the arms and dragged them away as if afraid whatever contagion he had might spread.</p><p>Rosalind reached for him and squeezed his hand. Asking him to step out of the dark shadows he\u2019d hidden in for the past eight years was an enormity she didn\u2019t underestimate.</p><p>\"So?\u201d he asked, ignoring the crowd as if he didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>\u201cSir Gideon has agreed to have lunch with me on Friday at the Metropolitan Hotel. He\u2019s cautious, but he certainly seemed interested in what I had to say.\u201d Excitement bubbled up in her chest. \u201cOh, Jack. You should hear some of his ideas. I always thought the Humans First party to be nothing but hot air but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s actually quite clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think this will work then?\u201d</p><p>For the first time in days, her smile softened, losing its hard, false edge. She hadn\u2019t realized how unfocused her dream had been lately. Everything she\u2019d done had become reactive, rather than taking initiative. She\u2019d done what she had to, but she\u2019d done it mechanically, without any real feeling for it. A chore. Something she owed Nate, for what she\u2019d cost him. But now, a thousand ideas sparked through her breast. \u201cI do. I really do. I had thought that giving up my plans would hurt more, but it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019re going to draft a bill to put before the Council about the increased rights for mechs. Mordecai\u2019s Bill. That\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ll approve it?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was vicious. \u201cOf course not. Not at first. But unfortunately for the Council, I\u2019m not going to go away. I\u2019m going to keep at them until they are weary of my voice.\u201d</p><p>Calculation gleamed in his gray eye. The other was covered by an eye patch. \u201cI think you\u2019ll have at least one of the Council votes in your pocket.\u201d</p><p>The reminder shattered her smile. She\u2019d been trying not to think about it ever since Lynch won the duel. There\u2019d been so much to do and she\u2019d gotten swept aside in the chaos after that swift battle. Standing in the doorway, watching as Barrons swept him up with a hard thump to the back, she\u2019d slowly edged back through the door. He\u2019d won. He was safe and the Duke of Bleight banished to a country estate, his titles stripped. If Lynch had wanted to see her, then she wouldn\u2019t have sat up for the last three nights alone, watching her candle burn down as the night slowly passed.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t presume,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d Jack tipped his head toward the open door of the carriage. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d best step in.\u201d</p><p>The expression on his scarred face was unreadable, but she could detect the faintest of lines around his eyes. A smile perhaps. Her eyes darted toward the carriage, her chest squeezing just a little tighter. That tickly sensation in her stomach multiplied a thousand times over, burning through her until she thought everyone would notice.</p><p>\u201cJack, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up in surrender and stepped back onto the curb. \u201cWhy nothing, Roz. Some gent approached me and we had us a little chat.\u201d From the sudden sharp gleam of his eyes, she had a feeling the discussion might have lasted at least one of the several hours she\u2019d been inside.</p><p>It was then that she noticed the driver sitting up on the seat of the carriage. Perry glanced at her, a cap pulled low over her eyes. Rosalind swallowed hard. As much as she was blindingly desperate to see Lynch, she didn\u2019t want to get in the carriage.</p><p>\u201cBe brave,\u201d Jack lowered his voice, taking her hand by the fingertips to help her inside. \u201cYou deserve to be happy.\u201d A faint grimace. \u201cEven if he\u2019s what makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>She thought that somewhat presumptuous. So much had happened between her and Lynch in the last week, yet nothing had been resolved. And he was a duke now. As the Master of the Nighthawks he\u2019d been somewhat within her reach, but the Echelon would be expecting him to take a consort or begin making thrall contracts. No matter how much she loved him, she could not be a thrall.</p><p>\u201cHow are you getting home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a mind to walk.\u201d Jack shrugged. \u201cSee if I can convince Ingrid out of her sulk.\u201d</p><p>Not all of them had been so happy to hear her confession about her feelings, both for the cause and for Lynch.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll come around.\u201d Jack saw the expression on her face. \u201cShe loves you. She just doesn\u2019t like change. And she\u2019s scared that there\u2019s no place for her here, out in the light.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind nodded. The carriage door loomed open, revealing nothing but shadows within. Steeling herself, she gave her brother a kiss on the cheek, grabbed a handful of her skirts, and swept inside.</p><p>The sudden plunge into darkness left her blind. Jack slammed the door shut and somehow she found her seat, the shadowy shape of long legs starting to form in front of her. Following them up, she noticed the tight frock coat Lynch wore and the stark white spill of a cravat. Not his usual uniform then. It only reminded her of the distance between them and the small, hopeful part of her stuttered in its exhilaration.</p><p>Rosalind finally met his gaze, twitching at her skirts to straighten them. Beneath the dark curve of his lashes, his eyes gleamed an intense gray\u2014watchful but giving nothing away. His only awareness of her showed in the stiffening of his body and the sudden clenching of hard muscle in his thigh. Seeing him again made her heart twist as though some enormous hand were squeezing it. She barely had the control to comport herself. She wanted to throw herself at him and drag his mouth to hers. To touch him. Assure herself that he was really there.</p><p>But why was he here?</p><p>\u201cHello, Your Grace,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>At that Lynch grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of that to last me a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best get used to it as I believe you\u2019re going to have a lifetime of it.\u201d</p><p>A sigh. Then those canny eyes found hers again. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind folded her hands neatly in her nap. Nothing. The dratted man was giving her nothing. She was so tense she felt as if she were going to fly apart. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing to do for three days.\u201d Censure crept into her voice. \u201cAnd someone once told me that I would never win a war, not in the streets.\u201d</p><p>Lynch glanced toward the window and the brownstone, as the carriage lurched into motion. His fingers drummed a slow, steady beat on his thigh. Restless. \u201cSo now you\u2019re going to go after them in their own hallowed halls. Beard the lion in its den?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to dabble in politics,\u201d she said. \u201cSir Gideon Scott is interested in several of my ideas and I...\u201d Her heart quickened. \u201cI admit I\u2019ve grown somewhat excited about some of his. He\u2019s not the fool I took him for, but he knows how far he may extend at each step.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous path,\u201d Lynch said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cLess so than my previous one.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cDo you remember that boiler pack I was trying to smuggle from the enclaves?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s designed to power an automaton. We call them the Cyclops. They\u2019re built large enough for a man to sit inside them and manipulate them and they\u2019ve enough firepower to handle four of the Echelon\u2019s metaljackets.\u201d</p><p>Lynch\u2019s eyes narrowed on her. \u201cHow many do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough. Not yet,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd most likely I won\u2019t pursue the project. You were right. This can\u2019t be won by outright war.\u201d</p><p>He scraped a hand over the back of his neck. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t ease my mind one whit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you suggest? That I pursue a hearth and home, perhaps take up knitting?\u201d</p> <p>The sudden smoky intensity of his gaze unnerved her. \u201cThat\u2019s not quite what I had in mind. Besides, you would probably stab someone with your knitting needle.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind couldn\u2019t help herself. Her heart began to quicken, her fingers toying uselessly with each other. Her gaze dropped to them. Damned hands. Always betraying her. \u201cI see. And what did you intend for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Rosa. Do we have to be so formal?\u201d</p><p>Again she lived in uncertainty. Looking up, she found the hard line of his jaw clenched. He had never been a man given to much emotion, but she saw it, gleaming in his pale eyes and pinched nostrils. A man holding himself so tightly he was afraid to let go.</p><p>But one of them must. Or they\u2019d exist in this exquisite politeness until the carriage pulled up and then he would help her down and offer some platitude and she would probably accept it, watching as he left.</p><p>To take that next step scared her. But she wasn\u2019t as afraid as she had been. She\u2019d thought once that to love again would be the worst that could ever happen to her, but it wasn\u2019t. To come so close to losing him had shown her how small such a fear could be.</p> <p>\u201cI waited for you for the last three nights,\u201d she said in a small, choked voice. \u201cI was so certain you would come for me. But you didn\u2019t. I had to do something with my time. I was going out of my mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Rosa. I wanted to come. I thought\u2014you weren\u2019t there. When I turned around you\u2019d gone and... There were things I desperately needed to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBalfour,\u201d he said gruffly. As she stiffened, he reached out and took her hand. \u201cHe won\u2019t bother you again, Rosa. Indeed, he has no desire to hurt you. He\u2019s almost as intent as I in seeing that the prince consort never hears the truth of Mercury.\u201d</p><p>Heat flashed through her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he regrets what happened. No matter what you may feel, he seems fond of you and quite proud.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind tore her fingers from his. \u201cIt\u2019s a ploy.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, Lynch tried to touch her again but she was too agitated. What was he saying? That in his fury, Balfour had done something he\u2019d regretted? She shook her head. No. He\u2019d killed Nate and crippled her brother. That was unforgivable.</p> <p>\u201cIf it is a ploy, then I am prepared for him,\u201d Lynch said quietly. \u201cYou mentioned that he asked you to assassinate several persons for him. I would like the details, when you are ready. I want to prepare a full case against him, in case he decides to manipulate you. I\u2019ve spoken to Barrons about it and he\u2019s prepared to press the case for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmail?\u201d she asked, swallowing the hard knot in her throat. \u201cI would never have expected it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeverage,\u201d he corrected. \u201cBalfour once said I am predictable. Maybe I was. But not anymore.\u201d His expression darkened. \u201cI have had enough of being manipulated by those in power. I won\u2019t be threatened anymore\u2014and I won\u2019t have those I consider mine threatened either.\u201d</p><p>The look he gave her left her in no confusion as to whom he referred to.</p><p>\u201cAnd us?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat of us? You said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I said.\u201d His face darkened, his eyes going black with heat and need. \u201cRosalind... When you walked into that chamber...\u201d He shuddered, each word said so precisely that it was clear he was barely holding on. \u201cI know what you intended. I could see it all over your face. Don\u2019t you ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I to do? Let you die in my place? It nearly killed me when Garrett told me what you were planning.\u201d Everything that she\u2019d been holding inside for the last few days boiled up. Heat raced behind her eyes. \u201cYou stupid man! You should have told me what the prince consort was demanding! I can\u2019t believe you... You\u2014you didn\u2019t even say good-bye...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. She was so angry. Or hurt. Or...something she couldn\u2019t quite explain, even to herself. Leaping toward him, Rosalind balled her fist and drove it into his arm. Lynch caught her wrists, dragging her forward.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she snapped, then his mouth took hers and the words were lost.</p><p>She slid her hands into his hair and yanked his face closer to hers. The hard edge of violence rode him, the muscles in his arms quivering with restraint as she raked her hands down them. She didn\u2019t want restraint. She hated it, hated the distant politeness, the way her emotions sat in a hard ball in the center of her chest. She let it all out, biting at his tongue just enough to sting.</p><p>As if the move goaded him into action, he growled deep in his throat, one hand fisting in her hair as he arched her back, his other hand grabbing a handful of her arse and hauling her closer. Rosalind\u2019s knees drove into the hard leather seats, her skirts bunching between them as he settled her firmly in his lap. Too many damned skirts. She caught a fistful of them and wrenched them out of the way, and then she could feel the hard steel of his erection between them, separated from her own flesh by his trousers and the barest silk slither of her drawers.</p><p>Lynch swept her bustle out of the way, and then his hand drove low between the back of her legs, fingers sliding over the delicate puckered rosebud of her bottom and deeper still, where the silk pressed wetly against her flesh. Rosalind\u2019s head spun, a gasp tearing from her bruised lips.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered, grinding against him. Suddenly she couldn\u2019t hold herself back anymore. She needed to feel him against her, feel his cool-as-silk skin, taste it on her tongue. Shaking fingers found the buttons on his black waistcoat and then Rosalind was tugging, frantic in her haste, buttons tearing free from the lush velvet\u2014hot and shivery and so close to coming apart that she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>The fingers between her thighs slid mercilessly between the thin slit of her drawers. Against her wet flesh. She groaned, grabbed a handful of his waistcoat and tore it open.</p><p>\u201cEasy, my love, easy...\u201d</p><p>Rosalind kissed the smile from his lips. She didn\u2019t want easy. She wanted now. Somehow she had his shirt open and then she was dragging her mouth down his throat, her teeth rasping against the flat disk of his nipple. Lynch\u2019s hand fisted in her hair, and he sucked in a sharp gasp. He couldn\u2019t quite reach her now, his other hand clenching in the mound of her arse. She needed the respite. She wanted him to be with her this time, and if he kept it up, she\u2019d have come in seconds.</p><p>Her hand slid down between them, grasping the straining length of his cock through the tight material of his trousers. Kissing her way down, Rosalind started tugging at his laces, her lips brushing through the line of hair that arrowed south from his navel...</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Lynch rasped, grabbing her hips and swinging her around so that she straddled him backwards.</p><p>Shoving through the layers of skirts, he found her wet and wanting. One hard jerk and her drawers were gone. Then he fumbled between them and suddenly she could feel the silky-soft brush of his erection. Grabbing her by the hips he eased her back, sheathing himself inside her with one firm thrust.</p><p>Rosalind threw her head back, biting her lower lip until it hurt. Her bottom nestled against his lap, his breath harsh and cool against the back of her neck. Firm hands caught her hips, eased her into a rocking motion. Then they were sliding up, cupping her breasts from behind, thrusting them high.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d she whispered, her thighs burning as she rode him. Strands of her coppery hair tumbled down around her face as her head fell forward, her lip held fast between her teeth.</p><p>Lynch\u2019s fingers found her and she cried out, her body slowing on his, unable to move, her thighs quivering as she hovered there. It was too much. She grabbed at his knees, holding on, his hips moving beneath her...slowly...torturously... As if he wanted to feel every last second of this.</p><p>The world went white. Rosalind jerked, her body clutching at his greedily as pleasure washed over her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold her balance anymore. All she wanted was to wilt over him like a flower, bonelessly, blissed out on pleasure. He wouldn\u2019t let her. One hand thrust out, shoving aside the small curtain, and then she could feel cold glass beneath her touch, fingers spread and grasping for something\u2014anything\u2014to hold on to.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cI was so angry at you, yet the thought of not having you... It did something to me. Tore something deep inside.\u201d</p><p>His words set off another cascade of pleasure within her\u2014this time of the soul.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Rosalind admitted. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I needed you to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He kissed her shoulder, slowly grinding against her again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me.\u201d She felt his lips twitch against her skin. \u201cThough the timing could have been better.\u201d</p><p>Another slow grind. Rosalind shifted, rolling her hips. Pushing away from the window, she arched her back and lay back against his shoulder, sliding a hand up his throat. Clenching her inner muscles, she heard him curse softly, under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMinx.\u201d But his hands were quivering on her hips and he urged her faster. Each squeeze drew a sharp intake of breath from him. \u201cYou drive me insane.\u201d He groaned and pressed his lips to her shoulder. Teeth sank into the soft muscle there as he thrust hard against her. Hoarsely, \u201cWant you so much, so damned much...\u201d</p><p>He pressed her against him, one hand on her abdomen as he gasped. Rosalind squeezed hard, feeling his body shake around her as he climaxed. She loved this feeling, the power she had over him, the way the world seemed as though it belonged to just the two of them.</p><p>Lynch collapsed back against the seat with a groan, dragging her with him. Long minutes ticked by as she lay back in his arms. She didn\u2019t want this to ever end.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d miss the mask,\u201d he murmured, kissing a blazing trail across her trapezius. \u201cBut I like this too. Having you so vulnerable beneath me\u2014atop me. Knowing that it\u2019s you. That it was always you.\u201d His teeth sank into her skin and she gasped.</p><p>A little uncomfortable now. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always me. Not... Not the true me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I see her?\u201d he whispered, nuzzling her throat. \u201cThe true Rosalind? Cerise?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind pushed away from him, turning in his lap to face him. \u201cI\u2019m not Cerise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as much a part of you as Mrs. Marberry was. Or Mercury. I can see pieces of them all in you. You shouldn\u2019t be ashamed.\u201d His hand came up, cupped her face, his thumb stroking over her mouth. Those glorious gray eyes dropped too. As if he were thinking of tasting it again. \u201cAll of those pieces are you, Rosa. They made you what you are. Even Cerise...the girl who hurt...the girl who didn\u2019t want to exist anymore... You wouldn\u2019t be you, who you are, without her.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes that he should see it so clearly. She swallowed hard, wanting to kiss him again. But that was the coward\u2019s way out. A way to hide herself, to express herself without speech. \u201cI wanted to destroy her,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBecause she didn\u2019t deserve to live after what she\u2019d done. I wanted to be Rosalind. A new start. Away from all of the guilt. All of the hurt. If I finished what Nate started... It was a way to make things right, to find...forgiveness...\u201d</p><p>That cool hand cupped her face, made her feel safe. So safe. Rosalind tilted her cheek into the touch, like a cat. Nothing had ever felt better than this, than being in his arms. A wet tear slid down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHe forgave you,\u201d Lynch said gently.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He insisted. \u201cThat is what it means to love another.\u201d</p><p>The words stole her breath. With them came hope. Then his arms crushed her against him, holding her so tightly it were as if some part of him were afraid she\u2019d be torn from his grasp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The words bubbled up in her throat, tickled against the roof of her mouth. Clutching at his ruined shirt, she pressed her face against the bare skin of his throat. But she couldn\u2019t say it, as if a part of her still felt unworthy. Pushing against his chest, she looked up. \u201cI lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your lips, yes.\u201d His eyelids lowered, almost hiding those luminous eyes, but his hand kept on stroking her cheek. \u201cI should have paid more attention to my instincts, to what my dark half was telling me.\u201d His thumb paused in the middle of her lip and he looked up, capturing her gaze. \u201cIt knew who you were no matter what guise you wore. It claimed you long before I did.\u201d He took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cAnd did you ever lie to me...here?\u201d Tentative fingertips pressed between her breasts, directly over the thumping beat of her heart.</p><p>Rosalind shook her head, swallowing hard. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, cupping his hand and holding it firmly against her chest. She could feel the heady pulse of her heartbeat through his touch. \u201cIt belonged to you long before I knew it.\u201d Another heady swallow. She had to say it. He deserved it and she wanted him to know. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said the one thing she needed to hear the most. This time he believed her. Slowly his lips curled up, and she thought she might die for the joy the sight elicited in her. His smile\u2014so rare\u2014was a thing of wonders. \u201cI knew the instant you walked through the doors of the atrium.\u201d The smile began to fade.</p><p>Rosalind quickly pressed her fingertips to it, as if to capture it. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>Lynch kissed her fingertips and took a shuddery breath. \u201cI won\u2019t. That is done. However, there is one last thing we must discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>His fingers laced between her iron fingers and held them up. \u201cI have had Fitz design something special for me.\u201d Reaching into the pocket of his waistcoat, he drew out a small red velvet box. \u201cConsidering that no normal ring would fit\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Rosalind sat up and nearly hit her head. All she could see was that box, her heart pounding so swiftly she almost swayed with dizziness. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked your brother if I had permission to make you my consort.\u201d He flicked the box open. \u201cI want you to share the world with me. Forever, Rosa. No more secrets between us. Nothing but you and me, till death do us part.\u201d</p><p>Nestled within was a gleaming steel ring, burnished so brightly that it shone. An enormous square diamond was set into the top, with a lattice of tiny, filigreed silver holding it in place. No lady of the Echelon would wear it, but it suited her, so perfectly he had obviously designed it himself. And the fact that he had asked Jack\u2014who had given his blessing\u2014meant so much more to her than any diamond.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, her hand trembling as she held it up.</p><p>Lynch slid the ring from the box. \u201cYou can never take this off, Rosa. I intend to have Fitz solder it to your finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take it off.\u201d She bounced impatiently. \u201cHurry up and put it on.\u201d</p> <p>He slid it down over the iron knuckle and settled it in place. \u201cWell, duchess... How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel as if you have given me the world.\u201d Her throat was dry and tight again as she looked at him. How could one have so much feeling inside and not drown in it? She would have to learn to cope with this. \u201cI wish I could give you half as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have.\u201d He kissed her iron fingertips. \u201cYou have given me a future and joy in it too. Before I met you, I was only existing. I wasn\u2019t living life. The last few weeks...as tumultuous as they\u2019ve been, at least I\u2019ve lived them.\u201d Leaning down, he kissed her lips lightly.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he whispered against her lips, \u201cwe have so much to do together, you and I. A whole world to change.\u201d The words caught her breath. \u201cYou are the only one I trust to watch my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is almost my favorite part to look at,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lynch smiled. \u201cAnd there is my wicked Mrs. Marberry. I do believe I have one last request though... Something I would like to ask of you in exchange for the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d she promised, smiling at this amazing man: her future, her hope, her heart...</p><p>\u201cKeep the mask,\u201d he breathed, and leaned down to kiss her again.</p>  </body></html>"]
