He reached in his jean pocket and threw some money on the table, \u201cThis is for the next couple of months so you can pay the rent.\u201d He kissed me on my forehead and headed for the door.</p><p>I crossed my arms and stared at him, \u201cI don\u2019t want your money; I want you to stay. Please Kyle; don\u2019t give up on us.\u201d</p><p>I was now the most pathetic person in the world, begging my douchebag boyfriend to stay; not because I thought I was in love with him, but because I was afraid of being alone, and being alone was something that was all too familiar to me.</p><p>He picked up his bag from the ground and slung it over his shoulder, \u201cTake care Elle,\u201d and just like that he walked out. I stood in the middle of the living room and looked at the closed door as tears escaped my eyes.</p><p>Kyle and I have been together since sophomore year of college. We both attended Michigan State University and met at a frat party when he was a Delta Sigma Phi. Kyle was a good looking guy with his 6ft stature and medium build. He was not exactly eye candy, but he was cute. He always kept his jet black hair perfectly combed, and his dark brown eyes reminded me of my one favorite thing in the world, chocolate. Kyle was the person whose presence lit up the room. His charm and romance is what swept me off my feet. He studied accounting while I studied Art. It was not too long after we graduated that his cousin got him a job at the large accounting firm where he was employed. This is how we ended up moving from Michigan to New York. Kyle worked full-time as an accountant and made pretty decent money, so I was able to take on a part-time job at a record company and finish painting the pictures I promised the art gallery.</p><p>We rented a one bedroom apartment that was small, but it was our home for the past year and it made us happy; at least I thought it did. I took my teary eyed self and sat on the couch, curled in a ball and cried myself to sleep.</p> <p>I had not been sleeping long when I was startled by a knock on the door. I sat up and looked around the room, eyes swollen and red.</p><p>\u201cElle, are you in there?\u201d I heard a familiar voice say as she pounded on the door. I got up from the couch and stumbled to open the door. Peyton always seemed to know when I needed her most. She threw her hands up in the air.</p><p>\u201cElle, it is about time, I thought I was going to have to break down the door.\u201d She put her arms around me and hugged me tight. I motioned for her to come in as she pushed her way through and set a large brown bag on the table.</p><p>\u201cI come bearing douchebag boyfriend food,\u201d she smiled as she rummaged through the bag. She removed the boxes of Chinese food and set them on the table.</p><p>\u201cWe have Mongolian Beef, Lettuce Wraps, Chicken Fried Rice, Wonton soup and chocolate ice cream for dessert.\u201d</p><p>Her grin went from ear to ear, but quickly fell as I dropped my head and curled back up on my couch. Peyton sighed heavily as she walked over and sat next to me.</p><p>\u201cKyle texted me and said he left. He wanted me to come over to check on you and make sure you were ok.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head from my arms. Who the f**k did he think he was sending my best friend over to see if I was ok? I thought as angered burned inside me.</p> <p>\u201cHe said he left because of irreconcilable differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we married?\u201d I growled.</p><p>Peyton gave me a sympathetic smile and walked to the kitchen to grab plates and silverware for the food sitting on the table. I could not stop thinking about Kyle and how he just left. We were never apart for more than a couple of days, and now we\u2019d be apart forever and once again I was alone. I knew why he decided to leave, and for that reason I hated him. I gave him every opportunity to tell me the truth, but he could not even look me in the eye and do that. He was a coward, and I had no room in my life for cowards. Even though I felt sick to my stomach, I got up and made my way to the table as Peyton put some food on my plate.</p><p>\u201cListen Elle, Kyle is a douchebag, and I\u2019m sorry you wasted the last four years of your life with him. You need to focus on something else. You need to finish your paintings and get them over to the art gallery so people can find out who Ellery Lane truly is,\u201d she said waving her fork around. I lightly smiled because I knew she was right; if there was one way I could escape the hurt and loneliness, it was through my paintings. She reached over and put her arm around me and gave me a squeeze, \u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be here for you.\u201d</p><p>I met Peyton at the art gallery the day I stopped by to talk to the owner about displaying my paintings. The minute she asked, \u201cMay I help you,\u201d we clicked and have been best friends ever since. One thing about Peyton is her personality, its way bigger than her 5\u20192\u201d, Size 0 body. She always sports the perfect look with her long straight brown hair and perfectly placed makeup that enhances her bright blue eyes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen her dress in a pair of sweatpants; for her it is all about style with skirts and cute little tops. There isn\u2019t a shortage of guys when Peyton is around. They\u2019re always flirting with her, but she has yet to find the perfect man to give her heart to.</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel like eating, but I knew I had to appease Peyton or she would not leave me alone.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay with you tonight?\u201d</p><p>I set my fork down, \u201cNah, I just want to be alone. I think I\u2019ll go take a bath.\u201d</p><p>I got up from the table and headed to the bathroom. I turned the water on and poured a capful of bubble bath in its stream. I twisted my long blonde hair up and clipped it to prevent it from getting wet. I climbed in the bubble filled tub and slid down until my head was resting on the bath pillow behind me. I laid there, closed my eyes and tried to think of a plan, but I was to grief-stricken, and I needed the proper amount of time to wallow in self-pity before moving on with my life as a single female.</p><p>By the time I got out of the bathtub, Peyton had everything cleaned up. She had left me a text message saying, \u201cElle, get some rest and call me if you need anything. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow, love you always.\u201d</p><p>I smiled for she was about the only family I had left. My mother passed away from cancer when I was six, and my father died right before my eighteenth birthday. I had an aunt and uncle back in Michigan, but I have not seen or heard from them since my dad died. I always considered Kyle\u2019s parents my family, but now that we\u2019re broken up, it would be more than awkward to talk to them.</p><p>I made sure the door was locked. I turned off the lights and snuggled in my bed, burying my head under the covers to escape the reality of my life, at least for tonight.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The next few days I did nothing but stayed in my pajamas and concentrated on finishing my paintings. I called work and told them I had the flu. They told me to take the rest of the week off, which was something I didn\u2019t have a problem with. I was afraid I couldn\u2019t afford it, but I needed to get my paintings finished and off to the art gallery. I wouldn\u2019t have been good company to anyone anyways.</p><p>I made my third pot of coffee of the day and checked my phone to see if I had any messages. Kyle had not made any attempt to contact me since he left. How does a person just forget about someone after being with them for four years? A fire stirred in my blood just thinking about it. The way I saw things I had two choices; I could sit in my tiny apartment and let my life die out, or I could suck up what happened and go out into the world and live. I opted to go out and live. I was not ready to die yet; I had too many things I wanted to do.</p><p>I frantically cleaned my apartment, which was long overdue, and I was ashamed that I let it get that way. I took a garbage bag and started tossing everything out that reminded me of Kyle. I was determined to rid this apartment of any sign of him. By the time I was finished, my little home was practically bare. The shelves in the bookcase that housed pictures of me and Kyle now sat empty reminding me of the emptiness I felt in my heart.</p><p>I finally showered and stood in front of the bathroom mirror. I took my hand and wiped the steam that formed over it. I looked at myself for the first time in days. My ice blue eyes, which Kyle used to tell me, reminded him of the sea, looked tired with bags that formed underneath them. I ran a brush through my long blonde hair, and then fingered mousse through it, so it dried wavy. I put on some makeup to try to hide the fact that I\u2019ve been depressed and locked in my apartment for a week. I stepped into my favorite jeans and was surprised they were loose in places they never were before. My 5\u20197\u201d size 4 body appeared to have shrunk a bit since the breakup. I tore through my closet for my favorite pink shirt. Once I was ready, I took in a deep breath and called a cab. It was time to step out into the world and start my life again.</p><p>Manny pulled his yellow cab up to the curb of my apartment as I walked out the door. Seeing me struggle with the three paintings I was carrying, he got out of the cab to help me.</p><p>\u201cHey Elle, let me help you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Manny, thanks,\u201d I smiled at him.</p><p>Manny was my favorite cab driver, and I\u2019ve known him since I moved to New York. When I call a cab, I always ask for Manny, sometimes he\u2018s available and sometimes he\u2019s not. He stood about 5\u201910 with a muscular build. He always wore his black hair in a ponytail, and his brown eyes always sparkled when I\u2019d ask him about his kids. He was a family man and one of the nicest people I have ever met. His cab was the one that first picked me and Kyle up when we arrived in New York. I sat in front of the cab with him so my paintings could sit comfortably in the back.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mr. Kyle doing, Elle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyle moved out over a week ago Manny,\u201d I sighed. The expression on his face was sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Elle, are you ok?\u201d I looked over at him, and a light smile came over my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing ok. I was a mess last week, but now I\u2019m adjusting.\u201d Was I really? Or was I just a good actress.</p><p>He pulled up to the art gallery and helped me take the paintings out of the cab. I paid him the fare and thanked him for his help.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, call me Elle and I mean that,\u201d he pointed at me as he got into the cab and slowly pulled away.</p><p>Peyton saw me from the window of the gallery and came outside to help me bring in the paintings. She called the owner, Sal, and told him that I arrived. He came down from his office and kissed me on both cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAh, let me see what you have done here Ellery,\u201d he said as he took the paintings one by one and laid them up against the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was contracted to submit three painting to his gallery as a trial. One of the paintings was a romanticism of a man and woman dancing under the moonlight surrounded by clouds. The second painting was of a garden with a fountain surrounded by beautiful flowers. The last painting was of a child sitting in a field of flowers in a white dress as three angels look down upon her from the sky. All three paintings spoke something about me.</p><p>\u201cWow Ellery, these are gorgeous. I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t have any problem selling these,\u201d Sal smiled.</p><p>I felt a little embarrassed because this was the first time I was going to be showing my work to the world. He led me over to a small wall that was sitting bare.</p><p>\u201cThis is where your paintings will be displayed. I will call as soon as one or all of them sell.\u201d I thanked him and as soon as he walked away, Peyton started jumping up and down clapping her hands.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out and celebrate tonight,\u201d she squealed.</p><p>Going out was the last thing on my mind. I was not ready to do the single girl, out at night thing, but Peyton was persistent, and I knew I didn\u2019t stand a chance against her. So, I hesitantly agreed.</p><p>I left the gallery and started walking down the street. I fumbled through my large purse to find my ringing cell phone. I grabbed it and looked at the familiar number that found its way to my phone a little too much lately. I hit ignore and decided to walk the six blocks home. It was not long before the new voicemail alert lit up my phone. By the time I made it home, I was exhausted. I threw my keys and purse on the table next to the door and listened to the message that so annoyingly remained on my screen.</p><p>\u201cHi Ellery, this is Dr. Taub calling. I noticed you have cancelled the last two appointments since our last visit. I want to make sure you are still coming to see me. It is vital that we talk about this. I can help you Ellery. Please call my office to set up an appointment A.S.A.P.\u201d I rolled my eyes and shook my head as I hit the delete button.</p><p>I walked to the bedroom and decided to lay down for a while as the six block walk home took its toll on me. I had only been sleeping about an hour when I awoke to the sound of my ringing phone.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I sleepily answered.</p><p>\u201cWere you sleeping?\u201d Peyton asked rather loudly.</p><p>\u201cI was just taking a little nap,\u201d I yawned.</p><p>\u201cGet up; I\u2019m on my way over to your place to get ready for the club.\u201d</p><p>I heavily sighed, \u201cClub? You said we\u2019d go celebrate; I thought maybe that meant dinner, not clubbing.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel like going to a noisy crowded club tonight.</p> <p>\u201cElle, snap out of it, you have been a hum drum since douchebag Kyle left. Reclaim your life, have fun like you used to; you are the most fun person I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Peyton; I\u2019m not feeling the club scene tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel it once you get there and who knows maybe you will meet your Prince Charming tonight.\u201d</p><p>Did she say Prince Charming? I don\u2019t want a Prince Charming. I don\u2019t want anything to do with men period. It was important to Peyton that we celebrate, so I agreed to go.</p><p>\u201cOk Peyton, I guess I\u2019ll go, but I do not want to be out late, I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay,\u201d she shrieked. \u201cOh, my friend Caleb is picking us up at your place, bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, who is...\u201dclick... I silently chuckled and hopped in the shower. Peyton\u2019s exuberance attracted a lot of different people. I believe that\u2019s why we connected with each other so quickly.</p><p>As soon as I got out of the shower, Peyton walked through the door and threw a bag from Forever 21 at me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I asked as I peeked inside the bag.</p><p>She looked at me and smiled as she flitted to the bathroom, \u201cJust a little pick me up I bought for you to wear tonight.\u201d</p><p>Peyton was generous like that; we always bought each other things we thought the other would like. I opened the bag and took out the most spectacular silver, glittery knit tank top.</p><p>\u201cPeyton, I love it,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would. I thought you could wear it with your black leggings and black boots,\u201d she mumbled as she brushed her teeth.</p><p>I went to the bedroom and put on the top. The length was long enough to cover my ass, which made it perfect for leggings. I walked to the bathroom where Peyton was doing her hair. She looked at me through the mirror and whistled, \u201cLook at you miss thing; every guy at the club is going to want to tap that hot ass,\u201d she smiled as she lightly smacked it.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Peyton is one of those people who does not have a filter; she says what\u2019s on her mind, at that moment and never gives it a second thought. Her mouth spits before her brain thinks.</p><p>I smiled as I hugged her, \u201cThank you; it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwe, it\u2019s nice to see you smile again Elle,\u201d she continued straightening her hair.</p><p>I asked Peyton about Caleb, and she said he was a friend of a friend, and they went out a couple of times. I found it odd since this is the first time I\u2019m hearing his name. She said she started seeing him right when Kyle left me. She didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to talk about her dating life so soon. To be honest, I was touched by her thoughtfulness not to mention it, but at the same time I was pissed she didn\u2019t.</p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror one last time before going out. I decided to throw some soft curls into my blonde hair that I already straightened and rubbed off some of the eye shadow Peyton painted on me. I was starting to feel glad I decided to go tonight; I needed some fun.</p><p>Caleb came to the door and whistled at the both of us as Peyton opened it. He gently kissed her on the cheek and walked over to me holding out his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Caleb, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>I shook his hand and told him the same. His grip was firm, and from what I could tell so was his body. He wore his short brown hair messy but in an attractive way and his black eyes were piercing. I could see why Peyton was attracted to him. The three of us slid into the cab that was waiting for us outside. Peyton had her arm around Caleb\u2019s as they nuzzled each other. Suddenly, I felt like a third wheel.</p><p>\u201cSo, what club are we going to?\u201d I asked. Caleb broke his gaze from Peyton and looked over at me.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d go to Club S.\u201d</p><p>I frowned trying to think of how I knew that club, and then it hit me, my friend from the soup kitchen, Frankie is a bouncer there. I gasped.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a sex club?\u201d</p><p>Peyton looked at me and smiled, \u201cElle it\u2019s a normal club; it just so happens that some people go there to find others to have sex with.\u201d She said it so casually as if it was no big deal. I rolled my eyes and sighed.</p><p>\u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but doesn\u2019t the S stand for sex, as in Club Sex?\u201d Peyton and Caleb both smiled at me. \u201cGreat, now I\u2019ll have to be on the defense all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive a little Elle,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>I crossed my arms and looked out the window as they started making out. I was not about to live a little by having a one night stand with some random guy; that wasn\u2019t me. I only had sex with one guy in my life, and that was Kyle.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The cab dropped us off in front of the club, and I was astounded by the line of people who wrapped around the building for at least 2 blocks. I smiled, for I knew there was no way we were getting in tonight, which was OK with me. I preferred to go out for a quiet dinner.</p><p>Caleb slumped his shoulders, \u201cFuck, look at that line; we should have gotten here earlier.\u201d</p><p>As the crowds of people in line were patiently waiting to be let in, and I was wishing to get the hell out of there, I heard someone yelling my name. My eyes grew wide as I cautiously turned my head.</p><p>\u201cElle, is that you? Hey Elle, over here.\u201d</p><p>I looked over in the direction where the voice was coming from, and it was Frankie waving his hand and motioning for me to come over. The three of us walked to the entrance and stood in front of the large, burly man named Frankie Lasher. His 6\u20194\u201d wrestler body was enough to intimidate anyone. I could see why the club hired him as a bouncer. He put his arms around me and gave me a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cGood to see ya Elle; you guys clubbing here tonight?\u201d</p><p>I pulled from his embrace, \u201cWe were going to, but wow, look at that line, I don\u2019t think tonight\u2019s going to be a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense, you three go in.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a dirty look as he lifted the rope for us. Caleb and Peyton were ecstatic and beaming from ear to ear. Frankie lightly grabbed my arm as I walked past him, \u201cIf you do not feel comfortable in there or you need me, come out here and let me know.\u201d I smiled at his generosity and nodded.</p><p>We walked through the small hallway that led into the main entrance of the club. I\u2019ve been to many clubs, and this is by far is the most crowded I\u2019ve ever seen. I looked around at the tables that filled the place. A massive bar sat off to the side with fluorescent lights that hung down from the ceiling. The oversized dance floor housed large projection screens and displayed a full color laser show. The walls were suede with soft lights that glowed off them. The music was blaring as the floor was thumping beneath my feet forcing my body to move with the beat.</p><p>Peyton pulled me and Caleb to the dance floor where we danced for what seemed like hours. I needed a drink, so I left them to dance as I made my way to the bar. I took the only bar stool that was available at the end and ordered a Cosmopolitan. I was sipping on my drink when I noticed a man and woman arguing at a table not too far from where I was sitting. She had her shaking finger pointed at him and then proceeded to poke him in the chest several times. I couldn\u2019t help but shake my head and laugh. I kept looking over at them to see if they would kiss and makeup, but noticed he was yelling now. His finger was pointing at her, and his face looked angered. The tall beautiful woman slapped him across the face, turned on her heels and scurried off. I stared at him and took notice at the look on his face which showed no emotion whatsoever. He just sat there and stared straight ahead.</p><p>I kept looking over in his direction because he was one of the best eye candies I\u2019ve ever seen. His light brown, almost blonde hair was shorter on the sides as his longer top had waves to it. I could not help but stare at his prominent square jaw and chiseled cheek bones. I could not tell the color of his eyes because he was too far away, and the lighting was inadequate, but I could tell just by looking, anyone could easily get lost in them.</p><p>\u201cYum Elle, I see someone has stolen your attention,\u201d Peyton smiled as she looked over at him. Oh god I did not need her knowing I was checking this guy out because she would be the first one to run over, tell him, and try to set us up.</p><p>\u201cHe only has my attention because he was just bitch slapped by some woman.\u201d She let out a loud laugh, and that was my cue to change the subject. She dragged me out to the dance floor where I danced and endlessly fought off horny guys as I kept getting shuffled in the crowd.</p><p>It started to get extremely hot in the club, and I needed some fresh air. I told Peyton I\u2019d be back as I headed towards the door. As I stepped outside, I saw Frankie escorting Mr. Eye Candy out of the club. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOk Mr. Black, you have had way too much to drink tonight, and it\u2019s time for you to go home.\u201d He was stumbling from side to side and mumbling something.</p><p>\u201cFrankie, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I casually asked.</p><p>\u201cHey Elle, this gentleman has had too much to drink, and he started causing a scene when the bartender refused to serve him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just escort them out, what they do after that is not my concern.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and cocked my head, \u201cHe can barely stand, how do you expect him to get home?\u201d My head was telling me to stop immediately because it knew what I was about to do, but my heart was telling me to help him. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he gets home safe,\u201d I said to Frankie.</p><p>\u201cElle, that is not a good idea, you don\u2019t know whom you\u2019re dealing with here.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand up, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, and he needs help.\u201d</p><p>Frankie shook his head, \u201cYou have a good heart Elle, but sometimes I think you\u2019re crazy; please be careful.\u201d</p> <p>I grabbed my cell phone from my purse and called a cab. Mr. Eye candy was sitting on the cement against the wall. I took notice at his expensive black tailored suit and the white shirt that was partially unbuttoned, showing off his muscular chest. His 6ft stature was lean, but seriously muscular. Like his hair and face, his body appeared to be perfect. I walked over to him and grabbed his arm to help him up.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at me with his drunken green eyes, \u201cDo I know you?\u201d he slurred.</p><p>I patted him on the back and walked him to the curb just as the cab pulled up. Before I pushed him in, I took his wallet out of his back pocket. He stumbled into the seat, and I climbed in next to him. I opened his wallet, took out his driver\u2019s license and handed it to the driver, \u201cDrop him off here.\u201d He handed his license back to me, and I took it upon myself to read his name.</p><p>I patted him on the arm, \u201cNice to meet you Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and put his head on my shoulder. I let a small smile escape my lips.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p><p>The cab pulled around to the garage area. \u201cThis is where they like to be dropped off. He should have a key that fits that elevator over there; his name should be on the inside next to the key hole telling you which floor he is on, good luck.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the cabbie because one: how did he know this and two: I had no intention of taking him further than the elevator. I opened his wallet and thumbed through his money. I shook my head at the fact he only had several $100 bills. I took out a hundred and handed it to the driver, \u201cKeep the change,\u201d I winked.</p><p>A large smile swept across his face, \u201cThanks ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it; you can thank him next time.\u201d</p><p>I opened the door and grabbed his arm pulling him out of the cab. I put his arm over my shoulder and walked him to the elevator. He kept stumbling almost taking me down with him. I searched his pocket for his keys. It was that awkward moment when I put my hand in his side pocket and felt something semi hard that were not his keys. I pushed the button on the elevator and he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYou are a beautiful woman, and I\u2019m going to f**k you really hard,\u201d he said as he grabbed my ass. I sighed and removed his hand from my behind, \u201cOnly in your dreams sweetie, only in your dreams.\u201d</p><p>The elevator opened. I escorted him inside and looked at the different keys on his key ring wondering which one fit the elevator. I turned to him as he was leaning up against the back of the elevator, \u201cCan you please show me which key goes here.\u201d He flashed me a drunken smile and seductively took the key ring from me; picked which key and held it up. \u201cThank you,\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>I inserted the key into the lock next to his name as it took us up to the top floor. The elevator doors opened to the biggest and most beautiful penthouse I have ever seen. Ok, it was the only penthouse I\u2019ve ever seen, but it was still beautiful. My full intention was to lean him up against the wall and leave; I\u2019d assume he would pass out on the floor and wake up in the morning; that was until he looked at me and said he was going to be sick. I rolled my eyes as I asked him to take me to his bedroom; I figured that would get his attention real quick. He pointed to the stairs, and I held onto him, trying to hold him up as he tripped up each step. We finally made it to the top as I saw a bathroom on the left. He didn\u2019t make it. He vomited all over his clothes. I shook my head for this was a sight that was all too familiar to me.</p><p>I hurried him to the bathroom where he leaned over and hugged the porcelain of god for a good hour. I stood there admiring the beauty of his bathroom. The taupe walls and black granite countertops gave it a classic, but luxurious look.</p><p>I found a washcloth and ran it under lukewarm water. I walked over to him as he sat against the wall with his head down. He smelled liked vomit, and I had to get him to change his clothes.</p><p>\u201cCome on buddy; let\u2019s see if we can get you changed.\u201d I put his arm around me and with a little help from him; I lifted him off the floor. We made it down the hallway to his bedroom. I opened the double doors that led inside and gasped; his bedroom was bigger than my entire apartment. I took him over to the king size bed and sat him down.</p><p>\u201cAre you an angel?\u201d he slurred as he gently rubbed my cheek. His skin felt warm, and his touch felt nice, too nice as it gave me tiny goose bumps.</p><p>I took his hand away, \u201cYeah, I guess I am.\u201d</p><p>He drunkenly smiled and fell back on the bed. I knew this was going to take some work, trying to get his clothes off, but I could not let him sit in his own vomit all night. I took his shoes and socks off first. I climbed on top so I was straddling him and unbuttoned his shirt, rolling him from side to side taking his arms out. It probably would have been easier to take his shirt off in the bathroom, but I didn\u2019t think about that. I moved down to the button on his pants; oh god I cannot believe I\u2019m doing this. My thought was, just to let him lie there and sleep it off, but his pants received the worst of his vomit and he genuinely smelled. I unbuttoned his pants and lifted his h*ps so I could pull them off. It was a struggle, but I finally managed.</p><p>I could not help but look at his sculpted body as he laid there almost perfectly nak*d only in his black silk boxers. I\u2019m only human, right? He was lean, muscular and perfectly defined from head to toe. I felt dirty standing over his passed out body checking him out, but no one should ever look like that perfect, it is just not right. I needed to move him up to his pillow. I put the cool cloth on his head, and he stirred. I grabbed under his arms and pulled him up the best I could. I turned him on his side in case he vomited again; a slight groan came from his mouth. I found a blanket, on a chair in the corner of his room, and covered him with it. I sighed and looked at the clock on the night stand; it read 1:00 am.</p><p>I was exhausted and desperately needing some sleep. It was then I realized I never told Peyton I was leaving. I ran down the stairs and grabbed my purse off the table. I took out my phone and saw a text message from her.</p><p>\u201cFrankie told me what you\u2019re doing, and I know you like to play Good Samaritan, but I\u2019m worried, text me.\u201d I quickly replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine; I managed to get him home, and he is passed out on his bed. I\u2019m heading home now; I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the hallway and looked at the stairs. Memories were flooding my mind as I had to walk back to his room to check on him one last time. He had rolled on his back, so I rolled him back on his side. His bed was so comfortable that I decided to sit next to him and make sure he stayed on his side the rest of the night. Then maybe get a little bit of sleep.</p><p>I awoke from a dream I had about my father. I quickly sat up, but my brain had not fully registered where I was. I scanned the room and looked over at him sleeping peacefully. I shook my head in disbelief that I fell asleep for so long as I made my way to the bathroom. I splashed some water on my face and downed some mouthwash I found in his cabinet. I ran my fingers through my hair and headed downstairs. I should have just left right then and there, but I needed coffee, and so would he when we woke up.</p><p>I walked to the kitchen and stopped dead in my tracks. The mahogany cabinets topped with dark grey granite counter tops were utterly stunning. A large curved island sat in the middle of the kitchen with a built-in stove on one side, as three stainless steel ovens were built-in opposite the other wall. I found what I needed and made a pot of coffee. I had a recipe for a hangover cocktail that I used to make my dad every day. I scanned the kitchen and surprisingly enough, it had everything I needed to make one. I had my back turned to the doorway, making the hangover cocktail, when I heard someone clear their throat. I was startled, and I slowly turned around.</p><p>He stood in the middle of the kitchen in a pair of black pajama bottoms that hung low on his h*ps outlining his muscular form. I gulped at the site of him standing there, hung over and still looking as incredible as he did last night. He looked at me and cocked his head to one side.</p><p>\u201cDid I not go over the rules with you last night?</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do sleepovers. You were supposed to leave after I f**ked you; so would you mind telling me why you\u2019re still here, in my kitchen, making yourself comfortable?\u201d</p><p>His tone was arrogant and crude, obviously he did not remember anything from last night, but I didn\u2019t expect he would. His green eyes looked dark and angry, but he\u2019ll have to get over it; I didn\u2019t have time for this. I set the glass with the hangover drink on the counter and slid it to him. He narrowed his eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, and I expect an answer.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and rolled my eyes, \u201cListen buddy; I don\u2019t know what you think happened last night, but you didn\u2019t f**k me; I would never give you the pleasure; trust me.\u201d Ok, I was lying, I would have given him the pleasure, but he didn\u2019t need to know that. He cocked his head and stared at me narrowing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou drank yourself into oblivion at the club last night, and they kicked you out. I was walking outside when it happened and being the good person I am; I called a cab to make sure you got home safely. Then you proceeded to vomit all over yourself, so I had to get you to the bathroom and out of your clothes, because frankly, you smelled.\u201d He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI was on my way out the door when I decided to check on you one more time. I went back to your room and you were lying on your back, so I rolled you on your side again in case you vomited; I would not have wanted you to choke to death.\u201d He shifted his weight and crossed his arms. \u201cI fell asleep from exhaustion after dealing with you, and when I woke up I decided to make you a pot of coffee and a hangover cocktail. I was leaving in a few minutes, and I did not expect you to be up for at least a few more hours.\u201d</p><p>He took a few steps closer, \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me nothing happened between us?\u201d I rolled my eyes, didn\u2019t this man listen to a word I just said.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing happened; I just needed to make sure you were going to be ok; you were obnoxiously drunk,\u201d I looked down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked as he picked up the glass.</p><p>\u201cJust drink it; you will start to feel better in about 15 minutes. I\u2019ll pour you some coffee and be on my way.\u201d</p><p>I started to feel a little dizzy as I reached for a mug and it slipped out of my hands crashing to the floor.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I said as I bent down to pick up the broken pieces.</p> <p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re going to cut yourself,\u201d he walked over to me and bent down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said shaking my head and picking up the broken porcelain.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d his voice commanded.</p><p>His voice was startling, but I didn\u2019t listen because it was my mess and I was going to clean it up. He grabbed my hands and turned them over taking the broken pieces out of them. Our eyes met when he saw the scars on my wrists. I pulled back quickly and stood up. He continued to pick up the pieces. I took my purse from the counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry again for the mug. I\u2019ll replace it for you, and I hope you feel better.\u201d I turned and headed out the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d I heard him say.</p><p>I turned around and looked at him. \u201cAt least let me pay you for your trouble last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking your money, and it was no trouble.\u201d Ok, it was, but he is alive, and I feel better knowing that I probably saved his life. He rolled his eyes, \u201cThen at least have a cup of coffee before you go.\u201d I sighed. I seriously needed it, and one cup wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cFine, one cup and then I\u2019ll be out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>He walked back to the kitchen and put the cup on the island. He drank his cocktail and frowned the entire time. It was fun to watch the disgusted look on his face. He leaned over the counter and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you help me like that? What if I was a r**ist or murderer?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t rape or murder me even if you wanted to. You were so far gone last night; I could barely get you home.\u201d He ran one hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou should not be doing those kinds of things; it is not safe in this city for a girl to be doing shit like that.\u201d He seemed agitated.</p><p>I leaned my elbow on the counter, rested my hand on my cheek, and looked at him intently as he lectured me. He stopped what he was saying and narrowed his eyes at me, \u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I got up from the stool, \u201cThanks for the coffee, but I must go now; I need to get home.\u201d I grabbed my purse and started walking out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHave a lovely day Mr. Black and next time don\u2019t drink so much.\u201d I could hear his footsteps following behind.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind telling me your name?\u201d The elevator doors opened; I stepped in and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ellery Lane,\u201d I yelled as the door began to close.</p><p>Chapter 6</p> <p>I stepped out into the bright sunlight and looked up at the sky. I smiled as I waited for the cab to come. I kept thinking about Connor, his dumb rule about woman staying the night, and the way he looked. There was something about him that made my stomach flutter. I could not stop thinking about his tone and how angry it was when he first saw me. I guess I couldn\u2019t blame him though; I\u2019d probably be the same way if a strange man was in my apartment when I woke up.</p><p>I walked through the door of my apartment, threw my purse down and took a hot bath. I was exhausted, and I desperately needed some sleep. I craved the comfort of my pajamas and bed. I texted Peyton to let her know I was going to take a nap, and I\u2019d call her when I woke up. If I didn\u2019t text her, she would probably call or come over, and I just wanted to be alone tonight. I looked at the clock, and it was 3 pm. I had a plan to sleep till 5 pm, make a quick dinner and do some painting.</p><p>I was startled by a knock at the door. I looked at the clock, and it was 5:30. Shit, I slept longer than I wanted to. I got up and headed towards the door.</p><p>\u201cPeyton, I said I would call you when...\u201d I flung the door open and to my surprise it was not Peyton, but a young man holding a small white envelope.</p><p>\u201cAre you Ellery Lane?\u201d he asked. Suddenly, I got nervous; he sounded serious.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I\u2019m Ellery Lane.</p><p>He handed me the envelope, \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>I took the envelope from his hand. He smiled and walked away. My stomach started to tie itself in knots. I didn\u2019t know what to expect to find in the envelope, and who was sending me something anyway?</p><p>I slid my finger across the top and took out the piece of neatly folded paper that was tucked inside, it read, \u201cMiss Lane, I am going to properly thank you for your services last night, I will be waiting for you at Le Sur Restaurant. My driver will pick you up promptly at 7:00 pm.\u201d</p><p>Connor Black</p><p>First of all, how did he know my address and second of all, why the hell is he so bossy? I should have had that creeper feeling, but for some reason I didn\u2019t. I quickly put it out of my mind when I saw he wants to have dinner at Le Sur.</p><p>Since Kyle and I moved here, we have never been able to get into that restaurant. People book months in advance. I called Peyton immediately.</p><p>\u201cHey girl, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that guy I helped home last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY.e.a.h....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to thank me for helping him, so he is sending his driver over to pick me up to meet him at Le Sur at 7:00.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she screamed into the phone. \u201cElle, who is this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>I heard her gasp, \u201cAre you f**king kidding me Elle? Do you know who Connor Black is?\u201d I frowned and twisted my face.</p><p>\u201cNo, should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live in a bubble or something? Connor Black is the CEO of Black Enterprises. He is a 30-year-old mega millionaire who took over his father\u2019s company when he was 28. OMG Elle, he\u2019s hot, and he\u2019s rich, and he wants to take you to dinner?\u201d I could hear the excitement in her voice.</p><p>\u201cPeyton, first of all I\u2019m not interested in any guy. I\u2019m in the guy free zone, especially after what Kyle did to me. This man Connor Black is rude, bossy and does not have an ounce of respect for women.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell her what he said to me about his rules earlier in the day.</p><p>\u201cHe can be Elle, he\u2019s rich and hot.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at that last comment and told her goodbye. I didn\u2019t feel like going out tonight and I wanted to do some painting, but it was Le Sur and I\u2019ve been dying to go there, so I made an exception.</p><p>I rummaged through my closet trying to find something to wear. I pulled out a black dress that I wore to a friend\u2019s wedding a couple of years ago. It was simple with spaghetti straps and a v neck. I put on some light makeup and wore my hair half up, letting the loose curls from the back cascade around my shoulders. I threw some gloss on my lips and looked at the clock, it was 6:58. I checked myself out in the mirror one last time and headed out the door.</p><p>Sitting at the curb was a black limousine with a man leaning up against it. \u201cMiss Lane, I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Ellery Lane,\u201d I smiled as he opened the door and helped me inside. I took in the comfort and plushness of the Limo. I felt like a princess on her way to the ball. I looked to the front where the driver was sitting.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me in the rearview mirror, \u201cDenny, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Denny; is Mr. Black always so bossy?\u201d I politely asked.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head, \u201cMr. Black is used to getting whatever he wants.\u201d I rolled my eyes and looked out the window, of course he does.</p><p>I walked into the restaurant and up to the desk where a tall redheaded woman asked if she could help me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Mr. Black,\u201d I answered. Instantly her eyes looked like daggers as she said, \u201cFollow me.\u201d The razor eyed redhead led me towards the back of the restaurant to the table where Connor was seated. He saw us coming and stood up. He walked over and pulled out my chair. Ok, so far he has some manners.</p><p>\u201cGood evening Miss Lane, I\u2019m glad you decided to join me.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell him that I was only here to experience the restaurant and that if he had chosen anywhere else, I would not have attended. I sat in my chair as he walked over to his.</p><p>He wore an extremely expensive dark gray suit. His sun-kissed skin glistened more than I remembered from this morning and his hair was perfectly styled in the tousled way that was hot.</p><p>\u201cGood evening Mr. Black, thank you for inviting me, but it really was not necessary and please call me Elle.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me intently, \u201cIsn\u2019t your name Ellery?\u201d</p><p>I took a sip of water, \u201cYes, but my friends call me Elle.\u201d</p><p>He took his menu and opened it, and I was astounded by the next words that came out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut we are not friends Ellery.\u201d</p><p>Ok, I take back the whole man has manners thing, he is just downright rude.</p><p>I opened up my menu. \u201cAlright then Mr. Black, why don\u2019t we just stick to Miss Lane?\u201d I saw him slightly grin from behind the menu.</p><p>\u201cOrder anything you like, it looks like you have not eaten in weeks.\u201d I looked sternly at him.</p><p>\u201cI eat every day Mr. Black, not that it is any of your concern.\u201d He suddenly looked intrigued as he set his menu down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just you are very thin.\u201d</p><p>What the f**k is this man\u2019s problem. First, he says we are not friends; then he calls me anorexic.</p><p>\u201cThis is the way I was born; I\u2019ve always been thin.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together as the waiter came to the table with a bottle of Pinot Grigio. He poured the wine in each glass and proceeded to take our order. I looked at Connor as he sat there staring at me; it was making me intensely uncomfortable, but turning me on at the same time. My heart started to beat rapidly, and a familiar ache rose from down below. Two can play this game.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your story Mr. Black?\u201d He brought his wine glass to his lips and took a sip, never taking his eyes off me.</p><p>\u201cMy story?\u201d he simply asked.</p><p>A small smile escaped my lips, \u201cYes, your story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to tell, I\u2019m a 30 year old CEO, I have more money than I will ever need; I do not do relationships; I usually get everything I want, and I do whatever I want.\u201d I sat there staring at him the entire time he boasted about himself.</p><p>\u201cNow, that we got that out of the way, what\u2019s your story Miss Lane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a story Mr. Black; I\u2019m 23 years old; I moved here with my boyfriend a little over a year ago; I work part-time at a small record company; I paint pictures, and I volunteer at the soup kitchen.\u201d</p><p>He sat and pondered whether or not he wanted to ask me the next question. \u201cWhat does your boyfriend think about you having dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t, we aren\u2019t together anymore. He moved out almost 3 weeks ago,\u201d I looked down at the table.</p><p>I could sense a tiny bit of sympathy in his voice, \u201cOh, may I ask how long you were together?\u201d I found it particularly odd that he was trying to get so personal.</p><p>\u201cWe were together 4 years; we met at college and moved here from Michigan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He raised his eyebrows, \u201c4 years are a serious length of time.\u201d I decided just to lay it all out there for him since he seemed so interested; it didn\u2019t matter anyway I probably would never see him again after tonight.</p><p>\u201cYep, came home from work one day and said he needed space, packed his bags and walked out.\u201d I knew the real reason he left, but I was not about to tell Connor that.</p><p>He struggled with his next words, and it caught me by surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he did that to you.\u201d</p> <p>I waved my hand in front of my face. \u201cDon\u2019t be, nothing lasts forever.\u201d</p><p>He was taken aback by my choice of words, but it was the truth and I wasn\u2019t afraid to say it.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Le Sur was just as beautiful as I thought it would be. The ambiance was breathtaking with its low lighting and romantic feel. The marble floors were exquisite as were the paintings that hung on the walls representing Paris. The tables were lined with satin cloths, and the meals served were on delicate china.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it here?\u201d Connor asked as he noticed me looking around.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is a beautiful restaurant,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>The waiter brought our meal as Connor was about to ask me a question. \u201cYou say you volunteer at the soup kitchen, may I ask why?\u201d The look on his face told me that he was a bit intrigued by it.</p><p>I took my fork and knife and cut up my chicken as I proceeded to answer his question.</p><p>\u201cI like to help people in need; you should know that by now Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cYes, it was a dumb question to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a rough childhood and let\u2019s just say nobody was there to help me.\u201d His eyes never left mine; he listened to every word I said closely.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your parents? They did not help you?\u201d I looked down and away from him, trying to find the right words.</p><p>\u201cMy mother died of cancer when I was six, and my father was an alcoholic who passed away right before my eighteenth birthday.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face changed; it went from hard to soft in a matter of seconds.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you helped me last night because you think I\u2019m an alcoholic?\u201d he asked. I took the last bite of my dinner and set down my fork.</p><p>\u201cNo, my father choked to death on his vomit during one of his drunken nights. I found him dead in his bed the next morning. I didn\u2019t want that same fate for you. What people do not realize is how easy it is for something like that to happen. I spent my entire life taking care of my father who absurdly drank himself into oblivion almost every night because he couldn\u2019t get over my mother\u2019s death, so it is just second nature for me to help people.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say; I think I shocked him. He held up his glass and motioned me to do the same.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for your help last night, as mad as I was this morning to find you standing in my kitchen, I do appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>As we were leaving the restaurant, I noticed several women looking at Connor with what appeared to be sex in their eyes. Some were licking their lips as we walked by, and others were eyeing him up and down. It was rather disgusting, but I could see why they did it. He was undoubtedly something to be admired. We walked outside, and I looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWant some ice cream?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked at me with a puzzling look like I was crazy or something.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not want ice cream, I\u2019m taking you home and then I have somewhere to be.\u201d Here comes his rudeness again, I was surprised it took this long.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, my treat, I know this cute little ice cream parlor a couple of blocks away that\u2019s open 24 hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lane, I do not want any ice cream, now get in the car so Denny can take you home.\u201d His tone was adamant.</p><p>I started to walk down the street. I wanted ice cream. If he didn\u2019t that was his problem, but I was getting some with or without him.</p><p>I waved my hand as I walked away, \u201cThanks again Mr. Black for dinner, I\u2019ll see ya around sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lane, get back here,\u201d he yelled down the street. I rolled my eyes and kept walking. Suddenly, he was beside me mumbling, \u201cMiss Lane, I will not tell you again to get in the car.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and turned to him shoving my finger into his chest, \u201cI do not take orders from anybody Mr. Black, especially people I\u2019ve only known less than 24 hours. I am not your responsibility. You thanked me for my help with a nice dinner, and now it is time to part ways. I am going to get some ice cream, and then I will call a cab to drive me home.\u201d</p><p>He stood there stunned, unable to speak. I continued walking, and he followed me. I heard him on the phone, \u201cDenny, I guess we\u2019re getting ice cream; I\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re leaving.\u201d The tone of his voice was angry.</p><p>\u201cYou do not need to come with me if you don\u2019t like ice cream,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI never said I did not like it, I just don\u2019t want any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you following me Mr. Black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe in this city for a beautiful young woman to be walking alone, especially at night, how many times do I need to explain that to you?\u201d</p><p>I caught the \u201cbeautiful\u201d part and could not help but smile. My feet were starting to kill me in my 4 inch heels, so I stopped abruptly in the middle of the sidewalk and took them off.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking off my shoes because my feet are killing me,\u201d I said as I used his arm for balance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to walk barefoot on this dirty sidewalk?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cYes I am Mr. Black.\u201d I could tell he hated the idea; he was so prim and proper. We walked up to the door of the ice cream parlor, and I slipped my shoes back on.</p><p>\u201cHello, how can I help you?\u201d A cheery young girl behind the counter asked. I looked at the different ice creams behind the glass, \u201cI will have a single scoop of chocolate chip on a waffle cone please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for you sir?\u201d the cheery girl asked.</p><p>Connor looked at me and sighed, \u201cA single scoop of cherry vanilla in a cup.\u201d I smiled at him and bumped my shoulder against his. I went to grab my wallet and pay, but Connor had already handed the girl his money.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was my treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Miss Lane, I can afford to buy you ice cream.\u201d I rolled my eyes and sat down at the wrought iron table, Connor sat across from me. I watched him eat his ice cream while hiding a small smile. I could tell he was enjoying it.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you ate ice cream?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked at me puzzled, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess since I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me, you haven\u2019t had ice cream since you were a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you would find a lot of things surprising about me,\u201d he said. I twisted my face and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are you going later?\u201d Not that it was any of my business, but he made a point to let me know he needed to be somewhere.</p><p>He raised one eyebrow, \u201cMiss Lane, I don\u2019t think you really want to know the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>We finished our ice cream as I saw Denny pull the limousine up at the curb. He got out and opened the door for me.</p><p>\u201cThank you Denny, you are such a gentleman,\u201d I said as I glared at Connor. Thank god I didn\u2019t live too far because it was awkwardly silent the whole way home. The Limo pulled up to my apartment, and I could see Connor leaning over checking it out.</p><p>\u201cYou have your own outside entrance?\u201d he frowned.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do not live in a fancy apartment building with a door man and private elevator. This is it Mr. Black, my little apartment with its own outside entry.\u201d He looked at me in irritation.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it, I just think it is unsafe; anyone can break in.\u201d I looked at him and thanked him for putting that thought in my head. I leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. I found it odd that he flinched at my touch.</p><p>\u201cThank you for dinner and ice cream, I had a nice time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome; have a nice night Miss Lane.\u201d</p><p>I got out of the Limo and leaned forward so I was facing him and I winked, \u201cHave a pleasant night Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door and walked into my apartment. I took off my killer shoes and threw them down; god my feet hurt, but it was worth the pain to eat at Le Sur. My suspicion about Connor and him having to be somewhere was that he was going to pick up some woman for sex. I had the distinct feeling he was that type of guy. He said he did not \u201cdo\u201d relationships, but he is a man and every man has needs, and he was going to make sure his were filled.</p><p>I pondered why anyone would want a relationship with him anyway. He is downright rude and arrogant, not to mention he seems a little controlling. Oh hell, I\u2019ve never known anyone so controlling, but why does my heart flutter when I\u2019m around him? I laughed to myself, thinking about the night, and how on more than one occasion I pissed him off as I climbed in my bed and fell fast asleep.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>I spent the next few days going to work and volunteering at the soup kitchen. Saturday came, and it was a beautiful September day. Peyton had called and asked me to go shopping with her, but I told her I already had plans, of course she was not happy with my answer, but I was going to Central Park.</p><p>Growing up, I would escape my house and find a quiet place to sit and draw. It was the only time I did not feel lonely. I liked to draw and paint pictures of places where I could go and hide. My father used to tell me that I got my artistic ability from my mother. I thought about her almost every day and how my life would be different if she hadn\u2019t died, but like I say, nothing lasts forever; you can either roll with it or let it kill you. I grabbed my drawing pad and pencils and headed out the door. The walk to Central Park wasn\u2019t long, and I enjoyed the fresh air; it made me feel alive.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent more time in Central Park since I\u2019ve moved to New York than anywhere else. The playgrounds were filled with children playing in the warm New York sun. I made my way to the Conservatory Garden. The magnolia and lilac trees filled the air that provided a soothing and calming effect. It was easy for me to escape the world and take in the beauty of the gardens. It was like a sanctuary for me; a place where I could go and draw just about anything.</p><p>I sat down on the bench and I noticed a bride and groom over to the right of me getting their picture taken by the fountain. She was beautiful in her white wedding dress, and he was equally handsome in his black tuxedo. They looked happy. I smiled; this was the perfect place to get married and that would make the perfect painting.</p><p>I was half way done drawing them when my phone rang. I looked at the unfamiliar number and ignored the call. A second later the phone rang again displaying the same number. I\u2019m sure whoever it was had the wrong number, so I answered it to tell them to stop calling. I froze as I heard the voice on the other end.</p><p>\u201cHello Miss Lane, are you enjoying Central Park?\u201d I started to get creeped out as I looked around from side to side and then behind me; that is when I saw Connor walking towards the bench I was sitting on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am Mr. Black and it looks like you are to.\u201d I hung up as he approached me.</p><p>I gasped when I saw him. He had a way of making me do that and I hated it. He was dressed in a pair of khakis and a button down white cotton shirt with his sleeves rolled to his elbows. His hair, as usual, was perfectly tousled, and his sun-kissed skin glowed in the sunlight. I frowned at him as he sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get my phone number; I do not remember giving it to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have my ways of finding out anything about anybody Miss Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re a stalker then?\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed, \u201cNo Ellery, I\u2019m not a stalker. I just wanted your number in case I needed you to help me home some night.\u201d I glared at him but was secretly smiling underneath.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenny pointed out that he saw you walking down the street, and I asked him to stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I curiously asked. He pursed his lips together as I could tell he was getting irritated with my questions.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just thought I\u2019d say hi, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you could have just called, since you have my number and all.\u201d</p><p>He heavily sighed, \u201cMiss Lane, enough with the questions please.\u201d</p><p>I laughed silently because I was pissing him off again and I loved it.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you one more thing?\u201d He looked at me and frowned. God he was sexy when he did that. It\u2019s a sin to look that good.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you please stop calling me Miss Lane and call me Ellery?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and cocked his head, \u201cIt would be my pleasure Ellery.\u201d I liked the way my name rolled off his tongue.</p><p>Connor glanced over at my pad and saw the scribble of two people on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drawing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bride and groom over there,\u201d I pointed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, they\u2019re a cute couple, and I think it would make a good painting. I\u2019ll call it A Wedding in Central Park.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what makes you think someone would buy that?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at his bluntness; I knew it was only a matter of time.</p><p>\u201cPeople love weddings and any couple that got married here would buy it as a memory of the beginning of their life together.\u201d</p><p>Connor lifted up his chin, \u201cIt\u2019s all a bunch of shit if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d I asked as I looked at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWeddings, starting a life together, relationships, all of it, you said nothing lasts forever.\u201d</p><p>I was surprised by his words and his hatred for relationships. I could see the pain in his beautiful green eyes; he must have been badly hurt. I looked down and continued drawing.</p><p>\u201cWell, a lot of people believe in the happily ever after and the fairytale relationships, let\u2019s not take that away from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in any of that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I thought once I did, but I\u2019m not so sure anymore.\u201d I continued drawing.</p><p>He took his hand and lightly grabbed my wrist, turning it over and softly rubbing my scar with his thumb. I wanted to pull away, but his touch froze me; he was so warm and soft and what he was doing sent fire through my body.</p><p>\u201cTell me about these scars,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>My heart started racing as he let go and let my hand fall back to my pad. I stared at him, why did he care? I have not known him long enough to share my secrets; hell, I don\u2019t know him at all.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake; I was young and stupid; that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is young and stupid from time to time, but they do not try to kill themselves,\u201d he snapped. It was almost as if he was taking this personally. I sighed and remained calm.</p><p>\u201cConnor, you don\u2019t know me or anything about me. We are not friends remember, so what happened to me in my past is none of your business.\u201d There I said it. I put him in his place and politely told him to back off.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he said as he looked straight ahead.</p><p>I started to feel a bit of regret for my tone. I got up from the bench. \u201cI\u2019m starving, would you like a hot dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want a hot dog; if you are hungry then I\u2019ll take you to a proper restaurant for lunch.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I turned my back to him and started walking away, \u201cSuit yourself Mr. Black, but I\u2019m going to get me a hot dog from the hot dog stand.\u201d I heard him mumble something under his breath, and before I knew it, he was walking beside me.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever listen to anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d he mumbled under his breath thinking I didn\u2019t hear him, but I did. I casually smiled and kept walking. We reached the hot dog vendor, and I looked at Connor.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting one?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me and growled at the vendor, \u201cGive me two hotdogs.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my hot dog and apologized to the vendor and whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s mad because I\u2019m forcing him to eat a hot dog when he wanted a fancy lunch.\u201d</p><p>The vendor and I laughed as Connor walked over to a wooden table. I walked over to the condiment stand and topped my hot dog with relish, onions, ketchup and mustard. I grabbed a bunch of napkins and sat down next to Connor at the small picnic table. He looked over at my hot dog and then at me with disgust in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat is gross,\u201d he said as he took a bite of his plain hot dog.</p><p>\u201cGross, no way man, this is heaven,\u201d I took a large bite and watched him stare at me as I chewed.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize how bad that is for you, right?\u201d</p><p>I put my finger up, \u201cYou only live once, make the best of it.\u201d</p><p>He tried to hold back a smile, but I saw it and it made me smile back. I shoved my hot dog at him.</p><p>\u201cHere take a bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, get that thing out of my face,\u201d he frowned.</p><p>\u201cNot until you take a bite Connor, then you can judge if it\u2019s gross.\u201d</p><p>I kept moving the hot dog closer to his mouth as he rolled his eyes and finally took a bite. He chewed it, and I laughed at the glob of ketchup he had in the corner of his mouth. I took a napkin and wiped it. Instantly, he put his hand on mine like he wanted to jerk it away, but he didn\u2019t and he stared at me with fear in his eyes. I took the napkin away and smiled as if I didn\u2019t notice his reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou had ketchup right there, and I didn\u2019t want it to get on your shirt.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his head, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>The afternoon in Central Park was beautiful. The sun was shining down keeping a bit of warmth in the air. The tips of the leaves were starting to change letting everyone know that fall is approaching. The birds were chirping, and the squirrels were running around gathering up supplies to make their nests for the winter.</p><p>\u201cI want to ask you something,\u201d Connor said as he looked at me. I took the last bite of my hot dog and wiped my mouth.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave some thought to our recent outing, and I was wondering if you would be interested in being?\u201d he stopped.</p><p>\u201cBeing?\u201d I motioned for him to proceed.</p><p>He cleared his throat and took in a sharp breath, \u201cWould you be interested in being a companion?\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d He heavily sighed at the fact that I did not get what he was trying to say.</p><p>\u201cWould you be interested in being a person who would accompany me to certain functions, no strings attached, and I would pay you of course?\u201d I was in the middle of drinking my water when I spit it out.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You mean like an escort or call girl,\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cNO, NO, that is not what I meant Ellery,\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cI mean like a friend.\u201d I lightly smiled at him because that was so hard for him to say.</p><p>\u201cYou mean go out as friends, like me and Peyton?\u201d He ran his hands through his luxurious hair. I lightly touched his arm.</p><p>\u201cConnor, if you want to be friends then all you had to do was ask. Actually, I already considered us friends, and there will be no money involved either.\u201d He pursed his lips and a small smile escaped them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a benefit I need to attend tomorrow night. It is a charity function, and I need to be there to represent my company, would you like to go?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip as I sweetly smiled at him, \u201cI would love to go.\u201d He smiled back as we got up from the table and started making our way out of Central Park.</p><p>\u201cI will pick you up at 6pm sharp,\u201d he said looking straight ahead. I silently smiled because I felt different when I was with him. I liked the feeling, but then I hated it to because nothing can happen between us, and I needed to be extremely careful that nothing did.</p><p>Just as we were leaving I heard someone call my name, \u201cElle?\u201d I looked to the side and time stopped as I saw Kyle walking towards me. Connor stopped walking when I did and looked at me; he knew something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cElle, how are you?\u201d Kyle asked in a confused tone. I took in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great Kyle how are you?\u201d I managed to smile.</p><p>A few feet behind him stood a woman with jet black hair and boobs so fake, I bet they would pop if I poked them with my finger. I looked over at her as she was eye f**king Connor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, who is this?\u201d he asked, pointing to Connor.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry; this is my friend Connor Black.\u201d Connor extended his hand, and the two of them shook. My stomach was in knots and so desperately wanted to throw up.</p><p>\u201cElle, you look good,\u201d he smiled as he looked me up and down.</p><p>I faked a smile as Kyle\u2019s little plastic bimbo came walking up and introduced herself.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Angela; you must be Kyle\u2019s ex?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cYep that\u2019s me; Kyle\u2019s ex.\u201d</p><p>She would not stop looking at Connor and seducing him with her eyes. It was making me uncomfortable. She was practically salivating. I pulled Kyle over to the side.</p><p>\u201cTame your dog Kyle; she is embarrassing you.\u201d</p><p>He glared at me, \u201cAngela, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at Connor who was steadily smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, you are just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what Connor?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just full of life, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d he laughed. I shook my head as we left Central Park.</p><p>Denny had the Limo parked and was waiting for Connor. \u201cAre you getting in?\u201d Connor asked as he pointed to the car.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m walking,\u201d I said as I started down the street.</p><p>\u201cElle, get in the car,\u201d he demanded. I smiled because for the first time he called me Elle, which was his way of letting me know we were friends. My back was turned as I walked away and waved.</p><p>\u201cBye Connor, see ya tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I heard him sigh, and the car door shut. I walked a majority of the way with Connor\u2019s Limo following me. I finally turned the corner and stopped. He rolled down the window.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to get in now?\u201d he smiled.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and opened the door. I smacked him on the arm and told him to move over. Denny was watching me through the rear view mirror and he was lightly laughing. We reached my apartment, and as I was getting out of the Limo, Connor surprised me by lightly grabbing my hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for going tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I crinkled my nose and smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d</p><p>I walked in the door and leaned up against it sliding down till I was on the floor. I cupped my face in my hands and thought about the fire that ignited in my body when he touched me. I was headed for trouble, and I already knew it.</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>I awoke the next morning to a text message from Peyton saying she was on her way over with coffee and bagels. I rolled out of bed just as Peyton was ready to break down the door.</p><p>\u201cSome friend you are,\u201d she spouted as she flew past me to set the coffee and bag on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d I yawned.</p><p>\u201cI waited all night for you to call me and tell me about your day with Connor and you never did,\u201d she pouted. Peyton loved to pout, and she was such a natural at it. She once told me that she could make a guy do anything just by pouting.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about yesterday?\u201d</p> <p>She looked down and took a sip of her coffee. \u201cKyle told me,\u201d she said as if it was no big deal.</p><p>\u201cWHAT?\u201d I scowled. Peyton pulled a bagel out of the bag and handed it to me.</p><p>\u201cHe called me and said he saw the two of you in Central Park and wanted to know how long you have been seeing each other; I could tell he was jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell does Kyle think he is? Did he forget he is the one who left me and he is the one moving on by dating a plastic bitch?\u201d</p><p>She leaned over table, \u201cI told him Connor was your f**k buddy and to get over it.\u201d</p><p>I lightly grabbed her arm, \u201cYou did not.\u201d</p> <p>Peyton held up two fingers; I swear to God I did.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes as I held my coffee cup in my hands. \u201cWho does he think he is?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me as she got up to get a knife from the drawer. \u201cHe\u2019s a douchebag Elle, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and was startled by a knock at the door. I strangely looked over at Peyton and got up to see who it was. I looked out the peep-hole and saw a tall attractive woman standing there. I opened the door as I was still in my pajama pants and tank top.</p><p>\u201cMiss Ellery Lane?\u201d The woman asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Ellery Lane.\u201d She pushed her way through the door.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d she said as she waved her hand and 3 other women with garment bags followed behind her.</p><p>\u201cUmm, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I looked over at Peyton as she sat at the table with her mouth open.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Lane, I\u2019m Camille, and we\u2019re from Saks Fifth Avenue. Mr. Black sent us to have you pick a dress for tonight\u2019s event. He described you, so we chose which dresses we felt would suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit Elle,\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>I stood there as the women unpacked the garment bags pulling out the most beautiful and expensive dresses I\u2019ve ever seen. I tried on each one feeling like Cinderella. Peyton was giving me thumbs up at the dresses she liked. The tall woman applauded as I tried on each dress. The last dress I put on was a Badgley Mischka black strapless lace gown. I gasped when I looked in the mirror because I had never worn anything more beautiful. Peyton had a tear in her eye as she took my hands in hers and looked me over.</p><p>\u201cYou look absolutely stunning Elle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much, I can\u2019t accept this or let Connor do this for me.\u201d</p><p>Camille walked over and handed me a pair of Jimmy Choo strappy heels. \u201cPut these on dear and let the man buy you a new dress; trust me, if he did not think you were worth it, he would not have done this.\u201d I looked at Peyton and took the shoes from Camille.</p><p>\u201cConnors not a douchebag let him buy you a dress and definitely those shoes,\u201d Peyton smiled.</p><p>I rolled my eyes as I stood in a designer dress and Jimmy Choos. I felt incredible. I grabbed my phone and sent Connor a quick text.</p><p>\u201cHi it\u2019s me Ellery, thank you for the beautiful dress, but it is too much and I do not feel right accepting it.\u201d Seconds later he replied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome and it is not too much, see you at 6pm sharp.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Camille, \u201cI like this one,\u201d I said as I ran my hands down my body. She snapped her fingers signaling the other women to pack up the other dresses.</p><p>\u201cMr. Black will be immensely pleased you chose his favorite,\u201d Camille smiled as she walked out the door. I stood in the middle of the room trying to figure out what Camille meant by his favorite dress. Did he go to the store himself and pick a bunch out for her to bring to me? Then I wondered if this was a habit of his for all his women.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overthinking Elle,\u201d Peyton said as she unzipped the back of my dress. \u201cGo put your other clothes back on; you do not want to ruin this before tonight. I\u2019m going to call Roger and see if he\u2019s available to do your hair and makeup, he owes me a big favor.\u201d</p><p>I went to the bedroom and put on a pair of jeans and a tank top with a sick feeling in my stomach. My phone rang, and that familiar number was calling again, I ignored it and sent them to voicemail.</p><p>Peyton and I took a cab to Color Me Beautiful, a hair salon our friend Roger owns. We walked through the doors of the luxury salon as Roger spotted us instantly. He walked over and embraced me tightly.</p><p>\u201cOh girl, I heard about you and Kyle and I think he\u2019s an a**hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Roger I think he is to,\u201d I lightly smiled. He turned to Peyton and gave her a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cNow, tell me where you are going tonight and with whom.\u201d</p><p>Peyton jumped in, \u201cShe\u2019s going to a charity event with Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Connor Black? Hot and gorgeous millionaire Connor Black?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cYes Roger, that\u2019s the one.\u201d He looked at me seriously.</p><p>\u201cElle, you do know about his reputation right?\u201d I looked blank because I didn\u2019t know anything about Connor except his one rule about sleepovers and that he didn\u2019t like relationships.</p><p>\u201cWe are friends, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Roger waved his hand in front of his face. \u201cGirl, Connor Black doesn\u2019t have female friends; he has sex slaves, not friends.\u201d I gulped and didn\u2019t want to hear anymore. Peyton could tell I was feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what he has; I\u2019m going to this benefit tonight as his friend and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on Roger, work your magic and fix up our girl so every guy at the event will be begging her to take them home.\u201d I smacked Peyton\u2019s arm as we followed Roger to his station.</p><p>I met Roger through Peyton. He used to work at the art gallery part-time while he was trying to launch his salon. He was a handsome man with brown spiked hair and just the right amount of facial hair outlining his oval face. He cut hair and did makeup like nobody\u2019s business. He once worked as a hair stylist for Miranda Lambert, but gave that up to stay in one place and build a life with his partner George. I sat in the chair while Roger worked his magic on my hair and face. I never felt more beautiful as I did that day.</p><p>I stepped into my designer dress and Jimmy Choos and looked in the mirror at my lightly made up face and elegant curly up-do. For the first time, in a terribly long time, I forgot about all the bad in my life. I glanced at the clock, and it read 6:00 pm. I rolled my eyes as there was a knock. As promised, he arrived at 6:00 sharp. I opened the door as Connor stood there staring at me and taking in a sharp breath. The butterflies in my stomach started to flutter, and my heart started racing as I looked at him in his black tuxedo.</p><p>\u201cWere you afraid I\u2019d get mugged between my door and your car?\u201d I smirked.</p><p>\u201cVery funny Ellery,\u201d he said.</p><p>I was surprised that he came to the door himself instead of sending Denny. I bumped my shoulder against his, and he managed a small smile. We got into the back of the Limo and Connor poured us a glass of champagne.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful Ellery; nice dress.\u201d I looked at him, stomach still fluttering and heart racing.</p><p>\u201cThank you Connor I was hoping you would like this one,\u201d I winked as he smirked and we held our glasses up to one another.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>The charity was for the Autism Speaks Foundation. It was to support the biomedical research for the causes and treatments of autism in children and adults. Denny opened my door as Connor came around the other side to meet me. He held out his arm and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can behave yourself tonight?\u201d I put my arm in his and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I cannot make any promises.\u201d</p><p>We walked to the entrance and stepped inside. The ballroom was breathtaking as were the people who attended. Connor led me over to a reserved table with his company\u2019s name on it. I sat down taking notice of the pilasters around the room as well as the beautifully carved ceilings. The walls were painted in a beige color with mahogany trim as were the chairs that sat at each table. A band and dance floor sat in the middle of the room. Off to the side was a large wrap around bar that was complimented by the same mahogany wood and marble tops.</p><p>Connor went to the bar to get our drinks. Apparently, he didn\u2019t have the patience to wait for the waitresses and waiters walking around the room with drinks on their trays. He came back with a glass of white wine for me and a scotch for himself. Even as beautiful as the ballroom was, Connor was the most beautiful person there, and I could not help but stare at him. He lightly grabbed my elbow and escorted me over to a couple who were staring our way. Even the slightest touch of his hand sent my body into convulsions.</p><p>\u201cGood evening Connor,\u201d the older gentleman said as he shook his hand.</p><p>\u201cHello, Robert, I would like you to meet Ellery Lane, a friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and lightly kissed it, \u201cYou have beautiful friends Connor.\u201d</p><p>I gently smiled at his comment and looked over at his wife who was eyeing me up and down.</p><p>\u201cThis is my wife, Courtney,\u201d Robert smiled.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she smiled at me.</p><p>Courtney was extremely attractive, and she was about 25 years younger than her husband. Robert put his arm around Connor and walked him over to the side whispering so we could not hear. Connor shook his head, and the two of them came back to where we were standing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked at me at strangely for even asking, \u201cJust business.\u201d</p><p>He lightly put his hand on the small of my back and escorted me back to the table while he excused himself to the restroom. I was taking in the beautiful sound of the band playing soft melodies as Courtney came over and sat next to me.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Connors new toy,\u201d she remarked. I looked at her trying to absorb what she meant.</p><p>\u201cConnor and I are nothing more than friends.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cRight, well I\u2019m only saying this for your own sake, woman to woman because you seem like an innocent and nice person, stay away from Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at her then looked around to see if Connor was on his way back. \u201cWhy would you say something like that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause Connor will use you till he emotionally breaks you down and physically wears you out; then he will toss you to the side like a piece of trash.\u201d She got up from her seat and put her hand on my arm, \u201cJust some friendly advice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked away and left me sitting there pondering her words. The way she spoke led me to believe that she was a victim of Connors. I did not want to think about it as I got up and headed to the bar for another glass of wine. I glanced over to the side where there was a small hallway and raised my eyebrow when I saw Connor talking to the same woman who slapped him at the club. His eyes looked angered as he grabbed her arm and led her out of sight. My stomach tied itself in knots, what the hell was I doing here? I don\u2019t even know anything about this man I was with.</p><p>I was standing at the bar when a gentleman approached me. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Andrew, I was wondering if a beautiful woman such as you would like to share a dance with me?\u201d I looked around, and Connor was nowhere to be found, the nerve of him just to leave me alone like this.</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mind dancing with Andrew; he was handsome with brown hair and hazel eyes. He was tall, and as he put his arm around my waist, I could feel his strength. Before we had a chance to finish our conversation, Connor came up from behind.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me Andrew, but she is here with me.\u201d</p><p>Andrew looked at Connor. \u201cMr. Black, I apologize I did not know she was yours.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away as Connor took his place. His? I\u2019m not his or anybody else\u2019s. Connor stared at me as he put his arm around my waist and took my hand in his, \u201cI leave you alone for a minute and you go off and start dancing with strange men.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him, \u201cYou leave me alone to go disappear with the woman who slapped you at Club S.\u201d</p><p>His look turned to fire, \u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, \u201cYes, I think a lot of people saw that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight, you saw me before you found me drunk outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was sitting at the bar, why?\u201d</p><p>The corners of his sexy mouth curved up, \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head at him, \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting?\u201d Then it hit me. \u201cOh I get it, you think I had my eyes set on you from the start.\u201d</p><p>He wickedly smiled at me, \u201cYour words Miss Lane, not mine.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes and leaned into him, taking in his alluring scent as I whispered in his ear, \u201cYou are a delusional man Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy this specific charity?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked at me and took in a breath, \u201cWhy not?\u201d I dropped the subject about the woman in the hallway and where he disappeared to, but I would not let this one go.</p><p>\u201cWhy though?\u201d</p><p>He stopped looking at me and looked straight into the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s just a charity my company is involved with, why is it so important that you know a specific reason?\u201d His words came across cold, almost as if he didn\u2019t trust me enough to tell me.</p><p>\u201cJust forget I asked,\u201d I kept my eyes straight ahead refusing to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when I\u2019m mad Mr. Black,\u201d I responded.</p> <p>The song ended, and we walked back to the table that was now filled with some associates from Black Enterprises. Connor went around and introduced me to some of his staff. I glanced over at the next table, and there she sat, the beautiful tall woman from the club. Her straight, jet black hair sat just above her shoulders, and her tanned skin glowed beneath the ballroom lights. She sparkled in her silver long dress and silver high stilettos. Diamonds took their place in her ears and neckline, and she did not miss a beat when it came to applying makeup. She was a stunning woman, and she kept staring at me, or should I say glaring at me.</p><p>Dinner consisted of Filet Mignon or Fish. Connor took the liberty to order me the Filet since he felt I needed to put some meat on my bones as he so kindly put it. During dinner, a man stepped up to thank everyone for coming and thanked Black Enterprises for donating five hundred thousand dollars to the charity; everyone applauded.</p><p>I excused myself to the restroom as I heard someone call my name. I turned around and froze when I saw Dr. Taub coming out of the men\u2019s bathroom.</p><p>\u201cEllery, fancy meeting you here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDr. Taub, I am here as someone\u2019s guest and would appreciate it if he did not see us talking.\u201d My stomach felt sick, and my heart was beating faster.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t returned my calls or rescheduled your appointments. You need to finish our sessions Miss Lane; it\u2019s important and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Taub,\u201d I whispered as I looked around to make sure no one, especially Connor, saw us talking, \u201cI will, just give me some time please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime is not on your side Ellery, it is important you schedule your appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot talk about this here, please Dr. Taub.\u201d He walked away shaking his head.</p><p>I walked into the restroom and checked my hair and makeup. I glossed up my lips, and as I opened the door to step out, I was startled to see Connor standing against the wall with his arms folded. He glared at me as I spoke, \u201cUh, hi? Why are you standing there like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have been gone for quite a while and I was checking to make sure you are ok. I was giving you five more seconds before I was opening the door and coming in after you.\u201d</p><p>I walked away from him, \u201cWow, stalker much?\u201d</p><p>I heard him sigh, \u201cI\u2019m not a stalker for the last time; I was concerned for your safety.\u201d I rolled my eyes; he had safety issues, and it was starting to annoy me.</p><p>We walked back to the table, and as we passed the \u201cone\u201d next to us, Connor looked over at the tall beautiful woman. She smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cI am if you are.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and we walked outside where Denny was waiting for us. He stopped and turned to me, \u201cI\u2019m going to have Denny take you home, I have something I need to wrap up here.\u201d He took my hand and lightly kissed it, \u201cThank you for coming with me tonight; I hope you had a good time.\u201d His lips were warm on my skin, but I too was focused on the fact that he was not coming to drive me home.</p><p>I looked into his eyes, \u201cI had a wonderful time, thank you for inviting me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and opened the door. I slid in the back seat and waved goodbye trying to hide the disappointment in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood evening Miss Lane,\" Denny said as he looked in the rearview mirror. \u201cHi Denny,\u201d I replied as I looked out the window.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>The night air was exceptionally warm for September, and I wanted to do something other than go home to an empty apartment. \u201cDenny, could you please drive me to the beach?\u201d</p><p>He looked up in the rearview mirror, \u201cSorry Miss Lane, but my orders were to take you straight home.\u201d</p><p>I politely smiled, \u201cDenny, either you can drive me to the beach or I will call a cab the minute you drop me off at home. Mr. Black does not own me nor does he have the right to tell me what to do. I do not care if he told you to take me home; I\u2019m telling you otherwise. Now, please drop me off at the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine Miss Lane, if you say so,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>\u201cI do say so and if Mr. Black has a problem with it, then I will deal with him.\u201d</p><p>I took off my shoes and carried them as my feet hit the soft warm sand. The ocean looked beautiful at night with the moonlight shining down, illuminating each wave that pushed its way to the shore. I threw my shoes down and ran to the edge of the water. I laughed as the cold water stung my feet making me feel alive and exhilarated. The peaceful sound of the waves lapping against the shore and the sweet smell of the salt water was enough to let me escape into a world of my own, a world I created. I was enjoying the serenity of my world when I heard, \u201cWhat the hell do you think you are doing?\u201d I sighed for I knew all too well that angered voice. I turned my head to see Connor standing a few feet away from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here Connor; don\u2019t you have things to wrap up?\u201d I considered the possibility that his wrapping something up involved sex and the tall beautiful woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because you didn\u2019t make it home and forced my driver to disobey my orders,\u201d his voice sounded angry.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was such a beautiful night, and I wanted to be here; it\u2019s my favorite place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a time and place for here Ellery and now is neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, but I\u2019m not done here yet, and I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>He raised his voice, \u201cEllery Lane let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Who the f**k does this man think he is? \u201cDon\u2019t be so grouchy and if you want me to go then you will have to catch me,\u201d I laughed as I started running down the beach.</p><p>\u201cFor f**k sake Elle, you\u2019re pissing me off,\u201d he yelled as he started chasing after me.</p><p>I turned my head and looked behind me as he was catching up; I swear I saw a small smile escape his lips. He was a good runner, but he had an advantage, he wasn\u2019t wearing a long dress. I started to run out of breath and slow down as he came up from behind me, picked me up and put me over his shoulder. I kicked and screamed, \u201cPut me down Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance, you will just run again, and I\u2019m done playing games.\u201d</p><p>Out of breath I said, \u201cI won\u2019t I promise, anyway I\u2019m out of breath if you couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>He gently put me down, and I sat on the sand. He looked down at me shaking his head as I held out my hand for him to sit next to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sitting in the sand in this tuxedo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive a little Connor, life is too short,\u201d I said as I stared out into the moonlit water. He sighed and sat down next to me.</p><p>We sat in silence for a moment, and I was feeling somewhat emotional; I\u2019m blaming the wine, when I started to speak.</p><p>\u201cIt was my sixteenth birthday when I was diagnosed with cancer.\u201d I felt him look at me as I just stared ahead listening to the whispers of the ocean. \u201cHey, happy sweet sixteen, guess what, you have cancer.\u201d I felt the tears starting to sting my eyes.</p><p>Connor took my hand and whispered, \u201cYou do not have to do this.\u201d I would not look at him because if I stared into his beautiful green eyes I would have lost it. I proceeded with my story.</p><p>\u201cI could not bear the thought of my father having to go through that torture and pain again like he did with my mother, so I decided I was going to spare him from having to.</p><p>\u201cEllery,\u201d he whispered as he leaned closer to me.</p><p>\u201cHe was going out on one of his drinking binges, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t be home till the middle of the night, if at all, so that was my opportunity to put my plan into action. I filled the bathtub with hot water, laid back and took a razor blade to both my wrists.\u201d I heard him take in a sharp breath as he was gently rubbing my scar with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe it was the one night he forgot his wallet and came back to the house; talk about fate right? He found me and called 911. I almost didn\u2019t make it; I had lost so much blood.\u201d</p><p>Connor didn\u2019t say a word, but he didn\u2019t have to; I could tell he was choked up.</p><p>\u201cI guess God had other plans for me. I went through a year of chemo and went into remission. I was given a second chance at life, and for that I\u2019m grateful. Like I said yesterday, I was young and stupid, and I made a terrible mistake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Connor let go of my hand, put his arm around me and pulled me into him. I rested my head on his shoulder. He was firm, and it felt good to be held.</p><p>\u201cThat is why you have this overwhelming need to help others isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked as he lightly kissed the top of my head. \u201cYou\u2019re a good person Ellery Lane,\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p><p>I smiled and closed my eyes. I felt his strong arms pick me up as he carried me across the sand and to his car, which was not his Limo, it was a Range Rover. He carefully laid me in the front seat as I stirred; he whispered, \u201cSleep angel.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up to my apartment, opened my purse to find my keys then carried me to the door. My arms were tightly wrapped around his neck. He inserted the key into the lock and lightly kicked the door open with his foot. He carried me to the bedroom and laid me gently on the bed. I was somewhat aware of what he was doing, but I was too exhausted to move.</p> <p>He covered me with a blanket and brought the back of his hand to my cheek as he softly rubbed it, \u201cSleep well angel and sweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>The next morning was a work day, and I did not have to be there till noon. I dragged my ass out of bed and got out of my evening gown. I was thankful he didn\u2019t undress me, ok maybe I wanted him to because the moments we shared on the beach was something I never wanted to forget. I felt something change in him last night.</p><p>I stood under the hot water and let it overtake me. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Connor and how sweet and gentle he was with me last night. I exposed my deepest secret to him, and now regret was settling in. I should not have shown him that side of me; it was too dangerous. I dressed in my leggings and long tunic top, put my hair up in a ponytail and headed to the kitchen to make some coffee. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of stupidity for telling him; sometimes I just do not know when to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>As I waited for the coffee to brew, I went in my purse and grabbed my phone; there was a text message from Connor.</p> <p>\u201cHi, I hope you slept well, I just wanted to see if you were up and how you were feeling.\u201d</p><p>A small smile escaped me as I replied, \u201cGood morning, I slept good and I\u2019m feeling fine, thank you for your concern. I hope you have a terrific day and don\u2019t work too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you are feeling fine, and I always work hard, it\u2019s why I\u2019m as successful as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that and thank you for taking care of me last night, I owe you one!</p><p>\u201cConsider it repayment for when you got me home safe. I have a meeting TTYL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p> <p>I poured some coffee into a mug that read: \u201cI\u2019m not gay, but my ex-boyfriend is,\u201d compliments of Peyton. I walked over at the desk that housed my laptop, opened the drawer and took out the piece of paper that sits neatly on top of a magazine. I looked over the paper and with a pen I scribbled on it and put it back in its place till I needed it again.</p><p>I stepped outside and walked down the street, I had an hour before I had to be at work, so I decided to walk the few blocks it took to get there. The air was cooler today as the sun hid behind a stream of clouds. Today was a different sight than it had been in months. People had broken into their fall wardrobe and pulled out the \u201cchilly\u201d day clothes. Pants, long sleeves, cardigans and light jackets graced the streets of New York City as people prepared for the arrival of fall.</p><p>I passed Starbucks on my way to work, and of course, I had to stop as if I needed more caffeine. I walked in and stood in a line that took up half the caf\u00e9. I reached in my bag and grabbed my phone, I promised Peyton I would call and tell her about last night. I dialed her number and waited for her to answer; after a few rings it went to voicemail.</p><p>\u201cHey Peyton, it\u2019s me, I had a fabulous time last night with Connor. I\u2019m on my way to work, call me later for girl talk, love ya.\u201d</p><p>It was finally my turn as I ordered a Grande Cinnamon Dolce Latte. I paid the barista and walked outside with my coffee in hand and on my way to work. As I walked down the crowded street, I noticed a black Limo parked across from a tall building. The Limo door opened as a familiar woman got out and then came Connor, following her and adjusting his tie. My stomach felt sick and my heart started racing, not out of passion, but out of nerves. He looked over and saw me standing there a few feet away. I couldn\u2019t let him know the rage and jealousy I was feeling at that moment seeing them together, so I smiled and waved just like any friend would do. His face looked pained when he saw me. He did not smile back; he could only manage a small wave. They walked up to the tall building and went inside. As I walked past, I noticed the name of the business on the large double doors, \u201cBlack Enterprises.\u201d I never realized that is what this building was as I passed it all the time.</p><p>I continued walking as a wave of betrayal coursed through my veins. There was no reason for me to feel this way. Connor and I are friends and nothing more; there could never be more. I struggled with my emotions all the way to work and tried to reason with myself that he did nothing wrong. If he and I were going to remain friends, then I would have to get used to seeing him with other women. He was not mine, and I was not his. I kept saying that as I finally arrived at work.</p><p>It was a slow day at work, which sucked because it gave me more time to think about Connor and the tall beautiful woman that got out of the Limo. I had no right to even think about them, but after the moment we shared last night, I could not help but wonder that maybe he had feelings for me. Whom was I kidding? Connor Black is a player, and I\u2019ve already been warned about him. I needed to do some serious soul-searching, and the best place to do that was at my favorite pizza place.</p><p>The workday finally ended. I grabbed my phone and purse and headed out the door. I came to a standstill when I saw Denny leaning up against the Limo parked at the curb. I narrowed my eyes at him.</p> <p>\u201cHi Denny, what are you doing here?\u201d I curiously asked.</p><p>\u201cHello Miss Lane, Mr. Black sent me to pick you up and take you to the restaurant where he will meet you in 15 minutes for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I asked as I put my hands on my hips. He looked at me with a smirk on his face because he knew what was coming next.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell Mr. Black that I am not available this evening. I have other plans.\u201d</p><p>I started walking away as I turned my head back, \u201cAlso, tell him that if he wants to have dinner with me then he can pick up the phone and ask me.\u201d I put my hand up and waved, \u201cBye Denny have a great night.\u201d</p><p>Pizzapopolous was a couple of blocks away, and the chilly evening air was settling in. I sat down at a table close to the window and opened the menu. The restaurant was small with about 20 tables that took up the space. The white walls were decorated with photographs of all the celebrities that dined there. The tables were decorated with red and white gingham tablecloths and white napkins. The atmosphere was casual and quaint, and they had the best pizza.</p><p>I was digging through my purse for my phone when I saw the shadow of someone sit down across from me. I looked up, and there was Connor glaring at me; I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is where you want to have dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I tilted my head to the side and looked at his smoldering face, \u201cYes Connor, this is where I\u2019m having dinner tonight, and I don\u2019t believe you were invited.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand over his heart, \u201cOuch that stings Ellery. I invited you to dinner, and you turned me down, so I took it upon myself to join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I want company?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on the table and folded them, \u201cI don\u2019t, but since I\u2019m here we might as well dine together,\u201d he said as he looked around the restaurant.</p><p>The whole point of this dinner was for me to do some soul-searching and that was going to be extremely hard with him sitting across from me.</p><p>The waitress came over and started drooling when she asked Connor what he would like to order. He looked the menu up and down and decided on a salad. I looked at him and grabbed the menu out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot sit in a pizza place and only get a salad.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the waitress and cleared my throat to divert her attention away from Connor. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a large deep dish with pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives, a large antipasto salad and an order of bread sticks.\u201d</p><p>Connor brought his finger up and rested it on his lips, \u201cDo you actually think I\u2019m going to eat that pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you are; I know you are,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I set my phone on the table and looked at him. If he so rudely wanted to interrupt my dinner plans, then he will have to answer some questions. \u201cWho is that woman you\u2019re always with?\u201d The words just came out before I could think about them. He shifted in his seat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a friend Ellery,\u201d he softly answered my question. I knew he was lying. Perhaps she was a friend, but what kind of friend is what I wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of friend Connor?\u201d</p><p>His green eyes turned dark as he glared at me, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t matter Ellery; she is a friend and that is all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, \u201cI think after what I told you last night you would be willing to tell me a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of discussing my personal life. It\u2019s called personal for a reason Ellery.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t realize it, but at that moment he made a decision for me. The waitress brought our pizza and put it in the middle of the table along with salad and bread sticks. I picked up a slice of pizza with the spatula and put it on his plate. He sighed and grabbed his fork and knife.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you kidding me? Put that down right now Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>He looked startled, \u201cWhat? What the hell is wrong?\u201d</p><p>I leaned over the table and grabbed the knife and fork out of his hand, \u201cYou are not eating pizza with a knife and fork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how the hell am I supposed to eat it?\u201d</p><p>He was so damn sexy at that moment. I picked up my pizza and took a bite. With a mouthful, I said, \u201cLike this, pick it up and bite into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting and don\u2019t talk with your mouth full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t do it then I will.\u201d I picked up the pizza from his plate and held it up to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBite\u201d I demanded.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at me, \u201cDo you have any idea how sexy that sounds?\u201d he winked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but let out a light laugh as I hit him on his arm. He rolled his eyes, which was sexy as hell, opened his mouth and took a bite of the pizza. I smiled as I put the pizza back on his plate.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYour turn what?\u201d</p><p>He took the pizza from my plate and held it up.</p><p>\u201cBite\u201d he demanded.</p><p>I took a bite, and a wide grin graced his perfect face. I think that may have been the first time since I\u2019ve known him that I\u2019ve seen him smile like that. It was the most beautiful and warm smile I\u2019ve ever seen, and it made my heart flutter.</p><p>We ate more pizza, talked and ate some salad. The waitress kept walking by our table and giving Connor flirtatious smiles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever get sick and tired of all the ogling you get from women?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t you get sick of all the ogling you get from men?\u201d</p><p>I twisted my face in confusion, \u201cI don\u2019t get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you do Ellery, I see it every time I\u2019m with you; the only difference is men are more discreet about it than women are.\u201d</p> <p>I never noticed men ogling me before; I\u2019ll have to start paying more attention. As we were laughing and enjoying our conversation my phone rang; it was my Aunt Patti\u2019s number. I looked at Connor, \u201cI have to get this.\u201d He nodded his head and took out his phone.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answered. The voice on the other end was my cousin Debbie.</p><p>\u201cEllery, it\u2019s Debbie, I wanted to let you know that mom and dad were...\u201d she started sobbing, \u201cIn a car accident, and they both were killed.\u201d</p><p>Her sobs grew harder as a tear fell down my cheek. Connor looked at me and reached for my hand resting on the table. \u201cDebbie, I\u2019m so sorry; I will be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Elle, I\u2019ll call you with the details.\u201d</p> <p>I hung up and looked at Connor who was staring at me with a worried look in his eye, \u201cEllery, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt and uncle were killed in a car accident. I need to get out of here Connor.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my purse and took out some money. Connor grabbed it from my hands and shoved it back in my purse, \u201cI got this.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t fall apart in front of him; I had to hold it together, at least till I got home, when I was alone.</p><p>He threw some money on the table and followed me out of the restaurant. My head was in a daze, and I was confused. I looked in both directions forgetting which way I needed to go. He put his arm around me and pulled me into him leading me to where Denny had parked the Limo. I stumbled a few times, but the strength of his arms held me up. He opened the door and helped me in. I slid to the other side as he got in and sat beside me. He didn\u2019t say a word; he only wrapped his arms around me and pulled me into his chest. Feeling the warmth and security of him, I clenched his shirt in my hands and started crying. He rubbed his hand up and down my back as his chin rested on my head. At that moment I didn\u2019t care that he saw me like this, I just needed to be with someone right now, and he was more than willing to be that someone.</p><p>Chapter 14</p> <p>We walked into my apartment. Connor shut the door behind him. I threw my purse on the table and walked to the kitchen to grab a bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Connor asked as he followed closely behind. I scratched my head, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, do you want some wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh no, I really have to go. I have a meeting with someone.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes with my back turned to him because I\u2019m sure his meeting had to do with getting laid. I opened the bottle, poured some into a glass and turned around putting one hand on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThank you Connor, I appreciate everything.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand to my face and gently wiped away a couple of tears that were left with his thumb. \u201cI know you do, and you are welcome.\u201d</p><p>Fire swept through my body heating every part that ached for him at this moment. This was a side of him that was tender and gentle; a side I wanted to know better. My heart started racing, and the butterflies fluttered around every time he touched me. I was vulnerable at this moment, and all I could think about was kissing him passionately. I restrained myself because I was not about to ruin our friendship.</p><p>I patted him on the chest, \u201cYou better go to your meeting Mr. Black; it\u2019s rude to keep someone waiting.\u201d</p> <p>He managed a small smile, \u201cIf you need anything, anything at all, please call me,\u201d he said as he pressed his lips against my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI will, now go have a good night.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door behind him and sat down with my wine. For someone my age, I have experienced death more times than I should have. I needed to call Peyton and let her know what was going on. As I got up and reached for my phone, there was a knock at the door. I looked out the peep-hole and saw Connor standing there.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He walked inside, \u201cPack a bag; you\u2019re staying at my place tonight.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with a stunned look, \u201cNo I\u2019m not. I\u2019m staying home.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cElle, for once, just once, please do as I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child Connor, and frankly you cannot order me around, I thought we had this discussion already?\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the corner of the room where my easel was and looked at the unfinished painting sitting on it. His tone changed, \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be alone tonight after the news you received, and my place has a guest room. I would feel better knowing you were not alone.\u201d</p><p>He struggled with every word he just spoke; I now realized that he had a hard time with emotions.</p><p>\u201cOk Connor, give me a minute.\u201d He nodded his head never taking his eyes off the painting.</p><p>I threw a few things in a bag and walked over to him standing by the easel. \u201cThis is what you were drawing in Central Park, isn\u2019t it? The bride and groom in front of the fountain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I started painting it that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I can see, you are a very talented artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Mr. Black, now let\u2019s go.\u201d He smiled and took my bag from me; he was full of surprises today.</p><p>His penthouse was breathtaking, from the marble floors in the hallway to the white walls and 2 story windows. The living room housed a beautiful dark grey sofa, a large square wood table in the center and 2 leather wingback chairs, in a soft grey. Long curtains hung from the floor to ceiling windows as the marble fireplace was the focal point of the room. Black and white pictures hung vertically on the walls in groups of three with various city scenes from around the world. He came up behind me as I was staring at the pictures.</p><p>\u201cDo you like these?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, \u201cYes, they are beautiful. Where did you get them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took them.\u201d</p><p>I whipped my head around, and the look on my face must have amused him because he started laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou took these?\u201d I emphasized each word.</p><p>\u201cYou look so surprised Ellery. Photography is a hobby of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how would I know that Connor since you refuse to tell me anything about you?\u201d</p><p>I stood there and studied the photographs. I smiled because at that moment I realized we had something in common; we were both artists. I painted pictures and he took them.</p><p>\u201cYour home is beautiful, did you decorate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my sister did.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him confused, \u201cYou have a sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and she is an interior designer, she did this place and my office building.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head up and down, \u201cI get the impression talent runs in the family.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he walked over to his bar, \u201cDrink?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShot of Jack please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhy, does that surprise you?\u201d</p><p>He reached for a shot glass, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t, well, maybe it does; I just don\u2019t know any women who do shots of Jack Daniels straight.\u201d</p><p>He handed me the shot glass as I held it up, \u201cYou do now.\u201d I threw it back as it burned all the way down, but it felt good.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t do sleepovers Mr. Black?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and grinned, \u201cI don\u2019t Miss Lane. I never have, but tonight I made an exception for a friend.\u201d He emphasized the word friend. \u201cBecause I felt she shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d He poured another shot and held up the glass.</p><p>\u201cOne more shot?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to get me drunk?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me in that sexy way that made my body ache. \u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>I threw back the shot and sat down on the couch. Connor walked over with his glass of scotch and sat next to me, \u201cAre you ok?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked up at him and sighed, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I was just thinking of how I\u2019ll be able to visit my mom and dad\u2019s grave when I\u2019m back in Michigan.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, blue eyes staring into green and seriously spoke, \u201cWhen I die, I don\u2019t want a funeral. I don\u2019t want people staring at my dead body and crying over me. I want to be cremated and have my ashes scattered around Paris.\u201d</p><p>Connor stared at me and gave me an irritated look. \u201cStop talking like that; you have many years to decide what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, I\u2019m serious, I want people to drink and celebrate me. I want them to remember the good times, not mourn in the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, you need to stop because you are talking as if you\u2019re going to die tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know what each day will bring, that is why I say nothing lasts forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, I think Mr. Daniels has gotten to you, let\u2019s get some sleep, I have to work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>We walked upstairs and he showed me to my room. \u201cGood night Elle, sleep well,\u201d he said as he walked out and towards his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cGood night Connor.\u201d</p><p>I changed into my nightshirt and climbed into the comfy king size bed that occupied the room. I took in the luxurious feel of the satin sheets as I looked around at the classically decorated room. The taupe walls with carved moldings were astounding. There was a beige dresser with a large round mirror that sat above it and matching night stands on each side of the bed. The large window had built-in bookcases on each side with a window seat that was covered with the same material as the bed comforter. I could curl up here and stay forever residing in its beauty and comfort.</p><p>It was too late to call Peyton, so I decided to text her and let her know what was going on.</p><p>\u201cI got some terrible news today. My cousin called me earlier; my aunt and uncle died in a car accident. I\u2019ll be going back to Michigan in a couple of days for the funeral. I wanted you to know so you didn\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOMG, I\u2019m so sorry, do you want me to come over? You shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m fine, and I\u2019m staying at Connors tonight; he was with me when I got the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously Elle? What the hell is going on between the two of you? Did you sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO! We\u2019re just friends, and I\u2019m staying in the guest room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up and get into that mans bed, let him make you forget about everything bad, at least for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLOL, good night Peyton, I\u2019ll keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive Elle! Have you ever heard of friends with benefits? Nighty night...\u201d</p><p>She was right, when I\u2019m with Connor he does make me forget about everything bad, but the ironic thing is he\u2019s the one who\u2019s bad for me. One of us will have our heartbroken by the other, and I cannot have that in my life right now.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>I rolled over and opened my eyes as the sunlight peeked through the sheer curtains that perfectly hung from the windows. I threw on some yoga pants and a t-shirt and followed the aroma that led me straight to the kitchen. Connor was sitting at the table typing away on his laptop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood morning Ellery, I hope you slept well.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and headed to the cabinet for a coffee mug. \u201cGood morning, I slept very well in that monstrous bed.\u201d</p><p>He lightly laughed. I poured some coffee and sat at the table across from him. \u201cThere are bagels over there, please have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at me with his morning green eyes, \u201cYou have to eat Ellery.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, \u201cI never eat when I first wake up, but don\u2019t worry dad I\u2019ll have one in a little bit.\u201d</p><p>A slight irritated smile graced his face, \u201cYou\u2019re even a smart ass first thing in the morning.\u201d I held up my cup and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked as I pointed to his laptop?</p><p>\u201cJust sending some emails and rearranging some meetings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you overschedule or something?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and cocked his head, \u201cYou question everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the ceiling, \u201cI guess I do,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I sat and stared at him as he was looking at his computer screen. He was freshly showered, and his hair was still damp and perfectly sexy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans today?\u201d He curiously asked. I set my cup down and wrapped my hands around the mug.</p><p>\u201cI have to call work and tell my boss I will not be in because of the funeral; then I think I\u2019ll stop over at the soup kitchen and volunteer this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Connor looked up from his laptop, \u201cYou really enjoy volunteering there don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I love it. Even though they are homeless and whatever problems they may have, they are human beings, and they need help.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a second and then continued on his lap top. I took a sip of my coffee and looked out the enormous window at the view of New York City.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I was rearranging my meetings is because I\u2019m taking you to Michigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>He got up from the table and put his cup on the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s not up for discussion Elle; we are leaving tomorrow morning, and we\u2019re driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving? That\u2019s a 10 hour drive Connor.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and faced me, \u201cI know how long of a drive it is; consider it a road trip.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed, \u201cA road trip? Flying will get us there in an hour and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a problem being with me in a car for 10 hours?\u201d he casually asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d</p><p>He walked over to where I was sitting and stood over me as if he wanted to touch or kiss me, but he didn\u2019t, he just said, \u201cNo buts, we will go by car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Denny wants to drive us to Michigan.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and walked away, \u201cDenny isn\u2019t driving; I am.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and heavily sighed, why was he going anyway? I am more than capable of going back home by myself, and that\u2019s the way I prefer it, ok maybe not, the thought of being in a car with him for ten hours was exciting. I smiled and got up from the table.</p><p>I grabbed my bag and stepped into the elevator; Denny was waiting for me outside by the Limo.</p><p>\u201cMorning Denny, where is Connor?\u201d I asked as I looked, and he was not in the Limo.</p><p>\u201cGood morning Miss Lane. Mr. Black took the Range Rover to work today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question Denny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure Miss Lane,\u201d he said as he looked at me through the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cDid Mr. Black tell you why he\u2019s driving me to Michigan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Miss Lane he did not, he just told me to take the next few days off because he was going on a road trip. Miss Lane, can I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>I looked curiously at him, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked for The Black family for the past 10 years. I was his father\u2019s driver, as well. I have never seen Mr. Black behave in such a way as he has since he's met you. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be telling you this.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, \u201cNah, it\u2019s ok Denny, we\u2019re friends, and maybe that\u2019s all Connor needs is a really good friend.\u201d It saddened me that it\u2019s the only way things can be.</p><p>I stepped into my apartment and headed to the bathroom to take a hot bath. I needed to think about everything before I headed back to Michigan. I climbed into the hot bubbly water and closed my eyes taking in the lavender scented bubbles. My phone rang just as I was starting to relax.</p><p>\u201cHey Peyton,\u201d I answered. There was a screech from the other end.</p><p>\u201cOMG Elle, I have the best news.\u201d Even though, I couldn\u2019t see her, I knew she was jumping up and down.</p><p>\u201cElle, all three of your painting sold.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, \u201cWhat? Are you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I would not kid about a thing like that, and the best part is the same person bought all three and paid triple the amount for them. They said your paintings are the most beautiful they have ever seen. Elle, Sal wants to talk to you about becoming a regular artist for the gallery; he wants to contract you for more paintings. Listen, the money you made off those three alone, you can quit your job to paint full-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was the buyer?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Sal said it was some woman. I have your check; can you meet for lunch later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch sounds great. I\u2019m going to volunteer at the soup kitchen for a couple of hours then we can meet after that, I\u2019ll text you.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and laid back against the tub reveling in my good news. I never dreamed any of my paintings would sell, especially all 3 of them. I couldn\u2019t wait to tell Connor. I wanted to text him, but he was at work and I\u2019m sure he was busy, so I figured I shouldn\u2019t bother him. I got out of the tub, pruned skin and all, and threw on a pair of skinny jeans and a long sweater. I walked across the hallway as a wave of dizziness came over me and then suddenly everything turned black.</p><p>I awoke lying on the floor and my head hurting. I laid there dazed and confused trying to focus and remember what happened. I was pretty sure I fainted. I sat up as I felt something dripping down my face. I took my fingers and swiped them across the drips and looked in horror at the blood all over them. I took a deep breath and got up to look in the mirror. I had a deep cut above my eye, and it was bleeding pretty badly. I opened the medicine cabinet, took out some gauze and applied pressure to the wound. I kept begging god to make it stop and not have to go get stitches. I reached back inside the medicine cabinet. I took out the box of butterfly bandages that I had left over from when Kyle cut his finger on a knife. I applied the bandage and hoped for the best. Why now? Why did this have to happen now? Just an hour ago, I was basking in the glory of the sale of my paintings, and now I was standing in front of the mirror with a gash above my eye that may or may not require stitches.</p><p>I went to the cupboard and pulled out the bottle of Motrin. I took two caplets and headed over to the record company to give my notice. Peyton was right, if Sal wanted to contract me, then painting would become my full-time job. I just hope I would make enough money to live on.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>I was walking down the street as I felt the wetness through the bandage. Shit, I knew I was going to need stitches. I reached in my bag for my cell phone and dialed Peyton.</p><p>\u201cPeyton, I fell and cut my head. It won\u2019t stop bleeding, so I\u2019m heading over to the hospital to have it looked at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOMG are you ok? I\u2019ll meet you there Elle, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Before I could tell her not to go, she hung up. I was nowhere near the hospital, so I tried to catch a cab. Of course, when I desperately needed one, they won\u2019t stop. As I was standing on the curb with my hand on my head, a Limo driving by pulled up and rolled down the passenger side window, \u201cMiss Lane are you ok?\u201d Denny asked with concern. I couldn\u2019t believe he was here at this moment.</p><p>\u201cDenny, thank god, can you drive me to the hospital? I had a little accident, and I need to get it checked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, get in the front seat and let me take a look.\u201d</p><p>I opened the door and climbed in the front seat. Denny removed my hand. His eyes widened. He opened the glove box and took out a small white towel and folded it. \u201cHere, keep this over that cut and apply pressure,\u201d he said as he pulled into traffic and drove me to the hospital.</p><p>We arrived at the hospital, and he helped me out of the car. I thanked him as I saw Peyton waiting in the lobby for me. He walked me into the ER as I introduced him to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you Denny for your help.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, \u201cNot a problem Miss Lane, take care of that and feel better.\u201d I gently hugged him as he left through the automatic doors.</p><p>A nurse named Carla sat me in a wheel chair and pushed me through the corridor to a room. She helped me out of the chair and onto the bed where she made me lay down to prevent any more injuries. Peyton sat down in the chair next to my bed and cursed at me for not coming to the hospital sooner. I hated hospitals; I saw and been in enough of them to last me a lifetime.</p><p>Carla was a larger woman, and by the looks of her, she was not one who played around. She was funny. She had me and Peyton laughing our asses off with the way she talked about the nursing staff and some of the doctors.</p><p>Not too long after she took my vitals, Dr. Beckett came in. Peyton was in the middle of a sentence, and when she saw him she fell silent. He was a hot young resident with short black hair, baby blue eyes and sun-tanned skin.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dr. Beckett,\u201d he smiled as he held out his hand.</p><p>Peyton jumped up and held out her hand, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Peyton Bennett,\u201d she flirtatiously smiled.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, which hurt because of the cut. \u201cSo Ellery, tell me how this happened,\u201d he spoke as he examined the wound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure; I took a bath and got dressed. I started to feel a little dizzy as I was walking down the hallway and I think I passed out. I must have hit my head on the corner of the wall or molding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it normal for you to get dizzy suddenly?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, straight into his baby blues and said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, well I\u2019m going to get my suture kit, put in a few stitches and get you out of here.\u201d I smiled and nodded my head as Peyton drooled over him.</p><p>\u201cOMG, he is gorgeous, I\u2019m obviously getting his number. Did you see a ring on his finger Elle? Did you?\u201d</p><p>Just as I was about to answer, the curtain opened, and there stood Connor, looking as sexy as when I left him this morning. Peyton\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cOh god, another one, I think I\u2019ve died and gone to heaven.\u201d I frowned at her and lightly smacked her on the arm. Connor stood there holding the curtain in his hand.</p><p>\u201cElle, my god what happened?\u201d He walked over to me and put his hand on my head. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d I looked at his face; he genuinely seemed worried. It\u2019s a look I haven\u2019t seen before.</p><p>\u201cConnor,\u201d I put my hand on his arm, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Connor Black?\u201d Peyton tilted her head and asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Connor this is Peyton; Peyton this is Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to finally meet you Peyton, I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peyton smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you to.\u201d</p><p>20 shades of red covered my face as he responded, \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>Just before Peyton could embarrass me any further, Dr. Beckett walked in with a small silver tray. \u201cLet\u2019s get that nasty cut sewn up; I promise to stitch it well so the scar will barely be noticeable, if at all.\u201d</p><p>Connor took my hand and started lightly rubbing it with his thumb. Dr. Beckett worked his magic and put four perfect stitches above my eye. The only feeling I felt was the warmth from Connors touch and the rapid beating of my heart as he softly stroked my hand.</p> <p>\u201cOk, all fixed Miss Lane, do you live with someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I live alone, why?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, \u201cYou will have to get someone to stay with you tonight, and you will need to be monitored for a concussion. Sometimes with head injuries, even minor cuts, a concussion can settle in after the brain and the trauma settle down. I\u2019m going to write you a prescription for some pain medication, take it only if you need to.\u201d He glanced over at Peyton and smiled as he spoke to me, \u201cTake care Miss Lane and call if you have any questions.\u201d I thought Peyton was going to die as he walked out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with you tonight,\u201d Peyton said as she got up.</p><p>Connor looked over at her, \u201cEllery will be staying with me tonight Peyton.\u201d</p> <p>She started to pout, \u201cElle is that true? We can have a girl\u2019s night?\u201d I looked over at Connor then back at Peyton and could not believe these two were fighting over whom I was staying with.</p><p>I took Peyton\u2019s hand, \u201cListen, you are my best friend, and I love you, but I think its best I stay at Connor\u2019s tonight, anyway, we are leaving in the morning for Michigan.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped, \u201cWhat? The two of you are going to Michigan together? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor and I are taking a road trip.\u201d I looked at him and winked.</p><p>\u201cFine, but as soon as you get back we are having a girl\u2019s night.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and hugged her, \u201cI will and we will, now go find Dr. Beckett; I didn\u2019t see a ring on his finger, and I could tell he liked you.\u201d</p> <p>A gigantic smile grew across her face, \u201cDo you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so, now go.\u201d</p><p>Peyton started to walk out of the room and then turned around and looked at Connor, \u201cYou better take care of her and make sure she\u2019s alright. She\u2019s like a sister to me.\u201d He smiled at her.</p><p>I looked at Connor who was helping me from the bed, \u201cWhy would you pass out like that? Is something wrong with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I grabbed my purse, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I think I took too hot a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be more careful.\u201d He lightly took a hold of my arm as we walked down the corridor. My eyes widened as I saw Dr. Taub walking in the opposite direction towards us. My heart started racing as I did not want to talk to him, especially in front of Connor.</p><p>\u201cMiss Lane?\u201d He said as he looked at the bandage above my eye.</p><p>\u201cDr. Taub, lovely to see you again,\u201d I faked a grin.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Lane what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I fell and hit my head; I tripped in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me curiously, \u201cHow have you been feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling great Dr. Taub, now if you will excuse me; I have to get this prescription filled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes of course,\u201d he said as he looked directly at Connor.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day Dr. Taub,\u201d I smiled as I could not get away from him fast enough.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know him Ellery?\u201d</p><p>I knew that brief encounter would trigger questions. I looked straight ahead at the sliding doors.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my family doctor; I\u2019ve seen him a couple of times since I\u2019ve moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of times and he knows you like that? Why would he ask you how you\u2019re feeling?\u201d</p><p>Shit, why does he have to ask so many questions, he doesn\u2019t explain anything to me when I ask him questions?</p><p>\u201cI saw him a couple of months ago for a bad cold I had. He is a good doctor and truly concerned for all of his patients.\u201d We walked out the door as the cold air hit me and cooled my burning body.</p><p>We slid into the back of the Limo as Denny turned and looked at me, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re doing better Miss Lane.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a heartfelt smile, \u201cThank you Denny, I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Connor looked over at me and smiled, \u201cDenny almost got fired today.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him; shocked expression on my face, \u201cWhat, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t pick me up for my meeting. It wasn\u2019t until he called and told me that he drove you to the hospital because you cut your head.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with a confused look. \u201cDidn\u2019t you drive yourself to work this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes I did,\u201d he answered.</p><p>I ran my tongue across my lips to moisten them, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you just drive yourself to the meeting, especially if he was running late?\u201d I heard Denny lightly laugh from the front seat, and I think Connor did to by the irritated look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could have but...\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head, \u201cThere\u2019s no but. You were going to fire him for not picking you up when you had a vehicle the whole time? I\u2019m sorry he couldn\u2019t call you, but he was concerned about me Connor Black, and for that you should be grateful. I could have bled to death on the streets of New York.\u201d I was silently grinning.</p><p>He looked at me and rolled his eyes, \u201cNow you\u2019re being a drama queen.\u201d</p><p>I let out my silent smile, \u201cI know and I\u2019m good at it to.\u201d</p><p>Connor laughed as he took my hand and gently squeezed it. I laid my head his shoulder as my body warmed from his touch, and my heart started beating faster.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>I walked into my cold apartment and headed straight to my room to pack my bags. \u201cHelp yourself in the kitchen, there\u2019s not much, but if you can find something it\u2019s yours,\u201d I yelled. I grabbed what clothes I needed from my closet and drawers and folded them neatly into my suitcase. I looked up and saw Connor standing in the doorway with his arm up on the frame of the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie to that doctor and tell him you tripped over something in the hallway?\u201d</p><p>Oh shit, he wasn\u2019t going to let this go. I looked down and continued packing, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t going to tell him I fainted then he would make a big deal about it and want me to get a bunch of tests done, that\u2019s what doctors do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you took too hot of a bath.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and looked at him, now seriously irritated, \u201cI did Connor now let it go for f**k sake. You talk about me asking a billion questions, it\u2019s different when it\u2019s you, right?\u201d My voice grew louder.</p><p>He walked over to me and put his hands on my shoulders, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I did not mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>My first mistake was looking into his beautiful green eyes because before I knew it I cupped his face in my hands as I so desperately wanted to kiss him, taste him and feel him. I was vulnerable at that moment, and for one second, I didn\u2019t care; all I knew is I needed him in ways every woman needs a man. Then reality hit me, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I raised my voice, I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>I let go of his face and turned to zip up my suitcase. He grabbed my arm, turned me to face him and wrapped his arms around me, pulling me into a warm embrace. This was the first real hug we ever shared. His arms were strong, and he made me feel safe. I closed my eyes as I took in his scent that made me weak but excited. He didn\u2019t say a word, and it felt like we stayed in each other\u2019s arms for eternity. He broke the embrace and turned away like he did something wrong. \u201cWe should get going.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly it hit me; I never made it to my work to give my notice. I shook my head and sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cI was on my way to the record studio to give my notice, and I just realized I never made it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive your notice, why are you quitting?\u201d Connor grabbed my suitcase, and we walked out into the living room. My face lit up as I was about to tell him the good news.</p><p>\u201cI completely forgot to tell you, my paintings sold, all three of them,\u201d I excitedly said. \u201cNow the owner wants to contract me and my paintings, and that\u2019s a full-time job.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant news Ellery, congratulations.\u201d</p><p>As I was grabbing the last of my things, my phone rang; it was my cousin Debbie. I asked Connor to go in my desk drawer and grab a piece of paper and pen so I could write down the name and address of the funeral home. I took down the information and hung up. I turned around as Connor was staring at my list I keep in the drawer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he casually asked.</p><p>I walked over and took it from him, \u201cJust a list of things I would like to do in my lifetime. I wrote it after Kyle moved out, kind of a new start on life list.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me only the way Connor could and said, \u201cOk, ready to go?\u201d</p><p>I locked up the apartment and headed to the Limo. I called my boss at the record company and explained to him what happened and how I was on my way in give my notice. I explained to him how much I liked working there, but my painting was now going to become a full-time job. He congratulated me and told me if I ever needed a job he would take me back.</p><p>We arrived back at Connors penthouse as he took my suitcase upstairs. I followed him and fell back onto the large comfy bed.</p><p>He looked down at me, \u201cDo you like this bed?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, \u201cYes, it is the most comfortable bed I\u2019ve ever slept in.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand to help me up, \u201cAre you up for some Chinese food?\u201d</p><p>I smiled as my stomach growled, \u201cSounds delicious.\u201d</p><p>We walked down to the kitchen where Connor opened the drawer, pulled out a menu and sat on the bar stool next to me, \u201cWhat do you like?\u201d</p><p>I leaned closer as his scent filled me with excitement. I wanted to respond, I like you, but that would not be a cool move, \u201cI like just about anything, you pick.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, \u201csweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice, Mongolian beef and egg rolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of food Mr. Black, is anyone joining us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to make sure you eat.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and then held my hand over my cut, \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he looked at me, \u201cStop rolling your eyes at me and it won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop making me roll my eyes at you and I will.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and grabbed his phone to call in the order. He poured us some wine and led me to the living room where we sat on the couch. The fireplace was on and had warmed the room nicely. I sat with my leg under the other and faced him.</p><p>\u201cI want to know more about you Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised as he responded, \u201cWhat\u2019s to tell?\u201d</p><p>I took in a deep breath, \u201cWe\u2019re friends right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded his head, \u201cOf course we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends know things about each other. It doesn\u2019t have to be intimate or deeply personal things, but I want to know about where you come from and your family or even your business. Of all the time we have spent together hanging out, you have never told me anything about your family other than I know you have a sister who is an interior designer. You know a lot about me, and I know nothing about you. I feel like this friendship is one-sided Connor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared at me as he drank his wine, being cautious as to what he was going to say to me.

You need to understand that I\u2019ve never been just friends with a woman before.\u201d</p><p>The thought of the tall beautiful woman entered my mind as he said that and with me and my big mouth I said, \u201cBut you said you and that woman you\u2019re always with are just friends, so you have other women that are friends, right?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me intently, \u201cIt\u2019s different and I\u2019d rather not discuss it now.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang, and he got up to answer it. I sat there wondering what the hell I was doing. Was I playing a game? Was I his game? Was he using me to prove something? He came back with the cartons of Chinese food, plates and silverware.</p> <p>\u201cCan I have the chopsticks please?\u201d I asked. He looked in the bag and pulled out a pair and handed them to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked him as he started to put food on his and my plate.</p><p>\u201cUm, serving dinner?\u201d He looked at me with a - are you stupid - look. I shook my finger from side to side.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d I said as I grabbed the cartons. \u201cGrab your chopsticks,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to use chopsticks, I could never get those things right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will teach you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery, let\u2019s just eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are going to eat, but my way,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He sighed and took his set of chopsticks out of the bag. I took the sweet and sour pork container, inserted by chopsticks and grabbed a piece of pork, \u201cSee, easy.\u201d If looks could kill, I\u2019d be dead just about now.</p><p>I took his chopsticks and placed them properly between his fingers. The feel of his soft skin sent shivers down my spine. I guided his chopsticks inside the carton and helped him pull out a piece of pork. He looked at me and smirked.</p><p>\u201cSee, it\u2019s not hard with the proper training.\u201d</p> <p>I took a piece of beef and held it to his mouth as he took it and smiled. He was enjoying this new found way of eating Chinese food even though he would never admit it. He still had some trouble, but managed to get a piece of pork and brought it to my mouth. He laughed when I grabbed the chopsticks between my teeth and refused to let go. This moment we were sharing felt so right and comfortable, and it scared the hell out of me.</p><p>When we finished eating, he took his thumb and gently stroked the area above my cut, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asked sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d I answered as I looked down. His touching me like that was killing me. It stirred up heat in me I never knew existed. Kyle never made me feel the way Connor does, and I was bothered by that. I should not have these feelings for him; we\u2019re friends, and that is all we can be. I believe we met for a reason, but I have yet to find out why.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he softly asked. I took his hand and removed it from my head, holding it up to my face as I gently kissed it. I could feel him tighten as his breathing grew heavier, but I didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about how lucky I am to have a friend like you,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He smiled and pulled his hand away, \u201cWe need to leave early in the morning; we should get some rest.\u201d</p><p>I got up and started walking upstairs, \u201cDo you want a pain pill?\u201d He yelled from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I responded.\u201d I slipped into my night-shirt and got under the absurdly warm covers.</p> <p>I was looking through my phone when Connor knocked on the door. \u201cCome in.\u201d He walked in the room wearing dark gray silk pajama bottoms that hung off his hips. His muscular frame stared at me as my butterflies awoke and the fire ignited in my blood. He sat down in the chair and reclined it back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGetting some rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, do you have a problem with that?\u201d The only problem I had was trying to keep my hands off him and having my way with him.</p><p>\u201cYes I do Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and looked at me, \u201cWhy? The doctor said you need to be watched for a concussion. How am I supposed to do that if I\u2019m in the room down the hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, and besides you cannot sleep all night in that chair, you\u2019ll be hurting in the morning, and we have a ten-hour drive to Michigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctors\u2019 orders Miss Lane, so deal with it. You are not getting your way with this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re making me feel bad,\u201d I took in a sharp breath and wanted to crucify myself for what I was about to say, \u201cAt least sleep in the bed.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, \u201cI don\u2019t think that is a good idea Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? We\u2019re friends. Peyton and I sleep in the same bed when we have sleepovers, and my bed is tiny compared to this one. You have your own side way over there,\u201d I pointed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t then I\u2019m leaving and you know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going anywhere, and I\u2019m not sleeping in that bed.\u201d</p><p>I threw the covers back, got out of bed and started to put on my yoga pants. Connor jumped up from the chair and grabbed my arm, \u201cStop it Ellery, you need your rest.\u201d His voice was angry, and his face was irritated.</p><p>He took in a long sharp breath, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll sleep in the bed, just please get back in it and leave those pants on.\u201d I smiled at him and climbed back into bed. He walked to the other side, climbed in and turned the other way, \u201cYou are the most stubborn and defiant person I have ever known Ellery Lane.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I closed my eyes, \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been told Mr. Black, goodnight.\u201d</p><p>Even though, I could not see him, I could feel him smile, \u201cGoodnight Ellery.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>I awoke the next morning, and I was alone. I got up and headed to the bathroom when I heard yelling coming from downstairs. I stepped a little closer to the top of the step when I heard Connor\u2019s raised voice. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad Ashlyn; I have to go out-of-town for a few days on business. No, I cannot, I don\u2019t have time. Don\u2019t you dare come over here; I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I get back. I know it\u2019s been a while, but I can\u2019t help that; I\u2019ve been busy. No, she has nothing to do with it, I\u2019ve been working. Ashlyn, I promise we\u2019ll get together as soon as I get back. I\u2019m going to send an envelope over with Denny; I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>My stomach felt sick, and my heart ached after I heard that conversation. I leaned my head against the wall and felt the sting of tears fill my eyes. My inner voice started to yell, \u201cStop it Elle, just stop it, he\u2019s your friend. You knew from the beginning it could never be more than friendship. You knew what you were getting into, and I warned you.\u201d I looked up at the ceiling to stop the tears from falling.</p><p>I heard footsteps coming up the stairs, so I ran into the bathroom and started the shower. There was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cElle, make sure the water isn\u2019t too hot,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the shower and let the warm water fall on me. I was going to have to put an end or distance to this friendship when I got back from Michigan. I silently cried as I buried my face in the water, drowning my sorrows. I turned the shower off and stepped out; I wrapped a towel around me and noticed I didn\u2019t bring any clothes except my night-shirt that was lying on the floor wet. I opened the door and jumped when I saw Connor leaning against the wall across from where I was standing.</p><p>\u201cShit, you f**king scared me Connor.\u201d Not to mention the fact that I was half-naked in front of him and the towel was barely covering my ass.</p><p>He looked at me with a hunger in his eyes as he blushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I just wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t take too hot of a shower. I didn\u2019t want you getting dizzy and passing out again. You do have a habit of not listening to anybody.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and headed to the bedroom, \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I told you not to roll your eyes at me, and you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I shut the door and got dressed. When I came out he was downstairs in the kitchen. He set a cup of coffee on the counter and a plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes. \u201cDid you make all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure did, you sound surprised?\u201d</p><p>I took a bite of the eggs, \u201cTo be honest I am, I didn\u2019t think you knew how to cook.\u201d</p><p>He sat down next to me at the island and started eating. \u201cHow hard is it to cook eggs? Plus I can cook a little,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>I wanted to bring up the conversation I heard earlier, but we were heading out in a while, and I didn\u2019t want to upset him.</p><p>\u201cSo, did I harm you in any way last night?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked at me and frowned. \u201cNo, in fact, you put your arms around me, started rubbing my chest and calling me Peyton, I was quite turned on.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped until he smiled and I knew he was joking. I went to smack him as he laughed and grabbed my wrists, holding them rubbing my scars and looking straight into my eyes. The atmosphere was no longer playful as it turned serious.</p><p>\u201cMy scars really bug you don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He let go of my hands and stood up, taking his plate to the dishwasher, \u201cThey sadden me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Connor, I didn\u2019t even know you when this happened. Why would my scars sadden you so much?\u201d</p><p>He kept his back turned to me, \u201cIt saddens me that someone could think so little of their life to want to do such a thing.\u201d</p><p>That comment hurt me deep down to my core, and I wanted to break down and cry. He stood staring out the window with his hands on the counter.</p><p>\u201cI told you why I did it, and it wasn\u2019t because I thought so little of my life. I did it to lessen the pain for my father, and how dare you Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>Too late, the tears started falling; I left the kitchen. He came after me and grabbed me pulling me into him as he held me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it, I swear I didn\u2019t. I just get sad when I see them because it reminds me of what you went through.\u201d His voice was sincere, and I could tell he regretted saying what he did.</p><p>I looked up at him, \u201cIt\u2019s ok, let\u2019s just forget about it and head out.\u201d</p><p>He gently wiped my tears and put his forehead on mine, \u201cI\u2019m an insensitive bastard.\u201d He sounded wounded and broken. Those words were from pain, and I wanted to know what happened in his life to make him this way.</p><p>I put my hand on his firm chest, \u201cYou\u2019re in luck; I am quite fond of insensitive bastards.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed me on the head, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We took the elevator to the garage and set out on our road trip to Michigan.</p><p>The Range Rover was comfortable and I had an easy time settling in my seat with my iPod in hand. I looked over at Connor; his seat was slightly leaned back. He had one hand on the steering wheel, and his other arm was resting on the console in the middle. The way he drove was sexy, and I could not help staring at him. Everything this man did was sexy even when he tried to control me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked over at me. \u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering about Connor Black, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and looked back at the road. I looked out the window and put my headphones in. I pressed play and started singing as we merged on the U S 1-9. Connor tapped me on the arm. I took out my headphones and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ignore me the whole way there?\u201d He asked.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell me a little bit about Connor Black?\u201d I smiled in a cocky way.</p><p>He sighed and shook his head. I could tell I was pissing him off, so I put my headphones back in. He yanked the headphone out of my ear, \u201cHey, what the hell Connor?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, \u201cTake those things out you stubborn girl and I\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>I knew I\u2019d win; I always do, but if it got to be too much for him, I would tell him to stop.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s name is Cassidy, and I had a twin brother Collin.\u201d</p> <p>I gasped as my eyes widened, \u201cHow the hell could you not tell me you were a twin?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and took a hold of my hand, \u201cAre you going to ask a million questions or are you going to let me finish?\u201d</p><p>I twisted my face contemplating what to say, \u201cOk, I promise not to ask any questions at all, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He seriously asked.</p><p>I shook my head and made the zip my lip motion across my mouth. He smiled and continued; \u201cCollin died when he was 7 years old from a virus that attacked his heart.\u201d I swallowed hard. I wanted to throw my arms around him and comfort him because I knew how hard this was for him to tell me.</p><p>\u201cMy mom and dad had a hard time with his death and their way of dealing with it was to get pregnant with my sister. When Cassidy was eighteen, she got pregnant from some guy who tossed her to the side when he found out. You asked me why my company is involved with the autism charity; it is because my sister\u2019s 5 year old son, my nephew is autistic.\u201d</p> <p>I put my hand on his leg, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Connor, you don\u2019t have to say anymore.\u201d</p><p>My sympathy ran deep for him, and my stomach was in knots for behaving the way I did and forcing him to tell me about his family.</p><p>He put his hand on top of mine and glanced at me, \u201cIt\u2019s ok; I want to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father built Black Enterprises from the ground up and started grooming me when I was around thirteen. I worked hard, learned fast, went to Harvard and 2 years ago he retired. He handed over his company to me, and in those 2 years I doubled the company\u2019s profits. So now you know about my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about past relationships?\u201d</p><p>I knew that was crossing the line with him, but I was hoping he would feel comfortable enough to tell me since he was telling me about his family.</p><p>He pressed his lips together and took in a deep breath, \u201cI do not talk about my past relationships, there\u2019s no point, what\u2019s past is past and why revisit it. I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, nor do I want one.\u201d</p><p>His comment hurt deep down; just hearing him say he didn\u2019t want a girlfriend was heartbreaking. It\u2019s for the best though, because I could never be his girlfriend and he could never be my boyfriend. I figure if I keep telling myself that, I\u2019d actually convince myself.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not, even if you\u2019ve been hurt before, you pick yourself up and move on. Everyone\u2019s been hurt at least once in their life, some more than others, but you have to make a choice what to do with that hurt.\u201d I sounded way too casual about that, and who was I to talk anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple Ellery, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t ever want to get married or have children and do the whole perfect family thing?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with such seriousness it startled me, \u201cNo, I never want any of that and to quote you, nothing lasts forever.\u201d</p><p>I could just kick myself for saying that to him. It was true, but I did not mean to live a life of loneliness and misery.</p><p>\u201cYou really need to stop quoting that Connor, I think you took it the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of which way I took it, I mean it, I already told you that I do not do relationships, and I mean that.\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I was starting to regret asking him to tell me about himself. I think it was better if I didn\u2019t know, maybe then I wouldn\u2019t be hurting so much.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>We had been driving about 4 hours as Connor pulled off the expressway and stopped for gas. \u201cI\u2019m going to fill her up, and then we\u2019ll get something to eat,\u201d he said as he got out of the car. I got out and walked around stretching out my back and legs. I walked over to the gas pump where Connor was pumping gas and kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a thank you for telling me about your family.\u201d He gave me that heart melting smile of his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in the shop to get a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>I entered the store and headed right to the candy isle. I scanned the rows trying to decide what I wanted when Connor came up behind me, \u201cYou\u2019re going to fill your body with this junk?\u201d He asked.</p><p>I turned quickly to face him, and a wave of dizziness fell over me as I stumbled into him and he caught me. \u201cEllery, are you alright?\u201d</p><p>I held my head, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just got a little light-headed.\u201d He held me until it passed.</p><p>\u201cI knew we should have waited an extra day to leave. You are not ready to travel yet, and you need to rest more.\u201d</p><p>I was feeling better and could have lifted my head up from his chest, but I liked where it was. \u201cConnor, stop being protective, I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s probably the pain Meds I took.\u201d I lied; I never took any, but I didn\u2019t want him worrying about me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m finding us a hotel, and we\u2019re stopping for the rest of the day. We\u2019ll continue first thing tomorrow. We\u2019ll be in Michigan in plenty of time for the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, but let\u2019s get something to eat and drive for a couple of more hours before stopping for the night. Go grab one of those little baskets over there,\u201d I said to Connor as I pointed by the door.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t seriously buying that much, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk Mr. Black, if you must know the truth, it\u2019s my PMS time.\u201d</p><p>He took a step back and put his hands up, \u201cWhoa, enough said.\u201d</p><p>I grinned as I picked up a bag of Fritos, Cheetos, a Hersey bar(king size), a Twix bar, a small pack of chocolate donuts, 3 cans of coke, a bag of tiny twist pretzels and a jar of Nutella. Connor looked in the basket and then at me with a horrified look on his face.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who wanted to take me on this road trip. I\u2019m just trying to keep the peace because without these foods for a woman at that time of the month,\u201d I waved my hand. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t really want to know.\u201d</p><p>I put the basket on the counter. The cashier overheard our conversation, she looked at Connor and said, \u201cTrust her; we girls are two sheets short of psycho when it comes to our special little time.\u201d</p><p>He just stood there and looked at both of us, speechless, as she rang up the food. She gave me the total, and I looked at Connor.</p><p>He looked at me in confusion, \u201cReally? You want me to pay for this crap?\u201d</p><p>The cashier leaned over the counter and looked him straight in the eyes, \u201cRemember, 2 sheets short of psycho.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his wallet and paid as he was mumbling under his breath. He took the bag and headed out. I looked at the cashier and high fived her, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe girls need to stick together,\u201d she said. I walked out of the store smiling as he sat in the car waiting for me.</p><p>We headed back to the interstate as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy; I just wanted you to know that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cAwe sweetie, I know, but I promise it\u2019s only for a few days.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and I saw how hard he was trying to fight a smile. We saw some signs on the interstate for some restaurants. I was going to be polite and let him pick where he wanted to eat. He got off at the next exit, and we entered restaurant haven.</p><p>\u201cTake your pick Mr. Black, the call is yours,\u201d I said as I moved my hand around.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t care where we eat?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and tilted my head, \u201cNo, pick wherever you want, I like just about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk then,\u201d he smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s a seafood restaurant over there.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together and didn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t like seafood, but I said it was his pick, and if that\u2019s what he wanted then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have. They should have something non-seafood. We got out of the car as he held his arm out for me. I hooked my arm around his as we walked into the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said as I looked around at the sharks and swordfish mounted to the walls. A cute little blonde girl walked over to us and said there was about a 30 minute wait; this was my chance to get the hell out of here. I didn\u2019t like staring at those things on the wall; they\u2019re creepy.</p><p>\u201c30 minutes is a long time to wait Connor; maybe we should go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with a smile, \u201c30 minutes is nothing, and time will fly by. Go look at those lobsters over there.\u201d</p><p>I flinched because I hated to see them in those glass tanks, moving around not knowing they were next to be thrown into a pot of boiling water. He grabbed my hand and led me to the bar, \u201cWe\u2019ll sit here and have a drink until they call us.\u201d</p><p>I sat on the stool as the bartender, a very attractive woman with long brown curly hair and large perky boobs, walked over to us, but only made eye contact with Connor. She leaned over the bar, not taking notice that I\u2019m sitting right next to him, and with her low-cut top and cl**vage hanging out she says, \u201cWhat will it be handsome?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a flirtatious smile and leaned in closer, \u201cI\u2019ll have a sex with the bartender.\u201d I gasped, and with a horrified look on my face, I looked at him.</p><p>\u201cOne sex with a bartender coming right up stud,\u201d she winked.</p><p>He looked over at me as I clenched my jaw and took in a deep breath. I could not believe he just did that and right in front of me. I bit the inside of my cheek and contemplated.</p><p>\u201cUmm sweetheart, when you get his drink don\u2019t forget to bring those luscious boobies over here,\u201d I smiled. The look on Connors face was priceless after that statement.</p><p>\u201cEllery, what the hell are you doing?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Am I embarrassing you Mr. I\u2019ll have sex with a bartender?\u201d</p><p>She came over and handed him his drink, looked at me and in an irritated way asked me what I wanted. I looked at her and pouted, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s only fair that you give me the same kind of service you\u2019re giving him? Why should he be the only one to get to see your boobies? I like them to.\u201d</p><p>Connor threw some money on the bar and stood up, \u201cCome on honey, I think our table is ready.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and winked at her as she gave me a dirty look and turned away. Connor leaned over to me and whispered in my ear, \u201cPoint taken, you bad girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou love it Mr. Black and you know it.\u201d He smiled as the waitress showed us to our table.</p><p>I opened the menu and guess what, no non-seafood items existed. Shit, I thought to myself. What was I going to order? Well, I do have a car full of junk food if it comes down to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to order Ellery?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from my menu and glared at him, \u201cI\u2019m not sure; I\u2019m torn at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The waitress came by and asked to take our drink orders. Connor spoke up before I could tell her I wanted a Cosmopolitan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m set, and she\u2019ll have a coke.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cI wanted a Cosmo Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after that little stunt, who knows what that bartender would do to that drink.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and continued looking at the menu. As soon as the waitress brought my coke, she asked us if we were ready to order. Connor closed his menu and looked at me. I glanced up at the waitress and bit my lip. Connor looked at her, \u201cGive us a minute please.\u201d I looked at him; I think he realized I didn\u2019t like seafood.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like seafood do you?\u201d I stared at him while biting my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d He said as he ran his hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted you to have what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with those beautiful green eyes and suddenly they turned evil. He didn\u2019t say a word, but he was scaring me as he waved for the waitress to come back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to order for us,\u201d he said. Uh oh, now I\u2019m in trouble.</p><p>\u201cWe will start with an order of Calamari, crab legs and a lobster tail for each of us, also throw in an order of broiled scallops.</p> <p>The waitress looked at me, and I managed a slight smile. Connor crossed his hands and placed his elbows on the table.</p><p>\u201cRemember the times when you made me eat things; the pizza, hot dog and let\u2019s not forget the use of the chopsticks?\u201d</p><p>I just stared at him. Two can play this game.</p><p>\u201cYes I do and I\u2019m fine with everything you ordered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>I leaned over the table, \u201cYou\u2019re a vicious man Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in closer until we were face to face, \u201cNot as vicious as you darling.\u201d I sat back, smiled and reveled in the moment when he called me darling.</p><p>The waitress came and set the calamari in the center of the table. I looked at it and then at Connor. I got out my phone and Googled calamari; my eyes widened as \u201csquid\u201d appeared. I looked up at Connor; he was laughing at me.</p> <p>\u201cYou Googled it didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and took a sip of my coke. His laughing subsided, and he looked at me with a serious face.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to eat it, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I took in a deep breath, \u201cNo it\u2019s ok, and I\u2019m going to try it. It is the least I can do for everything you have done for me.\u201d He lightly smiled as I took a piece from the plate and inspected it.</p><p>\u201cSeriously Elle, don\u2019t, I know you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>I took a small bite and started chewing; his eyes intently watched me as I was eating the Calamari and making faces. He took out his phone and started taking pictures of me, \u201cThis is classic,\u201d he laughed. The Calamari wasn\u2019t as awful as I thought it would be.</p><p>\u201cOk bad boy bring on the next one.\u201d</p><p>Connor threw his head back and laughed as the waitress brought the scallops and lobster tails. I stabbed a scallop with my fork and held it up to my mouth as he smiled and took a picture. I ate it and to my surprise, enjoyed it. I held up the lobster tail and pouted at it as he took another picture. We both laughed and talked throughout dinner. I will admit I liked it all; this new seafood experience agreed with me. We finished up and left the restaurant. Connor put his arm around me and pulled me close. I put my hand on his chest and my head on his shoulder as we walked to the Range Rover.</p><p>We drove till we found a hotel. We only passed a billion of them, but Mr. Fancy pants had to have the best, so we drove out-of-the-way to the Ritz Carlton.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>We pulled up as he let the valet park his Range Rover. He walked up to the desk and gave them his last name. I watched the girls behind the counter giggle and eye him. He must have seen it to because he flashed them his flirty smile. I rolled my eyes.</p><p>The bellhop took our suitcases and led us in the elevator. \u201cWelcome to the Ritz Carlton Mr. and Mrs. Black.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at Connor as he began to speak, \u201cOh we\u2019re not...\u201d I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, what my husband is trying to say is that we will not be staying long.\u201d Connor gave me a perplexed look.</p><p>The elevator took us to the Presidential Suite. The door opened, and I glanced over at Connor, \u201cThe presidential suite, really, for one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will have nothing but the best room for my beautiful wife. Isn\u2019t my wife beautiful?\u201d Connor asked the bellhop with a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cYes sir, she\u2019s very beautiful.\u201d I glared at Connor and then smiled at the bellhop.</p><p>\u201cDarling husband, make sure you tip this nice young man well.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a wad of money from his pocket and started thumbing through the bills. I walked over to him and grabbed a hundred-dollar bill and handed it to the bellhop. \u201cDo you have a wife or girlfriend?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes I do, thank you ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo buy her something beautiful, perhaps a nice necklace.\u201d Connor looked at me and clenched his jaw.</p><p>\u201cThank you ma\u2019am, sir, thank you,\u201d he said excitedly as he walked out shutting the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cReally, a hundred-dollar tip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s what you tipped the cab driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCab driver, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night I brought you home, I had to pay the driver, and I didn\u2019t have enough money, so I went in your wallet and gave him a hundred; that was before you told you were going to f**k me really hard.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped, \u201cI said that to you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, \u201cYeah, but you were drunk, so I forgave.\u201d</p><p>He started walking towards me, \u201cA hundred dollars\u201d he kept saying as he was smiling with a playful look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cConnor, relax, it\u2019s only money, and you said yourself you have plenty of it.\u201d</p><p>He was heading straight for me. I screamed and ran behind a chair; he started to chase me around the suite saying over and over, \u201cA hundred dollars.\u201d</p><p>He caught me as I ran into the bedroom and he threw me on the bed. He straddled me and pinned my arms over my head. We were both out of breath as he looked down at me staring into my eyes. I stopped fighting him and held his gaze; my heart was racing, and my skin was on fire. My body ached for him, and my lips begged him to kiss me. He held my wrists and lowered his head till his lips lightly brushed against mine. He looked at me again and let go of my wrists. He softly stroked my cheek with the back of his hand and stared into my eyes as I moved my hands through his hair. He swallowed hard as I could hear the rapid beating of his heart; he felt the same way as I did. He stared at me as if he was searching my soul; then his lips touched mine as we kissed, and he fell into me as our tongues met for the first time. This was our first kiss, and it was filled with such passion and emotion. He was gentle and not forceful. He took his time exploring my mouth in such a way that made me feel loved. He abruptly broke our kiss and pulled back, getting off me and sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Elle, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t? He basically rapes my mouth and now he sits there and says he can\u2019t? A wave of hurt and rejection overtook my body.</p><p>\u201cWhy not Connor, because I\u2019m not one of your whores?\u201d The words flew out of my mouth before I could stop them.</p><p>He got up and wouldn\u2019t look at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not a whore, and I just can\u2019t Elle.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and pleaded with him. \u201cPlease just tell me what\u2019s wrong and why you don\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want you Ellery that\u2019s the problem; I want you too f**king much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that a problem?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>He turned and looked at me with rage in his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know the real me. I\u2019m not a good person; I use women for sex. I can\u2019t have real relationships; I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to have a relationship; we can just be friends with benefit.\u201d</p><p>Yep, there it was, the thing I hated the most I just yelled to the man I was falling in love with. He stood there and ran his hands through his hair. I stepped closer to him, \u201cConnor, please, I need you.\u201d A single tear fell from my eye.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Elle, don\u2019t do this to me, to us; I can\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>Anger and rage grew inside me. He wouldn\u2019t give me a straight answer or explanation, so I did what I do best.</p><p>\u201cFuck you Connor Black, just f**k you.\u201d I turned and walked out of the room, grabbed my purse and headed towards the door. Connor followed after me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare walk out that door Ellery,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>I put my hand on the knob and held it there for a second as I took in a deep breath. I started to open the door when Connor came up from behind me and slammed it shut. He turned me around and pushed me against the door.</p><p>\u201cI f**k women for the pleasure that\u2019s it, there\u2019s no emotion for me when I f**k them; there never has been.\u201d More tears fell from my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI seduce them, use them, f**k them and leave them. Is that what you want? Is that how you want me to treat you?\u201d he screamed at me. \u201cYou are different Ellery, and you scare me. You make me feel things I never have before. You\u2019re all I think about day and night. I feel empty inside when you\u2019re not around. Don\u2019t you understand? It isn\u2019t supposed to be this way, and if I sleep with you this will all be ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you to make you this way?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He looked away from me as he still had my body pinned against the door.</p><p>\u201cI had a girlfriend when I was eighteen. She started to become obsessive and wanted to spend every waking minute with me. It became too much to try to keep her happy and I felt like I was suffocating, so I broke up with her.\u201d He paused and looked up at me as his eyes started to fill with tears.</p><p>\u201cShe committed suicide 2 days later. She left a note explaining if she couldn\u2019t have me then she didn\u2019t want to live and told everyone to blame me for her suicide.\u201d He took my wrists and turned them up.</p><p>\u201cYou see, this is why I feel sad when I see these on you. It\u2019s a reminder of what I did, and how I killed her.\u201d I gasped at his words as I broke his grip and cupped his face in my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou did nothing wrong, it wasn\u2019t your fault she killed herself. It was her weakness and inability to cope; you cannot blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swore after that I would never fall in love or get emotionally involved with another woman, but with you it\u2019s too late, I\u2019m already emotionally attached and I\u2019m doing everything I can to stop myself, but I can\u2019t.\u201d He turned away, his breathing rapid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I went to him and wrapped my arms around his waist. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally attached, and everything inside me said to stay away, but I see a side of you I don\u2019t think you let other people see; a sweet and tender caring man who would give his world for someone he cares about.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and looked at me. Before I knew it, his lips were on mine, kissing me passionately and warmly. Our tongues danced with each other as he picked me up and carried me to the bedroom. My heart was racing with his, and my body was aching for his touch. He sat me gently on the bed as he lifted up my shirt and gently took it off. He tore the shirt off his back and unbuttoned his pants, never taking his eyes off me. I stood up and took off my jeans and threw them on the floor. I laid down on the bed in just my bra and panties as he examined my half-naked body.</p><p>\u201cYou are so f**king beautiful,\u201d he whispered as he ran his hand up and down my stomach. He climbed on top of me as I wrapped my arms around his neck. His lips met mine for a brief second until his tongue started to explore my neck. I moaned and tilted my head back to give him full access. I arched my back as he took down my bra straps and exposed my br**sts. He groaned as he lightly sucked each nipple and ran his tongue in circles down my stomach. I pressed my h*ps against him and felt his erection, which made me ache for him even more.</p><p>I took my hand and pushed it down the front of his pants as he moaned. He lightly traced the edge of my panties as his fingers made their way to the spot that needed him the most. He circled his fingers around before gently inserting them inside me. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet Ellery, god I want you,\u201d he moaned as he brought his lips to mine. He moved his fingers inside me and then in a delicate in and out motion.</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll be gentle with you, but if I get too rough promise me you\u2019ll stop me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as I helped him off with his jeans and boxers. He took himself and gently inserted himself in me, looking into my eyes with each small thrust, slow and steady. Once he made his way fully inside me, his thrusting became faster. I screamed from the excitement. He was so hard, and he filled me with so much pleasure, something I never experienced before. My hands traveled to his backside as he moved in and out of me, steadying his movement. He brought his mouth to my br**sts; sucking and lightly biting each nipple. This is what I needed. It\u2019s what I wanted from the moment I saw him standing in his kitchen. My hands moved up and down his back as I began to swell; he felt it to as his moans became louder and his thrusts more forceful. He took my leg and wrapped it around his waist, making penetration more deep and intense.</p><p>\u201cCome for me Ellery; come baby,\u201d he whispered in my ear. I started to scream as the pleasure was so intense and I was ready to explode. One more thrust and that was it, I screamed Connors name as my body shook in pleasure and he took me to a place I\u2019ve never been before.</p><p>\u201cChrist Ellery, you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>His moans grew as he yelled my name while filling me with his come. He looked at me panting as I stroked his face with my hand and pulled him down into me. He wrapped his hands around my head and buried himself in my neck. Our rapid heartbeats started to slow as did our breathing. I was done for; there was no going back now, and I was scared I was headed for heartache and trouble.</p><p>He sat up and gently pulled out of me falling onto his side and looking at me. I laid on my side facing him as he softly pushed my hair away from my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>I blushed, \u201cNo, you\u2019re amazing; I have never felt anything like that before.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me on the nose, \u201cCan I be honest with you?\u201d Oh god I thought, what did I do wrong.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you can. You can tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>He traced the outline of my jaw with his finger as he ran them softly across my lips, \u201cYou said you never felt anything like that before. I haven\u2019t either. It was like I was hav**g s*x for the first time.\u201d</p><p>I took his hand and kissed it, \u201cThat\u2019s because we made love Connor. It wasn\u2019t just the act of sex; it was sex with feeling and emotion.\u201d He pulled me closer and brushed his lips against mine so softly, I could have come right then and there. Needless to say, that started round two!</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>I awoke the next morning snuggled in Connor\u2019s arms. He was holding me tight as my head rested on his chest. I opened my eyes, and for the first time in my life, I felt peace and serenity. He made me feel whole and safe like I\u2019ve never felt before. We made love three times last night, and it was the most beautiful experience I\u2019ve ever had, nothing like with Kyle. I felt passion and love with Connor; it was like we couldn\u2019t get enough of each other.</p><p>We finally had our moment, and now I faced a new problem. I have a secret that could destroy this man who finally gave himself to me.</p><p>\u201cMorning baby,\u201d Connor said as he kissed me on the head.</p><p>I looked up at him and smiled, \u201cGood morning, did you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept great, how about you? He asked.</p><p>I lightly ran my finger around his muscular chest, \u201cYes I did; someone wore me out.\u201d He smiled as I moved up closer to his face, covering my mouth with my hand, \u201cI have morning breath.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, and before I knew it I was lying flat on my back with him on top of me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, it doesn\u2019t bother me one bit.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at the clock. \u201cLook at the time; we need to get out of here, or we\u2019ll never make it to the funeral on time.\u201d</p><p>Connor slid off me, got out of bed and held his hand out, \u201cLooks like we\u2019ll have to shower together to save time.\u201d I bit my bottom lip as I took his hand and we walked to the bathroom.</p><p>I would have preferred the water a little hotter, but with what we were doing I was getting hot enough. He pinned my arms against the shower wall and took me from behind, kissing my neck as he moved in and out of me. He let go of my arms as he cupped each breast in his hands, rubbing and feeling them as deep groans came from the back of his throat. He moved flawlessly and had me ready to come the minute he touched me.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready Elle?\u201d he panted.</p><p>I moaned with each deep thrust. \u201cYes, come with me Connor,\u201d I begged. The words were enough for him as his sexy moans grew louder. He pushed himself harder into me, and I felt his warmth fill my insides. He held me tight as we both sank to the shower floor and sat there in pure bliss.</p><p>Once we were able to get ourselves out of the shower, we dressed, and I sat on the bed for a moment as I was starting to feel a little weak and tired.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong baby?\u201d Connor asked as he stood over me.</p><p>I smiled to mask what I was actually feeling.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I\u2019m just sitting here looking around and wishing we could spend another night here; it\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and helped me up, \u201cThere will be plenty of hotels in our future, don\u2019t worry.\u201d I smiled as he used the word future, which to me meant a relationship.</p><p>What have I done? I need to tell him something, but I can\u2019t, not now. Once we get back to New York, I\u2019ll tell him everything and watch his perfect heart-break. Tears started to fill my eyes as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cEllery what is wrong with you? Why do you look like you\u2019re going to cry?\u201d He wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just so happy that\u2019s all; you\u2019ve made me so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made me happy to baby; I can\u2019t even tell you how much.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me and grabbed our suitcases as we headed back on the road to Michigan. I followed behind him trying to fight back the tears.</p><p>We were driving and deciding whose music to listen to. He liked mostly classic rock, and I was more a pop, contemporary kind of girl, so we compromised and took turns listening to each other\u2019s music. I would eventually get him over to my side of music, but that was going to take some work.</p><p>His phone was sitting between us on the console, and it rang. I glanced over and saw Ashlyn\u2019s name appear. Suddenly, my stomach tied itself in knots; I felt sick and I started to sweat. There was no way in f**king hell he was going to continue to talk to or see her. He pressed ignore and kept his head looking straight ahead at the road. She was someone I needed to know about, and it was not going to be painless, but Connor is mine now and he\u2019s going to have to tell me the truth.</p><p>I took in a deep breath, \u201cWho is she Connor?\u201d I reached over and turned off the radio.</p><p>He heavily sighed, \u201cI knew you were going to ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, then you need to tell me about her if we\u2019re going to move forward.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and held it up to his lips, \u201cI do not want to talk about her now Ellery, the car is not the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll wait, and we\u2019ll discuss her later. But whatever you tell me will be ok because things with us are different now and we\u2019re putting all our baggage in the past, right?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at me and smiled, \u201cYou bet we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you,\u201d I said as I took the wrapper off my Twix bar. \u201cDenny told me that you\u2019ve been different since you met me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, \u201cDenny shouldn\u2019t be telling things like that, but it\u2019s true. I was intrigued by you the minute I saw you in my kitchen. When I woke up and heard someone in the kitchen, I walked downstairs to yell at whoever it was for being so loud. Imagine my surprise when I saw this beautiful stranger standing there making coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you yelled at me about your rules.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, \u201cWell, I thought I brought you home from the club; I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d I smacked his arm. He smiled as he looked at the road ahead.</p><p>\u201cWhen you told me what you did for me and gave me quite the attitude, it was that moment I knew I couldn\u2019t let you walk out of my life. Denny knew it to because I kept talking about you and I didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d I laughed and reached over to kiss his cheek, but instead shoved the Twix bar in his mouth.</p><p>We arrived in Michigan as I grew nervous to be back to a place that harbored such bad memories. Connor must have sensed it by my reaction. When I saw the Welcome to Michigan sign, he grabbed my hand and held it tight. My phone rang and it was Peyton calling.</p><p>\u201cHi Peyton,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cOh my god Elle, I just had to tell you about my fantastical date with Dr. Hottie last night.\u201d</p><p>I started to laugh, \u201cSo, you did manage to get him to ask you out?\u201d I put her on speaker so Connor could hear.</p><p>\u201cNo, I asked him out, and we went to dinner, then to a club and back to his place. Elle, he was phenomenal. He f**ks like no one ever has before.\u201d Connor looked at me and started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWow Peyton, that\u2019s great,\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSeriously Elle, he made me do things I never thought of doing before and shit is he big. I was worried when I saw it that it wouldn\u2019t fit inside me. Elle, I got nervous that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to experience this hot man.\u201d</p><p>Connors mouth dropped as he was in shock by Peyton\u2019s openness. I was used to it, so it didn\u2019t faze me.</p><p>\u201cPeyton, sweetie, I have you on speaker and Connor heard every word you just said.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, I have nothing to hide, maybe you two should try it. Live a little Connor, take that girl to bed and show her your sexiness.\u201d I wanted to die right there, in the leather seat of Connors range rover.</p><p>He unexpectedly shouted, \u201cI already did and she was amazing, she made me do things to her that even shocked me.\u201d I hit him on the arm and shot him a look.</p><p>\u201cWoo, you go girl, we\u2019ll swap notes when you get back. I have to go, Dr. Hottie is summoning me back to bed,\u201d she giggled.</p><p>I hung up and shook my head at him, \u201cHow could you tell her that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh please love, like you haven\u2019t embarrassed me before.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue with that, especially with the bartender at the restaurant and then the bellhop. I laughed and looked out the window at the all too familiar place I was heading.</p><p>We pulled into the funeral home and instantly, my stomach felt sick. I got out of the car and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThis is the same funeral home we had for my mother and father,\u201d I said as I stood in front of it.</p><p>Connor put his arm around me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this; you can call your cousin and tell her you got sick or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s the coward\u2019s way out. I can\u2019t escape reality. Besides, I have you with me.\u201d</p><p>We walked through the doors. My cousin Debbie saw me and swiftly walked towards me as we hugged each other tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss Debbie.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry on my shoulder. \u201cI know and I\u2019m sorry for you to; I know they were like your surrogate parents growing up.</p><p>What happened?\u201d She asked as she pointed to my stitches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal; I just fell and hit my head.\u201d</p> <p>I looked over at Connor, \u201cDebbie this is my friend Connor.\u201d</p><p>She shook his hand and then whispered to me, \u201cI heard you and Kyle broke up, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not, but thank you anyway.\u201d</p><p>She led us to the room where my aunt and uncle laid in their beautiful wooden caskets. I walked over and kneeled down in front of them, praying to god to keep them safe. Connor stood behind me with his hands clutching my shoulders. I stood up and made my way through the crowd, saying hi to old friends and making small conversation with distant family. I could hear the whispers of people talking about my attempted suicide seven years ago. I could hear the pity in their voices. The whispers went on about my dad; how he was an alcoholic and couldn\u2019t stop drinking enough to raise his only daughter. They went on to say that if my mother was alive I would not have tried to take my life. I had become the center of attention at someone\u2019s funeral, and I was starting to get pissed. Connor overheard the soft talks as he put his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to them; they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I took in a deep breath, but couldn\u2019t control myself any longer when I heard a woman say, \u201cShe\u2019s the one who tried to commit suicide to save herself from her alcoholic father. He was too wrapped up in the death of her mother to even realize she existed. She should have been taken away from him and then she wouldn\u2019t have tried to...\u201d</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, I rudely interrupted her, \u201cWho the f**k do you think you are talking about my father and family like that?\u201d</p><p>I pushed my wrists in her face, \u201cHere, see the scars. That\u2019s right, take a good look at them, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if they took me away or not, they would still be there.\u201d</p> <p>The whole room was standing in silence staring at me. Connor grabbed my hand, \u201cCome on baby let\u2019s go. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d I turned as he led me out of the funeral home. The cold air cooled my burning skin.</p><p>\u201cI must say, you can put on quite a show,\u201d Connor smiled to lighten my mood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just couldn\u2019t take anymore; I knew this was going to happen if I came back here.\u201d</p><p>He held me and whispered, \u201cIts ok, you\u2019ve said your goodbyes to your aunt and uncle, you told off a few people, and now we can go; unless you want to stay?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNo, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>We hopped back into the Range Rover as Connor searched for hotels on his GPS. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for luxury then I suggest the Athenuem Suite Hotel.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at me and smiled, \u201cFunny; that\u2019s what my phone is telling me. I can reserve the Presidential Suite right here online.\u201d He did just that and then took my hand. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>I brought his hand to my lips and gently kissed it. \u201cI need to go visit my mom and dad\u2019s grave; it\u2019s not too far.\u201d</p><p>He punched the address in his GPS as we headed toward the cemetery. I asked if we could make a quick stop at the flower shop so I could pick up some flowers.</p><p>We arrived at the cemetery. I directed Connor where to park to make it easier to get to their graves. We got out of the car. I took his hand and led him to where my parents were buried. The air was brisk for the end of September. I remembered warmer days this time of year. We walked to the graves for my mother and father that sat side by side.</p><p>\u201cMy father made sure to buy the plot next to where my mother was buried because that way they could be together forever. He loved my mother very much and he considered her his soul mate; that\u2019s why when she died, a part of him died with her.\u201d</p><p>Connor knelt beside me and kissed me on the head, \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I put the flowers on my mother\u2019s grave first and then my fathers. Connor got up, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you some privacy,\u201d he said as he walked a few feet away.</p><p>I sat down on the grass and placed the flowers on each grave. \u201cHi mom, hi dad, I cannot believe it\u2019s been over a year since I\u2019ve visited you last. A lot has changed in the past year. I moved to New York and started selling my paintings in a small art gallery. I met an incredible guy there; in fact he\u2019s here with me now. I know you\u2019d like him daddy. He\u2019s sweet, charming, kind, really sexy, and I believe he would do anything for me.\u201d</p><p>I leaned in closer to their graves and whispered; I love him mom and dad, for the first time in my life I\u2019m truly in love. We\u2019re leaving Michigan tomorrow, so I wanted to stop by and say hi and let you know I\u2019m doing well.\u201d Tears swelled in my eyes. Connor walked over and put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI love both of you very much, and I miss you.\u201d He helped me up as I took in a deep breath and composed myself.</p><p>Connor took me in his arms and held me. \u201cYou\u2019re far too young to have experienced so much death Ellery; it hurts me to know what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>My chest started to tighten, and panic started to settle in. I needed to tell him my secret, but I was too scared about how he was going to react. I couldn\u2019t lose him, not now, I loved him too much.</p><p>He stood with me and stared at my parent\u2019s grave. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine losing my parents, especially at such a young age. You amaze me Ellery with your strength because I don\u2019t know if I could have made it through.\u201d</p><p>I let go of him and bent down to pull some weeds that were surrounding the grave area. \u201cThat\u2019s something you decide whether or not you\u2019re going to do. You can move on and try to live your life as normal as possible, or you can make the decision to let go of life and let sorrow consume you. I\u2019m a big believer of fate, and I believe god took my dad so his pain and suffering could stop, and he could be with my mother again.\u201d He stroked my hair and ran his finger along my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, and I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve to have you in my life.\u201d I kissed his cool lips and smiled as we walked back to the Range Rover and headed for the hotel.</p><p>We arrived at the hotel and took the elevator up to the Grand Room. I was getting use to this Presidential Suite thing. Connor went to the fireplace and turned it on. I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his waist. \u201cYou feel so good,\u201d I said as I took in his scent.</p><p>\u201cNot as good as you feel baby,\u201d he whispered as he buried his nose in my head.</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d I asked.</p><p>A beautiful smile graced his face. \u201cI would love to dance with you, but let me put on some music first.</p><p>He walked over to the small stereo that sat on a table by the window. He walked back to me and wrapped his arms around my waist. We held each other and slowly moved to the soft melody coming from the radio. He stared into my eyes as he leaned in and brushed my lips with his. My hands moved up and down his back as our soft kiss turned passionate and we gently made love by the fire. We laid there, staring into each other; our nak*d bodies wrapped in a blanket.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d He asked as he kissed my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFor you, yes,\u201d I smirked.</p><p>He smiled as he stroked my cheek with his soft fingers, \u201cI am always hungry for you, but we will eventually have to eat real food. I hate to break it to you baby, but we can\u2019t survive on sex alone.\u201d</p><p>He started to tickle me as I laughed and tried to grab his hands. He finally stopped when I said ouch because my eye started to hurt. He softly kissed my stitches before getting up and ordering room service.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t too long before room service was delivered as we got up and got dressed. \u201cAre you feeling ok Elle? You look a little pale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine sweetie; I\u2019m just tired, and I think I have you to blame for that.\u201d</p><p>He flashed me his sexy smile. \u201cIf I recall, you were the one who did all the work.\u201d</p><p>I blushed as I got up from my seat and held out my hand, \u201cWould you care to join me for a hot bath Mr. Black?</p><p>\u201cI would love to Miss Lane, just not too hot; I don\u2019t want you passing out.\u201d I snickered as we walked to the large marbled bathroom.</p><p>The bathtub was large enough for 4 people. Connor started the water and got in as I removed my robe and twisted my hair up so it didn\u2019t get wet.</p><p>\u201cDamn you are so sexy,\u201d he smiled as I walked towards the tub.</p><p>\u201cNot as sexy as you are,\u201d I smiled as I slid in the tub and leaned my back against his firm chest. He put his arms around me and we laid there, taking in the warmth of the water and the softness of our wet skin. He softly kissed my neck. \u201cI love it when you wear your hair up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I smiled as he continued to plant small delicate kisses down my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how bad I wanted you that night of the charity. I did everything I could to restrain myself and not take you in the bathroom and have my way with you.\u201d</p><p>I lightly rubbed his arm with my fingers, \u201cI wish you would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t, I would have been too rough, and I might have scared you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can never scare me off.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head, so I was facing him, \u201cInfinity is forever, and that is what you are to me, you are my forever Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my lips, \u201cThere's no limit to what I wouldn't do for you. Just ask and it will be done, no matter the sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>I traced his lips with my fingers, \u201cThose are the most beautiful words anyone has ever said to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re true, every last word,\u201d he whispered as our lips met one last time before we headed off to bed.</p><p>The next morning Connor and I were drinking coffee in the room when a text message from Kyle came through.</p><p>\u201cElle, I heard you were in town, where are you staying? I need to see you; it\u2019s important?\u201d I sighed as I read it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d Connor asked.</p> <p>\u201cKyle says he needs to see me. He says it\u2019s important, and he wants to know where we\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him then, obviously he needs to see you about something.\u201d Connor seemed calm about it, but I had a terrible feeling.</p><p>I texted Kyle back and told him which hotel I was at and wondering what the hell was he doing in Michigan? Connor and I got dressed and finished packing our things to head back to New York. Before long, there was a knock at the door. I walked over and opened it.</p><p>\u201cHi Kyle, come in,\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cHey Elle\u201d He walked in and froze when he saw Connor come from the bedroom. Kyle looked at me, \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was here with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey Kyle,\u201d Connor waved to him.</p><p>Kyle gave a small hello and looked at me, \u201cEllery, I need to speak with you in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have something to say, you can say it in front of Connor.\u201d Kyle looked sternly at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d want him to hear this.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tied itself in knots, and I started to get extremely nervous.</p><p>\u201cKyle, what is it? Spit it out for f**ks sake; we are heading back to New York in a little while, and I don\u2019t have time for games.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at Connor who started to walk towards the bedroom, \u201cI\u2019ll give you two some privacy.\u201d</p><p>Kyle nodded and turned to look at me, \u201cI made a terrible mistake Elle; I never should have left you.\u201d</p><p>I gasped because that was totally unexpected. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too late, you did what you did, and I moved on, and so did you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you, I didn\u2019t move on. Hell, I dated a few girls, but none of them are you; I love you baby. We had four f**king years together; you can\u2019t just throw that away.\u201d</p><p>Rage started to take over my body. How dare he tell me that I threw our relationship away when he is the one who packed up and left? My voice became uncontrollably loud.</p><p>\u201cI - can\u2019t throw that away? You\u2019re the one who f**king walked out on me, leaving me alone because you needed space, and now you come here back to our hometown and expect me to take you back?\u201d Connor heard me yelling and emerged from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI was scared Elle. I ran because I was scared, but I now realize what a screw up I am and I want you. I want us back for as long as we can be.\u201d</p><p>I pointed my finger at him, \u201cGet the hell out of here Kyle.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes turned cold as he looked over at Connor, \u201cDoes he know Elle? Did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>Connor walked over and looked at me, \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>I stared at Kyle with pleading eyes, \u201cKyle, please leave; please, for both our sake.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew wider, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyle, stop please,\u201d I begged.</p><p>Connor turned to Kyle, \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t she told me?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled my eyes as Kyle began to speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Elle.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Connor and proceeded to talk. \u201cShe has cancer, and she refuses to go and get treatments; she is just going to let herself die. That\u2019s why I left because I couldn\u2019t sit there and watch her die.\u201d</p><p>The tears were flowing freely down my face as Connor looked at me with a horrified look on his face, \u201cEllery is that true?\u201d</p><p>Kyle turned around, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Elle,\u201d he said as he shook his head and walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cEllery is that true?\u201d Connor screamed.</p><p>I flinched and nodded my head, \u201cYes it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his fists and tightened his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019ve known your cancer was back even before I met you and you hid it from me after everything we\u2019ve been through? What kind of person are you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen or experienced such rage and anger in a person like the one standing in front of me. His eyes turned dark as he looked at me with shame and disgust.</p><p>\u201cPlease Connor let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what? What\u2019s to explain? Were you just going to tell me one day you were dying? And why the f**k aren\u2019t you getting any treatment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease calm down,\u201d I pleaded.</p><p>\u201cCalm down? You expect me to be calm when I just found out that the woman I love and want to spend the rest of my life with is dying? I don\u2019t want to hear anything from you. You make me sick Ellery. I can\u2019t do this; I can\u2019t even look at you.\u201d He turned towards the bedroom. I ran after him and grabbed his arm.</p><p>\u201cPlease Connor, don\u2019t do this; let me explain.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his arm away and I fell back onto the floor. He turned and looked at me, his voice now calm but pained, \u201cYour dizzy spells, your tiredness, it\u2019s all part of the cancer. You\u2019re getting worse, and you knew it, but you still didn\u2019t tell me. I bared my soul to you. I told you things nobody in this world knows. I shared myself with you. How could you do that to me Ellery?\u201d His eyes filled with tears as he turned to the bedroom and slammed the door.</p><p>My heart shattered, and I started to shake. I sat on the ground in shock at how quickly my life had just changed. An hour later he threw open the door and came out with his suitcase walking past me.</p><p>\u201cConnor wait; please,\u201d I said as I jumped up.</p><p>He turned around and pointed at me, \u201cStay away from me. I booked a flight for you back to New York; it leaves in 2 hours, so compose yourself and be ready. I\u2019m driving back by myself. I can\u2019t stand to look at you right now, let alone ride in a car with you for 10 hours.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth with my hand as he opened the door and stormed out. I fell to my knees. It felt like the wind had just been knocked out of me. I couldn\u2019t breathe, and I begged God to take me right then and there. He was gone. He left me just like everyone else in my life.</p><p>I got up from the floor and somehow managed to call the desk, telling them I needed a car to take me to the airport. I stumbled to the bathroom and looked in the mirror at the black streaks of mascara that stained my face. I took a washcloth and wiped them away. I didn\u2019t need water; my tears were enough to soak the washcloth. I put on my sunglasses to hide my red swollen eyes and headed to the lobby with my suitcase. I was unsteady and still shaking.</p><p>The car was waiting for me as the driver took my suitcase and opened the door. All I kept thinking was had I told him the truth from the start, maybe things would have been different. I was to blame for his pain, and I hated myself for that. He didn\u2019t deserve this. I knew he could forgive me, if he would let me explain why I didn\u2019t tell him.</p><p>As I sat in the airport, I dialed his number. It went straight to voice mail. My flight was called, and I boarded the plane. I couldn\u2019t think about anything but Connor and how I felt like I had just killed him. Who am I? I searched deep in my soul for that answer. The only thing that came to mind was a cold-hearted bitch that was selfish and only thought of her.</p><p>I never should have let the relationship with Connor get that far. I knew it was wrong, but he made me feel things I never felt before, and he loved me. I never felt love from anyone in my life, not my dad and certainly not Kyle. Our relationship was out of convenience. There were times I knew Kyle cheated on me, but I chose not to say anything because I was afraid to be alone. I spent my whole life alone. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I did love Kyle, but I was never in love with him.</p><p>I arrived back in New York and was walking out of the airport when I saw Denny standing next to the Limo. I stopped as he walked over to me, hugged me and then took my suitcase. I tried so hard not to cry, but my eyes didn\u2019t listen. I sobbed and sobbed in the back of the Limo while Denny drove me home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Miss Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d I sniffed.</p><p>\u201cHe told me that he won\u2019t be seeing you anymore and that I needed to pick you up from the airport and drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you why?\u201d</p><p>No Miss Lane, he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I guess I was going to be the one to tell him. He deserved to know the truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick Denny. I have cancer. Connor left me because I didn\u2019t tell him,\u201d I started sobbing again.</p><p>He pulled up to my apartment and followed me inside with my suitcase. I turned to him as he hugged me.</p><p>\u201cMiss Lane, he\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNot this time Denny, it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and handed me a piece of paper. \u201cThis is my phone number. I want you to call me if you need anything and don\u2019t worry I won\u2019t tell Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the paper and hugged him as we said goodbye. I shut the door behind him and looked around my apartment; it was a representation of how I felt, dark, lonely and small.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>I walked to the bedroom and fell on my bed. The rage was growing inside me as I gripped my comforter with both hands and screamed. I sat up and looked around my small bedroom. The pain inside me was far worse than I ever imagined it could be. My chest felt heavy, and my shattered heart pierced me from within. I clenched my jaw as my hands gripped the bed. I tore my comforter off my and threw it across the room. I ripped off my sheets and balled them up, so they masked the sounds of my screams. I walked to the kitchen for a glass of water to try to calm down, but threw the glass at the wall and watched as it shattered into tiny pieces like my heart. I looked around. I took my desk and tipped it over as the drawer fell out, and my list was lying on the floor. I picked it up and looked at it. I held in my hand my bucket list. A list of all the things I needed and wanted to do before I died. I crumbled the paper and threw it on the ground.</p><p>I went into the bathroom. I was so angry for my life and for what I did to Connor I couldn\u2019t see straight. I reached in the bathtub and grabbed my razor that was sitting on the edge. I took the blade out and held it to my wrist; I was going to end this pain now. I looked at the blade that perfectly matched up with my scar as the memories of that night came flooding back in my mind. I threw the blade down. What the hell was I doing? I fell to ground sobbing as I felt someone\u2019s arms wrap around me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok sweetie; I\u2019m here,\u201d Peyton whispered. She looked down and picked up the blade and then she looked at my wrists, \u201cJesus Elle.\u201d</p><p>We sat on the bathroom floor for what seemed like an eternity. She helped me up and walked me to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI see you went on a destruction spree.\u201d</p><p>I sat on the floor with my knees to my chest as she remade my bed. I felt like I had just had a nervous breakdown; like everything that happened in my life just hit me. Peyton took me by the shoulders and helped me up. She went to my drawer and pulled a night-shirt out and helped me into it. I felt like a rag doll as my arms and legs felt limp. I climbed into my bed as Peyton covered me with the blankets. She scooted next to me and put her arms around me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cConnor called and told me everything. Elle I\u2019m sorry, and I wish you would have told me about the cancer, but now is not the time to talk about this,\u201d she said as she pushed my hair out of my face. \u201cGet some sleep, I\u2019m not going anywhere, and if you\u2019re up to it, we\u2019ll talk when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say a word; I couldn\u2019t. I just shook my head and drifted off into a deep sleep.</p><p>I woke up and looked around the room. I sat on the edge of the bed as Peyton walked in. \u201cFinally, you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>I yawned and ran my hand through my hair, \u201cHow long have I been sleeping?\u201d</p> <p>She put her hands on her h*ps and twisted her face as if she didn\u2019t want to tell me, \u201c2 days.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened, \u201cWhat? 2 days? Peyton, why didn\u2019t you wake me?\u201d</p><p>She came over and sat on the edge of the bed, \u201cSweetie you obviously needed it. When I found you on that bathroom floor, god Elle, I thought you...\u201d She turned her head and looked at the wall.</p><p>I lightly took her hand, \u201cI know Peyton and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She laid her head on my shoulder, \u201cThe only thing that matters is you didn\u2019t. You\u2019re awake now, and you need to eat. Henry made the most delicious chicken noodle soup.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at her with a frown, \u201cWho\u2019s Henry?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and smiled, \u201cDr. Hottie, he\u2019s been here helping me out while you\u2019ve been sleeping.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cSeriously Peyton, you told him everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah Elle, I did; we\u2019re seeing each other now, and I needed someone to talk to, besides, he\u2019s been the biggest help.\u201d</p><p>I got up and felt light-headed. Peyton grabbed my arm, \u201cYou need to eat Elle; it\u2019s been 2 days.\u201d</p><p>She helped me to the kitchen. All I could smell is the aroma of the chicken soup, and it was amazing. I didn\u2019t feel like eating, but my body told me I had to. I sat at the table as Peyton set the bowl of soup in front of me, \u201cEat up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my phone?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over on your desk, I charged it for you.\u201d</p><p>I walked over and pulled it out of the charger and turned it on. I patiently waited for it to turn on so I could see if Connor texted me or called. There was nothing, not even a voicemail. I should have started crying, but there were no tears left in my eyes.</p><p>Peyton sat across from me as I slowly ate the soup Henry had made. \u201cEllery, why didn\u2019t you tell me about your cancer coming back? I thought we were best friends?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at her because I was ashamed. I knew my secret would hurt the people close to me. I\u2019ve already lived it, and I couldn\u2019t go through it again.</p><p>\u201cPeyton, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. I wanted to tell you, believe me, but I couldn\u2019t bear to stand in front of you and see the look on your face after I told you. It was bad enough I had to tell Kyle.\u201d</p><p>She reached over and touched my hand that was resting on the table. \u201cElle, I would have stood by you and supported you. I seriously cannot understand why you wouldn\u2019t tell me. I get that you were scared, and you didn\u2019t want me to worry, but what were you going to do? Just go off and die alone?\u201d</p><p>I got up from the table and sat on the couch, hugging my knees to my chest and burying my head in my hands. \u201cMy life has been made up of hurting people Peyton. I need you to understand that. After my mother died, I was left as a reminder of her to my dad, and that hurt him so much, he had to drink himself to death just to cope. Then there was my suicide attempt and cancer.\u201d I could feel the tears starting to spring back to life.</p> <p>Peyton sat down beside me and put her arm around me pulling me closer. \u201cI do understand where you\u2019re coming from Elle, but do you want to know what I think? I think you made the wrong decision not to tell anyone, especially Connor, and now you have to deal with the consequences. I\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t mean to kick you while you\u2019re down, but you not telling anyone has caused more pain than if you would have been honest from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head on her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Peyton; I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can and have forgiven you Elle, but you have to promise me that you\u2019ll call the doctor and start treatments right away because...\u201d Peyton started to cry. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my life without you in it.\u201d</p><p>I turned towards her and hugged her tight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, and I promise to get help.\u201d</p><p>Peyton got up to clean up the kitchen as I went to take a shower. I got dressed and put on my coat.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of things I need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that you go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I lightly laughed, \u201cAre you my mother now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I do worry about you and I want you to be safe, Oh god I sound like a mother,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be gone long, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I walked out the door and headed down the crowded streets. You would think that the coldness of the air would chill my bones, but every part of my existence was already numb.</p><p>I walked over to the next block to a church I\u2019ve admired since I moved to New York. I needed to seek solace in the house of God. I had unanswered questions and unfinished business. I reached the steps of the church and pulled open the heavy door that led inside. I have wanted to visit this church since I moved here, but Kyle wasn\u2019t a church fan and wouldn\u2019t go with me.</p><p>I looked around at the beauty of the stained glass that overtook the windows and many rows of wooden pews that stood before me. I knelt at one of the pews and said hello to God before I sat down. I stared at the altar as memories of my childhood flashed before my eyes; memories of me sitting in a pew just like this one, in the front row, staring at the large wooden casket that held my mother. My father holding his face crying as strangers all around gave me their sympathetic looks.</p><p>A single tear fell from my eye. As I wiped it away, a man in a white robe sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cGood day my child, is there anything I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello father, I\u2019m just here because I have some unfinished business with god.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a surprised look, \u201cUnfinished business, huh?\u201d</p><p>I looked down and laced my fingers together, \u201cYeah, I need some questions answered about my life, and I was hoping to get them here.\u201d</p><p>The priest sat and listened to me as I told him about my life. I confided in him about my mother and father\u2019s death, my past and recurrent battle with cancer and how I hid the truth from Connor. I didn\u2019t tell him about my suicide attempt, but it wasn\u2019t too hard to hide when I lifted my hand and pushed my hair behind my ear. The priest looked at me and lightly touched my wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a survivor and god gave you a second chance at life.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI know that father, but what good is that second chance if I\u2019m not going to live a full long life?\u201d</p><p>He patted my hand softly, \u201cYou don\u2019t know you won\u2019t live a full long life, and it doesn\u2019t matter what you went through before; what matters is that you survived it. God won\u2019t give you more than you can handle. He knows you\u2019re strong enough to handle this again.\u201d</p><p>I looked down and bit my lip. My emotions were all over the place. \u201cThe chemo was awful,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cChemo isn\u2019t supposed to be fun, but you survived and it made you stronger. What you need to understand is that you refusing to get treatments are just another form of suicide.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at his face; my eyes stinging with tears. He was right. I never thought that what I was doing was a form of suicide. He took my hand and patted it once more as he smiled and walked away.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>I was walking down the street, not knowing where exactly I was going, thinking about my conversation with the priest when I stopped in front of Pizzapopolous. My stomach tied itself in knots as I stared through the window remembering how I made Connor eat pizza with his hands. I lightly smiled as I stepped into the Starbucks that was next door. The aroma of coffee was making me salivate as I ordered a mocha latte. I took my latte and sat at a table towards the back. I looked at the time on my phone. It was already 2 pm. I dialed the phone number that kept consistently calling me for the past 4 months.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Dr. Taub\u2019s office, how may I help you?\u201d The perky voice on the other end spoke.</p><p>\u201cHi this is Ellery Lane; I need to make an appointment to see Dr. Taub\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ok, well the first appointment I have is November 5th at 3 pm.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, \u201cDo you realize that it\u2019s September 30th and November 5th is far away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but that is his first available appointment.\u201d</p><p>I was now starting to get agitated, \u201cMay I please talk to Dr. Taub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but he\u2019s with a patient right now; may I take a message for him?\u201d</p><p>Once again I sighed, \u201cYes, tell him Ellery Lane called and I\u2019m ready. He\u2019ll know what I mean.\u201d I hung up before she could say anything else.</p><p>I put my phone on the table as I looked up and had a near heart attack when I saw Connor walk through the door. He looked rough, like he hadn\u2019t slept in days. He wore dark jeans and my favorite grey t-shirt that defined his muscular chest. A few days\u2019 worth of stubble sat upon his face. His hair was tousled in a different way, but he still looked perfect and hot as hell. I panicked, and I didn\u2019t want him to see me, so I did the only thing I could; I hid under the table.</p><p>The place was packed with people conversing and studying, so the chances of anyone seeing me under the table were slim; with the exception of Dr. Hottie who knelt down and peered his head under the table.</p><p>\u201cYou ok down there, Ellery?\u201d</p><p>I waved my hand to shoo him out-of-the-way so I could see when Connor left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hiding from him,\u201d I mumbled pointing to the line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d he winked.</p><p>Henry stood up, walked over to Connor and shook his hand. He kept him talking until Connor got his coffee and then patted him on the shoulder as he walked out the door. I got up off the floor and sat back in my chair. Henry walked over and sat across from me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and took a sip of his coffee, \u201cNah, now we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head to the side and raised one eyebrow, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He lightly laughed, \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t have needed stitches that day you came to the hospital, I never would have met Peyton.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips together, \u201cYou really like her don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The grin on his face was priceless. \u201cI do, and I know it\u2019s soon, but I\u2019m going to ask her to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s crazy about you; I\u2019m glad my injury brought you two together,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He leaned over the table and brought his hand above my eye. \u201cI must say I did an exceptional job with those stitches,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI have to go; I have rounds at the hospital. I\u2019ll talk you soon Ellery.\u201d I waved goodbye as he walked out the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My phone, face down on the table, started to ring. My imagination went wild with the hopes that maybe it was Connor. I picked it up and looked at it. It was Dr. Taub\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cEllery, its Dr. Taub, I\u2019m glad you called. I want you to come in for some blood work tomorrow morning. After I get the results, we will go ahead and schedule the Chemotherapy. I\u2019m happy you changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to throw the phone at the wall because I wasn\u2019t looking forward to going through that again.</p> <p>\u201cMe too Dr. Taub, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d I sighed and took a sip of my latte.</p><p>When I got home later that day, Peyton had told me that Henry was taking her somewhere special for dinner. I was truly happy for her that someone was worthy of her heart, even if my own was shattered beyond repair.</p><p>\u201cGuess what else?\u201d she jumped up and down. Henry asked me to fly to Colorado tomorrow to meet his parents.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, put on my happy face and jumped up and down with her. I didn\u2019t want to ruin her trip by telling her I was going to be starting chemo soon, so I didn\u2019t tell her about the phone call from Dr. Taub.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be alright sweetie?\u201d she pouted.</p> <p>I waved my hand in front of my face and walked over to the sink, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m going to lose myself in my paintings, so don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>She hugged me tight. \u201cOk I have to go home and pack. We\u2019ll be gone 2 weeks, so if you need anything or you just want to talk, you better call me Ellery Rose Lane. Do you understand me?\u201d She grabbed her coat and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cPeyton,\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she turned and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy for you; go have fun and keep in touch,\u201d I spoke with a fake happiness.</p><p>\u201cThanks Elle, I will, I love you,\u201d she yelled as she shut the door.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t happy for her; I was. I was just feeling sorry for myself because I screwed things up with Connor. How could I be so stupid? What the hell was I thinking? I knew what I had to do and the first step was to apologize to him.</p><p>I called a cab and stepped out into the brisk night air. I had the cab driver drop me off at the soup kitchen; I wanted to volunteer one last time before I started chemo. Once I start, I can\u2019t be around groups of people, especially the homeless with their colds and illnesses. I volunteered for a couple of hours and told Julius what was going on.</p><p>\u201cOh Elle, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be Julius, I\u2019ve been through it before and beat it, and I can do it again.\u201d</p><p>He high fived me, \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. I know you will and if you need anything, anything at all, you call me or anyone here, and we\u2019ll be by your side in a flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Julius, I will and tell your wife I said hi.\u201d He flashed me a smile and nodded his head.</p><p>I walked to the next block to a tattoo parlor where my friend Jack works. \u201cWhy if it isn\u2019t Ellery Lane; good to see you sweetheart,\u201d Jack said as he walked over and bear hugged me. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while, how\u2019s Pey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Jack, she\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at me and twisted his face, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that pretty little head of yours? Are you thinking about a tat Elle?\u201d</p><p>I bit down on my bottom lip, \u201cYep, I sure am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome sit over here. Let me finish her up, and then you\u2019re next,\u201d he winked.</p><p>The girl sitting in the chair was getting a tattoo of angel wings on her left shoulder, with the inscription, \u201cForever Yours.\u201d I looked at her, \u201cNice tattoo?\u201d</p><p>She smiled over at me, \u201cThanks, it\u2019s for my boyfriend. Tomorrow is his birthday, and this is my way of letting him know I\u2019m forever his and no one else can have me.\u201d</p><p>I looked into her eighteen year old eyes, \u201cWow, forever huh?\u201d</p><p>She giggled, \u201cYeah, he said that we\u2019ll be together forever.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at me and rolled his eyes. I had to keep myself from laughing. He finished her tattoo and gestured for me to sit in the chair. \u201cWhat do you want and where do you want it, Elle?\u201d</p><p>I held out both my wrists. I pointed to my left scar; \u201cI want CONNOR on this one and the Infinity symbol on this one,\u201d I pointed to my right. \u201cMake sure the scars are totally covered.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at me and frowned, \u201cWho\u2019s Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt Elle, you realize that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it is Jack, let\u2019s just get it over with.\u201d Nothing could hurt me as bad as I was already hurting.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Jack was a great guy. He was one of those guys that had tattoos covering every inch of both arms, down his chest and back. He was an artist like me, and he proudly displayed his work. His black eyes matched his long dark hair which he frequently wore back in a ponytail. He started with Connors name on my left wrist. The sting was bearable. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it felt like a thousand tiny pins were being poked in me, but I\u2019ve been through much worse. After a couple of hours, Jack was finally finished. I looked at my wrists and smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe redness will go away in a few days, just make sure you keep moisturizer on them so it won\u2019t itch as bad.</p><p>\u201cThank you Jack, they\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a ride home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call a cab.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s midnight; I\u2019ll have Donny close up and I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, \u201cIt's ok Jack, really, I\u2019ll just call a cab.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his coat, yelled for Donny to close up and told me to get in his car.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken you live by my girlfriend, and I\u2019m heading that way anyway; it\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p><p>I walked into my apartment, and first thing I did was grab my laptop, change into my pajamas, climbed in bed and opened my email. The first step in getting on with my life was apologizing to Connor, and I owed him a big one. I hit the compose button as a blank page came up:</p><p>Dear Connor:</p><p>I hope you\u2019re reading this and didn\u2019t delete it before you opened it when you saw my name. If you are, then you\u2019ll see this is my heartfelt apology to you. Words cannot explain how sorry I am for not telling you about my illness from the start. I never meant for us to get as close as we did for that very reason. The night I took you home I had every intention of leaving and never looking back; if I had, we wouldn\u2019t have met and you wouldn\u2019t be hurting right now. I will never forgive myself for not telling you the truth. I believe in fate, and it was fate that brought us together. I told you I was saved for a reason, and I think it was to save you. You have a beautiful heart and soul, and you don\u2019t deserve to never love someone. You will never know what you\u2019ve done for me and how you\u2019ve changed my life. I never would have experienced love the way I have with you, because what you showed me, and how you made me feel, was a first for me in my lifetime. I never loved Kyle. I was with him because he was there and I was afraid of being alone. It is what my whole life was made of, loneliness. My decision not to get treatment at the time was out of pure selfishness on my part, and I\u2019ve come to understand that now. I want to thank you for your love and kindness. If I had one last breath left, I would use it to tell you how much I love you, because I do and I always will. Love forever, Ellery.</p><p>Tears filled my eyes as I hit send. I took in a deep breath, closed my laptop and fell asleep.</p><p>I threw on a pair of leggings, my pale pink long sweater and my black boots. I put some curls in my long hair and applied some makeup for the first time since Michigan. I opened my laptop and checked my email, nothing. I didn\u2019t expect there to be any reply from him, but one could hope.</p><p>I called a cab and headed to Dr. Taub\u2019s office for blood work. I examined my wrists and smiled at the beauty of Connors name and the infinity symbol. I entered the office building and took the elevator up to the fourth floor.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Ellery Lane, and I\u2019m here for some blood work,\u201d I said to the young girl behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have your file right here, I just need to copy of your ID.\u201d I dug through my purse and retrieved my driver\u2019s license and handed it to her. She took notice of my wrist with Connors name.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, that is awesome,\u201d she said.</p><p>I smiled and thanked her as I showed her my other wrist. The scars were barely noticeable, and for people who didn\u2019t know, they wouldn\u2019t see them. The nurse called my name and took me back to the drawing station. She asked me if I was nervous about needles and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through chemo before, so giving blood is nothing.\u201d</p><p>She managed to force a smile; I don\u2019t think she thought that was too funny. She drew 3 vials of blood and told me to have a good day.</p><p>I left the medical building and decided to walk around for a while before calling a cab and heading home. I walked a few blocks doing some window shopping when a text came from Peyton,</p><p>\u201cHey girl, on the plane, headed to Colorado, tell me you\u2019re doing ok.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and replied as I walked down the street. Unaware of my surroundings, because I was too engrossed in texting my best friend, I collided into someone.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, I\u2019m so sor...\u201d I started to say as I looked up at the man I just ran into head on. I took in a sharp breath and looked down, \u201cConnor, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean...\u201d I couldn\u2019t even look him in the eyes; I was so ashamed. My heart started pounding so hard it felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.</p><p>He stood there staring at me, \u201cNo, it\u2019s my fault I should have been paying more attention.\u201d</p><p>We stood there in front of each other, awkwardly, with his hand lightly touching my arm. I pulled away; the pain was too strong and I felt my throat closing up.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I mumbled as I turned the corner and didn\u2019t look back. I reached an alley way between buildings and I stood with my back against the brick trying to catch my breath. All the emotions I tried to force away came flooding back and bruising what was left of my soul.</p><p>I ended up walking home which was about 10 blocks from where I was. I didn\u2019t care; I needed to try to clear my head. I walked through the door, panting and completely exhausted. I made a pot of coffee, and as it brewed, I sat down in front of my easel and continued my painting of the wedding in Central Park. I wanted to get at least 2 more paintings finished before I started chemo. I was up till 2am, and it was finally finished. I painted it with the vision of how I would want my wedding to be; just a delusional thought from my head. I took my brushes over to the sink and let them soak as I went to bed. Tomorrow, I would paint a new picture.</p><p>Morning had come and gone. I was woken up by my cell phone ringing, \u201cHello,\u201d I sleepily answered.</p><p>\u201cEllery, it\u2019s Dr. Taub. Your blood results came back, and I\u2019m a little concerned about your hemoglobin level. It\u2019s a little low, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and start chemotherapy anyway. I\u2019m going to schedule your first treatment one week from today, but first I\u2019m going to prescribe you some iron pills I want you to start taking immediately.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cOk Dr. Taub, one week from today 9:00 am.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the clock as it read 12:00 pm; I couldn\u2019t believe I slept in that late. I put on a pot of coffee and rinsed my brushes. I took a quick shower and got dressed. I noticed the pile of clothes lying in the laundry basket that needed to be washed; I hadn\u2019t done laundry in a while. I sighed as I picked up the basket and set it by the door. I filled a mug with coffee and headed off to the laundry mat; thank god it was only around the corner. After a couple of hours, I finished my laundry and walked back to my apartment where I saw Kyle leaning up against the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want Kyle?\u201d I yell before I approached the walkway. He was standing there with his hands in his pockets staring at me.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how you were?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could have texted me, not just shown up here.\u201d</p><p>This is just what I needed; this a**hole to ruin my day. I wasn\u2019t in the mood, and I needed to start painting.</p><p>\u201cHere let me help you,\u201d he said as he took my key and opened the door. I walked in and set the basket in my room. When I came out I noticed him staring at my painting.</p><p>\u201cElle, this is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, isn\u2019t it? Now what do you want Kyle?\u201d</p> <p>I was being mean, but I didn\u2019t care; I loathed this boy standing in front of me and for what he did.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I wanted to see how you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit Kyle; I\u2019m fine, now you know; now you can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElle, stop acting like this baby,\u201d he said as he swiftly moved closer to me. Before I knew it, his mouth was on mine. I pushed him away with force.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElle, don\u2019t fight it, I know you still love me and I want you so bad.\u201d I stood there in shock by his words and by his actions; I didn\u2019t know what to say.</p> <p>\u201cReally Kyle, you think I love you? Let me tell you something you scum sucking, loathing little worm; you leaving me was the best thing that ever happened in my life. I never loved you. You were a convenience for me, someone to fill the lonely spot in my world.\u201d</p><p>His face turned red and angry, \u201cYou\u2019re a f**king bitch Elle,\u201d he screamed.</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one Kyle, now get the f**k out of my house before I seriously hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try,\u201d he said.</p><p>I picked up a vase that sat in the corner of my desk and threw it at him. He ducked as it shattered against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou are one crazy bitch; I\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>I ran and locked the door, avoiding the tiny pieces of glass that were scattered across my floor. I heavily sighed as I cleaned up the mess I made, remembering the first time I met Connor in his kitchen, and I dropped the mug on his floor.</p><p>The whole week I never left the apartment except when I went to the hospital to have a port put in for chemo. I concentrated on finishing my paintings and successfully I did. Sitting in front of my easel was the only time when I felt somewhat normal. My heart was still shattered, and my soul was empty. I felt lost and broken and no matter what I did I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling, so I just existed.</p> <p>My first treatment was tomorrow morning, and I was scared. I had no one to be there with me. The first time I went through chemo, my dad managed to stay sober long enough to be there for me during my sessions, but as soon as we left the hospital he hit the local bar. Now, I was all alone facing cancer and chemo once again, by myself.</p><p>Tears came to my eyes as I threw myself a little pity party. I had some friends, but I was in no way going to have them stop their lives to help me. I took the paintings to the art gallery and terribly missed seeing Peyton\u2019s smiling face greeting me at the door. She had one more week left in Colorado. Sal shook his head when he saw my paintings.</p><p>\u201cEllery, these are beautiful, you are so incredibly talented, I know these will sell quickly,\u201d he said as he moved them over to the empty wall. I gave him a hug and thanked him.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>Chemo day arrived. I put on my yoga pants, a baggy sweatshirt and threw my hair up in a ponytail; there was no going to chemo looking fashionable. I grabbed my blanket and my kindle and stepped inside the cab that was waiting for me outside. I arrived at the hospital and headed to the cancer center where I would be a frequent visitor once a week for the next 6 months. Because I waited longer than most to have chemo after I was told my cancer came back, the doctor and I agreed to do a little more aggressive treatment that would shorten the duration of my therapy, hopefully.</p><p>Nurse Bailey called me back into the room where a total of 16 oversized blue chairs lined the walls of the sterile white room. There were eight chairs on one side and eight on the other; each chair having its own IV pole and curtain. I never felt comfortable with my chemo treatments. People always looked at me like I was way too young to have cancer. I was the youngest one there for the first 8 months until a 9-year-old girl named Molly showed up.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone here with you sweetie?\u201d Nurse Bailey asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>She patted my hand and gave me a sympathetic look, \u201cWell, don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m here with you.\u201d</p><p>She was an older woman probably in her 50\u2019s with short salt and pepper hair. Her voice was soft but perky. She told me about her ex-husband and her 3 grown children as she sat me in the chair and did some prep work. She excused herself and said she\u2019d be right back. I looked around the room at the six chairs that were filled by people who were here for the same reason. It was weird because being complete strangers, we all shared a common bond.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is here to see you,\u201d Nurse Bailey said in her perky voice. I looked up from my phone and practically went into cardiac arrest when I saw Connor standing there. I felt like I was going to suffocate.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Connor?\u201d I managed to ask.</p><p>He sighed and sat in the chair next to me.</p><p>\u201cHello Ellery.\u201d</p><p>I continued to look down at my phone, and I refused to look at him. \u201cI asked you a question,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cNobody should have to go through this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone, I have Nurse Bailey,\u201d I pointed, still looking at my phone.</p><p>Before I knew it, he grabbed my phone from my hands and put it in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell Connor?\u201d I snarled.</p><p>Nurse Bailey came walking over, \u201cOk sweetie, here is your cocktail, bottoms up,\u201d she smiled as she inserted the needle into my port and hung the bag on the pole. I gently smiled at her, \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>Connor looked at me, \u201cI\u2019m here as your friend Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have my phone back please?\u201d I asked nicely as I held out my hand.</p><p>He took in a sharp breath, reached in his pocket, pulled out my phone and handed it to me. Our fingers touched as he put it in the palm of my hand. My heart started racing like it always did when he touched me.</p><p>\u201cThis is how this is going to work,\u201d he spoke. \u201cI am going to bring you here every week and then take you home. I\u2019ve hired a private nurse to come to your apartment daily to tend to you and make you comfortable.\u201d</p><p>All kinds of thoughts were running through my head; why was he doing this for me? Is this his revenge, to kick a girl during her chemo sessions?</p><p>\u201cWhy Connor, why are you doing this?\u201d He looked at me with cold eyes.</p><p>\u201cI owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took care of me once so now I\u2019m returning the favor. I know you don\u2019t have anyone else.\u201d</p><p>So now I\u2019ve become his charity case, great. \u201cThe night you brought me home from the beach and put me to bed, you said we were even. You don\u2019t need to stay. I\u2019m fine you can go.\u201d</p><p>He looked down and laced his fingers together, \u201cI\u2019m staying Ellery, and you are in no position to say otherwise.\u201d I rolled my eyes and tried to think of a million ways to run.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, how did you know I started chemo today, and how did you know I was here?\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI know a lot of things Ellery; I told you before that I can find out anything.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look, \u201cStalker.\u201d</p><p>I sat there reading while he sent emails and did business from his iPad.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be here, I\u2019m sure you have better things to do than sit in a room watching people get chemo for 5 hours,\u201d I randomly said.</p><p>\u201cWhether I have better things to do or not, this is how it\u2019s going to be, so let\u2019s be quiet and don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d his voice was flat and cold.</p><p>Didn\u2019t he realize I was pissed off at the world at that moment and he was making it worse? I didn\u2019t want him here because it was bringing back all the emotions I tried to bury, but I did want him here because I had a bit of hope in the back of my mind that he still wanted to be with me and that he possibly forgave me. I looked down at my kindle and tried to read, but as I looked at the words, the only thing registering in my mind was Connor.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing sweetie?\u201d Nurse Bailey cheerfully asked as she checked my chemo drip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing f**king fantastic Nurse Bailey, because I know that probably by tonight, I\u2019ll have my head down the toilet for a good hour or two.\u201d</p><p>Connor looked at me and then at Nurse Bailey, \u201cEllery that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>The nurse looked at him sympathetically, \u201cIt\u2019s ok, she\u2019s angry right now and needs to let it out, and I\u2019m used to it. I just try to make my patients as comfortable as possible.\u201d</p><p>Connor leaned closer to me and whispered, \u201cCould you please stop being a smart ass? She is only trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at him because if I did, I was going to slap him right across the face. I didn\u2019t say a word. I was more than ready to rip that chemo line right out of me and run as fast and far away as I could. This is what I wanted to prevent, the hostility, the anger, the resentment. I just wanted to live my life with the time I had left, happy.</p><p>That was the longest 5 hours of my life. Nurse Bailey removed the chemo drip from my port and gave me a hug goodbye. Connor grabbed my blanket, and I tore it out of his hands, \u201cI got it.\u201d He heavily sighed and followed behind me as I exited the hospital. Connor opened the Limo door for me as I slid in the seat.</p><p>Denny turned and looked at me, \u201cHello Miss Lane.\u201d He was the only one of the day that got a smile from me.</p><p>\u201cHi Denny.\u201d</p><p>Connor climbed in next to me, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window, \u201cI\u2019m fine right now; it takes a few hours or even a few days for the chemo to hit you.\u201d The ride to my apartment was silent.</p><p>Connor got out of the Limo and followed me inside, \u201cI want you to start packing.\u201d</p><p>I turned and looked at him, \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>He took in a sharp breath, \u201cYou will be staying in the guest room at my penthouse.\u201d I felt the blood drain from my face, and my heart started to beat faster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere; this is my home. This is where I\u2019m staying.\u201d But the idea of sleeping in the enormous comfy bed was appealing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d his voice was raised, \u201cI don\u2019t want you staying here alone.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to him and put my finger to his chest, \u201cI\u2019m not your f**king charity case Connor Black, and I don\u2019t need your help, besides you hate me anyway, why would you want to help me after what I did?\u201d I slowly turned around and walked to the sink for a glass of water. I stood there with my hands on the edge.</p><p>He slowly walked up behind me, \u201cEllery, I don\u2019t hate you, please don\u2019t ever say that again. Yes, I will admit I\u2019m still angry, and I will be for a very long time, but I need to put all that aside because you are my friend and you need help. Please put your stubbornness aside and let me help you.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft and his words sincere. I wanted to throw my arms around him and cry into his shoulder, but I couldn\u2019t, he admitted he was still angry and that he was only my friend.</p> <p>\u201cYou said you hired a nurse to come here and check on me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed again, \u201cWell, I changed my mind and I\u2019m making other arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, let me get my things.\u201d I gave in because I didn\u2019t have the strength to fight him, and I was scared of being alone.</p><p>He turned around and looked over at the wall that was missing a chunk of drywall, \u201cWhat happened over there?\u201d</p><p>I came from the bedroom as he walked over and grabbed my bags, \u201cI threw a vase at Kyle.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a laugh, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he wouldn\u2019t leave so I threw a vase at him; needless to say he left after that.\u201d Connor shook his head and continued to laugh.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>I threw myself on the bed I\u2019ve grown to love. Connor set my bags down in the corner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out tonight; if you need anything help yourself.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and gave half a smile, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>He walked out and shut the door. Did he just make it a point to tell me he was going out? I could feel the burning and the rage rev up in my body; jealousy was setting in. This was not a good idea, but if it got too unbearable staying with him, I would pack up and leave.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, and I was tired so I decided to turn in early. I was woken up by the sudden feeling of nausea that overtook my body. I looked at the clock. It was 2 am. I flew out of bed and to the bathroom that was directly across the hall. Thank god I made it as I started to vomit uncontrollably. Here we go I knew it wouldn\u2019t take long; it didn\u2019t the last time. As I was leaned over with my head in the toilet, I heard the door slowly open.</p><p>\u201cEllery,\u201d I heard Connor say as he grabbed my hair and held it back.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want him to see my like this. Moving here was not a good thing to do, and now I regretted it.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here Connor, please just go.\u201d</p><p>He knelt down beside me as he held my hair, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until you are back in bed.\u201d</p><p>I threw up a few more times, mostly dry heaving as he walked to the sink and wet a cloth with tepid water. He folded it up and put it on my head. I quickly grabbed it out of his hand. I managed to get up and take small steps towards the door. I was so weak that I wanted to collapse right on the marble floor. Connor lightly took a hold of my arm and helped me into bed. He pulled the covers over me and as he went to walk away, I grabbed his hand. He turned around and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing; you have no idea what you\u2019ve gotten yourself into Mr. Black.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at me without saying a word then walked out the door, leaving it open a crack. I was too exhausted to think of anything. I just wanted to sleep peacefully.</p><p>I opened one eye at the sunlight peeking through the curtains that hung on the windows. I stretched and rolled over on my side, taking in the view of the city that stood outside my window. So much for the anti-nausea meds Nurse Bailey fed me. I heard the door slightly open.</p><p>\u201cEllery, are you awake?\u201d I heard his voice whisper.</p><p>I rolled over and looked at him standing there in his dark jeans and a black cotton button down shirt that he left untucked. His hair was messy and damp, but in that sexy way that made me ache for him.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d He asked from the doorway.</p><p>I sat up on the edge of the bed, \u201cI\u2019m feeling ok at the moment. I think I\u2019ll take a shower.\u201d</p><p>His eyes stared into me as if he wanted to reach out and touch me.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re done, come downstairs and Claire will make you some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>I got out of bed and opened my bag to dig out my clothes for the day. \u201cWho\u2019s Claire?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know you had a housekeeper, you never mentioned her.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand through his hair, \u201cThe opportunity never came up I guess.\u201d</p><p>I walked past without even looking at him. I walked in the bathroom as he followed me and stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the office to do some work, I\u2019ll be home later.\u201d</p><p>I kept my back to him as I turned on the shower, \u201cOk, see ya later.\u201d</p><p>My words were flat with no emotion. I climbed in the shower and sat on the floor. I curled myself into a ball and cried.</p><p>After my shower, I walked down to the kitchen. \u201cYou must be our new houseguest Ellery right?\u201d She asked as she walked over and hugged me.</p><p>I greeted her warmly, \u201cYes, and you must be Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure am honey, now sit down and tell me what you would like me to make you.\u201d</p><p>Claire was a breath of fresh air in this house. She was an older woman with brown hair that sat just above her shoulders. Her smile was as warm as her deep brown eyes that lit up when she saw me. Maybe she was happy to have another female in the house. I sat at the island as she put in front of me a cup of peppermint tea.</p><p>\u201cDrink up; it will soothe your stomach.\u201d I took a small sip and set the cup down.</p><p>\u201cMr. Black told me you were sick last night, so how about you start with some toast and scrambled eggs?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I was curious as to how much she knew about me and our situation, so I asked an obvious question.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did Mr. Black tell you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she put the bread in the toaster, \u201cHe only tells me what I need to know. Mr. Black is a very private person. He says you\u2019re a friend and he wanted to help you. He\u2019s a very generous man.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. If the chemo doesn\u2019t kill me, then staying here with the man whose life I pretty much ruined will.</p><p>\u201cAh I see you two met,\u201d Connor said as he lightly stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI thought you left,\u201d I said with a - I don\u2019t like you very much right now - attitude.</p><p>\u201cI had to finish up some computer work here first, don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be leaving soon.\u201d</p><p>Claire eyed me and then looked at Connor as he sat over at the table.</p><p>\u201cHere honey, try to eat something, you\u2019ll feel better if you do.\u201d</p><p>I saw Connor look over at me out of the corner of my eye. I picked up the fork and started to eat some eggs. The food was starting to help a bit, or maybe it was the tea, who knows.</p><p>Connor finished his coffee and walked over to me, \u201cI\u2019m leaving now so if you need anything Claire will be here all day.\u201d I didn\u2019t look at him as I waved my hand.</p><p>\u201cI can tell this is going to be more difficult than I thought,\u201d he mumbled as he left the kitchen.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if he meant for me to hear it or not, but I did and it pissed me off.</p><p>Claire studied me for a moment, \u201cCalm down honey it\u2019s not worth getting upset over.\u201d</p><p>I decided that if I was going to stay here, Claire had a right to know what happened between me and Connor. I told her everything.</p><p>She sat down next me holding her coffee cup, \u201cI figured something was going on between the two of you. You must have been the reason why Mr. Black was always in a good mood and smiling all the time not that long ago.\u201d</p><p>She saw the look on my face and took my hand; she pushed back my sleeve and looked at my wrist and then took my other hand and did the same, \u201cDoes he know about this?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNo, but he will soon enough, it\u2019s not something I can keep hidden for long.\u201d Claire smiled and patted my hand.</p><p>I grabbed my coat and stepped outside. The air was a little warmer than it had been. The sun was shining bright, and there wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky; it was a perfect October day. I needed to get lost in myself so I decided to take a walk to Central Park. I needed to be alone, and what better place than to think about how much my life sucked at the moment is in the park. I made my way to the Conservatory Garden and found a spot in the middle of the grass. I laid the blanket on the soft grass and sat down with my knees to my chest. My phone started to ring; it was Connor. Someone must have tipped him off that I escaped. I hit ignore. I figured he would go to my apartment first, then probably the art gallery or soup kitchen. He\u2019ll eventually figure out where I am so I wasn\u2019t worried, and I honestly didn\u2019t care. I inhaled through my nose, taking in the mild October air. I studied the flowers that were around me for soon they would be gone.</p><p>I laid down on my back and stared up at the sky. I had a little talk with god and asked him to give me the strength to endure this process all over again. Connor kept calling me, so I turned my phone off. I asked god for a sign to let me know he would help me through this as I felt a tiny drop of rain fall on my cheek. That was good enough for me until a few clouds rolled in and it started to pour; so much for my perfect October day. I laid there staring up at the sky that was falling down upon me. I wanted so badly for the rain to wash away my illness and my fears. I continued to lay there in my delusional state until I heard a familiar voice call my name.</p><p>\u201cEllery, what the f**k do you think you\u2019re doing, are you crazy?\u201d I looked at him as he was walking towards me holding an umbrella.</p><p>\u201cAre you, for coming out here after me?\u201d</p><p>I saw his jaw tighten as he approached me, \u201cLook at you, you\u2019re soaked; get up now before you get sick.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cI\u2019m already sick, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>He stared down at me with a strange look on his face and did something I never thought Connor Black would do. He laid down beside me and looked up at the sky. I looked over at him as he struggled to keep his eyes open as the rain pelted him in the face; a small smile crossed my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked as he turned and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cCause I can lay here and no one will know I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment and then back up at the falling rain. We laid there and didn\u2019t speak a word. Connor put his hand on top of mine, and that was all the words we needed. Both of us were soaked, and I was starting to get cold. I sat up on my elbows.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at me and smiled, \u201cGood because I can\u2019t stand being wet like this.\u201d</p><p>I lightly laughed as we both got up and started walking out of the park. I suddenly stopped and turned the other way to some nearby bushes. I bent down as the nausea set in and I began to vomit. Connor waited for me to finish as he put his arms under my legs, picked me up and carried me to the car. That was all I needed to feel safe again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He carried me up to the penthouse and to the bedroom. He started to help me undress as I stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine; you need to get out of those wet clothes. Please go change; I\u2019m going to take a hot bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel well enough to take a bath by yourself?\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look, \u201cIf I said no does that mean you\u2019ll get in with me?\u201d</p> <p>He looked down, \u201cEllery.\u201d</p><p>I saw the look on his face, and it was one of pain, almost the same look as the day in the hotel room.</p><p>\u201cI was kidding Connor, now get out of here and go change.\u201d</p><p>He walked out and left me standing there feeling like an idiot. I didn\u2019t make it to the bathtub. I put on my nightshirt and robe and collapsed on top of the bed.</p><p>Chapter 28</p> <p>I woke up 4 hours later and couldn\u2019t move. The part I feared the most hit me; the pain. I started to whimper when I wanted to scream because I didn\u2019t want anyone to hear me. My body felt like it\u2019d been hacked into a million pieces, starting from the top of my head down to my toes. There wasn\u2019t a single bone, joint, or muscle that didn\u2019t hurt. I tried to get comfortable, but I couldn\u2019t. I slowly got off the bed and wanted to scream when my feet touched the floor. I stood up and made my way to the door; I stepped out into the hallway and dropped to my knees and then onto my side.</p><p>I started to cry, more a soft whimper like a puppy. Connor must have been in his office, which was the room next to the staircase because I could hear him on the phone. I tried to crawl to the bathroom, but the pain was too great. It wasn\u2019t too long when I saw Connor running up the stairs, skipping a step in between.</p><p>\u201cEllery, my god, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>At that point, I was shaking uncontrollably. I put my hand up. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, it hurts,\u201d I cried.</p><p>He yelled for Claire and told her to call the nurse immediately and get her over to the penthouse. He sat down beside me and touched my hair.</p><p>\u201cI need to get back in bed, just pick me up and get it over with,\u201d I begged. He stood and picked me up off the ground. He flinched as I screamed. He carefully carried me into the bedroom and laid me on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cThe nurse will be here soon; she\u2019ll help you,\u201d he said as he gently brushed the hair away from my face.</p><p>I looked at him and cried, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry for this, I never wanted you to see me like this.\u201d</p><p>He knelt down beside the bed and lightly touched my hand. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for; I\u2019m the one who is sorry. It kills me to see you in such pain,\u201d he said as a single tear fell down his cheek.</p><p>I took my thumb and gently wiped the tear from his face as he took my hand and looked at my wrist; the one tattooed with his name. He didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything as the nurse came in with her bag. Connor stood up and sat at the edge of the bed while Claire stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to be just fine sweetie,\u201d she said as she held up a needle. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a shot of morph**e for the pain.\u201d</p><p>She injected the shot into my hip and told me to relax. She then asked Connor to step into the hallway. I started to relax as the pain started to subside. Connor walked back in room and to the other side of the bed, where he sat up with his back against the headboard. I turned on my side to face him.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t always going to be like this,\u201d I said. \u201cThe first 3 days after chemo are the worse than I am usually fortunate enough to have a few days where I feel good; well as good as can be expected on chemo.\u201d He didn\u2019t say a word; he only sat there playing with my hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get to use to doing that, it\u2019s going to be gone soon.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed me that smile that melts my heart, \u201cI don\u2019t care; you\u2019ll still be just as beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him, and he kissed me lightly on my forehead. He softly took a hold of both my wrists and looked at them, rubbing the tattoos lightly. I saw the anguish in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI noticed these at the hospital when you were receiving chemo. I\u2019ve been waiting for you to show me; why Ellery?\u201d He asked.</p><p>I rolled over as the morph**e settled through my body and I was able to step out of bed and slowly walked over to the window. \u201cBecause at some point you have to realize that some people can stay in your heart, but not in your life, and this is my way of keeping you in my heart.\u201d</p><p>Silence overtook the large room until I felt his arms wrap around me and he softly whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cGet back in bed and I\u2019ll bring you some tea.\u201d</p><p>I turned around with his arms still wrapped around me as I delicately kissed him on the cheek. He closed his eyes and took in a sharp breath. He released his arms from me and left the room. He came back a few minutes later with a cup of peppermint tea and set it on the nightstand, then climbed on the other side and sat next to me.</p><p>\u201cPeyton called me and read me the riot act,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019s been trying to get a hold of you for a couple of days and when she didn\u2019t have any luck, she called me. When I told her about your chemo and that you were staying here, she started yelling and said to sit tight because she was coming straight over from the airport to kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cOh god, not tonight.\u201d</p><p>Connor lightly laughed, \u201cNo, tomorrow, her flight was delayed.</p><p>I let out a sigh of relief, \u201cGood, because tonight I couldn\u2019t deal with her.\u201d</p><p>I must have drifted to sleep because when I woke up I was under the covers and Connor was gone. I felt so alone and did the only thing I couldn\u2019t control, I cried. As my shoulders were shaking and the sobs were buried deep in my pillow, I felt an overwhelming sense of comfort from behind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok baby, I\u2019m here.\u201d Connor wrapped his arms around me and held me the rest of the night.</p><p>I woke up and patted the empty side where Connor laid and held me last night. I wanted to wake up in his arms and I wanted him to tell me that he loved me. I\u2019m getting too many mixed signals from him; it\u2019s hurting me and I don\u2019t have the strength to fight cancer and him at the same time.</p><p>I felt like my chemo fog lifted and I was starting to feel somewhat normal, as if I even knew what normal was anymore. I followed the aroma of coffee down the stairs and into the kitchen where Claire was cooking.</p><p>\u201cGood morning dear,\u201d she turned and smiled.</p><p>\u201cGood morning Claire, I am in desperate need of some coffee.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the cabinet and grabbed a mug, \u201cOne cup coming right up.\u201d</p><p>I heard a raised voice coming from over by the living room. I took my coffee and walked towards it when I noticed it was coming from Connor\u2019s office. He was on the phone and he sounded angry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated Ashlyn. Yeah, well I\u2019m sorry about the other night but something came up; fuck,\u201d I heard him yell as he threw his phone across his desk. He paced back and forth, rubbing the back of his neck and shaking his head. It hurt me to the very core that he still talked to her and still never explained to me who she was and what their relationship was. I heard his footsteps coming towards the door as I darted back into the kitchen.</p><p>He walked in and looked at me, \u201cAre you ok today? You look better.\u201d I could see the anguish in his face. He looked tired and weary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said as I looked down.</p><p>Then out of nowhere he went off on a tangent and started yelling, \u201cYou always say you\u2019re fine Elle, even when you\u2019re not, are you ever really fine? Can you ever just tell me the f**king truth for once in your f**king life so I can stop playing these goddamn guessing games? Can you say something other than I\u2019m fine Connor, because you know what Ellery, it makes me sick.\u201d</p><p>I stood there shocked, unable to say anything in my defense. I didn\u2019t know this man standing in front of me and I didn\u2019t want to know him at this moment either. He stood with his hands on the counter, his body pushed away from it with his head down. I walked over to him and as he looked at me, I took my hand and slapped him as hard as I could across his face. There was no emotion in his eyes or on his face, just like that night at the club. I walked out of the kitchen and started up the stairs. I heard something break as Claire looked at me from the living room. Before I made it to my room, I heard the front door slam. My heart was racing, but other than that I felt nothing at that moment. I couldn\u2019t stay in his house another day. He was too affected by my illness and he didn\u2019t deserve to live like this. I packed my bag and left.</p><p>I hailed a cab and went back to my cold, lonely apartment. I walked to my room and pulled out a piece of paper from under my mattress. I stared at it for a while, folded it up and tucked it in my purse. I threw the rest of my clothes, or really what would fit into the bag that was already packed. I grabbed some cash from my drawer, grabbed my laptop and left. I walked down the street for a bit until I was able to hail a cab. I got in and smiled when I saw Manny looking at me from the front.</p><p>\u201cAre you going somewhere Elle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah Manny, I am going somewhere, but I need you to promise me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, anything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI need you to take me to the airport and you cannot tell a single person where you took me or that you saw me, please.\u201d He looked at me from the rearview mirror, \u201cYeah, ok Elle, don\u2019t worry, I never saw you.\u201d</p><p>I arrived at airport and was fortunate enough to book the flight that was leaving in 30 minutes to Michigan. I checked my bag and ran to the gate. I handed the man my ticket and boarded the plane. I sat in my seat and took a deep breath. My phone beeped and as I took it out of my pocket; I saw a text message from Connor.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for my behavior, I\u2019m on my way back to the penthouse and we need to talk, if you\u2019re feeling up to it we can go out for lunch.\u201d</p><p>My heart sank as I read his words, but it was too late, I knew what I had to do now; it\u2019s probably what I should have done from the start, before Connor Black walked into my life.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>I took a cab to the bank where my father used to do all his banking. I stepped inside and walked over to the teller handing her the folded piece of paper I took from my purse. She walked me over to the safety deposit boxes, pulled the number that was indicated on the paper and led me to a small room.</p><p>\u201cLet me know when you\u2019re finished,\u201d she smiled. I stared at the box and the letter as the memory of my father\u2019s death haunted me.</p><p>Dear Ellery,</p><p>If you\u2019re reading this letter that means one thing that I\u2019ve gone to be with your mother. I\u2019m sorry for being such a lousy father to you. I tried to do what\u2019s right by you, but the death of your mother was too much for me to handle and drinking was the only way to kill the pain, at least for me. No matter how bad it got you always stood by me and took care of me when I should have been the one taking care of you. You had to grow up so fast and I\u2019m sorry for that. I feel like I stole your childhood from under you. You should have been playing with your friends and having fun, instead you were home taking care of your alcoholic father because he wasn\u2019t strong enough to help himself. I do know one thing Ellery; I know that you grew into a strong young lady. I know you\u2019ve endured a lot of heartache through the years and then having to fight cancer was unfair, but you did it baby and I\u2019m so proud of you. If I don\u2019t or didn\u2019t get the chance to tell you that, I am now. I am so proud of my little girl. Your mother gave me the attached instructions before she died and asked me to hold it until you were eighteen. It\u2019s the number of a safety deposit box your mother had kept for you. I\u2019ve been adding to it every year since your mother passed. When you are ready, go and open the box and remember how much you are loved. Love always, Dad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My Aunt Diane gave me the letter a couple of days after my dad died. She told me he gave it to her for safe keeping and if anything should happen to him before my eighteenth birthday she was to give it to me. I held onto the letter all these years because I was never ready to open that box.</p><p>I carefully slipped my fingers around the edge of the top and lifted it slowly till it stopped. I looked down into the box with the black felt lining and pulled out a wad of cash that was sitting on top in a white envelope. I set it down on the table and pulled out a silver heart locket with an inscription on the back, \u201cHappy 18th Birthday, Love Mom. I covered my mouth as the tears poured from my eyes. I opened the locket and there was a picture of my mother one side and me as a child on the other. I wiped my eyes as I pulled out a video cassette tape that was labeled, \u201cTo my darling daughter.\u201d Lying at the bottom of the box was a stack of bonds with my name on them. I took a deep breath and composed myself before closing the lid on the box and leaving the room.</p><p>My phone chimed. I reached in my pocket and pulled it out; there was another text from Connor.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you Ellery?\u201d</p> <p>I looked at his words, my heart aching and I didn\u2019t want him to worry, so I replied.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I had to leave, my being at your place was hurting you as bad as it was hurting me. The only thing I can tell you is I\u2019m ok and please don\u2019t worry about me. I have a few things I need to do and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my things and handed the teller the safe deposit box and the bonds. As I was waiting for her to return, a text from Connor came through.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll be back? Where the f**k are you going? You have treatments to finish; you better get the f**k back here NOW!\u201d</p><p>I lightly laughed because even over text he was yelling at me, but I loved him and I was doing this for him, for us. A few moments later another text came through.</p> <p>\u201cI will find you Ellery Lane even if I have to travel to the ends of the earth; make no mistake I will find you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and quickly replied, \u201cI know you will my stalker.\u201d I shut my phone off and took the money the teller handed me from my bonds. Combined with the cash in the envelope and with the money from the sale of my paintings, I had a little over $100,000.</p><p>I called a cab and had the driver drive me to the airport. I stepped up to the ticket counter and booked a one way flight to California. The flight didn\u2019t leave for a couple of hours so I sat down and turned on my phone. I dialed Peyton\u2019s number and she answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cEllery, where are you? I\u2019ve been so worried, we\u2019ve all been worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeyton, stop and calm down, I need you to listen to me, you are the only one I\u2019m telling this to so whatever you do, don\u2019t you dare let Connor or Henry know, please.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, \u201cOk, anything.\u201d</p> <p>I took a deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m flying out to California for a while and I need you to throw Connor off my trail. I need you to talk to him every day and find out what he\u2019s learned. I need to buy some time before he finds me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want him to find you?\u201d She whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do want him to find me because if he does then I know we were meant to be together and everything I\u2019m doing would be for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pissed Ellery; he was throwing things and swearing. You should have heard the things he was saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s angry and he\u2019ll get over it, just try to be a friend to him. I have to go, love you friend.\u201d I hung up and threw my phone in the trash.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>I stepped onto the pavement of Los Angeles, California a nervous wreck. I couldn\u2019t believe I was here, alone in a strange city. The air was much warmer than New York and it felt like the sun shined brighter. I put on my sunglasses and hailed a cab. I handed the driver a piece of scrap paper from the airport in Michigan and told him to take me to that address. He pulled up to the building and as he drove away; I stood there examining my surroundings. I walked around the side of the rental office where I met Mason, the manager of the apartment building.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Mason Grant, I manage these wonderful apartments and you must be Ellery?\u201d</p> <p>I extended my hand to greet his, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous,\u201d he said as he turned and grabbed a key off the board.</p><p>We walked over to the next building and he took me up to the third floor apartment. He inserted the key and opened the door. I walked in and looked around. It was fully furnished and clean and that\u2019s all I needed. Before I agreed to rent it, I needed to talk to Mason first. I asked him to sit at the table. He looked at me awkwardly as he sat down.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re running from the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that,\u201d I laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t leave a paper trail because it will make it easier for someone to find me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in closer, \u201cOh now you have me intrigued, continue.\u201d</p><p>I continued with the story about why I was here and all about Connor. I went as far as to show him my tattoos. He grabbed my wrists and stared at them. Then he looked at me with a tear in his eye, \u201cYou had me at hi.\u201d I laughed and he reached over and hugged me. We came to the agreement that I would not sign a lease and that I would pay cash every month for as long as I needed to stay, but I had to promise one thing; I had to come to his place for dinner and meet his partner Landon. I agreed and hugged him as he handed me the keys to my new apartment.</p><p>I looked around. It was bigger than my box back in New York. The thing that excited me most was the fireplace in the living room. The kitchen was much more spacious with its white cabinets and black granite countertops. This place had everything I needed right down to the BUN coffee maker. I walked to the bedroom and set my bag on the bed. The first thing I had to do was go get a new cell phone.</p><p>I walked down the street to the shopping center and slipped inside the wireless store. I glanced at the wall that said \u201cPREPAID PHONES.\u201d I picked the phone, paid and headed to the little grocery store at the end of the strip. I picked up some essentials and carried my bags back to the apartment. I was exhausted by time I got back. I put my food away, sat on my couch and texted Peyton.</p><p>\u201cDO NOT store my name in your phone and delete these texts after you read them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you some secret agent now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll is quiet on the home front so far; Connor did ask me to let him know if I hear from you. Are you sure you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have to go, remember delete.\u201d</p><p>I unpacked my bag and put everything away in the dresser and closet. The one thing I was missing that I needed was an easel and paints. I walked downstairs to Mason\u2019s apartment and knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cHello fabulous,\u201d he answered exuberantly, \u201cCome in.\u201d I walked into his beautifully decorated apartment that was bigger than mine.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where there\u2019s an art store close by?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and cocked his head, \u201cAn art store? As in completed paintings or artsy supply stuff?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cArtsy supply stuff.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and yelled, \u201cLandon, come meet our new tenant that lives upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Landon, who looked like he just stepped out of the pages of a GQ magazine, strutted across the floor with his hand held out.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Ellery,\u201d he smiled as he kissed my hand.</p><p>\u201cMiss fabulous wants to go to the artsy supply store, so I say let\u2019s take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, that\u2019s ok, if you\u2019ll just tell me where it is I can go myself.\u201d</p><p>Mason and Landon laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, we\u2019ll take you, someone has to show you around L.A.\u201d</p><p>I got into the back seat of their 2009 Volvo as the boys drove me to the art store. I knew exactly what I needed so I wasn\u2019t in there very long. I picked up an easel, paints, canvases and brushes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so excited to see what you\u2019re going to paint,\u201d Landon said as he carried my easel up the stairs for me. There was a perfect spot in the corner between two windows where it fit perfectly. I was exhausted, and it was already 12am California time, and I was still on New York time. I needed sleep bad; I had an early appointment in the morning that I couldn\u2019t miss. I slid into my new queen size bed and was surprised at how fast I drifted to sleep.</p><p>I opened my eyes and had to remember I wasn\u2019t in New York anymore. I still couldn\u2019t believe I was California. I took a shower and put on a cute little beige sundress and flip-flops. I pulled my hair to a side braid and headed out the door. One of the main reasons I took the apartment was because it was within walking distance of the place I would be visiting frequently.</p><p>When I reached my destination, I stood in front of the infamous Cedars Sinai Grace Hospital. I met with Dr. Danielle Murphy who was the head of the new cancer clinical study involving cancer treatment injections and immunotherapy.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Ellery,\u201d Dr. Murphy said as she motioned for me to sit down. \u201cSo, you were first diagnosed with Leukemia at 16?\u201d She asked as she looked at me. I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou had 24 chemotherapy treatments and went into remission and now at 23 years old the leukemia came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said as I looked down at my hands.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, let me tell you that I\u2019m sorry you did and are going through that again, but I was very pleased when I got your email because I think you are a perfect candidate for our clinical trial.\u201d I sat there listening to her with enthusiasm in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had one chemo treatment and that was almost 2 weeks ago correct?\u201d I shook my head. She closed my file and threw it on the desk.</p><p>\u201cEllery, look at me. You are in the trial and this is how it\u2019s going to work. I am going to send you home with some immunotherapy pills; it\u2019s a cocktail, like chemo, but with less side effects and you are to take them every day you are in this trial. Then you will come here once a month for 3 injections over the span of 3 months. Once you receive your last injection, we will do all the necessary testing to see if you\u2019re cancer free. If the cancer is still there, but you are getting better, then we will continue treatment for another 3 months. I see here in your medical file that you had stem cells removed before you received treatment when you were 16.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at her, \u201cI had forgotten about that.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms and ankles and leaned back on the desk. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you had it done because my recommendation is that you undergo a stem cell transplant once you\u2019re better, to prevent this disease from coming back later in life. Now sit tight while I get your pills and then you\u2019re free to go,\u201d she said as she patted me on the shoulder.</p><p>I pulled out my phone and texted Peyton. \u201cWhat\u2019s the low down on Mr. B?</p><p>\u201cMr. B isn\u2019t talking. He says he hasn\u2019t heard from you, but he\u2019d let me know if he did. Elle, he\u2019s weird, he\u2019s acting normal. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was one piece of my heart that started to heal when he took care of me after my chemo treatment. Now that piece shattered into even more pieces than before. Tears started to sting my eyes as Dr. Murphy came back and handed me a bag full of pills.</p><p>\u201cHere you go Ellery, you are to take these pills first thing in the morning before you eat, and I am scheduling your first round of injections 2 weeks from today.\u201d</p><p>I managed a half-smile as I thanked her and walked out the door. The minute the warm California air hit my skin, the tears started to flow. I barely made it home before my legs started to shake. I made it up to my apartment and fell to the floor, sobbing into my hands. A loud knock startled me.</p><p>\u201cElle, its Mason, open up, I hear you crying.\u201d</p> <p>I turned around, still on the floor, and reached up and opened the door. Mason looked down and met me on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked as he hugged me. My shoulders moved up and down as I tried to talk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Connor gave up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you don\u2019t know that for sure,\u201d he pulled me closer. He sat with me on the floor while I cried. \u201cMaybe he just is giving the two of you some space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Peyton said he\u2019s acting normal. How the f**k can he act normal when I\u2019m a total mess?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuys are different Elle; they don\u2019t wear their heart on their sleeves like women do. Give him some time; I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just as upset but not letting Peyton know it.\u201d I shook my head and got up from the floor.</p><p>\u201cThanks Mason, I appreciate it.\u201d He hugged me tight and left to go back to his apartment.</p><p>I spent the rest of the day painting a vision I had in my mind of a Cape Cod style house that sat surrounded by grass. I envisioned a short stone wall that went around the property, and an archway that led to steps going down to a small private beach with a boat and a lighthouse. I was going to paint two versions, one day and one night. I had nothing but time on my hands and painting was my escape from this reality, into another with peace and tranquility.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>I took my 15 pills every morning and every night my body shook for an hour straight. So far, that was the only side effect I had and after what chemo did to me, that was a piece of cake. I occupied the last couple of weeks by absorbing myself into my artwork and spending time with Mason and Landon. They quickly became my best friends in California. Even though I tried to keep myself busy, I thought about Connor every day and night. Peyton kept me updated and nothing had changed; he wasn\u2019t doing anything to find me.</p><p>The loneliness I felt was beyond anything I ever experienced before. When we were apart in New York, I had the comfort of knowing he was in the same city and that we would eventually run into each other; but he\u2019s not here in California and the loneliness factor is ten times worse. I checked my email every day hoping he would send me one, but he didn\u2019t and I didn\u2019t because it was obvious he was over me. I would pull his picture up online and put my wrist over my heart. Sometimes just seeing a picture of him eased the pain, but most of the time it made it worse.</p> <p>In two days I get my first set of injections. I was nervous not knowing what effects it will have on me, so I decided to take the morning and run to the store. I needed to stock up on some things in case I couldn\u2019t leave the apartment. I put on my khaki shorts, a black tank top and a pair of black strappy sandals I picked up on sale when I first moved here. I stopped by Mason and Landon\u2019s apartment to ask if they needed me to pick up anything; they graciously said no but appreciated the thought. I walked down the street and around the corner to Trader Joes and picked up some things to stock my refrigerator. I took in the warmth of the California sun as I headed back to the apartment.</p><p>I reached down in my bag and pulled out the Twix bar I desperately craved. I looked up as I almost reached the building and came to a standstill when I saw him leaning against the side of a black convertible Porsche. He looked at me and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman to find Miss Lane.\u201d</p><p>It felt like life was breathed into me again as my heart started racing. I let my bags fall to the ground and ran to him as fast as I could. He was no longer leaning against the car when I jumped up and wrapped my legs and arms around him. He caught me by wrapping his arms around me and holding me tight.</p><p>\u201cOh baby, I\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI missed you and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh...no apologies, the only thing that matters is that I found you and your safe.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head up, cupped his face in my hands and kissed him passionately. Our tongues met with excitement and exhilaration as our long-lost kiss left us breathless. Tears started running down my face as he put me down and softly wiped my cheeks with his thumb.</p> <p>\u201cLet me look at you?\u201d he said as he spun me around. He grabbed me and held me tight. \u201cYou look just as beautiful as when you left.\u201d</p><p>Mason and Landon emerged from their apartment clapping. I turned my head and smiled, \u201cGuys this is...\u201d</p><p>Mason held up his hand, \u201cWe already met this gorgeous man Elle.\u201d I looked at them and then at Connor.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hot sexy boy toy came to the rental office and wanted to know if you were renting an apartment here and we said YES! We told him you ran to the store but you\u2019d be right back.\u201d</p><p>Connor kissed the top of my head, \u201cYou have some great friends here.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him again as Mason and Landon walked over and picked up the bags I dropped on the cement. Connor put his arm around me as we walked up to the building.</p><p>\u201cSee, no private entrance,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re learning,\u201d he lightly laughed.</p><p>I took him up to my apartment. Mason and Landon stepped inside, put the bags on the counter and quickly left as Landon gave me a wink. Connor turned and ran his finger along my jaw line and over my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of explaining to do, but first I\u2019m going to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>I gasped as my body quivered. He lightly brushed his lips against mine as his tongue trailed down my neck. \u201cYou taste so good, it\u2019s been too long Ellery; I need you. I need to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>His words sounded desperate as was my body begging him to take me. He picked me up and carried me to the bedroom, his lips never leaving mine. He set me down in front of the bed and lifted my shirt over my head, tossing it to the side. His hands ran up and down my sides and over my h*ps as he let out a light moan. He unhooked my bra as it fell to the floor. His hands were cupping my br**sts and fingering my n**ples as his tongue explored my navel. He found his way up to my br**sts, lightly biting my nipple while removing my shorts. My body was on fire and the ache I felt for him was an ache much stronger than before. He didn\u2019t even need to touch me; my body was in a constant state of ache whenever he was near me.</p><p>I brought his face to mine and kissed him letting him know how much I needed and wanted him. He groaned as my hands took off his shirt and my nails lightly dug into his back. He broke from me as he kicked off his shoes and took down his pants. I stared at his masculine body as the fire in my body raged. He put his arms around me as he gently laid me on the bed hovering over me and staring into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel alive, like no one ever has.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hands through his perfectly tousled hair and brought him in for a kiss. His hands traveled from my br**sts down to the edge of my panties. He pressed his erection into me as I arched my back begging for more. He slid his hand down to the front of my panties and moaned, \u201cEllery, you\u2019re so wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what you do to me Connor, feel every bit of it.\u201d</p><p>He slid his fingers inside me and gently worked them around as his thumb circled around me, arousing me more than I already was. The ache was getting unbearable.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come now Ellery, while my fingers are inside of you, pleasuring you.\u201d His words sent me into oblivion as I screamed out from the amazing orgasm this man gave me. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>With him still hovering over me and his tongue circling my nipple, I reached down and grabbed his erection, gently stroking it and feeling the wetness as I lightly moved my thumb over the tip. He groaned, \u201cOh god Ellery.\u201d</p><p>His lips moved to mine as I pushed him off me and got on top. He smiled and bit his bottom lip. I wanted to take control of him; I wanted to pleasure him as much as he did me. I straddled him as I took him inside me, gently moving up and down. His hands traveled over my br**sts as he took my n**ples between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful, especially when I see you like this,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>I was swelling as I moved back and forth preparing for my next release. My hands were planted firmly on his chest as his were planted on my hips, moving me up and down.</p><p>\u201cLook at me Ellery; I need to see you come.\u201d</p><p>I looked directly in his eyes as our breathing was heavy and I moved up and down, back and forth, faster and faster. His moans grew louder as his eyes never left mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come yet baby, I want us to come together,\u201d he panted.</p><p>He flexed his h*ps under me so he was deeper inside, I didn\u2019t think it was possible but he was. He moved up and down with me as our bodies became one.</p><p>\u201cScream for me baby, I want to hear what I do to you.\u201d</p><p>That sent me over the top as I couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and neither could he; one final thrust as we both came together never taking our eyes off one another.</p><p>I collapsed onto his chest and buried my head into his neck. I laid there as he rubbed his hands up and down my back and I lightly kissed his neck, taking in his incredible scent. Our heart rates slowed as did our breathing. He rolled me off of him and onto my side as he faced me, pushing my hair back behind my ear not saying a word. He didn\u2019t need to say anything; I knew exactly what he was feeling just by his stare and his touch. I never wanted to leave this position; I wanted to stay like this forever.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he said. I took his hand and brought it up to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about how happy I am you found me.\u201d He smiled in the way that made me ache for him.</p><p>\u201cI told you I would find you, remember I\u2019m a stalker.\u201d I laughed and ran my fingers up and down his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou can stalk me any day Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and pulled me closer so my head was resting on his chest.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He kissed me on the top of my head, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything and you\u2019ll tell me everything while we go grab something to eat, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head and frowned at him, \u201cYou mean we have to leave this bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes darling, but trust me, we\u2019ll be back in it soon enough.\u201d</p><p>I reached up and kissed him on the lips and we got out of bed. We redressed ourselves and headed to the main room of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cThis apartment is really nice, better than the one in New York.\u201d I hit him on the arm as I walked past.</p><p>\u201cHey, I like my little box in New York.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and walked to the kitchen. He stopped as he stared at the 15 bottles of pills all lined up in a row on the counter. He picked up one of the bottles and starting reading the label. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCare to explain what these are?\u201d He asked as he gave me a pained look. I took his hands and led him over to the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a trial study, that\u2019s why I came out here.\u201d He started to interrupt as I put my finger over his mouth, \u201cLet me finish.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he took my finger in his mouth and sucked on it. I giggled and removed it as I continued, \u201cI have to take these pills every day. Once a month I go to the hospital and get a set of 3 injections, it\u2019s called some type of Immunotherapy. I have to do this for a period of 3 months. Once I complete the 3 months, the doctor will test my blood to see if the cancer is gone; if not then I will continue for another 3 months. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s going to work,\u201d I said as I looked down.</p><p>He lifted my chin so I was looking at him, \u201cIt will work; It has to work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a trial Connor; it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s being done on humans so right now I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re strong Elle, you\u2019re the strongest and most stubborn person I have ever met in my life and if anybody can pull through this it\u2019s you, but you have to stop running away from me.\u201d I took his hand that was stroking my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI know; I\u2019m just so scared.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hands and turned them over as he looked at my tattoos and lightly kissed each on. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, I\u2019m here and I\u2019m going to help you through this. Even if this trial doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t matter because I will fly you around the world and find you the treatment that will work because,\u201d he took in a deep breath, \u201cI love you Ellery Lane and I will protect you.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down my face as I heard the words that he never spoke to anyone before. I hugged him as tight as I could and whispered into his ear, \u201cI love you to.\u201d His fingers wrapped around the bottom of my shirt as he gently lifted it off me. My heart started racing as he leaned me back on the couch and we made love.</p> <p>Chapter 32</p><p>Connor emerged from the bathroom as I was putting my shoes on. \u201cNice touch by the way.\u201d I spun around and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cNice touch?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, throwing your phone in the trash at the airport in Michigan.\u201d</p><p>I crinkled my nose, \u201cYeah I knew you would trace it so I had to get rid of it. By the way, how did you find me and why did it take you so long?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, \u201cDo you want the truth or do you want me to tell you what YOU want to hear?\u201d</p> <p>I looked at him from across the room and cocked my head, \u201cHuh? I want the truth.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, \u201cOk, but you need to promise me you won\u2019t get mad at me,\u201d he said as he walked towards me but kept a distance.</p><p>I bit my bottom lip and narrowed my eyes, \u201cOk, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually found you in less than a week.\u201d He could see the anger brewing as I clenched my jaw and moved it back and forth.</p><p>\u201cHey, you promised.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to remember Ellery, with the kind of money I have, I can do and find out just about anything. I will hand it to you though, I loved the way you paid off the girl at the ticket counter to put your ticket under a different name, but unfortunately she liked my money more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, you sneak.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, \u201cShall I continue?\u201d I shook my head and crossed my arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get mad at me for what I\u2019m about to tell you,\u201d he nervously said as he ran his hands through his hair. \u201cI had my tech guy hack into your computer through your IP address.\u201d</p><p>My breathing became heavy as my eyes widened in disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s when I saw you were looking up a Doctor Murphy, so I did some research and that\u2019s what led me here.\u201d</p><p>I clenched my fists and walked towards him, he put his hands up in front of him, \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t get mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before I knew you hacked into my computer you stalker.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my wrists as I approached him and held me back, \u201cI really don\u2019t want you slapping me again that really hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you don\u2019t have to worry about me slapping you; I\u2019m going to punch you instead.\u201d He laughed and kissed my fists and wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cTell me one more thing,\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew in less than a week I was here, why did you wait so long to come?\u201d The pain in my voice was apparent and he knew it as he sighed and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to be found so quickly and I was giving you time; did you really think I would let you spend your birthday alone?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and smiled as I buried my head in his chest. Tomorrow was my 24th birthday.</p><p>We walked hand in hand to the beach as he spread out the blanket over the warm sand and I set the basket on it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we could have just gone to a restaurant?\u201d</p><p>I smacked his arm, \u201cI love the beach and nothing is more romantic than having a picnic here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he put his arm around me, \u201cSex on the beach is just as romantic; can we do that to?\u201d</p><p>My skin ignited when he said that as that familiar ache appeared, \u201cLook around the area my dear; there are children around.\u201d He laughed and opened up the picnic basket, took out a strawberry and seductively fed it to me. I moaned as I bit into it.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep doing that it\u2019s not going to matter if there\u2019s people around here, I\u2019m going to take you right here and now,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I smiled and bit my lip, \u201cDown boy, there\u2019s plenty of time for that.\u201d</p><p>We ate, talked and enjoyed the warmth of the sun. I leaned over to kiss Connor when a little girl, about 5 years old, came and tapped me on the shoulder, \u201cI can\u2019t find my mommy,\u201d she whined.</p><p>\u201cWhat does your mommy look like?\u201d I asked her. She rubbed her eyes with her small hands. \u201cHer hair is like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that certainly narrows it down,\u201d Connor said. I shot him a look and he shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCome on sweetie, let\u2019s see if we can find her but first what is your name?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and closed one eye, \u201cChloe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Chloe, I\u2019m Ellery and this is my friend Connor,\u201d I said as I shook her little hand. Connor looked at me and then at her small hand that extended out to him.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Chloe,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>The way he shook her hand made me melt inside, so gentle and pure. I got up and took her by the hand and motioned for Connor to do the same. He got up and took her other hand as we walked her up and down the beach. I heard a woman yell Chloe\u2019s name. Connor and I turned around as the small woman with blonde wavy hair came running up to her and hugging her tight.</p><p>\u201cChloe, you scared me.\u201d</p><p>She stood up and looked at me and Connor, \u201cThank you so much for taking care of her.\u201d</p><p>I was surprised when Connor spoke out. \u201cNo problem, but you need to keep a closer eye on her.\u201d She shot him a look and took Chloe by the hand and walked away.</p><p>\u201cConnor, that wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cLook at her, she looks all of what 19 or 20? She shouldn\u2019t even have a kid; she\u2019s still a kid herself.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure where that came from, but I had a suspicion it had something to do with his sister. We walked back to the blanket; he spread his legs and pulled me in between them as my back laid into his firm chest.</p><p>\u201cThe very last memory I have of my mom was at the beach. I think that\u2019s why I love it so much; I feel closer to her when I\u2019m here,\u201d I softly said as I stared out into the blue ocean.</p><p>Connor tightened his grip around me and kissed the top of my head, \u201cTell me about your memory.\u201d I lifted my head back as he leaned down and kissed my lips.</p><p>\u201cIt was our last vacation before she died. My dad took us to the beach because she wanted to see the sunset over the water. I remember her sitting in a lounge chair with a big floppy straw hat on and big white sunglasses. I was building a sandcastle and just as the sun was starting to set she called me over to her and had me sit on her lap. She pointed to the sunset and said, \u201cSee that Ellery, there is nothing more beautiful than the sun setting over the ocean water. I want you to remember something for me, if you ever feel sad or lonely or need to talk to me, come here and wait for the sun to set and I\u2019ll be here with you.\u201d</p><p>Connor lifted me up and turned me around so I was facing him. He stroked my face with the back of one hand while the other was around my waist. \u201cMemories are our way of holding onto the things we love, and I plan on making the most beautiful memories with you.\u201d</p><p>I stared into his enchanting eyes as I leaned over and softly kissed his moist lips. I could feel him harden beneath my thighs. \u201cI love you Connor Black,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He hardened our kiss as he ran his hands through my hair. \u201cI love you to.\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and took his hand, pulling him behind me. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked as he adjusted himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d I said.</p><p>I took him to a lighthouse I noticed earlier in the day at the end of the beach. I prayed the door would be unlocked as I turned the handle and it opened. I turned to Connor and smiled.</p><p>\u201cEllery, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I shut the door and pulled him by his shirt into me, kissing him passionately.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted beach sex. Well, this is the best I can give you right now. We\u2019ll call it sex in a lighthouse on the beach.\u201d</p><p>He growled and then his face lit up. \u201cYou kinky girl,\u201d he said as he pushed me up against the wall.</p><p>His hands moved up my shirt and to my br**sts as his tongue explored my neck. I unbuttoned his pants and took him in my hand. He moaned as I ran my hand up and down the length of him. He easily took down my shorts and panties and slid his fingers inside me to make sure I was ready for him. He wasted no time as he grabbed himself and entered me, not gently, but rough and with such force it made me scream. He moved in and out of me what seemed like at the speed of light as he savagely kissed me. He grabbed my wrists and pinned them above my head with one hand as he took the other hand and pulled my leg up to his waist. His roughness was something I never experienced before and it made me wonder if this is what sex was to him with other women. My body shot up in flames as he brought me to the point of no return. I moaned his name as he commanded.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me to f**k you; I want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>I obliged by telling him what he wanted to hear. He gave one last hard thrust as we both moaned and came together. He buried his head in my neck as he let go of my wrists and I held him tight. As our breathing slowed, he lifted his head and brought it to mine.</p><p>\u201cYou never cease to amaze me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here and go home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>Home; referring to us going home is bittersweet. Connor walked over to the easel and looked intrigued by my painting.</p><p>\u201cI have to say Ellery, you are a very talented artist; this painting is stunning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked over and slipped my hands in his back pockets and put my chin on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThank you. This is my glimpse of a future; it looks so peaceful there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very beautiful, I suggest you keep it and don\u2019t sell it,\u201d he said.</p><p>I kissed him on the cheek, \u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p> <p>I paused for a moment as I looked into the depth of my painting, \u201cI was going to tell you, ya know.\u201d</p><p>He reached for my hands and brought my arms around his waist, \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>I took in a sharp breath, \u201cAbout coming here and seeing Dr. Murphy. I wanted to talk to you about it that day but you were so angry; I heard you on the phone, in your office, with Ashlyn.\u201d</p><p>He looked down, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I never should have said those things to you, I was...\u201d He couldn\u2019t find the words he needed to say, so I interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell me about her Connor, we can never move forward if you don\u2019t and I think I have a right to know.\u201d</p> <p>He turned around so he was facing me and pressed his forehead against mine, \u201cI know and I will just not tonight baby.\u201d</p><p>I was starting to wonder if he was ever going to tell me because if not, I would have to find out for myself and that was something I didn\u2019t want to have to do. I sighed as we headed to the bedroom.</p><p>I awoke to the sensation of my neck being covered in small light kisses. I smiled as I rolled over to view the sexy man who was sending shivers throughout my body.</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday baby,\u201d he smiled as he lightly kissed my lips.</p><p>I interlaced our fingers and nestled into his chest, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>It amazed me how fast things changed. I was dreading this day not too long ago for the fear of celebrating alone. Not that I would celebrate because it was just 8 short years ago that I was diagnosed with cancer the first time and here I am facing it again, but Connor being here made things better; he made me feel safe and happy.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he said as he swiftly got off the bed. I bit my lower lip anxiously waiting for his return.</p><p>Wearing only dark gray pajama bottoms he strutted into the bedroom holding a tray. I could do nothing short of holding my breath as I looked at his perfectly chiseled chest and his exposed h*ps as his bottoms hung so perfectly below them. Connor Black knew he was a sexy man and he didn\u2019t have any trouble letting me know. He sat the tray across my legs and sat down next to me. With a grin that went from ear to ear, I looked down at the scrambled eggs, bagel, fruit and bacon that sat before me.</p><p>\u201cHow, when, where?\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he took my fork and stabbed the eggs, \u201cSince you didn\u2019t have anything besides eggs, I headed down the street to the caf\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he opened his hand and handed me my daily dose of 15 pills; needless to say I rolled my eyes. He picked up the fork and brought it to my mouth as I graciously removed the eggs from it.</p><p>\u201cYou are amazing,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I grabbed the fork from his hand and shared my eggs and bacon with him. A happiness grew inside me I never thought could exist. I was too happy and it scared me; it scared me to death because all I kept thinking was nothing lasts forever and I never wanted this feeling to end.</p><p>\u201cPresent time,\u201d he smiled as he reached one arm under the bed. He pulled out 3 beautifully wrapped boxes and then removed the tray from my lap.</p> <p>\u201cI love presents,\u201d I squealed.</p><p>The expression on his face was of pure bliss. He was just as happy in this moment as I was. He handed me the first box and I carefully unwrapped it. My mouth dropped as I pulled a new iPhone out of the box.</p><p>\u201cYour phone number is the same as your old phone; you know the one you threw away?\u201d he smirked. \u201cWho just throws away their phone?\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>I playfully smacked him on his arm, \u201cI\u2019m crazy remember?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed me on the head. I turned the phone on and instantly there were text messages from all my friends wishing me a happy birthday.</p><p>A text from Peyton read, \u201cHappy birthday bitch, nah, you know I love you, call me soon, we have a lot to catch up on.\u201d By the way have lots of birthday sex you deserve it.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and laughed. Connor knew how Peyton was so he didn\u2019t even ask what she said, he could just tell by my reaction.</p><p>He took the phone from my hand and set it on the bed while he handed me the next box. I smiled as I bit my bottom lip anxiously unwrapping, excited like a child on Christmas morning, the perfect silver square box. I removed the top and inside sat a stunning silver bracelet with the infinity symbol encased in diamonds. I gasped as I ran my finger along the diamonds.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I...I love it. This is the most beautiful gift anyone has ever given me.\u201d</p><p>He took the box from my hand and took out the bracelet. He unclasped it and put it on my wrist. \u201cI love you, not only for who you are, but for the person I have become because of you. This is my forever to you.\u201d</p><p>The uncontrollable tears that seemed to plague my face recently started their trail down my cheeks, but were quickly stopped by Connors response.</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t, there will be no tears on your birthday, whether they\u2019re good tears or not; I forbid it, do you understand Miss Lane?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but break into laughter at his commanding voice.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around him as tight as I could and met his mouth with mine. He responded, but quickly broke our kiss, \u201cYou still have one more present to open.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I leaned back on my pillow. \u201cYou spoil me.\u201d</p><p>He handed me the long box as he smiled. I took the box and with the same finesse, I un-wrapped it like the others. I took off the top and stared at the voucher inside. I looked at Connor as my eyes started to swell.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it, no tears.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it this time, my emotions were too far fallen for inside the box were 2 tickets to Paris. As he looked at me, he gently wiped the tears from under my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know your dream is to go to Paris, I saw it on that list you hid in your desk and as soon as the doctor says it\u2019s ok, we will be on the first flight there for however long you want to stay.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe he remembered what was on my bucket list from that brief minute he looked at it. I was overwhelmed at the love I was receiving from this man who not too long ago couldn\u2019t bring himself to love anyone. I straddled him and cupped his face in my hands.</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything, I love you Connor Black,\u201d I said as I kissed him and showed him for the next two hours how grateful I was.</p><p>The day was perfect. All days were perfect when I spent them with Connor. It didn\u2019t matter if we were held up in a cave in the middle of nowhere, it would still be perfect. Mason and Landon were taking us to a swank bar in downtown Los Angeles for my birthday. They had it planned before we knew Connor would be here, but he was game and said it sounded like fun.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>We entered the bar as Mason pulled us through the crowd of people to a booth in the back. The side we sat on was the one with the stage and a piano; it\u2019s the stage where the local bands perform. But there was no band playing tonight; it was a free for all for any patron who wanted to show off their talent on stage.</p><p>We sat in the round booth, Connor on one side of me and Landon on the other. A redheaded waitress, dressed in tiny black skirt that barely covered her ass and a tank top that was exposing her entire br**sts, came over to our table to take our drink orders. Landon and Mason ordered a couple of martinis each and Connor ordered a scotch. I could tell Connor was uncomfortable because she was eyeing him up and down instead of taking my order, and he was afraid of another comment like the one at the seafood restaurant. He looked at me and could see me gearing up to say something, so he stepped in and put his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend will have a glass of white wine,\u201d he smiled at her. She looked me up and down.</p><p>\u201cOh, I thought she was with one of them.\u201d</p><p>I shifted in my seat as Landon pulled me in closer to him. \u201cSweetheart, she\u2019s with all three of us and you should see the things she can do to us at the same time, OMG, it\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a dirty look and walked away as the three of us did a high-five in the air and Connor sat there shaking his head. I leaned over and snuggled into him, taking in his scent that already was making me ache.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous sweetheart; you know I love you more.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he took his hand that was resting on his lap, placed it on my bare thigh and slowly moved it up my skirt, stopping as soon as his fingers reached the lace on my panties. My body shook and shivered as he grinned. The waitress brought our drinks and never took her eyes off me as she set them down on the table.</p><p>Mason leaned over, \u201cI think she likes you.\u201d I laughed and took a sip of my wine.</p><p>\u201cJust stick to one glass tonight. I don\u2019t think you should be drinking while taking that medication plus you have your injections in the morning,\u201d Connor said as he moved his fingers passed the lace and was now touching bare skin. I jumped at his touch.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your concern. I will take that under advisement,\u201d I said with gritted teeth.</p><p>Mason and Landon excused themselves as they saw a couple of friends across the bar. Connor smiled as they walked by, then took my chin in his hand and turned it toward him. \u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d he asked seductively. My breathing started to increase as he lightly rubbed the area that was now pulsating for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to make me do? Come right here in the bar in front of everyone?\u201d I asked almost breathless.</p><p>He gave me that seductive smile and twisted my h*ps so I was sitting sideways facing him in the booth.</p><p>\u201cThat was my plan, but you have to act like nothing is happening.\u201d</p><p>He gently inserted his finger as I bit by bottom lip. I looked around the bar to see if anyone was paying attention, but everyone was drinking, dancing and carrying on conversations. My skin ignited and my heart raced as he inserted another finger and began rubbing my aching spot with his thumb. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d I said as I buried my head into his neck.</p><p>I wrapped my arm around him to make it look like I was hugging him as he moved his fingers in and out. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d I asked as he was starting to bring me to orgasm.</p><p>He brought his lips to my ear, \u201cBecause I like pleasuring you and I know you want it. You\u2019re so wet Ellery.\u201d</p><p>My body was preparing enter oblivion and he knew it; he could feel it. \u201cRemember you need to be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Easy for him to say; he\u2019s not the one getting off in a public place, and it\u2019s not so easy to keep quiet when Connor Black is bringing you to the edge of an orgasm. I tightened my hand around the back of his neck, digging my fingers into his delicate skin, my mouth was on his neck lightly nipping at it with my teeth; he started to groan. Game on, it was payback time.</p><p>My body reached the point of no return as I squeezed my eyes shut and buried my mouth deep into his neck and released over his fingers. I nipped on his ear lope which sent him over the edge. As soon as he was sure my orgasm was over he grabbed my hand and slid out of the seat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Where are we going?\u201d I laughed as my legs were shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>He led me down a narrow hallway and opened a door that led to a closet. He led me inside and then closed the door. The room was dark and the only light that I could see was the light coming from underneath the door. He lifted up my skirt and pulled down my panties. I reached for his pants as he already had them half way down. My back was pushed against the door as he went down and joyfully licked my aching area. I ran my hands through his hair as he kept going around with his tongue, licking and sucking, making it unbearable to control myself. He stopped and inserted himself inside me as he positioned his hands on each side of me against the door and quickly moved in and out of me till he released and filled my insides full of his come.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday baby,\u201d he panted in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou have control issues,\u201d I whispered as I caught my breath. I heard him chuckle.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who took me into the lighthouse, now I\u2019m returning the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a closet Connor?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cHey anywhere we can get it right?\u201d</p><p>I carefully opened the door as he looked out to make sure no one was coming. We left the closet and casually walked down the hallway as if nothing happened. We walked back to the table where Mason and Landon were seated.</p><p>They looked at us as Landon started to speak, \u201cWhere did you guys\u201d and then was interrupted by Mason yelling, \u201cOMG, they have sex hair, they just had sex somewhere.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything, but the smile on both mine and Connors face answered their question.</p> <p>Mason and Landon asked if we were ready to leave because they had a birthday cake waiting at home for me. I smiled as Connor motioned for the waitress to stop over and give him the bill. I excused myself to the bathroom to fix my hair and makeup. I was walking back to the table and noticed the waitress was there bending over with her cl**vage in Connors face. I could see his eyes fixated me and the panic in them as he was wondering what I was thinking. I walked up to the table and tapped the waitress on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, what the f**k do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>She turned around and looked at me. \u201cListen bitch, if you\u2019re doing all three of them then there\u2019s no harm in letting me have a taste of this juicy one,\u201d she smiled at Connor.</p><p>The look on his face was sheer panic as he wouldn\u2019t take his eyes off me. \u201cWho are you calling a bitch?\u201d I yelled at her.</p><p>Connor stepped out of the booth and put his arm around me. \u201cLet\u2019s go Elle.\u201d He quickly led me out of the bar as Mason and Landon were laughing. \u201cOh my god Elle, have you retracted your claws yet?\u201d Mason laughed.</p><p>Connor kissed me on the side of my head, \u201cI can\u2019t take you anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>I looked sternly at him, \u201cIt\u2019s not me; it\u2019s you and these damn women you attract.\u201d He laughed as he picked me up and carried me to the car.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>Connor</p><p>Celebrating her birthday with her was the best day of my life, except for the day I found her standing in my kitchen. I walked into the room with a 12 inch round cake, beautifully lit up with 24 burning candles. I set it in front of her and watched her smile as she closed her eyes, made a wish and blew them out. The sweetness and the innocence of her swept me off my feet and left me with a feeling I never knew I was capable of. Her smile, her laughter and the way she played with her hair when she was nervous, were some of the things I loved most about her.</p><p>I handed her the knife to cut the first piece of cake as she took it from my hand with her delicate fingers. I stood there and stared at her as she cut each piece with finesse. She looked at me with her ice blue eye; eyes that were mesmerizing and full of life.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>A smile fell upon my face as I answered, \u201cHow much I love you.\u201d The words I was never able to say before now flowed freely from my lips as easy as loving her did. She leaned over and put a dab of icing on the tip of my nose and laughed. She wiped it off and held her finger to my mouth as I took it inside and licked it slowly. I saw the fire in her eyes like I do every time she looks at me.</p><p>I can\u2019t extinguish the fear that resides in my heart with her illness. I don\u2019t want to believe that she won\u2019t get better, but there\u2019s a tiny part of me that is scared shitless that she won\u2019t. I put on a brave front for her because she needs me. She needs me to be her rock and I can\u2019t and won\u2019t let her down.</p> <p>I lay there in bed, checking my emails while waiting for her to come out of the bathroom. She opens the door and walks into the bedroom while brushing her teeth, frantically looking for something. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong baby?\u201d I asked. She mumbled something; I couldn\u2019t understand her between the toothbrush and the foam. She held up her free hand against her ear.</p><p>\u201cYour phone?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. I smiled as I pulled it from between the sheets. She smiled at me and gave me thumbs up as she went back into the bathroom and spit in the sink.</p><p>\u201cThanks baby,\u201d she yelled. She walked towards the bed and looked at her phone checking her messages before she pulled back the covers and climbed in. She snuggled into my chest as I put my arm around her. This was right, too right, as she softly kissed my chest and slowly drifted to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>I chewed my bottom lip as we walked through the doors of Sinai Grace Hospital. I tightened the grip on Connors hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be ok Elle, I\u2019m here with you,\u201d he sympathetically said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m just a little nervous,\u201d I pouted.</p><p>He put his arm around me and pulled me into him giving me the only safety I\u2019ve known. We stepped into the waiting room of Dr. Murphy\u2019s office as the leggy blonde receptionist told us to take a seat. Not too long after, the leggy blonde called my name and took us back to a small room. She handed me gown and told me to change into it as she was eyeing my boyfriend up and down, giving him suggestive looks. He turned away so not to face her while looking down at my hands wondering if I\u2019m going to get up and bitch slap her. She saw the look on my face and exited the room quickly.</p><p>Dr. Murphy walked in with 3 large needles on a silver tray. \u201cGood morning Ellery, are you ready for your first set of injections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess as much as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d I nervously answered.</p><p>She was flipping through my chart and then looked at me with concerning eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you\u2019re feeling right now, at this moment.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at her, \u201cI\u2019m scared and unsure, that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling.\u201d</p><p>She took ahold of my hand, \u201cI know you\u2019re scared, but this will be a walk in the park compared to chemotherapy, I promise. The others who have recently received these injections have not had any side effects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great Dr. Murphy, but you don\u2019t even know if the injections are working.\u201d She pursed her lips together as Connor walked over and put his hands on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confident it\u2019s going to work; have faith Ellery.\u201d I managed a small smile as she asked me to lie down on the bed. She looked over to Connor.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to need you; I would suggest holding her hands.\u201d I looked at Dr. Murphy alarmed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She heavily sighed. \u201cEllery, I\u2019m not going to lie to you, these injections are very painful; you are going to feel like someone lit your body on fire, but it\u2019s only temporary and we need to keep you here under observation for a couple of hours to make sure there aren\u2019t side effects.\u201d</p><p>Connor sat on the side of the bed as I turned on my side to face him. Dr. Murphy called her nurse in and held up the first needle. Connor grabbed my hands as he stared directly in my eyes. \u201cJust look at me baby and focus on nothing but me, ok?\u201d I shook my head as Dr. Murphy inserted the first needle. I shrieked at its sting, as tears swelled in my eyes. It didn\u2019t take long for the fiery pain to start blazing through my body.</p><p>\u201cOk Ellery, I\u2019m going to give injection number 2,\u201d Dr. Murphy said as she pierced my skin with the needle.</p><p>I let out a louder cry this time for the burning intensified. I let go of Connor and clutched his shirt with both hands as he moved in closer and wrapped his arms around me. I screamed in his chest as the last needle entered my body.</p><p>\u201cDr. Murphy, please, isn\u2019t there anything you can do for her?\u201d Connor desperately asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Black, we have to let it run its course and it\u2019s only temporary. I\u2019ll be back in an hour to see how she\u2019s doing; if you need anything or she\u2019s having a reaction, you are to push this button immediately.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as she walked out of the room. My body felt like it was engulfed in flames and my soul was trying to escape.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Connor kept saying as he held me and I shook in his arms. At that point I didn\u2019t know which was worse, this or Chemotherapy.</p><p>A couple of days had passed and we mostly stayed in. We cooked together, had lots of sex and watched movies. When Connor had to do work, I would sit in front of my easel and paint. I smiled at Connor who was sitting at the table on his laptop conducting business meetings with his employees. I was happy and it felt right. For the first time in a long time, I had hope that I would have a future and this man would be a part of it.</p><p>The next morning, I didn\u2019t feel like getting out of bed, so I laid there and I tried to sleep, but I could hear Connor talking to someone on the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes mom, I\u2019m coming and I\u2019m bringing someone with me; she\u2019s very special and I want you to meet her.\u201d</p><p>It was then I realized that next week was Thanksgiving. Connor came walking into the room as I opened my eyes and saw him staring at me. He smiled as he walked over and sat on the edge of the bed, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked as his finger ran down my jaw line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling ok. I heard you on the phone.\u201d</p><p>I was talking to my mother. I\u2019m taking you home for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>As much as I wanted to meet his family I was a hot mess of a cancer patient and I didn\u2019t know how they would react to that.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your mom about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did, and she\u2019s going to love you.\u201d</p><p>I licked the bottom of my dry lip, \u201cI mean did you tell her I have cancer?\u201d</p><p>He sat there and looked at me and I could see the pain in his eyes which told me he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her Connor?\u201d</p><p>His eyes traveled to the window, \u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance and it\u2019s not something I want to do over the phone Elle, I think that needs to be done in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is that you want me to spring it on her on Thanksgiving. Hi Black family, I\u2019m Ellery Lane, your son\u2019s girlfriend who has cancer for the second time in her 24 years of life and is nothing but a walking cancer disaster.\u201d</p><p>He got up from the bed. \u201cWow Elle, you really know how to ruin a moment.\u201d</p><p>I felt an argument coming on, but I didn\u2019t care, I was angry at him for not telling his mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will tell her before Thanksgiving, end of discussion.\u201d</p><p>His authoritative tone burned my blood. \u201cNo Connor, it\u2019s not the end of the discussion and don\u2019t you dare take that tone with me.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from the window and looked at me, \u201cAre you looking to start an argument?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is tell me why you didn\u2019t tell her yet.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes turned dark as he glared at me. I could see anger in them. \u201cYou want to know why? I haven\u2019t been able to do anything because I\u2019m stuck here taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>Did I just hear this bastard right? Did he just say he\u2019s STUCK here taking care of me? I felt my blood pressure rise as my heart felt like it had been stabbed with a knife. He realized what he said because he turned towards the window again and ran his hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cStuck, you\u2019re not stuck here Connor, I didn\u2019t f**king ask you to come here; I didn\u2019t f**king ask you to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>He turned towards me, \u201cBaby I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>The only thoughts running through my insane mind were that he felt trapped. \u201cGet out of here,\u201d I screamed as I picked up a glass and threw it at him. He ducked and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cFine, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>He turned just like that and walked out as I flinched when I heard the apartment door slam shut. My phone quickly signaled a text message from Mason, \u201cEverything ok? We just saw Connor storm out?\u201d</p><p>My fingers typed frantically, \u201cI\u2019m fine; we\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I dialed Peyton and let out a sigh of relief when she answered, \u201cHi Elle.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even get the words hello out first. \u201cConnor and I got into an argument and he stormed out,\u201d I started to cry.</p><p>She asked what we argued about and I told her the stuck comment he made. I was appalled how quickly she proceeded to yell at me.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I love you Elle, but I\u2019m telling you this for your own good. You need to get your head out of your ass and start thinking about someone else. I know you\u2019re sick and I\u2019m sorry for that, in fact, I hate that I\u2019m not there with you, but you need to step out of your, oh pity me self, and think about what Connor is going through. You think it\u2019s easy for him to watch the woman he\u2019s only loved go through cancer? He needs to vent to you know, you\u2019re not the only one who gets to scream and be pissed off at the world.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak. I was frozen with the reality that Peyton was right.</p><p>\u201cElle, are you still there?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, \u201cYes and thank you, as always you\u2019re right.\u201d I could feel her smile over the phone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome that\u2019s what best friends are for. Now cut that man some slack and think about his feelings.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and climbed out of bed. I walked over to the shattered glass, sat on my knees and started picking up the pieces. How could I not realize Connors feelings? How could I not stop wallowing in my own pity for just a minute and see how hard this was for him? I sat there staring at the pieces of glass as he took my hand.</p><p>\u201cStop, you\u2019re going to cut yourself,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I took in a deep breath and slowly turned my head so I was looking at him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just...\u201d</p> <p>He took my face in his hands, \u201cI know baby and its ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not Connor, I know this is hard for you and I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d His soft lips brushed against mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I didn\u2019t mean what I said; it came out wrong.\u201d</p><p>I melted into his arms as he wrapped them around me.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t, I overreacted.\u201d He kissed the top my head. I looked up at him with pleading eyes and a pouty mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at my lips and lightly nipped them, \u201cI bought you something.\u201d</p><p>He stood and helped me up. He walked to the dresser and handed me a brown bag. I smiled excitedly as I opened the bag and peeked inside. I looked up at him and his big smile as he took my hand and led me to the bed. I dumped the brown bag in the middle and stared at the pile of chocolate that looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cI figured that would make you feel better,\u201d he said with caution.</p><p>\u201cYou are amazing and absolutely perfect, I love you,\u201d I said as I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him on top of me. \u201cI know something else that will make me feel better,\u201d I smiled as he hovered over me.</p><p>He bit his bottom lip. \u201cAre you sure? Are you up for it?\u201d I lifted my head and kissed him passionately, that was the only sign he needed.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>I got out of bed the next morning and stumbled into the kitchen for some already brewed coffee. Connor was sitting on the couch with his cup and typing something into his phone.</p><p>\u201cHey babe, I hope I didn\u2019t wake you?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNope not at all, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, come sit down.\u201d</p><p>My stomach got all panicky, his tone was serious. I sat down next to him and kissed him on his cheek. He smiled and put his phone down on the table.</p><p>\u201cI have to go back to New York today for a meeting regarding the sale of a company I\u2019ve been interested in. I want you to come back with me.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him and twisted my face, \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, you don\u2019t get your next set of injections till next month. We\u2019ll go back today, stay through Thanksgiving and come back before your next treatment.\u201d</p><p>A smile grew across my face, \u201cI\u2019ll get to see Peyton, she\u2019ll be so excited and my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Connor frowned, \u201cYou\u2019re not staying in that box you call an apartment; you\u2019re living with me.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a pouty look, \u201cDo I have to stay in the guest bedroom?\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he touched my cheek, \u201cThere is no way you are staying in the guest bedroom; I want you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>We took his private jet back to New York. I ran to Denny as I saw him leaning up against the black limo. I threw my arms around him.</p><p>\u201cDenny, I\u2019ve missed you, how are you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and twirled me around, \u201cLook at you Elle, you look great.\u201d</p><p>I saw Connor smirking as he put our bags in the trunk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Black let me get those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Denny its ok, she\u2019s been dying to see you, she missed you.\u201d</p><p>Denny looked at me and gave me a hug, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you to, and it\u2019s nice to see your bright smiling face here again.\u201d</p><p>I slid into the back of the limo and Connor followed interlacing our fingers.</p><p>\u201cI called Peyton and told her I was back in town and I needed her help with something for you, so she\u2019s coming by the penthouse around 7 tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her I was here?\u201d</p><p>He tightened the grip on my hand, \u201cNo, I was going to let you surprise her.\u201d</p><p>I rested my head on his shoulder, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>We arrived back at the penthouse around five. Connor took our bags to the bedroom while I went to the kitchen to get some water. I went up the stairs and headed straight to his room. I\u2019ve only been in his room one time and that was when I brought him home from the club. The door was open and I walked in; I gasped at what I saw. Connor turned around and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot you haven\u2019t been in here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes glanced to the right, then above the bed and then to the left side of the room. Each wall was displayed with my paintings from the art gallery.</p><p>\u201cYou bought my paintings?\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up, \u201cPlease tell me you aren\u2019t mad.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the painting that hung over his bed, the one of the man and woman dancing under the stars.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad; I just want to know why.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cLook at them Elle, they\u2019re beautiful. It was my way of being able to be close to you when you weren\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his waist, \u201cThank you, it means a lot.\u201d He let out a sigh as if he was relieved there wasn\u2019t going to be a battle.</p><p>I walked over to his bed and slightly chuckled remembering the night I struggled to get his clothes off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just remembering the night you were passed out on this bed and I was straddled over you taking off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>His sexy smile captivated me as he laid down on the bed and spread out.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you doing that and I want to, so I thought you could reenact it for me.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip as I pulled my shirt over my head and threw it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cUmm, I don\u2019t think you did that.\u201d</p><p>I seductively smiled, \u201cNo I didn\u2019t, but I\u2019m going to make it a little more interesting this time.\u201d I unbuttoned my pants and took them off, throwing them on top of my shirt. I straddled him and slowly unbuttoned his shirt.</p><p>\u201cFuck it, I need you now,\u201d he said. Before I knew it I was lying on my back and he was on top of me.</p><p>I stayed in the kitchen while Connor went to the elevator and greeted Peyton.</p><p>\u201cOk Connor, what is so important that you need my help with?\u201d</p><p>I stepped from the kitchen. \u201cThat would be me!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>Peyton shrieked as she ran to me and we hugged jumping up and down.</p><p>\u201cOh my god Elle! I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>Connor smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll let you two catch up. I\u2019ll be in my office if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>I took Peyton to the kitchen and poured us each a glass of wine. We moved ourselves to the comfort of the couch in the living room.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me what\u2019s going on with you and Henry?\u201d</p><p>She smiled her big Peyton smile and told me they were doing great and she thought he was going to propose at Christmas. We talked for a few hours before Henry called her and asked her when she was coming home. She took my hands and held them in front of her as I noticed her eyes start to tear.</p><p>\u201cYou are my best friend and I hate that you have to fight cancer again. I want you to know that I will always be here for you no matter what. You will beat this Ellery Lane or I will kick your ass, do you understand me?\u201d I hugged her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYes Peyton, I will beat this because you scare me.\u201d She let out a laugh and walked out the door.</p><p>I walked upstairs to find Connor in bed sound asleep. I changed into my nightshirt and climbed into his king size bed. I watched his chest slowly rise and fall with each peaceful breath. I envisioned this being my future. I laid down and snuggled against him. He stirred and put his arm around me bringing me in closer to him. It was the perfect end to the perfect day.</p><p>The week went by rather quickly as I visited the soup kitchen and the art gallery. Connor took me shopping and bought me some new clothes. I insisted on paying for them myself, but he just laughed and told me to stop being silly.</p><p>While Connor was at the office, I would occupy my time painting and hanging out with Peyton. Sal called me to let me know that two of my paintings sold and that I needed to paint more. I asked Connor if he bought them and he just laughed.

I bit my bottom lip as Connor put the Ranger in park. He put his hand on top of mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, my family will love you.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled and took Connors arm as we walked up the steps to the grand house. He opened the front door and we stepped inside. The smell of turkey and stuffing filled the elegantly decorated home. There was laughter coming from the other room as a brown-haired boy peeked around the corner of the wall. He took one look at Connor and ran to him jumping in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHey buddy, how are you?\u201d Connor smiled. The boy hugged him tight. \u201cCamden, this is my special friend Ellery.\u201d Camden looked at me with his blue eyes and just stared.</p><p>Hi Camden,\u201d I smiled and held out my hand. He continued to stare, unsure of me, and then looked back at Connor. He put both hands on Connors cheeks and smiled. My heart melted at that moment, it was obvious this boy loved him.</p><p>It\u2019s ok Camden, you can touch Ellery.\u201d He looked back at me and slowly put his hand in mine as I gently shook it.</p><p>\u201cConnor darling,\u201d a woman emerged from the other room.</p> <p>\u201cMother, this is Ellery.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and took my hands, \u201cYou are just as beautiful as Connor said you were.\u201d</p><p>I blushed, \u201cThank you, it\u2019s nice to meet you Mrs. Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Jenny dear,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>Jenny was a beautiful woman who Connor resembled a great deal. She was tall and thin and with her light brown bob style hair and green eyes, she didn\u2019t look her age, she looked much younger.</p><p>Camden was struggling to be put down as Connor and I walked towards the living room. Everyone in the room stopped talking and turned to stare at us as we walked in. Connor put down Camden as he ran over to a young woman. I felt like I was on display the way everyone was staring at me. The young woman jumped up and gave Connor a big hug, \u201cHappy Thanksgiving brother.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled and kissed her on the cheek, \u201cCassidy, this is Ellery.\u201d</p><p>She turned and hugged me, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and hugged her back. Her smile was big and her green eyes were full of light. She was exactly my height and she wore her black hair short and stylish. Connor took me around the room and introduced me to the rest of his family and friends.</p><p>Cassidy took my hand, \u201cCome on let\u2019s see if mom needs help in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Connor and he nodded for me to go with a big smile on his face that made me miss him already. It surprised me to find Mrs. Black in the kitchen cooking Thanksgiving dinner; usually the rich have their own personal chefs to do that for them.</p><p>\u201cSo Ellery, Connor says you\u2019re an artist,\u201d Jenny said as she basted the turkey.</p><p>\u201cYes, I paint pictures for a small art gallery in New York.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy smiled, \u201cI bought one, but I didn\u2019t know my brother was dating the artist. You paint beautiful pictures Ellery; you are very talented.\u201d</p> <p>I was starting to feel more relaxed as she handed me a glass of red wine. As Jenny pushed the turkey back in the oven, she turned to me.</p><p>\u201cConnor hasn\u2019t really told us anything about you, why don\u2019t you fill us in.\u201d</p><p>Panic started to set in; how could I tell these people, whom I just met less than 30 minutes ago, about my past and present life.</p><p>\u201cYou have to excuse my mother,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIt\u2019s just you\u2019re the first girl Connor has ever brought home and we just want to get to know the woman who finally managed to steal his heart.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I took a sip of wine. Just as I was about to say something, an older woman walked into the kitchen. She was in her late 60\u2019s with black hair and grey streaks running through it. Cassidy ran to her and hugged her tight, \u201cAunt Sadie, you made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did, I couldn\u2019t wait to see my favorite niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your only niece Aunt Sadie,\u201d Cassidy frowned.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re my favorite,\u201d Sadie smiled.</p><p>She turned to me, \u201cNow who might this young pretty woman be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Ellery and she\u2019s Connors girlfriend,\u201d Jenny spoke.</p><p>She smiled and gently hugged me, \u201cNice to meet you dear.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and looked at me with serious eyes, like she was looking into my soul. \u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d she said. My eyes widened and fear started running through my body. What did she mean by that?</p><p>Jenny looked at her sister, \u201cSadie, that\u2019s rude.\u201d Sadie looked at me and grabbed my hands, turning my wrists over and staring at my tattoos.</p><p>\u201cForgive my sister Ellery, she has a bit of a gift and sometimes she can be very bold with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sick Ellery, like do you have a cold or something?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than a cold,\u201d Sadie answered.</p><p>Oh god, here we go and thank you Connor for not telling your family ahead of time and for not telling me that Aunt Sadie has a gift. I took another sip of my wine and looked at them.</p><p>\u201cI have cancer,\u201d I blurted out. Just like that, no hesitation nothing, I just let the words fall out. They stood there and stared at me, I couldn\u2019t have been placed in the most awkward position even if I tried. Sadie finally spoke up to break the tension.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your first bout with it, is it?\u201d Holy mother of pearl, I bet she\u2019s going to bring up my suicide attempt; great first impression.</p><p>I heavily sighed, \u201cNo it isn\u2019t. I was first diagnosed with cancer when I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>At that point Connor decided to make an appearance. He heard what I said as he came from behind and wrapped his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cIt came back recently, but she\u2019s in a trial study program in California so everything is good at the moment. She\u2019s doing fine and she\u2019s going to be fine, so there\u2019s nothing more to discuss.\u201d</p><p>His tone was commanding and everyone knew it. I smiled as I pulled him out of the kitchen and into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHow could you not tell me about Aunt Sadie?\u201d I asked furiously as I hit him in the chest.</p><p>\u201cOuch Elle, that hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s going to hurt Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>A smug smirk blew across his face as he looked at me, \u201cPromise baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh you make me so mad,\u201d I whispered as I turned the opposite way.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I never took much stock in what Aunt Sadie had to say, I always thought she was kind of crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family must think I\u2019m a walking disaster of a human being and probably wondering what the hell you\u2019re doing with me.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me tight, \u201cThey love you, I can tell and it doesn\u2019t matter what they think about our relationship, I love you for all that you are, nothing less, and for the record, I think you\u2019re a beautiful disaster.\u201d</p><p>I laid my head back on his chest and looked up as he leaned down to kiss me. I bit his lip for that beautiful disaster comment.</p><p>\u201cOuch, you really need to save this shit for the bedroom Ellery; you have no idea how much you\u2019re turning me on with all your hitting and biting.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help to laugh and turn around to gently lick his bitten lip.</p><p>Dinner was exceptional and the rest of the day went smooth. Cassidy and I talked about our jobs while Connor sat on the floor and played with Camden. We both stared at them as Camden was teaching Connor how to stack the blocks.</p><p>\u201cI have never seen my brother as happy as he is right now,\u201d she said to me.</p><p>I smiled and looked over at him, \u201cHe\u2019s a very special man.\u201d</p><p>Just then Jenny interrupted, \u201cEllery how did you and my son meet?\u201d</p><p>A smile spread across my face as Connor looked at me with fear in his eyes. I decided to spare him the embarrassment and replied, \u201cWe met at a club.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, \u201cWell, lucky for him you were there.\u201d I smiled back and looked at the relief that washed over his face.</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>I was leaning over the bathroom sink washing my face as Connor was getting undressed. \u201cI loved watching you with Camden today; it was so special and sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well he\u2019s a pretty special kid.\u201d</p><p>I folded the wash cloth and put it on the sink. \u201cIt made me think of some things.\u201d</p><p>We walked out of the bathroom and I opened the drawer to take out my nightshirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d he asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; just how good you are with him and...\u201d</p><p>Instantly he cut me off, \u201cI can\u2019t have children Elle; I took care of that years ago.\u201d</p><p>My back was turned to him and his words shredded their way through my body. I took in a deep breath and continued to undress and get into my night-shirt. The air that surrounded us changed.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to respond to that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I turned around, \u201cOk, why didn\u2019t you tell me that before?\u201d I was feeling a little betrayed that he wouldn\u2019t have told me that sooner in our relationship. Maybe he thought it wasn\u2019t necessary to because I was going to die anyway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know it just didn\u2019t seem to ever be appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Then it came, the words only my mouth would say, \u201cWas it because you thought I was going to die and it didn\u2019t matter if I never knew?\u201d</p><p>The look on his face broke and anguish washed over him, \u201cHow could you say that?\u201d</p><p>I turned to face the window, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean it, and anyway, I don\u2019t want kids; with my f**ked up family genes the kid wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to me and put his arms around me and pulled me into him. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. My mother dying of cancer, father an alcoholic, me having cancer twice; think about it Connor, the child would be doomed the minute it was conceived.\u201d It killed me to say those words, but it was the truth and I was being honest with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong and I don\u2019t want you talking like that ever again.\u201d</p><p>I loosened myself from his grip, \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway because neither of us wants kids, so end of discussion.\u201d I walked across the room over to the dresser and grabbed the lotion bottle.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you that I can\u2019t have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, like I said, it\u2019s for the best anyway.\u201d</p><p>I was lying, it did bother me, and it bothered me that he didn\u2019t tell me. I braced myself as I asked the next question.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it Conner?\u201d</p><p>He took in a sharp breath, \u201cDo you really want to hear the answer to that Elle?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t, but I did. I needed to hear him say it. \u201cYes I do, since we\u2019re being honest and not keeping secrets, tell me.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard and didn\u2019t say anything; I don\u2019t think the words would come out of his mouth, but my mouth had no problems at all.</p><p>\u201cSince you can\u2019t say anything, let me say it for you. You were never going to fall in love and that meant never having kids, so why torture yourself with only experiencing half pleasure every time you f**ked a woman when you could experience the whole natural pleasure and not have a worry in the world, except being ignorant about STD\u2019s.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His face fell and anger grew in his eyes. He was genuinely pissed at what I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to respond to something as f**ked up as that,\u201d he yelled. He continued his rant. \u201cYou are pissed that I can\u2019t have kids. Aren\u2019t you the one who said she doesn\u2019t believe in happily ever after\u2019s and fairytale romances?\u201d</p><p>All I could think about as he was yelling at me was how since meeting him he changed all that for me, but obviously I didn\u2019t do the same for him. I walked over to the floor where I left my pants and pulled them on.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he yelled.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying here tonight; you\u2019re a dick and I don\u2019t want to be near you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a dick?\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one being a bitch and overreacting about me not being able to have kids.\u201d</p><p>Did he just call me a bitch? I spun around, \u201cI\u2019m a bitch because you didn\u2019t tell me about this sooner?\u201d</p><p>The anger and darkness now consumed his eyes, \u201cYou really want to go there Ellery about not telling each other things.\u201d He was now bringing up the cancer and he was hitting below the belt.</p> <p>\u201cI regretted that from day one and you know it,\u201d my voice was yelling. \u201cHow dare you throw that in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess we\u2019re even,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Oh he shouldn\u2019t have said that. My blood was boiling and my veins were pulsating full of anger.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best you stay in the guest room tonight, till we both cool off.\u201d</p><p>I spun around and pointed my finger at him, \u201cI\u2019m not staying in the guest room; I\u2019m going home to my apartment you so graciously call a box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally Ellery, you\u2019re going to run?\u201d He waved his hand. \u201cWhy not, it\u2019s what you do best anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Tears filled my eyes at his cold words as I stormed out of the bedroom and out of his penthouse. He didn\u2019t come after me which told me he was really pissed off.</p><p>The night air was cold as I looked around the crowded streets of New York. I realized I didn\u2019t have my keys so going back to my apartment wasn\u2019t an option. I waited for a text or call or even for him to tell me was sorry and take me back upstairs with him, but he didn\u2019t. I hailed a cab and had him take me to the nearest hotel. I was weak and exhausted as I laid myself on the bed. I looked at my phone hoping if I stared at it long enough he would call me and tell me he\u2019s sorry.</p><p>I fell asleep sprawled across the bed and was rudely awoken from an incoming text. \u201cWhere the f**k are you? I went to your apartment and you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and quickly typed my response. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business where I am, remember I\u2019m doing what I do best.\u201d</p><p>Within seconds I received another text, \u201cYou are behaving like a child and I don\u2019t like it; now get your ass back to my penthouse.\u201d</p><p>Shit, you talk about adding fuel to the fire; he was sure doing an exceptional job at it. I responded, \u201cI think we need time apart to think about what each of us said last night.\u201d</p><p>A sudden reply that broke my heart came through. \u201cI think so to and when you stop behaving like a selfish child, then call me and we can talk.\u201d</p><p>I did the only thing I normally do, I threw my phone against the wall and it shattered. I sighed and took a hot shower, sobbing as the water ran down my body.</p> <p>I bent down to pick up the broken pieces that was once my phone. I really need to get that under control and stop throwing things. I walked to the cellular store and purchased the same phone with my same number. I can say I didn\u2019t care about my phone, but I did because what if Peyton needed me or what if Connor needed me.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>A few days passed and I barely left the hotel room. I read and drew pictures of things I wanted to eventually put on a canvas. Connor didn\u2019t attempt to make any contact with me and it hurt. I was too stubborn to make the first move; his words stilled burned in my heart. I sat and thought maybe I should just book a flight and go back to California. My next treatment was next week so I needed to get back anyway. I didn\u2019t want to leave him and this time apart was killing me. I hated how I grew so dependent on him. I needed to talk to him and apologize. I was out of line and shouldn\u2019t have gotten so angry. We could have talked things out but instead I ran. Connor was right; it\u2019s what I do best. I swallowed my pride and walked to his penthouse that was right on the next block.</p><p>I put my key in the elevator and took it up to the penthouse. The door opened and I stepped out looking for Connor. I didn\u2019t see him in the kitchen, but I heard talking coming from his office. I slowly took steps towards his office and gasped for air at what I saw; Ashlyn had her mouth on his. Connor pushed her away and was startled when he saw me standing there. The fear in his eyes was a fear I had never seen before.</p><p>\u201cEllery, this isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand up and turned to walk away. I couldn\u2019t breathe, my chest felt constricted and I was starting to panic. That was until I heard her say, \u201cSee Connor I told you she doesn\u2019t love you like I can.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly rage replaced panic and it grew inside me at a rapid pace. I turned around and walked towards her.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Connor said because he was all too familiar with the look I was displaying.</p><p>Ashlyn stood there with her arms crossed glaring at me as I approached her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve officially met, I\u2019m Ellery, Connors girlfriend.\u201d She eyed me up and down and refused to shake my hand.</p><p>\u201cFunny, Connor said he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend anymore when he had his hands all over me.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Connor as he stood there speechless; his only movement was the slight shaking of his head to let me know she was lying.</p><p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah he did after he kissed me and told me that it was me he loved all along and you were just a charity case he felt sorry for.\u201d</p><p>Oh no she didn\u2019t!</p><p>Connors eyes grew wide as he took a step back. Before I knew it, my fist left my side and ended up right across her jaw line. She fell back on her ass and held her jaw, staring at me like I was a lunatic. I bent down until I right in her face.</p><p>\u201cMy advice to you is to crawl back into the whore hole you crawled out from and never look at me or him again. If I even catch you looking in either of our directions, I will pound my fist into you so hard that even a plastic surgeon wouldn\u2019t be able to fix you.\u201d I turned on my heels and started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy bitch, do you know that?\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Connor came chasing after me and grabbed my arm, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare take another step.\u201d</p><p>Was he stupid or something? Did he really want to do this now when I was so full of rage?</p><p>\u201cLet go of me Connor right now before you suffer the same fate as your whore over there.\u201d Me and my mouth, shit, did I just say that?</p><p>He let go of my arm, \u201cYou\u2019re angry right now so I will forgive that last statement, but what I will not forgive is you taking another step and walking out that door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Connor, but I can\u2019t stay, especially now.\u201d</p><p>Connor pulled out his phone and called Denny to come and get Ashlyn out of the penthouse. I started to walk away as he came up from behind me, grabbed me as tight as he could and carried me upstairs to his bedroom, slamming the door shut.</p><p>\u201cNow sit down on that bed and listen to me Ellery. I\u2019m not playing games with you anymore, and I know what you just saw hurt you more than anything else. You\u2019re going to sit there and you\u2019re going listen to me.\u201d</p><p>I sat there as I swallowed hard, silently trying to plan my escape.</p><p>\u201cGo on then, explain to me who Ashlyn is and why you\u2019ve been keeping your relationship such a secret.\u201d</p><p>He paced back and forth across the room while running his hands through his hair. \u201cAshlyn is Amanda\u2019s twin sister.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and shook my head, \u201cWho the f**k is Amanda?\u201d</p><p>He took in a sharp breath, \u201cAmanda is the girl who committed suicide after I broke up with her.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open and I felt sick to my stomach. A thousand thoughts ran through my mind. He was coming clean about her and I owed him that chance.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking Connor, I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshlyn sought me out and came to my office about a year ago. She told me she had been kicked out of her house and she didn\u2019t have any money and no place to go. She said that I owed her because it was my fault her sister killed herself.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. I could hear the pain in his voice. How dare that woman do that to him? I wanted to reach out to him, but I had to let him finish telling me about her.</p><p>\u201cI took her to dinner. We talked, drank a lot and we had sex. You have no idea how bad I regret that day.\u201d He stood there shaking his head and looking down as if he was ashamed for telling me.</p><p>I got up from the bed and walked over to him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop it after that night Connor?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cShe kept talking about Amanda and making me feel guilty for what had happened. I gave her a job at my company and we had an arrangement that we would meet three times a week after work for sex, no strings attached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, let me guess, she started falling for you and she wanted more.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his head. \u201cYes, she wanted me to stop seeing other woman and enter into an exclusive relationship with her. I told her time and time again that I wasn\u2019t interested and that our arrangement was staying the way it was.\u201d He turned his back to me and took in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cShe threatened to do what her sister did if I didn\u2019t succumb to her wants and needs. It was that night at the club; the night you brought me home, that I told her there was never going to be nothing more than sex between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it Connor, why the hell didn\u2019t you just stop seeing her?\u201d I yelled.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face me, \u201cBecause the next morning she called and apologized. She said she would be happy to keep our arrangement the way it was as long as I doubled her pay.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in disbelief as the sickness settled into the pit of my stomach and I had to sit back down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d he asked as he took a few steps towards me.</p><p>I put my hand up, \u201cDon\u2019t take another step and I mean it.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment to try and calm the clusterfuck that was going on inside my head.</p><p>\u201cI have one question for you and I want you to be honest. When was the last time you slept with her?\u201d</p><p>There was no hesitation when he answered. \u201cIt was the night before I met you. I tried to break things off with her several times since you and I met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was she doing here and why were her lips on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called her and asked her to come over so I could tell her never to contact me again and that what we had was long over. I told her I was in love with you. I was paying her to stay out of our lives. That, of course, pissed her off and she was going to try whatever she could to keep me. You just happened to walk in when she was throwing herself at me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I got up from the bed and headed for the door, \u201cI can\u2019t listen to any more of this Connor, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery, please, we need to talk about everything,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWhy, so we can hurt each other again with our words?\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on my face as I backed away. \u201cMy illness is tearing us apart. You can\u2019t handle your emotions and neither can I. We just end up hurting each other. I have a question for you and I want you to be totally honest with me, are you trying to save me to erase the guilt you\u2019ve harbored over the years about your ex-girlfriend?\u201d</p> <p>Fuckity fuck...I couldn\u2019t believe I just asked him that. He stared into my eyes with his cold eyes, like all the love he felt for me had just been erased, as if it never existed.</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cI think it\u2019s best if you go back to California and I stay here.\u201d</p><p>He turned around so he didn\u2019t have to look at me. He gave up and it was my fault; I pushed him to this point. Tears streamed down my face as I turned around and walked out the door.</p><p>I walked back to the hotel and grabbed my bag. As I was walking out a text from Connor came through. \u201cMy private plane is waiting for you to take you back to California. Text Denny your location and he will pick you up.\u201d</p><p>The heart wrenching pain reared its ugly head again as I didn\u2019t respond back. I called Denny and within 5 minutes he was at the hotel picking me up. I slid in the backseat. He turned around and looked at me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Miss Lane, but I\u2019m going to tell you what I told Mr. Black, you two are the most stubborn people on the face of this earth and you couldn\u2019t be more perfect for each other.\u201d</p><p>I gave a small smile. \u201cWe are a disaster together.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up to the private landing strip where Connors plane was waiting for me. He opened the door and helped me with my bags.</p><p>\u201cDo not let your fear sabotage your relationship with Mr. Black,\u201d Ellery. It\u2019s not fair to you or to him.\u201d I kissed him on the cheek and entered the plane.</p><p>\u201cEllery,\u201d Mason smiled as he met me outside with a big hug. \u201cHow are you, we missed you?\u201d He knew the minute he saw the sadness in my eyes things were bad. \u201cNot again\u201d he frowned. He walked me upstairs to my apartment. Peyton was calling so Mason went back downstairs.</p><p>\u201cHi Peyton,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the f**k Elle? What is going on with you two? And why didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to. I wanted to get back to California first. I\u2019m sorry Peyton I just can\u2019t talk about it right now. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, \u201cI went to Connors place to give you something and he went off on a tangent about you. I looked over and that driver of his was escorting some chick out as she was holding her mouth yelling something about you and telling Connor never to speak to her again. He told me you punched her, is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did punch that bitch square in the jaw and she deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Peyton shouted. \u201cMake things right with Connor, Elle. He loves you, and you love him and sometimes people do stupid stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Peyton, but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re good together as long as I\u2019m sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElle, you\u2019re overthinking things again. You don\u2019t want things to be right because you\u2019re scared and I get that, but he\u2019s scared to, and it seems to me that you two don\u2019t get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like every day I\u2019m finding out something new about him and it\u2019s driving me crazy Peyton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand that Elle, but you need to realize that maybe he keeps some things from you because he doesn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not telling me hurts me even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen f**king tell him that; talk to him instead of yelling at him and storming out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeyton, I have to go, we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>I crawled into my bed and cried myself to sleep, again.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>The days passed slowly as I threw myself into my paintings. One night I was putting the final touches on my painting and I was on my 4th glass of wine when I decided I was going to call Connor. I missed him and I missed hearing his voice and I wasn\u2019t sure if we were even still together. It was nine o\u2019clock L.A. time so it was six o\u2019clock New York time. I hit Connors name on my phone and sat nervously as it rang. After the 3rd ring it went to voicemail. I was just going to hang up, but as soon as the beep sounded I left him a message, \u201cHi Connor, it\u2019s Elle, I just called to see how you\u2019re doing and how things are going, I guess you\u2019re busy so I\u2019ll talk to you soon, bye.\u201d</p><p>I poured another glass of wine and took a sip. I didn\u2019t expect him to call me back. When my phone started ringing and Connors name appeared on my screen, my stomach twisted itself up and my heart started racing. \u201cHello,\u201d I answered. His voice was deep and low.</p><p>\u201cHey Elle, I see you called?\u201d Hearing his voice made me feel less alone. I grabbed my wine and climbed on the bed.</p><p>\u201cHi, yeah I was just wondering how you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok; I was just finishing up a new painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, \u201cI could take a picture and send it to you if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice; I would like to see it.\u201d</p><p>I decided to go for it and try to carry on a normal, full on conversation.</p><p>\u201cSo, what have you been up to?\u201d I asked not fully aware if I wanted to know the answer.</p><p>\u201cNot much, I\u2019ve been working a lot. What have you been up to?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cNothing really, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOk I guess.\u201d What I really wanted to say was that I was feeling like f**king shit because I miss him so much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Elle, I have to get going, Cassidy and Camden are in the city and I\u2019m taking them to dinner, they should be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ok, tell Cassidy I said hi and give Camden a big hug for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will Elle, thanks for calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure no problem, I\u2019ll talk to you soon, bye Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Elle.\u201d</p><p>I held the phone to my chest, closed my eyes and took in a deep breath.</p><p>A couple of days went by and I didn\u2019t hear from Connor, so I took it as my cue that we were over. I figured since I made the first move he would contact me again. He obviously moved on so maybe I needed to try to do the same. Drinking had become a daily routine for me lately, downing a bottle wine every night before bed helped me sleep.</p><p>I walked to the local store where I took my VHS tape that my mother put in the safe deposit box and had it converted to a DVD. The minute I got home, I put it in my DVD player and sat on the couch. My eyes filled with tears when she appeared on the screen. She was more beautiful than I remembered her. Her long blonde hair was like mine and we shared the same eyes. No wonder why my dad drank so much, I was the spitting image of my mother and he was reminded of her every time he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cHappy 18th birthday angel. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be there with you physically, but I am with you spiritually. You\u2019re all grown up now and you\u2019ll be heading off to college soon. Make sure you go somewhere you can stay on campus because I want you to have the full college experience like I did. I wish I could have watched you grow up, but God had other plans for me. Once college is finished you\u2019ll get a fantastic job, meet a wonderful man, get married and have children of your own. Please follow my advice and do it exactly in the order. I know being raised without a mom was tough on you Ellery, but I know you\u2019re a strong woman and you can handle anything that is thrown your way. You deserve only the best my sweet girl and don\u2019t you ever forget it. I will be with you and guide you through the rest of your life. Remember, there\u2019s nothing more beautiful and peaceful than the sunset setting over the blue ocean waters. Live your life in peace baby girl and remember I will always love you.\u201d</p><p>I sobbed as I watched her say goodbye. If there was a time I ever needed Connor it was right now. I picked up my phone and dialed his number; I just needed to hear his voice. He didn\u2019t answer and this time I didn\u2019t leave a message.</p><p>I called Mason and asked him if he and Landon wanted to go to a club. I desperately needed to get out of this damn apartment and forget about my life for a night. Mason loved the idea, but said it would only be the two of us because Landon wasn\u2019t feeling well. I put on my short black skirt, a black and white color block halter top which showed off my cl**vage and my high black boots. I curled my hair and put on more makeup than I usually wear. I wanted to look and feel sexy, even if it was for just one night.</p><p>Mason whistled as I opened the door, \u201cLook at you sexy kitten.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and twirled around, \u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike? I love and you may just totally turn g*y men straight.\u201d</p><p>I smacked him on the arm, grabbed my purse and left for the club. We were in the cab and my phone started to ring, it was Connor. I didn\u2019t answer; I wasn\u2019t going to think about him tonight.</p><p>We walked into the club and I pulled Mason straight to the bar. \u201cLine up 4 tequila shots with lime,\u201d I shouted to the bartender. He lined up 4 shot glasses, each with a lime in front of them and some salt. I licked the salt, downed the shot and sucked the lime. \u201cHey yeah\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d I yelled at Mason. We both did 2 shots each and then hit the dance floor. It was packed and there was a lot of bumping and grinding going on. I danced like I never had before. Tonight was about me and having some fun, for the first time in a long time. After dancing for a while, we headed back to the bar, \u201cLine em up, this time 8 tequila shots,\u201d I said. Mason was all for it as we slammed them down together, I slammed six, he could only do two. The room was starting to spin but I was feeling good. The floor was thumping beneath our feet as I dragged Mason back to the dance floor. I was enjoying the music as we were moving back and forth against each other when I felt someone grinding up against my body. I turned around to this sexy looking man who was trying to talk to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Chris and you are one beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I danced with him, swaying my h*ps from side to side as he grabbed my waist. He turned me around so my ass was up against his erection. I wasn\u2019t paying attention as I was too drunk to care. I was watching Mason a few feet away from me dancing with some random girl when I felt his hands take a tighter grab on my hips. I moved my hands up and down his arms taking in his muscular form as I moved my body up and down his. I turned around and came to a complete stand still when it was no longer Chris at my side, it was Connor. His eyes were enraged as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go now,\u201d he ordered. My heart started racing and I started to sweat. What the hell was he doing here and why?</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you doing here Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me that Ellery?\u201d His voice was angry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a total slut on this dance floor and thank god I was here or who knows what that a**hole would have done to you.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my arm out of his grip and headed towards the bar. I held 2 fingers up to the bartender as he put two shots of tequila in front of me. Connor weaved in and out of the crowd coming after me. I downed one shot and picked up the next glass as Connor grabbed it from my hand, \u201cYou\u2019re drunk and we\u2019re leaving, let\u2019s go.\u201d He threw some money on the bar and grabbed my hand pulling me out of the bar with Mason following behind.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me Connor Black,\u201d I screamed as I tried to get out from his grip. I was resisting so much that he picked me up and carried me to the cab, kicking and screaming all the way.</p> <p>\u201cEllery, knock it off or so help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo help you what Connor,\u201d I yelled as he put me in the cab as he climbed next to me. I looked at him as he stared straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cYou have no right,\u201d I said.</p><p>His angry eyes turned to me, \u201cI have no right? What the f**k do you think you were doing in there, trying to get yourself raped? Look at you and the way you\u2019re dressed, you\u2019re just asking for it.\u201d</p><p>I started hitting his chest, \u201cFuck you Connor.\u201d</p> <p>Mason grabbed my arms as Connor grabbed ahold of my wrists trying to calm me down. The cab pulled up to the apartment building. Connor and Mason got out as I sat there with my arms folded.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the cab now!\u201d he yelled. I glared at him and then flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cReal mature Ellery,\u201d he said as he leaned in the cab and dragged me out of it. He threw me over his shoulder and carried me straight to the bedroom and threw me on the bed. I watched him pace back and forth across the room running his hands through his perfectly tousled hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you. I came here tonight to surprise you and I find you dry humping some guy in a club, drunk off your ass. What the f**k were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I sat up on the bed, \u201cI was having fun instead of being cooped up in this apartment crying over you every f**king day.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and looked at me, \u201cDo you think this has been easy for me?\u201d</p> <p>I put my hand over my mouth and ran to the bathroom. I leaned over the toilet as the alcohol made its way up my throat. Connor walked up behind me and held my hair back with one hand while he rubbed my back with the other. He got me a warm cloth and wiped my mouth as he helped me up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you in your pajamas and into bed, you have your injections tomorrow.\u201d He took my nightshirt out of my drawer and I grabbed it out of his hands.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d he calmly said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help, I can do it myself.\u201d I undressed as he watched me. I slipped on my nightshirt and climbed into bed. He left the room and I heard the TV turn on. He slept on the couch.</p><p>The next morning, I stumbled out of bed and walked towards the kitchen. Connor was standing there, leaning up against the counter waiting for the coffee to brew looking as sexy as ever.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, you look like shit.\u201d</p><p>I frowned as my head was pounding. \u201cYeah well we all can\u2019t look as perfect as you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned as he handed me a cup of coffee. \u201cDo I get a hug,\u201d he asked as he held his arms out.</p> <p>I walked past him, \u201cSluts don\u2019t give hugs.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and sat at the table while I went into the bedroom to get dressed.</p><p>We arrived at the hospital in silence. I walked a few feet ahead of him and heard him say, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me a slut Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you looked like a slut Elle.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cSame thing you idiot.\u201d</p><p>We reached the office and the nurse took us promptly to the room. I changed into the thin gown and sat on the bed waiting for Dr. Murphy.</p><p>\u201cAre you even going to look at me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI am so mad at you Connor Black I could scream.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to me and tried to take my hand, I pulled away. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to apologize, I\u2019m not. What you did last night was unacceptable and immature.\u201d</p><p>I looked straight into his eyes, \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t take him home and f**k him like you do.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, \u201cWhy did I even bother coming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Connor, why the f**k did you?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Murphy walked in and looked at us. She could feel the tension in the room. \u201cHello Ellery, Mr. Black,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>We said hello as she flipped through my chart. She walked over and put her hand on my knee, \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her with sadness in my eyes, \u201cLet\u2019s just get it over with.\u201d</p><p>I laid down on my side and Connor sat on the edge of the bed facing me. I pointed to the chair, \u201cYou, over there.\u201d He sighed and shook his head as he sat in the chair.</p><p>\u201cOk Ellery, here\u2019s the first injection.\u201d</p><p>The prick of my skin was the easy part. My body started to burn from the inside. I clenched the sheet of the bed with my fists as my knuckles turned white. I wouldn\u2019t look at Connor even though I wanted him to hold me. I was stubborn and I wanted to do this on my own. As soon as the second injection pierced my skin, I let out a cry of pain as my body felt like a raging fire that couldn\u2019t be extinguished. Fuck it, I needed him. I held out my hand and looked at him as he was by my side in an instant. I clutched his shirt as hard as I could as he wrapped his arms around me and kissed my forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most stubborn person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>I cried into his chest as Dr. Murphy injected me with the last injection. She patted my arm and walked out the door.</p><p>I walked into the apartment and laid on the couch.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be comfortable there?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything; I was still mad at him, but I wasn\u2019t sure at this point why. He knelt down in front of me, his piercing green eyes looking into mine.</p><p>\u201cWould it be ok if I gave you a kiss? I\u2019ve really missed those lips.\u201d</p><p>In all honesty, who could resist him, but I\u2019ll be damned if I didn\u2019t try. I clamped my mouth shut and he laughed. He ran his finger softly over my mouth and up my cheek. He leaned into me and softly brushed his lips against my mouth. It didn\u2019t take long before I gave in and my lips joined his. I parted my lips so his tongue had access to my whole mouth. The kiss was light and soft. He broke our kiss and looked at me. He didn\u2019t say anything at first, he just stared at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never loved anyone like I love you and no matter what we\u2019ve been through or are going to go through, that will never change.\u201d</p><p>Tears started to swell in my eyes as I cupped his face in my hands, \u201cI love you to and I\u2019m sorry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we are going to spend our lives apologizing to each other,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>I sat up letting him sit next to me. He pulled me onto him so my head was resting in his lap. He gently stroked my hair as I fell asleep.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>We spent the next couple of days in bed catching up on sex. \u201cChristmas is next week and I\u2019m taking you to get a tree.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and pouted, \u201cYou mean we have to leave this bed?\u201d</p><p>Connor smiled, \u201cWe do, but I promise we won\u2019t leave it for too long.\u201d He took my hand and led me into the shower.</p><p>We spent the day picking out the perfect Christmas tree. Connor made arrangements to have it delivered while we bought the lights and ornaments. We decorated the tree as we sipped wine and ate Chinese food. We made love by the tree with the lights brightly cascaded down around us and laid on the floor wrapped in a blanket.</p><p>\u201cMy mom wants you to come for Christmas,\u201d he said as he ran his finger up and down my arm.</p><p>\u201cI would love that; I miss your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Peyton and if it\u2019s ok with you, we\u2019re going to spend Christmas Eve with her and Henry and then Christmas day at my mom and dads, unless you have other plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect to me and I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>It was the day before Christmas Eve and we were heading back to New York first thing the next morning. I got out of bed and started a pot of coffee. Connor emerged from the bedroom with his hand behind his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you hiding Mr. Black?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed me on the lips, \u201cA present for you.\u201d He handed me the beautiful white box with a pink satin bow. I opened it and pulled out a beautiful white, spaghetti strap sundress.</p><p>\u201cOh Connor, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I smiled as I held it up to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to wear that tonight for dinner.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head to the side, \u201cYou\u2019re taking me to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I always? But tonight will be our last dinner in California for a while so I wanted to make it special.\u201d</p><p>I put the dress down and wrapped my arms around his neck, \u201cThank you, I love it.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long before he picked me up and carried back to the bedroom for our routine morning lovemaking.</p><p>We walked out the door and there was a Limo waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cA Limo? How classy Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and opened the door. I slid in and gasped when I looked at the driver, \u201cDenny what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked at me with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you Ellery.\u201d</p><p>Connor slid in next to me and shut the door. \u201cWhy is Denny driving us in California?\u201d Connor just smiled.</p><p>\u201cI need to blindfold you.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little kinky with Denny here?\u201d</p><p>He lightly laughed and shook his head, \u201cTrust me, we will be using this in the bedroom, but for now, where I\u2019m taking you is a surprise and I don\u2019t want you to know till we get there.\u201d He took out a black cloth and put it over my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for being incredibly turned on, yes.\u201d</p><p>The limo stopped and Connor took my hand and helped me out. He stopped and told me to take off my shoes. My heart was racing a mile a minute with excitement. As soon as my feet touched the sand, I stopped and listened as the waves crashed to the shore. Connor reached over and took off the blindfold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you know where we are.\u201d</p><p>I stood there; my feet softened by the sand as I look out and see a white canopy sitting in the middle of the beach.</p><p>\u201cIs it just us here tonight?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Connor smiled as he kissed me softly on the cheek, \u201cYes baby, I rented out the entire beach for us.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and led me down the beach to the white canopy. Inside the canopy sat a round table draped in white linen, white roses and two chairs covered in white fabric. I was speechless at the beauty of it all. The best part was that the sun was going to set soon and we\u2019d be here to watch it.</p><p>\u201cConnor, how and when did you do all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it, you are so amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner will be here soon, so I thought we could take a walk along the water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took my hand as we walked along the edge of the shoreline; the water hitting our feet. He stopped and pointed to the sky, \u201cLook the sun is starting to set.\u201d I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and comfort at that moment. Connor took my hands and held them as he faced me taking in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cEllery, from the moment I saw you I knew instantly I needed you in my life and I set out to make sure that happened. You kept calling me a stalker and you were right, I did stalk you, but for good reason.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as he continued. \u201cYou are different from anyone I have ever met. You\u2019re strong, kind, good-hearted, forgiving and loving. And you\u2019re also stubborn, a smart ass and very independent and that\u2019s everything I love about you. You have certainly given me a run for my money since I\u2019ve met you. You\u2019ve challenged me and brought out a man I thought I never could be. You\u2019ve shown me things I never would have seen if you weren\u2019t in my life. You have filled the void in my heart and soul that I never knew existed until you weren\u2019t by my side.\u201d Tears started to fall down my face.</p><p>\u201cI was simply a man with no meaning until I met you and I\u2019m proud of whom I\u2019ve become because of you. We have been through a lot together and we will continue to go through a lot, but we\u2019ll conquer whatever life throws our way. I want to thank you for being my best friend and my lover.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly he got down on one knee and pulled a small velvet box from his pocket. The tears wouldn\u2019t stop flowing down my face. \u201cI want to be more than just your lover, I want to be your happily ever after, your best friend, your husband and I want you for my wife; will you marry me Ellery Lane?\u201d He opened the box and took out the most beautiful ring I have ever seen.</p><p>I looked at him, crying as I shook my head, \u201cYes Connor, I will marry you.\u201d</p><p>He put the ring on my finger and stood up, hugging me and twirling me around. We kissed passionately and then looked up at the sunset.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to do this here because I figured you\u2019d want your mom to be here with us.\u201d</p><p>I was touched in so many ways by this man. We stood and watched the sunset over the ocean waters wrapped around each other and never wanting to let go.</p> <p>He led me back to the table as we ate dinner and talked. \u201cI saw the tape your mom made for you; last night when we got back from the club and I slept on the couch. I turned the TV on and it was playing. That had to be so hard for you watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was at first, but then it was comforting at the same time. It was amazing to see her and I regret not getting the contents of that safe deposit box sooner.\u201d</p><p>I kept looking at my ring that gracefully sat on my finger. It was a 4 carat platinum princess cut diamond with smaller diamonds going down the band.</p><p>\u201cA beautiful ring for a beautiful woman,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>He stood up and took my hand and led me a large white tent that was filled with fluffy pillows and blankets.</p><p>A huge grin crossed my face, \u201cSex on the beach?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, \u201cYes, sex on the beach.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to me and slid the spaghetti straps off my shoulders allowing my entire dress to fall at my feet. I stood there in only my white lace panties as his tongue traveled across my neck and up my jaw line before meeting my mouth with his.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you all night, first here and then at home in every room. When you walk tomorrow you\u2019ll be reminded of our passionate night, one I never want you to forget.\u201d</p><p>I braced myself for the amazing hot sex that was about to take place. After all it has been a while and I craved him like chocolate. He laid me down on the soft pillow and watched me as he took off his shirt and removed his pants and boxers. Every time I look at him it amazes me how blessed this man was in the \u201cgoods\u201d department. He bent down and laid on his side propped up on his elbow as he softly stroked my br**sts, paying special attention to each hardened nipple as he twisted them in his fingers. I ran my hand through his hair and brought his head closer for a kiss. Our lips grew hot as our tongues were reunited with each other. With finesse, he moved his hand up and down my torso and into my lace panties feeling my wetness and my ache for him.</p><p>\u201cChrist you are so wet,\u201d he moaned. His lips broke from mine as he kissed each breast, making his way down to my belly button and kissing me softly inside my inner thighs. He gently inserted his finger in me and feeling the wetness before inserting another. I gasped at the pleasure and arched my back for him to go deeper. His tongue ran circles around my swollen area forcing me to release my pleasure to him. He quickly placed his mouth where his fingers had been, sucking lightly and licking every sensitive area. My heart was beating rapidly as his erotic moves were scorching my skin. He brought his mouth up to mine giving me a taste of what he loves so much. I reached down and took him in my hand, stroking the length of him with long soft strokes. Groans came from the back of this throat as his mouth was lightly licking behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cConnor I need you inside me now, please I need to feel you.\u201d He moaned and before I knew it I was flipped on my stomach as he entered me slowly from behind.</p><p>Is this how you want me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>He sat up and moved fluently in and out of me. He reached his hands around and grabbed my br**sts, squeezing them and pinching at each nipple before moving his hand down and rubbing my aching spot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come yet baby, I need you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder Connor, f**k me harder, right now!\u201d I demanded.</p><p>I was never usually that vocal, but something inside me snapped and I wanted him hard and fast. He took in a sharp breath as he moved faster in and out of me. He was bringing me to orgasm quickly as I screamed his name and we both felt each other\u2019s release. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said as he pushed himself deeper into me releasing all his pleasure into my body. He proceeded to kiss up and down my back before collapsing on me. I could feel his heart rapidly beating as he was trying to catch his breath. I wrapped my arms around his neck and stroked his hair.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you to Ellery.\u201d</p><p>We spent a couple of more hours in the tent, drinking wine and talking. Then as promised, we made love in every room back at my apartment.</p><p>Chapter 43</p><p>Before we left for New York, we stopped by Mason and Landon\u2019s apartment so I could give them their gifts and show off my gorgeous ring. They made us some Mimosas and an elegant breakfast before we headed to Connors plane. Denny was there sitting in a seat when we arrived. I ran to him and gave him a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou knew didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed me on the cheek, \u201cOf course I knew and congratulations.\u201d We arrived in New York and back to Connors penthouse.</p><p>The Christmas holiday was beautiful and well spent with family and friends. Connor and I spent New Year\u2019s Eve hosting a party at the Waldorf Hotel with about 200 people. We rented a room for the night and made passionate love. He wrapped his arms around me as I laid my head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong babe?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked up at him, \u201cNothing, what makes you think something is wrong?\u201d</p><p>He lightly smiled and ran his finger across my lips, \u201cI can tell when something is bothering you.\u201d I sighed and laid my head back down.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me Ellery; tell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hand lightly across his chest, \u201cWhat if this trial program doesn\u2019t help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will help you.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and turned towards the edge of the bed letting my feet hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be so sure of that Connor.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and clasped his hands on my shoulders, \u201cI can be sure because I have faith Ellery. It\u2019s a new year and a new beginning for us, for our future, and nothing is going to take that away. You will get better and we\u2019ll be married and have the rest of our lives in front of us.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so sure and I was scared. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to talk to you about.\u201d The seriousness of his tone made me uneasy. I turned to face him as he pushed my hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made an appointment with my doctor to have my vasectomy reversed.\u201d</p><p>My eyes grew wide. \u201cWhat? Connor, no you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with a surprised look. \u201cListen to me; I want this because I want a family with you and if we can have our own child that would be amazing. I\u2019m not saying it will work, but there\u2019s a 50/50 chance and I think we should try it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cBut my genes suck and you know it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and planted a kiss on my forehead, \u201cYour genes are beautiful.\u201d I smiled as he took me in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry baby, everything will be fine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>We stayed in New York for a couple more weeks so Connor could tie up some business deals then headed back to California for my last round of injections.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is it Ellery, are you ready?\u201d Dr. Murphy asked.</p><p>\u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Connor took a hold of my hands and planted them firmly against his shirt. I smiled as my hands began clutching the fabric with each burning injection.</p><p>\u201cOne month from today you\u2019ll be back here for blood work,\u201d Dr. Murphy instructed.</p><p>Connor took my hand and helped me from the bed. He pulled me into an embrace and whispered in my ear, \u201cNow we wait.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>I stood at the edge of the shoreline looking out into the depths of the water. Today was my mom\u2019s birthday, and there was no place I felt closer to her than here. I wished so bad she and my dad could have been here to see Connor and I and how happy we are. If there was a time in my life I needed my mom most, it was now.</p><p>I stood and watched the waves as they crashed into the shore remembering the day he brought me here 10 months ago.</p><p>Connor took my hand as he led me, blindfolded, somewhere he called a surprise. I was still in my wedding dress because he wouldn\u2019t let me change out of it; he said he wanted the honor of undressing his new bride.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was ready forever ago.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he removed my blindfold. I gasped as I stood in front of what felt like one of my paintings. Standing before us was the Cape Cod style house I painted in my picture.</p><p>\u201cConnor, what is this?\u201d I could hardly speak. I looked around and we weren\u2019t in New York anymore; this looked like the Hampton's.</p><p>He took my hand and led me to the porch, \u201cThis house is your wedding present.\u201d</p><p>My heart started racing with excitement. This house was exactly like the one I painted. I was breathless, speechless as my mind tried to figure out what was going on. He picked me up and carried me through the door.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLike it? I love it, but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and gently kissed my lips, \u201cThis is our second home. We will spend our weekends and summers here.\u201d</p><p>He put me down and took my hand as he led me to the back of the house. Tears started to roll down my face as I stepped out onto the deck and took in the beauty of what was before me. He had everything built just like I painted. I admired the short stone wall that went around the property. There was an archway that sat over small steps leading to the beach. My favorite flowers lined the walkway. But the one thing; the very one thing that made the property so perfect, was the lighthouse that sat off to the side of the house. Connor stood behind me and let me take it all in. I turned to him as he softly wiped a couple of tears that sat upon my cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say a word Ellery I know how much you love it; I can tell by the look on your face. This was built for you because I love you. I want to give you every dream you\u2019ve ever dreamed, every happy moment you never had, every bit of love you\u2019ve ever lost, and most importantly, a family. This home, our home, is my future with you and we are going to spend the rest of our lives making beautiful memories here.\u201d</p><p>I gulped because I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was an emotional wreck at the generosity and loving nature of this man. It felt as if I was living in a dream, that reality was some other realm that I traveled from and refused to go back to. I looked into his seductive eyes and held his face in my hands.</p><p>\u201cI could never understand my purpose in this world. I have had nothing but pain and loss my whole life. But now I know why god saved me the first time. It was so I could find you. Then he saved me the second time so I could love you forever. This house is perfect; you are perfect and no one will ever take that away from us. Our love is infinite and I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life showing you.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips against his and we fell into a deep passionate kiss. He picked me up in his strong arms and carried me towards the house.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of this dress Mrs. Black,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>Connor walked up behind me and wrapped his arms around my expanding waist, resting his hands on my stomach and laying his chin on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow are my two girls doing?\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on his as he rubbed my tummy tenderly.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter has been very active today and she kept me up all night.\u201d</p> <p>He nuzzled his face into my neck and softly kissed me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s like her beautiful mother and she\u2019s going to be a fighter. I can\u2019t wait to see her and hold her in my arms,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I smiled as I interlaced our fingers, \u201cI can\u2019t either. She\u2019s the reason god saved me a third time. She\u2019s our little miracle.\u201d</p><p>The End... </p> </body></html>"]
