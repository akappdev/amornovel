Eyes that reflected a surprising glimmer of intelligence. This might be the rare female a man could reason with.</p> <p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do this the easy way, or we can make things difficult.\u201d</p><p>With a soft snort, she turned her head. It was as if he\u2019d ceased to exist.</p><p>Bram shifted his weight to his good leg, feeling the stab to his pride. He was a lieutenant colonel in the British army, and at over six feet tall, he was said to cut an imposing figure. Typically, a pointed glance from his quarter would quell the slightest hint of disobedience. He was not accustomed to being ignored.</p><p>\u201cListen sharp, now.\u201d He gave her ear a rough tweak and sank his voice to a low threat. \u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll do as I say.\u201d</p><p>Though she spoke not a word, her reply was clear: You can kiss my great woolly arse.</p> <p>Confounded sheep.</p><p>\u201cAh, the English countryside. So charming. So . . . fragrant.\u201d Colin approached, stripped of his London-best topcoat, wading hip-deep through the river of wool. Blotting the sheen of perspiration from his brow with his sleeve, he asked, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose this means we can simply turn back?\u201d</p><p>Ahead of them, a boy pushing a handcart had overturned his cargo, strewing corn all over the road. It was an open buffet, and every ram and ewe in Sussex appeared to have answered the invitation. A vast throng of sheep bustled and bleated around the unfortunate youth, gorging themselves on the spilled grain\u2014and completely obstructing Bram\u2019s wagons.</p><p>\u201cCan we walk the teams in reverse?\u201d Colin asked. \u201cPerhaps we can go around, find another road.\u201d</p><p>Bram gestured at the surrounding landscape. \u201cThere is no other road.\u201d</p><p>They stood in the middle of the rutted dirt lane, which occupied a kind of narrow, winding valley. A steep bank of gorse rose up on one side, and on the other, some dozen yards of heath separated the road from dramatic bluffs. And below those\u2014far below those\u2014lay the sparkling turquoise sea. If the air was seasonably dry and clear, and Bram squinted hard at that thin indigo line of the horizon, he might even glimpse the northern coast of France.</p> <p>So close. He\u2019d get there. Not today, but soon. He had a task to accomplish here, and the sooner he completed it, the sooner he could rejoin his regiment. He wasn\u2019t stopping for anything.</p><p>Except sheep. Blast it. It would seem they were stopping for sheep.</p><p>A rough voice said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of them.\u201d</p><p>Thorne joined their group. Bram flicked his gaze to the side and spied his hulking mountain of a corporal shouldering a flintlock rifle.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t simply shoot them, Thorne.\u201d</p><p>Obedient as ever, Thorne lowered his gun. \u201cThen I\u2019ve a cutlass. Just sharpened the blade last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t butcher them, either.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, that was Thorne\u2014straightforward, practical. Ruthless.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all hungry.\u201d Bram\u2019s stomach rumbled in support of the statement. \u201cBut clearing the way is our aim at the moment, and a dead sheep\u2019s harder to move than a live one. We\u2019ll just have to nudge them along.\u201d</p><p>Thorne lowered the hammer of his rifle, disarming it, then flipped the weapon with an agile motion and rammed the butt end against a woolly flank. \u201cMove on, you bleeding beast.\u201d</p><p>The animal lumbered uphill a few steps, prodding its neighbors to scuttle along in turn. Downhill, the drivers urged the teams forward before resetting their brakes, unwilling to surrender even those hard-fought inches of progress.</p><p>The two wagons held a bounty of supplies to refit Bram\u2019s regiment: muskets, shot, shells, wool and pipeclay for uniforms. He\u2019d spared no expense, and he would see them up this hill. Even if it took all day, and red-hot pain screamed from his thigh to his shinbone with every pace. His superiors thought he wasn\u2019t healed enough to resume field command? He would prove them wrong. One step at a time.</p><p>\u201cThis is absurd,\u201d Colin grumbled. \u201cAt this rate, we\u2019ll arrive next Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking. Start moving.\u201d Bram nudged a sheep with his boot, wincing as he did. With his leg already killing him, the last thing he needed was a pain in the arse, but that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d inherited, along with all his father\u2019s accounts and possessions: responsibility for his wastrel cousin, Colin Sandhurst, Lord Payne.</p><p>He swatted at another sheep\u2019s flank, earning himself an indignant bleat and a few inches more.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Colin said.</p><p>Bram grunted, unsurprised. As men, he and Colin were little more than strangers. But during the few years they\u2019d overlapped at Eton, he recalled his younger cousin as being just full of ideas. Ideas that had landed him shin-deep in excrement. Literally, on at least one occasion.</p><p>Colin looked from Bram to Thorne and back again, eyes keen. \u201cI ask you, gentlemen. Are we, or are we not, in possession of a great quantity of black powder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTranquillity is the soul of our community.\u201d</p><p>Not a quarter mile\u2019s distance away, Susanna Finch sat in the lace-curtained parlor of the Queen\u2019s Ruby, a rooming house for gently bred young ladies. With her were the rooming house\u2019s newest prospective residents, a Mrs. Highwood and her three unmarried daughters.</p><p>\u201cHere in Spindle Cove, young ladies enjoy a wholesome, improving atmosphere.\u201d Susanna indicated a knot of ladies clustered by the hearth, industriously engaged in needlework. \u201cSee? The picture of good health and genteel refinement.\u201d</p><p>In unison, the young ladies looked up from their work and smiled placid, demure smiles.</p><p>Excellent. She gave them an approving nod.</p><p>Ordinarily, the ladies of Spindle Cove would never waste such a beautiful afternoon stitching indoors. They would be rambling the countryside, or sea bathing in the cove, or climbing the bluffs. But on days like these, when new visitors came to the village, everyone understood some pretense at propriety was necessary. Susanna was not above a little harmless deceit when it came to saving a young woman\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cWill you take more tea?\u201d she asked, accepting a fresh pot from Mrs. Nichols, the inn\u2019s aging proprietress. If Mrs. Highwood examined the young ladies too closely, she might notice that mild Gaelic obscenities occupied the center of Kate Taylor\u2019s sampler. Or that Violet Winterbottom\u2019s needle didn\u2019t even have thread.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood sniffed. Although the day was mild, she fanned herself with vigor. \u201cWell, Miss Finch, perhaps this place can do my Diana some good.\u201d She looked to her eldest daughter. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen all the best doctors, tried ever so many treatments. I even took her to Bath for the cure.\u201d</p><p>Susanna gave a sympathetic nod. From what she could gather, Diana Highwood had suffered bouts of mild asthma from a young age. With flaxen hair and a shy, rosy curve of a smile, the eldest Miss Highwood was a true beauty. Her fragile health had delayed what most certainly would be a stunning ton debut. However, Susanna strongly suspected the many doctors and treatments were what kept the young lady feeling ill.</p><p>She offered Diana a friendly smile. \u201cI\u2019m certain a stay in Spindle Cove will be of great benefit to Miss Highwood\u2019s health. Of great benefit to you all, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>In recent years, Spindle Cove had become the seaside destination of choice for a certain type of well-bred young lady: the sort no one knew what to do with. They included the sickly, the scandalous, and the painfully shy; young wives disenchanted with matrimony, and young girls too enchanted with the wrong men . . . All of them delivered here by the guardians to whom they presented problems, in hopes that the sea air would cure them of their ills.</p><p>As the only daughter of the only local gentleman, Susanna was the village hostess by default. These awkward young ladies no one knew what to do with . . . she knew what to do with them. Or rather, she knew what not to do with them. No \u201ccures\u201d were necessary. They didn\u2019t need doctors pressing lancets to their veins, or finishing school matrons harping on their diction. They just needed a place to be themselves.</p><p>Spindle Cove was that place.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood worked her fan. \u201cI\u2019m a widow with no sons, Miss Finch. One of my daughters must marry well, and soon. I\u2019ve had such hopes for Diana, lovely as she is. But if she\u2019s not stronger by next season . . .\u201d She made a dismissive wave toward her middle daughter, who sat in dark, bespectacled contrast to her fair-haired sisters. \u201cI shall have no choice but to bring out Minerva instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Minerva doesn\u2019t care about men,\u201d young Charlotte said helpfully. \u201cShe prefers dirt and rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called geology,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cIt\u2019s a science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certain spinsterhood, is what it is! Unnatural girl. Do sit straight in your chair, at least.\u201d Mrs. Highwood sighed and fanned harder. To Susanna, she said, \u201cI despair of her, truly. This is why Diana must get well, you see. Can you imagine Minerva in Society?\u201d</p><p>Susanna bit back a smile, all too easily imagining the scene. It would probably resemble her own debut. Like Minerva, she had been absorbed in unladylike pursuits, and the object of her female relations\u2019 oft-voiced despair. At balls, she\u2019d been that freckled Amazon in the corner, who would have been all too happy to blend into the wallpaper, if only her hair color would have allowed it.</p><p>As for the gentlemen she\u2019d met . . . not a one of them had managed to sweep her off her feet. To be fair, none of them had tried very hard.</p><p>She shrugged off the awkward memories. That time was behind her now.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood\u2019s gaze fell on a book at the corner of the table. \u201cI am gratified to see you keep Mrs. Worthington close at hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Susanna replied, reaching for the blue, leather-bound tome. \u201cYou\u2019ll find copies of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom scattered everywhere throughout the village. We find it a very useful book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear that, Minerva? You would do well to learn it by heart.\u201d When Minerva rolled her eyes, Mrs. Highwood said, \u201cCharlotte, open it now. Read aloud the beginning of Chapter Twelve.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte reached for the book and opened it, then cleared her throat and read aloud in a dramatic voice. \u201c \u2018Chapter Twelve. The perils of excessive education. A young lady\u2019s intellect should be in all ways like her undergarments. Present, pristine, and imperceptible to the casual observer.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood harrumphed. \u201cYes. Just so. Hear and believe it, Minerva. Hear and believe every word. As Miss Finch says, you will find that book very useful.\u201d</p><p>Susanna took a leisurely sip of tea, swallowing with it a bitter lump of indignation. She wasn\u2019t an angry or resentful person, as a matter of course. But once provoked, her passions required formidable effort to conceal.</p><p>That book provoked her, no end.</p><p>Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom for Young Ladies was the bane of sensible girls the world over, crammed with insipid, damaging advice on every page. Susanna could have gleefully crushed its pages to powder with a mortar and pestle, labeled the vial with a skull and crossbones, and placed it on the highest shelf in her stillroom, right beside the dried foxglove leaves and deadly nightshade berries.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d made it her mission to remove as many copies as possible from circulation. A sort of quarantine. Former residents of the Queen\u2019s Ruby sent the books from all corners of England. One couldn\u2019t enter a room in Spindle Cove without finding a copy or three of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom. And just as Susanna had told Mrs. Highwood, they found the book very useful indeed. It was the perfect size for propping a window open. It also made an excellent doorstop or paperweight. Susanna used her personal copies for pressing herbs. Or occasionally, for target practice.</p><p>She motioned to Charlotte. \u201cMay I?\u201d Taking the volume from the girl\u2019s grip, she raised the book high. Then, with a brisk thwack, she used it to crush a bothersome gnat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a calm smile, she placed the book on a side table. \u201cVery useful indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never know what hit them.\u201d With his boot heel, Colin tamped a divot over the first powder charge.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to hit them,\u201d Bram said. \u201cWe\u2019re not using shells.\u201d</p> <p>The last thing they needed was shrapnel zinging about. The charges he prepared were mere blanks\u2014black powder wrapped in paper, for a bit of noise and a spray of dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain the horses won\u2019t bolt?\u201d Colin asked, unspooling a length of slow-burning fuse.</p><p>\u201cThese are cavalry-trained beasts. Impervious to explosions. The sheep, on the other hand . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill scatter like flies.\u201d Colin flashed a reckless grin.</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p> <p>Bram knew bombing the sheep was reckless, impulsive, and inherently rather stupid, like all his cousin\u2019s boyhood ideas. Surely there were better, more efficient solutions to a sheep barricade that didn\u2019t involve black powder.</p><p>But time was wasting, and Bram was impatient to be moving on, in more ways than one. Eight months ago, a lead ball had ripped through his right knee and torn his life apart. He\u2019d spent months confined to a sickbed, another several weeks clanking and groaning his way down corridors like a ghost dragging chains. Some days during his convalescence, Bram had felt certain he would explode.</p><p>And now he was so close\u2014just a mile or so\u2014from Summerfield and Sir Lewis Finch. Just a mile from finally regaining his command. He bloody well wouldn\u2019t be thwarted by a flock of gluttonous sheep, whose guts were likely to burst if they weren\u2019t scared off that corn.</p><p>A good, clean blast was just what they all needed right about now.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d Thorne called, embedding the last charge at the top of the rise. As he pushed his way back through the sheep, he added, \u201cAll\u2019s clear down the lane. I could see a fair distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a village nearby, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Colin asked. \u201cGod, tell me there\u2019s a village.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a village,\u201d Bram answered, packing away the unused powder. \u201cSaw it on the map. Somesuch Bay, or Whatsit Harbor . . . Can\u2019t exactly recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it\u2019s called,\u201d Colin said. \u201cSo long as there\u2019s a tavern and a bit of society. God, I hate the country.\u201d</p><p>Thorne said, \u201cI saw the village. Just over that rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t look charming, did it?\u201d Colin raised a brow as he reached for the tinderbox. \u201cI should hate for it to be charming. Give me a dank, seedy, vice-ridden pustule of a village any day. Wholesome living makes my skin crawl.\u201d</p><p>The corporal gave him a stony look. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about charming, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can see that,\u201d Colin muttered. He struck a flint and lit the fuse. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch, what a charming village.\u201d Diana Highwood clasped her hands together.</p><p>\u201cWe think so.\u201d Smiling modestly, Susanna led her guests onto the village green. \u201cHere we have the church, St. Ursula\u2019s\u2014a prized example of medieval architecture. Of course, the green itself is lovely.\u201d She refrained from pointing out the grass oval they used for cricket and lawn bowls, and quickly swiveled Mrs. Highwood away, lest she spy the pair of stockinged legs dangling from one of the trees.</p> <p>\u201cLook up there.\u201d She pointed out a jumble of stone arches and turrets decorating the rocky bluff. \u201cThose are the ruins of Rycliff Castle. They make an excellent place to paint and sketch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how perfectly romantic.\u201d Charlotte sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt looks damp,\u201d Mrs. Highwood pronounced.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. In a month\u2019s time, the castle will be the site of our midsummer fair. Families come from ten parishes, some from as far away as Eastbourne. We ladies dress in medieval attire, and my father puts on a display for the local children. He collects ancient suits of armor, you see. Among other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a delightful notion,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the highlight of our summer.\u201d</p><p>Minerva peered hard at the bluffs. \u201cWhat\u2019s the composition of those cliffs? Are they sandstone or chalk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . sandstone, I think.\u201d Susanna directed their attention to a red-shuttered fa\u00e7ade across the lane. Wide window boxes spilled over with blossoms, and a gilt-lettered sign swung noiselessly in the breeze. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the tea shop. Mr. Fosbury, the proprietor, makes cakes and sweets to rival any London confectionery\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCakes?\u201d Mrs. Highwood\u2019s mouth pursed in an unpleasant manner. \u201cI do hope you aren\u2019t indulging in an excess of sweets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Susanna lied. \u201cHardly ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana has been strictly forbidden to indulge. And that one\u201d\u2014she pointed out Minerva\u2014\u201cis tending toward stoutness, I fear.\u201d</p><p>At her mother\u2019s slight, Minerva turned her gaze to her feet, as if she were intently studying the pebbles beneath them. Or as if she were begging the ground to swallow her whole.</p><p>\u201cMinerva,\u201d her mother snapped. \u201cPosture.\u201d</p><p>Susanna put an arm about the young woman, shoring her up. \u201cWe have the sunniest weather in all England, did I mention that? The post comes through two times a week. Can I interest you all in a tour of the shops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShops? I only see one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. There is only one. But it\u2019s all we have need of, you see. Bright\u2019s All Things shop has everything a young lady could wish to buy.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood surveyed the street. \u201cWhere is the doctor? Diana must have a doctor nearby at all times, to bleed her when she has her attacks.\u201d</p><p>Susanna winced. No wonder Diana\u2019s health never fully returned. Such a useless, horrific practice, bleeding. A \u201cremedy\u201d more likely to drain life than preserve it, and one Susanna had barely survived herself. Out of habit, she adjusted her long, elbow-length gloves. Their seams chafed against the well-healed scars beneath.</p><p>\u201cThere is a surgeon next town over,\u201d she said. A surgeon she wouldn\u2019t allow near cattle, much less a young lady. \u201cHere in the village, we have a very capable apothecary.\u201d She hoped the woman would not ask for specifics there.</p><p>\u201cWhat about men?\u201d Mrs. Highwood asked.</p><p>\u201cMen?\u201d Susanna echoed. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith so many unwed ladies in residence, are you not overrun with fortune hunters? Bath was teeming with them, all of them after my Diana\u2019s dowry. As if she would marry some smooth-talking third son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not, Mrs. Highwood.\u201d On this point, Susanna need not fudge. \u201cThere are no debt-ridden rakes or ambitious officers here. In fact, there are very few men in Spindle Cove at all. Aside from my father, only tradesmen and servants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d Mrs. Highwood sighed, looking about the village once again. \u201cIt\u2019s all rather common, isn\u2019t it? My cousin, Lady Agatha, told me of a new spa in Kent. Mineral baths, purging treatments. Her Ladyship swears by their mercury cure.\u201d</p><p>Susanna\u2019s stomach lurched. If Diana Highwood landed in a spa like that, it might truly be the end of her. \u201cPlease, Mrs. Highwood. One cannot underestimate the healthful benefits of simple sea air and sunshine.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte tugged her gaze from the ruined castle long enough to plead, \u201cDo let\u2019s stay, Mama. I want to take part in the midsummer fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I feel better already,\u201d Diana said, breathing deep.</p><p>Susanna left Minerva\u2019s side and approached the anxious matriarch. Mrs. Highwood might be a misguided, overwrought sort of woman, but she obviously loved her daughters and had their best interests at heart. She only needed a bit of reassurance that she was doing the right thing.</p><p>Well, Susanna could give her that reassurance truthfully. All three of the Highwood sisters needed this place. Diana needed a reprieve from quack medical treatments. Minerva needed a chance to pursue her own interests without censure. Young Charlotte just needed a place to be a girl, to stretch her growing legs and imagination.</p><p>And Susanna needed the Highwoods, for reasons she couldn\u2019t easily explain. She had no way to go back in time and undo the misfortunes of her own youth. But she could help to spare other young ladies the same friendless misery, and that was the next best thing.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Mrs. Highwood,\u201d she said, taking the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cSpindle Cove is the perfect place for your daughters\u2019 summer holiday. I promise you, they will be healthy, happy, and perfectly safe.\u201d</p><p>Boom. A distant blast punched the air. Susanna\u2019s ribs shivered with the force of it.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood clutched her bonnet with a gloved hand. \u201cMy word. Was that an explosion?\u201d</p><p>Drat, drat, drat. And this had all been going so well.</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch, you just claimed this place was safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is.\u201d Susanna gave them her most calming, reassuring smile. \u201cIt is. No doubt that\u2019s just a ship in the Channel, sounding its signal cannon.\u201d</p><p>She knew very well there was no ship. That blast could only be her father\u2019s doing. In his day, Sir Lewis Finch had been a celebrated innovator of firearms and artillery. His contributions to the British army had earned him acclaim, influence, and a sizable fortune. But after those incidents with the experimental cannon, he\u2019d promised Susanna he would give up conducting field tests.</p><p>He\u2019d promised.</p><p>As they moved forward into the lane, a strange, low rumble gathered in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>Susanna feigned innocence. \u201cWhat noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat noise,\u201d Mrs. Highwood said.</p><p>The rumble grew more forceful with each second. The paving stones vibrated beneath her heeled slippers. Mrs. Highwood squeezed her eyes shut and emitted a low, mournful whimper.</p><p>\u201cOh, that noise,\u201d Susanna said lightly, herding the Highwoods across the lane. If she could only get them indoors . . . \u201cThat noise is nothing to be concerned about. We hear it all the time here. A fluke of the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt cannot be thunder,\u201d Minerva said.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s not thunder. It\u2019s . . . an atmospheric phenomenon, brought on by intermittent gusts of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheep!\u201d Charlotte cried, pointing down the lane.</p><p>A flock of deranged, woolly beasts stormed through the ancient stone arch and poured into the village, funneling down the lane and bearing down on them.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Susanna muttered. \u201cPrecisely so. Intermittent gusts of sheep.\u201d</p><p>She hurried her guests across the lane, and they huddled in the All Things shop\u2019s doorway while the panicked sheep passed. The chorus of agitated bleats grated against her eardrums.</p><p>If her father had hurt himself, she was going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no cause for alarm,\u201d Susanna said over the din. \u201cRural life does have its peculiar charms. Miss Highwood, is your breathing quite all right?\u201d</p><p>Diana nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen won\u2019t you please excuse me?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, Susanna lifted her hem and made a mad dash down the lane, weaving around the few lingering sheep as she made her way straight out of the village. It didn\u2019t take but a matter of seconds. This was, after all, a very small village.</p><p>Rather than take the longer, winding lane around the hill, she climbed it. As she neared the top, the breeze delivered to her a few lingering wisps of smoke and scattered tufts of wool. Despite these ominous signs, she crested the hill to find a scene that did not resemble one of her father\u2019s artillery tests. Down at the bottom of the lane, two carts were stalled in the road. When she squinted, she could make out figures milling around the stopped conveyances. Tall, male figures. No short, stout, balding gentlemen among them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>None of them could be Papa.</p><p>She took a relieved gulp of acrid, powder-tinged air. With the burden of dread lifted, her curiosity took the fore. Intrigued, she picked her way down the bank of heather until she stood on the narrow, rutted road. In the distance, the figures of the men ceased moving. They\u2019d noticed her.</p><p>Shading her brow with one hand, she peered hard at the men, trying to make out their identities. One of the men wore an officer\u2019s coat. Another wore no coat at all. As she approached them, the coatless man began to wave with vigor. Shouts carried up to her on the breeze. Frowning, Susanna moved closer, hoping to better hear the words.</p> <p>\u201cWait! Miss, don\u2019t . . . !\u201d</p><p>Whomp.</p><p>An unseen force plucked her straight off her feet and slammed her sideways, driving her off the lane entirely. She plowed shoulder-first into the tall grass, tackled to the turf by some kind of charging beast.</p><p>A charging beast wearing lobster-red wool.</p><p>Together, they bounced away from the road, elbows and knees absorbing the blows. Susanna\u2019s teeth rattled in her skull, and she bit her tongue hard. Fabric ripped, and cool air reached farther up her thigh than any well-mannered breeze ought to venture.</p> <p>When they rolled to a stop, she found herself pinned by a tremendous, huffing weight. And pierced by an intense green gaze.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014?\u201d Her breath rushed out in question.</p><p>Boom, the world answered.</p><p>Susanna ducked her head, burrowing into the protection of what she\u2019d recognized to be an officer\u2019s coat. The knob of a brass button pressed into her cheek. The man\u2019s bulk formed a comforting shield as a shower of dirt clods rained down on them both. He smelled of whiskey and gunpowder.</p><p>After the dust cleared, she brushed the hair from his brow, searching his gaze for signs of confusion or pain. His eyes were alert and intelligent, and still that startling shade of green\u2014as hard and richly hued as jade.</p><p>She asked, \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was a deep rasp. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, expecting him to release her at the confirmation. When he showed no signs of moving, she puzzled at it. Either he was gravely injured or seriously impertinent. \u201cSir, you\u2019re . . . er, you\u2019re rather heavy.\u201d Surely he could not fail to miss that hint.</p><p>He replied, \u201cYou\u2019re soft.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. Who was this man? Where had he come from? And how was he still atop her?</p><p>\u201cYou have a small wound.\u201d With trembling fingers, she brushed a reddish knot high on his temple, near his hairline. \u201cHere.\u201d She pressed her hand to his throat, feeling for his pulse. She found it, thumping strong and steady against her gloved fingertips.</p><p>\u201cAh. That\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Her face blazed with heat. \u201cAre you seeing double?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. I see two lips, two eyes, two flushed cheeks . . . a thousand freckles.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t concern yourself, miss. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d His gaze darkened with some mysterious intent. \u201cNothing a little kiss won\u2019t mend.\u201d</p><p>And before she could even catch her breath, he pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>A kiss. His mouth, touching hers. It was warm and firm, and then . . . it was over.</p><p>Her first real kiss in all her five-and-twenty years, and it was finished in a heartbeat. Just a memory now, save for the faint bite of whiskey on her lips. And the heat. She still tasted his scorching, masculine heat. Belatedly, she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere, now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAll better.\u201d</p><p>Better? Worse? The darkness behind her eyelids held no answers, so she opened them again.</p><p>Different. This strange, strong man held her in his protective embrace, and she was lost in his intriguing green stare, and his kiss reverberated in her bones with more force than a powder blast. And now she felt different.</p><p>The heat and weight of him . . . they were like an answer. The answer to a question Susanna hadn\u2019t even been aware her body was asking. So this was how it would be, to lie beneath a man. To feel shaped by him, her flesh giving in some places and resisting in others. Heat building between two bodies; dueling heartbeats pounding both sides of the same drum.</p><p>Maybe . . . just maybe . . . this was what she\u2019d been waiting to feel all her life. Not swept her off her feet\u2014but flung across the lane and sent tumbling head over heels while the world exploded around her.</p><p>He rolled onto his side, giving her room to breathe. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should ask you that.\u201d She struggled up on one elbow. \u201cWho are you? What on earth are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d His tone was grave. \u201cWe\u2019re bombing the sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh dear. Of course you are.\u201d Inside her, empathy twined with despair. Of course, he was cracked in the head. One of those poor soldiers addled by war. She ought to have known it. No sane man had ever looked at her this way.</p><p>She pushed aside her disappointment. At least he had come to the right place. And landed on the right woman. She was far more skilled in treating head wounds than fielding gentlemen\u2019s advances. The key here was to stop thinking of him as an immense, virile man and simply regard him as a person who needed her help. An unattractive, poxy, eunuch sort of person.</p><p>Reaching out to him, she traced one fingertip over his brow. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d she said in a calm, even tone. \u201cAll is well. You\u2019re going to be just fine.\u201d She cupped his cheek and met his gaze directly. \u201cThe sheep can\u2019t hurt you here.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be just fine,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Bram believed her. Wholeheartedly. At the moment, he was feeling damned fine indeed. He had a road cleared of sheep, a functioning leg, and a fetching young miss stroking his brow. Why the devil should he complain?</p><p>Granted, the fetching young miss thought he was a blithering idiot. But that was a mere quibble. Truth be told, he was still gathering his wits.</p><p>In those moments following the blast, his first, admittedly selfish thought had been for his knee. He was almost certain he\u2019d ripped the joint apart again, what with that ungainly rescue attempt. Before his injury, he would have managed to scoop this girl off the road with more grace. She was lucky he\u2019d been standing to the side of the lane and not down the hill with the others, or he never could have reached her in time.</p><p>Once a few moments\u2019 assessment and a trial flex or two had assured him his knee remained intact, his thoughts had all centered on her. How the irises of her eyes were the same blue as . . . well, irises. How she smelled like a garden\u2014a whole garden. Not just blossoms and herbs, but the juice of crushed green leaves and the rich, fertile essence of the earth. How she made the perfect place to land, so warm and so soft. How it had been a stupidly long time since he\u2019d had a woman under him, and he couldn\u2019t recall one ever caressing him so sweetly as this.</p><p>God, had he truly kissed her?</p><p>He had. And she was lucky he hadn\u2019t done more. For a moment there, he\u2019d been well and truly dazed. He supposed the blast was to blame for that. Or maybe it was just her.</p><p>She sat up a bit further. Wisps of loosened hair tumbled about her face. Her hair was a striking shade of gold, touched with red. It made him think of molten bronze.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what day it is?\u201d she asked, peering at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in Spindle Cove, we ladies have a schedule. Mondays are country walks. Tuesdays, sea bathing. Wednesdays, you\u2019d find us in the garden.\u201d She touched the back of her hand to his forehead. \u201cWhat is it we do on Mondays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get to Thursdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThursdays are irrelevant. I\u2019m testing your ability to recall information. Do you remember Mondays?\u201d</p><p>He stifled a laugh. God, her touch felt good. If she kept petting and stroking him like this, he might very well go mad.</p><p>\u201cTell me your name,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise to recall it.\u201d A bit forward, perhaps. But any chance for formal introductions had already fallen casualty to the powder charge.</p><p>Speaking of the powder charge, here came the brilliant mastermind of the sheep siege. Damn his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you well, miss?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t say the same for your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBram?\u201d Colin prodded him with a boot. \u201cYou look all of a piece.\u201d</p><p>No thanks to you.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s completely addled, the poor soul.\u201d The girl patted his cheek. \u201cWas it the war? How long has he been like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Colin smirked down at him. \u201cOh, all his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my cousin. I should know.\u201d</p><p>A flush pressed to her cheeks, overwhelming her freckles. \u201cIf you\u2019re his cousin, you should take better care of him. What are you thinking, allowing him to wander the countryside, waging war on flocks of sheep?\u201d</p><p>Ah, that was sweet. The lass cared. She would see him settled in a very comfortable asylum, she would. Perhaps Thursdays would be her day to visit and lay cool cloths to his brow.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Colin replied gravely. \u201cHe\u2019s a certifiable fool. Completely unstable. Sometimes the poor bastard even drools. But the hell of it is, he controls my fortune. Every last penny. I can\u2019t tell him what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be enough,\u201d Bram said. Time to put a stop to this nonsense. It was one thing to enjoy a moment\u2019s rest and a woman\u2019s touch, and another to surrender all pride.</p><p>He gained his feet without too much struggle and helped her to a standing position, too. He managed a slight bow. \u201cLieutenant Colonel Victor Bramwell. I assure you, I\u2019m in possession of perfect health, a sound mind, and one good-for-nothing cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cThose blasts . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust powder charges. We embedded them in the road, to scare off the sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou laid black powder charges. To move a flock of sheep.\u201d Pulling her hand from his grip, she studied the craters in the road. \u201cSir, I remain unconvinced of your sanity. But there\u2019s no question you are male.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cThat much was never in doubt.\u201d</p><p>Her only answer was a faint deepening of her blush.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, all the lunacy is my cousin\u2019s. Lord Payne was merely teasing, having a bit of sport at my expense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And you were having a bit of sport at my expense, pretending to be injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, now.\u201d He leaned toward her and murmured, \u201cAre you going to pretend you didn\u2019t enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. And lifted, until they formed perfect twin archer\u2019s bows, ready to dispatch poison-tipped darts. \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend I didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on her glove, and he swallowed reflexively. A few moments ago, she\u2019d pressed that hand to his bared throat, and he\u2019d kissed her lips. All pretending aside, they\u2019d shared a moment of attraction. Sensual. Powerful. Real. Perhaps she\u2019d prefer to deny it, but she couldn\u2019t erase his memory of her sweet, lush mouth.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t hide that hair. God, that hair. Now that she stood tall, wreathed by midday light, she all but blazed with beauty. Red flames and golden sunlight, each striving to outshine the other.</p><p>\u201cYou never did tell me your name,\u201d he said. \u201cMiss . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, a closed-top coach hurtled over the crest of the hill, headed their way. The driver didn\u2019t bother to slow, just whipped the team faster as the coach and four bore down on them. All present had to scramble to one side, to avoid being crushed beneath its wheels.</p><p>In a protective gesture, Bram positioned himself between the lady and the road. As the carriage went by, he glimpsed a crest painted on its side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she breathed. \u201cNot the Highwoods.\u201d She called after the coach as it rumbled off into the distance. \u201cMrs. Highwood, wait! Come back. I can explain everything. Don\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seem to have already left.\u201d</p><p>She turned on Bram, flashing him an angry blue glare. The force of it pushed against his sternum. Not nearly sufficient to move him, but enough to leave an impression.</p><p>\u201cI do hope you\u2019re happy, sir. If tormenting innocent sheep and blowing ruts in our road weren\u2019t enough mischief for you today, you\u2019ve ruined a young woman\u2019s future.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRuined?\u201d Bram wasn\u2019t in the habit of ruining young ladies\u2014that was his cousin\u2019s specialty\u2014but if he ever decided to take up the sport, he\u2019d employ a different technique. He edged closer, lowering his voice. \u201cReally, it was just a little kiss. Or is this about your frock?\u201d</p><p>His gaze dipped. Her frock had caught the worst of their encounter. Grass and dirt streaked the yards of shell-pink muslin. A torn flounce drooped to the ground, limp as a forgotten handkerchief. Her neckline had likewise strayed. He wondered if she knew her left breast was one exhortation away from popping free of her bodice altogether. He wondered if he should stop staring at it.</p><p>No, he decided. He would do her a favor by staring at it, calling her attention to what needed to be repaired. Indeed. Staring at her half-exposed, emotion-flushed breast was his solemn duty, and Bram was never one to shirk responsibility.</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest, abruptly aborting his mission.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about me,\u201d she said, \u201cor my frock. The woman in that carriage was vulnerable and in need of help, and . . .\u201d She blew out a breath, lifting the stray wisps of hair from her brow. \u201cAnd now she\u2019s gone. They\u2019re all gone.\u201d She looked him up and down. \u201cSo what is it you require? A wheelwright? Supplies? Directions to the main thoroughfare? Just tell me what you need to be on your way, and I will happily supply it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t put you to any such trouble. So long as this is the road to Summerfield, we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummerfield? You didn\u2019t say Summerfield.\u201d</p><p>Vaguely, he understood that she was vexed with him, and that he probably deserved it. But damned if he could bring himself to feel sorry. Her fluster was fiercely attractive. The way her freckles bunched as she frowned at him. The elongation of her pale, slender neck as she stood straight in challenge.</p><p>She was tall for a woman. He liked his women tall.</p><p>\u201cI did say Summerfield,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat is the residence of Sir Lewis Finch, is it not?\u201d</p><p>Her brow creased. \u201cWhat business do you have with Sir Lewis Finch?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMen\u2019s business, love. The specifics needn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummerfield is my home,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Sir Lewis Finch is my father. So yes, Lieutenant Colonel Victor Bramwell\u201d\u2014she fired each word as a separate shot\u2014\u201cyou concern me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor Bramwell. It is you.\u201d</p><p>Sir Lewis Finch rose from his desk and crossed the office in eager strides. When Bram attempted to bow, the older man waved off the gesture. Instead, he took Bram\u2019s right hand in both of his and pumped it warmly.</p><p>\u201cBy the devil, it\u2019s good to see you. Last we met, you were a green captain, just leaving Cambridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been a long time, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sorry to hear of your father\u2019s passing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bram cleared his throat awkwardly. \u201cSo was I.\u201d</p> <p>He sized up the graying eccentric for any signs of displeasure. Sir Lewis Finch was not only a brilliant inventor, but he\u2019d become a royal advisor. He was said to have the ear of the Prince Regent himself, when he chose to bend it. The right word from this man could have Bram back with his regiment next week.</p><p>And idiot that he was, Bram had announced his arrival in the neighborhood by tackling the man\u2019s daughter in the road, rending her frock, and kissing her without leave. As strategic campaigns went, this one would not be medal-worthy. Fortunately, Sir Lewis seemed not to have noticed his daughter\u2019s bedraggled state on their arrival. But Bram had best conclude this interview before Miss Finch returned and had a chance to relate the tale.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be faulted for not making the connection. Save for the blue eyes they shared, she could not have been more different from her father. Miss Finch was slender and remarkably tall for a woman. By contrast, Sir Lewis was thick in the middle and short of stature. His few remaining wisps of silver hair would scarcely brush Bram\u2019s epaulet.</p><p>\u201cBe seated,\u201d the man urged.</p><p>Bram tried not to betray much visible relief as he sank into a studded leather chair. When Sir Lewis handed him a drink, he rationed the whiskey in small, self-medicating sips.</p><p>As he drank, he studied his surroundings. The library was unlike any gentleman\u2019s library he\u2019d ever seen. Naturally, there was a desk. A few chairs. Books, of course. Whole walls of them, populating several floor-to-ceiling mahogany bookshelves. The shelves themselves were separated by plaster columns with Egyptian motifs. Some resembled stalks of papyrus. Others were carved into the shape of pharaohs and queens. And to one side of the room, occupying most of the open space, sat an enormous coffin of solid, cream-colored stone. Its surface was etched, inside and out, with row upon row of tiny symbols.</p><p>\u201cIs that marble?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAlabaster. It\u2019s a sarcophagus, from the tomb of King . . .\u201d Sir Lewis ruffled his hair. \u201cI forget his name at the moment. I have it somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the inscriptions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHexes on the outside. On the interior, directions to the underworld.\u201d The old man\u2019s hoary eyebrows rose. \u201cYou can have a lie-down in the thing, if you like. Good for the spine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, no.\u201d Bram shuddered.</p><p>Sir Lewis clapped his hands. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve brought two wagons through eight turnpikes just to discuss antiquities over a fine whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I haven\u2019t. Idle chatter isn\u2019t my purpose, ever. But I will take the whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd dinner later, I hope. Susanna will have already informed the cook.\u201d</p><p>Susanna. So, her name was Susanna.</p><p>The name suited her. Simple, pretty.</p><p>Susanna. Susanna Finch.</p><p>Rather like the refrain of a song. A cheerful, stubborn sort of song. The sort of tune that persisted, dug a trench in a person\u2019s mind and kept merrily chirping there for hours, days . . . even when that person would rather be rid of it. Even when that person would slice off his own great toe just to turn his attention to something, anything else.</p><p>Susanna. Susanna Finch. Susanna fair with brazen hair.</p><p>He turned his gaze to the window, which overlooked an immaculately tended garden. With each herb and shrub he glimpsed, he identified another element of her intriguing, garden-infused perfume. He saw lavender, sage, hyacinth, rose . . . a dozen other plants he couldn\u2019t name. But through the open window, the breeze carried their scent to him. Lifting his hair with gentle fingers, just as she had.</p><p>He gave himself a shake. She was Sir Lewis\u2019s daughter. He could not think of her this way. Or any way.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, addressing the older man. \u201cYou received my letter?\u201d</p><p>Sir Lewis took a seat on the opposite side of his desk. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want your command back.\u201d</p><p>Bram nodded. \u201cAnd while I\u2019m here, I wonder if you\u2019d be interested in an apprentice. My cousin has a knack for destruction, and not much else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refer to Payne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord. You want me to take on a viscount as an apprentice?\u201d Sir Lewis chuckled into his whiskey.</p><p>\u201cHe may be a viscount, but for the next several months he\u2019s still my responsibility. Unless someone gives him a useful occupation, he\u2019ll have ruined us both by year\u2019s end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give him a useful occupation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be here,\u201d Bram said, leaning forward and giving the older man a pointed look. \u201cWill I?\u201d</p><p>Sir Lewis removed his spectacles and set them aside, rubbing his temples with thumb and forefinger. Bram didn\u2019t like the looks of this. Temple rubbing wasn\u2019t the sign of a decision going one\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cListen, Bramwell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBram, I admired your father a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. So did the nation.\u201d Bram\u2019s father had distinguished himself in India, rising to the rank of major general and earning a great many honors and awards. \u201cMy father admired you and your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Sir Lewis said. \u201cAnd I was grieved indeed when news reached me of his death. But our friendship is precisely the reason I can\u2019t help you. Not the way you\u2019ve asked.\u201d</p><p>Bram\u2019s gut turned to stone. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>The older man ruffled his few remaining wisps of silver hair. \u201cBram, you were shot in the knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonths ago now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know very well, an injury of that nature can take a year or more to heal. If it heals completely at all.\u201d Sir Lewis shook his head. \u201cI cannot, in good conscience, recommend you for field command. You are an infantry officer. How do you propose to lead a battalion of foot soldiers when you can barely walk?\u201d</p><p>The question struck Bram in the solar plexus. \u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt you can walk across this room. Perhaps to the end of the pasture and back. But can you cover ten, twelve, fourteen miles at a grueling pace, day in and day out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI can march. I can ride. I can lead my men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bram. If I sent you back into the field like this, I would be signing your death warrant, and perhaps those of others in your command. Your father was too good a friend. I simply can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His palms went damp. Devastation loomed. \u201cThen what am I to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetire. Go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a home.\u201d There was money enough, to be sure, but his father had been a second son. He hadn\u2019t inherited any property, and he\u2019d never found time to purchase an estate of his own.</p><p>\u201cSo buy a home. Find a pretty girl to marry. Settle down and start a family.\u201d</p><p>Bram shook his head. Impossible suggestions, all. He was not about to resign his commission at the age of nine-and-twenty, while England remained at war. And he damned well wasn\u2019t going to marry. Like his father before him, he intended to serve until they pried his flintlock from his cold, dead grip. And while officers were permitted to bring their wives, Bram firmly believed gently bred women didn\u2019t belong on campaign. His own mother was proof of that. She\u2019d succumbed to the bloody flux in India, a short time before young Bram had been sent to England for school.</p><p>He sat forward in his chair. \u201cSir Lewis, you don\u2019t understand. I cut my teeth on rationed biscuit. I could march before I could speak. I\u2019m not a man to settle down. While England remains at war, I cannot and will not resign my commission. It\u2019s more than my duty, sir. It\u2019s my life. I . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t resign, there are other ways of helping the war effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeuce it, I\u2019ve been through all this with my superiors. I will not accept a so-called promotion that means shuffling papers in the War Office.\u201d He gestured at the alabaster sarcophagus in the corner. \u201cYou might as well stuff me in that coffin and seal the lid. I am a soldier, not a secretary.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s blue eyes softened. \u201cYou\u2019re a man, Victor. You\u2019re human.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m my father\u2019s son,\u201d he shot back, pounding the desk with his fist. \u201cYou cannot keep me down.\u201d</p><p>He was going too far, but to hell with boundaries. Sir Lewis Finch was Bram\u2019s last and only option. The old man simply couldn\u2019t refuse.</p><p>Sir Lewis stared at his folded hands for a long, tense moment. Then, with unruffled calm, he replaced his spectacles. \u201cI have no intention of keeping you down. Much to the contrary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bram was instantly wary.</p><p>\u201cI mean precisely what I said. I have done the exact opposite of keeping you down.\u201d He reached for a stack of papers. \u201cBramwell, prepare yourself for elevation.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Susanna, pull yourself together.</p><p>After excusing herself to hurriedly tame her disheveled hair and exchange her torn, muddied frock for a fresh blue muslin and matching gloves\u2014in the process, speaking more sharply to Gertrude than the poor maid deserved\u2014she joined Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell\u2019s companions in the Red Salon.</p> <p>As she entered, she stole a quick glance in the hall mirror. Her appearance was repaired, as much as it could be. Her composure, on the other hand, remained splintered in a thousand jagged pieces, all of them rubbing and chafing within her. Some jabbed at her pride. Others stirred up the familiar well of dread that always opened whenever Papa and black powder were mingled. The rest made her prickle all over with awareness. It wasn\u2019t a nice feeling.</p><p>And it was all his fault. The beastly, teasing, handsome sheep-bomber. Who was the man, and what did he want with her father? Hopefully just a polite social call. Though she had to admit, Bramwell didn\u2019t seem the type for polite social calls.</p><p>The downstairs maid brought in the tray, and Susanna directed her to place it on a rosewood table with legs carved in the shape of long-whiskered goldfish.</p><p>\u201cTea, gentlemen?\u201d she asked, pulling her gloves snug as she reached for the pot. Pouring tea was just what she needed right now. Such a civilizing force, tea. She would nip sugar with little silver tongs. Stir milk with a tiny spoon. Tiny spoons were incompatible with a state of sensual turmoil.</p><p>The thought comforted her. Yes. She would give the men tea, and perhaps a nice dinner. Then they would be on their way, and the world would return to rights. At least her corner of it.</p><p>The formerly half-dressed gentleman\u2014Lord Payne, as she now knew him\u2014had located his coat and cravat, and smoothed his hair. He made a suitably aristocratic ornament, at home among the lacquered cabinets and glazed green vases.</p> <p>As for the officer\u2014a corporal, she\u2019d gathered from his patches\u2014he stood near the plate window, the picture of unease. He glared suspiciously at the dragon-emblazoned carpet, as if expecting the embroidered beast to strike. If it did, she had no doubt he\u2019d kill it handily.</p><p>\u201cWill you take tea, Corporal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to her this might have been the first\u2014and only\u2014word she\u2019d heard from his lips. He was the sort of man one knew, just from looking at him, had an interesting story to tell. She also felt, just as certainly, he would never tell it. Not at knifepoint, much less over tea.</p><p>She handed Lord Payne a steaming cup, and he took an immediate, reckless draught. A devilish smile curved her way. \u201cGunpowder tea? Well done, Miss Finch. I do enjoy a lady with a sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>Now this one . . . he was a rake. It was written all over him, in his fine dress and flirtatious manner. He might as well have had the word embroidered on his waistcoat, between the gold-thread flourishes. She knew all about men of his sort. Half the young ladies in Spindle Cove were either fleeing them or pining for them.</p><p>Susanna flicked a glance at the closed door to her father\u2019s library, wondering what could be keeping him so long. The sooner these men left, the easier she would breathe.</p><p>Payne reclined in his chair, tilting his head to regard the brass chandelier. \u201cThis is quite a room.\u201d He indicated a display case mounted on the wall. \u201cAre those . . .\u201d His head cocked. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRockets, from the Ming dynasty. My father is an avid collector of antiquities. He takes a particular interest in historical weaponry.\u201d Pouring her own tea, she explained, \u201cSummerfield has an eclectic theme. This room is in the chinoiserie style. We have an Austrian morning room, an Ottoman parlor, and an Italianate terrace. My father\u2019s study takes inspiration from Egypt and the great library of Alexandria. His medieval collections are housed in the long hall. Oh, and there\u2019s a Grecian folly in the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Lewis must be a great traveler.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, stirring sugar into her cup. \u201cNo, not really. We\u2019d always talked of a Grand Tour, but circumstances were against it. My father brought the world to Summerfield instead.\u201d</p><p>And how she loved him for it. Sir Lewis Finch would never rank among the most attentive or observant of fathers, perhaps. But when she\u2019d needed him most, he\u2019d never failed her. He\u2019d moved all their possessions and his entire laboratory to Summerfield, turned down innumerable invitations and opportunities to travel over the years . . . all for Susanna\u2019s health and happiness.</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re all assembled.\u201d Her father emerged from the library. Rumpled, as always. Susanna smiled a little, battling the urge to go smooth his hair and straighten his cravat.</p><p>Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell followed like a thundercloud, dark and restless. Susanna had no urge whatsoever to touch him. At least, none that she would admit to. As he moved across the room, she noted that he favored his right leg. Maybe he\u2019d done himself an injury earlier, when he\u2019d tackled her to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI have an announcement,\u201d her father said, brandishing a sheaf of official-looking papers. \u201cSince Bramwell has failed to muster the appropriate enthusiasm, I thought I would share the good news with you, his friends.\u201d He adjusted his spectacles. \u201cIn honor of his valor and contributions in the liberation of Portugal, Bramwell has been made an earl. I have here the letters patent from the Prince Regent himself. He will henceforth be known as Lord Rycliff.\u201d</p><p>Susanna choked on her tea. \u201cWhat? Lord Rycliff? But that title is extinct. There hasn\u2019t been an Earl of Rycliff since . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince 1354. Precisely. The title has lain dormant for nearly five centuries. When I wrote to him emphasizing Bramwell\u2019s contributions, the Prince Regent was glad of my suggestion to revive it.\u201d</p><p>A powder blast in the Red Salon could not have stunned Susanna more. Her gaze darted to the officer in question. For a man elevated to the peerage, he didn\u2019t look happy about it, either.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Payne remarked. \u201cAn earl? This can\u2019t be borne. As if it weren\u2019t bad enough that he controls my fortune, my cousin now outranks me. Just what does this earldom include, anyhow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much besides the honor of the title. No real lands to speak of, except for the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe castle,\u201d Susanna finished, her voice remote.</p><p>Her castle.</p><p>Of course, Rycliff Castle didn\u2019t belong to her, but she\u2019d always felt possessive of it. No one else seemed to want the pile of ruins, after all. And when they\u2019d first taken this house and she\u2019d been so weakened from fever, Papa had called it hers. You must get well, Susanna Jane, he\u2019d said to her. You have your very own castle to explore.</p><p>\u201cSusanna, show them all the model.\u201d Her father looked pointedly at a high shelf on the room\u2019s southern wall.</p><p>\u201cPapa, I\u2019m sure the lieutenant colonel wouldn\u2019t be interested in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Lord Rycliff now. Of course he\u2019ll be interested. It\u2019s his castle.\u201d</p><p>His castle. She couldn\u2019t believe it. Why hadn\u2019t her father told her anything about this?</p><p>\u201cThe model, dear,\u201d her father prompted. \u201cI\u2019d fetch the thing on my own, but you know you\u2019re the only one tall enough to reach that shelf.\u201d</p><p>With a quiet sigh, Susanna dutifully rose from her chair and crossed the room to retrieve the clay model she\u2019d made of Rycliff Castle more than a decade ago. Sometimes life could be astonishingly efficient in dispensing mortifications. In the space of a minute, she would be exposed before three male visitors to be both freakishly tall and an abominably poor sculptor. What would come next? Perhaps her father would invite the men to count her freckles, one by one. They\u2019d be here until moonrise.</p><p>Suddenly, Bramwell was at her side.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d he asked, touching a finger to the model\u2019s edge.</p><p>She cringed, wishing she could deny it. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>As he retrieved the model from the shelf, she stole glances at him out of the corner of her eye. She had to admit, the Rycliff title suited him. Give the man a mace and a chain mail vest, and she could easily have mistaken him for a medieval warrior, squeezed through some rocky gap in the centuries to emerge in modern day. From the sheer size of him, large and solid all over, to that squared jaw, shadowed with a day\u2019s or more growth of whiskers. He moved with more power than grace, and he wore his dark hair long, tied back at his nape with a bit of leather cord. And the way he\u2019d looked at her just before that kiss\u2014as though he would devour her, and she would enjoy it\u2014was straight from the Dark Ages.</p><p>As he presented the crumbling mess of sun-dried clay and pasted-on moss, Susanna fought the urge to blow dust off the thing. Evidently the maids couldn\u2019t reach this shelf, either.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it clever?\u201d Her father took the model from Bramwell\u2019s hands and held it up. \u201cSusanna made this when she was fifteen years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen,\u201d she corrected, cursing herself a moment later. Because \u201cfourteen\u201d somehow made it better?</p><p>With a flourish, her father placed the model on a table in the center of the room. The men reluctantly gathered around it. Bramwell glowered at the lumpy gray diorama.</p><p>\u201cIt may not look like much,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut Rycliff Castle\u2019s history is legend. Built by William the Conqueror himself, then enlarged by Henry the Eighth. It\u2019s situated on a bluff, right on the sea\u2019s edge. Below is the cove, see?\u201d He pointed. \u201cAnd the water\u2019s a lovely color in truth, not this murky gray.\u201d</p><p>Susanna touched her ear. \u201cThere was blue paint, once. It\u2019s flaked away.\u201d</p><p>Sir Lewis went on, \u201cThe cove was a bustling medieval port. Then, in the thirteenth century, there was a terrific landslide. The result of storms, erosion. No one knows. Half of the original castle fell into the sea, and what\u2019s left is in ruins. But come along, Bramwell.\u201d Sir Lewis prodded the officer. \u201cLook happy. Haven\u2019t you always wanted a castle?\u201d</p><p>At his side, Susanna watched the man\u2019s massive hand gather into a fist. She heard knuckles crack.</p><p>\u201cSir Lewis, I\u2019m honored, and I appreciate your recommendation, but this\u201d\u2014he waved at the model\u2014\u201cis not what I had in mind. I\u2019m not interested in playing at knights and dragons.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Sir Lewis jabbed his forefinger on the table\u2019s lacquered surface, to what would have been the castle\u2019s western side. \u201cThe village would be just about here, down in the valley. Charming little place.\u201d Then he turned and squinted at the far corner of the room. \u201cAnd just about where that jade medallion is displayed\u201d\u2014he pointed\u2014\u201cwould be Cherbourg, on the northern coast of France.\u201d</p><p>Bramwell glanced toward the jade, then looked back at Sir Lewis. His brow rose in silent question.</p><p>Sir Lewis clapped a hand on the officer\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou did want a command, Bramwell. Well, you\u2019ve just been granted a castle on England\u2019s southern coast, not fifty miles distant from the enemy. As the new lord, you\u2019ll raise a militia to defend it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Susanna blurted out. \u201cA militia, here?\u201d</p><p>She must have misheard, or misunderstood. These men were meant to take tea\u2014perhaps a nice dinner\u2014and then leave. Never to be seen again. She could not become neighbors with the sheep-bomber. And heavens . . . a militia? What would become of the ladies and Mrs. Nichols\u2019s rooming house? There were no men like these in Spindle Cove. The absence of rakes and officers was the village\u2019s primary attraction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPapa, please stop jesting,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to waste the gentlemen\u2019s time. You know very well, a militia would be useless here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUseless?\u201d Bramwell cut her a look. \u201cMilitias aren\u2019t useless. To the contrary, they\u2019re essential. In case you were unaware, Miss Finch, England is at war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally, I\u2019m aware of that. But everyone knows the threat of French invasion has passed. They\u2019ve had no real naval clout since Trafalgar, and Bonaparte\u2019s forces are so depleted after that drubbing in Russia, he hasn\u2019t the strength to invade anyone. As matters stand, it\u2019s all he can do to hold Spain. With Wellington\u2019s forces on the march, even that grasp is tenuous.\u201d</p> <p>The room went silent, and Bramwell frowned at her, intently. Yet another instance of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom proved wrong. If a woman\u2019s intellect was in any way analogous to her undergarments, men should thrill to see it revealed. Strangely enough, Susanna had never known it to work that way.</p><p>\u201cYou know a great deal about current events,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am an Englishwoman with an interest in the war\u2019s outcome. I take the trouble to inform myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so well informed, you should also know we\u2019re at war with not only France, but America. Not to mention, the coastline is rife with privateers and smugglers of every stripe.\u201d With a single fingertip, he drew the model toward him. \u201cI\u2019m astonished this Rycliff Castle has gone unsecured so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing astonishing about it.\u201d Reaching out, she tugged the model right back. \u201cNo one would attempt to come ashore here. As my father said, the coast has changed since the Normans invaded. The landslide formed a sort of reef. Only the smallest fishing boats can navigate it, even at high tide. Many a ship has foundered and wrecked in that cove. Not even the smugglers trouble with it.\u201d She looked up at him, pointedly. \u201cNature affords us protection enough. We don\u2019t need uniformed men. Not here.\u201d</p> <p>Their gazes locked and held. Something defensive flared in those bold green eyes, and she wondered at the thoughts crossing his mind. Not thoughts of kissing her, she\u2019d wager.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d Sir Lewis said, chuckling, \u201cthis happens to be a disagreement of the most vexing sort.\u201d</p><p>Susanna smiled. \u201cThe sort where the woman has the right of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear. The sort where both sides have equal merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Her father motioned toward the chairs, directing them all to sit. \u201cSusanna, you are correct,\u201d he said, once all were settled. \u201cThe chances of any enemy invading Spindle Cove are so small as to be infinitesimal. However\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, Lord Payne choked and sputtered, replacing his teacup with an abrupt crack.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Bramwell asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d Payne dabbed at his spattered waistcoat. \u201cSir Lewis, did you say Spindle Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place, here. Is Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Susanna echoed slowly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no reason.\u201d Payne rubbed his mouth with one hand, as if massaging away a laugh. \u201cPlease, do go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Sir Lewis continued, \u201cchances of invasion are slim indeed. However, Bramwell here will tell you that a solid defense is based on the appearance of readiness, not the probability of attack. Similar points along the coast have been fortified with Martello towers, defended by local volunteer militias. Spindle Cove cannot appear to be the weak link in the chain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing weak about our village, Papa. Visitors know it to be perfectly safe. If this militia comes to pass, that reputation can only suff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna, dear.\u201d Her father sighed loudly. \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t nearly enough. Papa, do you know what kind of man this is? she longed to argue. He\u2019s a bomber of defenseless sheep, an enemy of flounced muslin frocks, and a kisser of unsuspecting women! A perfect beast. We can\u2019t have him here. We can\u2019t.</p><p>Only deep, abiding respect for her father kept her quiet.</p><p>He went on, \u201cTo be perfectly honest, there is another reason. I am the only other local gentleman, you see. This duty should have been mine. The Duke of Tunbridge is responsible for the Sussex militia, and he\u2019s been hounding me for over a year now to provide a display of our local readiness.\u201d His eyes fell to the carpet. \u201cAnd so I have promised him one, at this year\u2019s midsummer fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe midsummer fair? Oh, but that\u2019s not even a month away,\u201d Susanna said, dismayed. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve always made the fair a children\u2019s festival. Suits of armor, crossbows. A few melons fired out to sea with the old trebuchet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dear. But this year, we\u2019ll have to treat our neighbors\u2014and the duke\u2014to a proper military review instead.\u201d He leaned forward, bracing his arms on his knees. \u201cIf Bramwell agrees, that is. If he doesn\u2019t embrace the Rycliff title and take on this militia as his duty . . . the task will fall to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa, you can\u2019t.\u201d The thought alone made Susanna wilt. Her father could not be responsible for embodying a militia company. He was aging, and his heart was weak. And he was her only family. She owed him her life, in more ways than one. The prospect of welcoming this horrid Bramwell and his friends into their safe, secure community filled her with dread. But if the only alternative would endanger her father\u2019s health, how could she argue against this militia scheme?</p><p>The answer was plain. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Her father addressed the officer. \u201cBramwell, you\u2019ve led entire regiments into battle. I\u2019m asking you to train a company of four-and-twenty men. Believe me, I know full well this is like asking an African lion to serve a barn cat\u2019s purpose. But it is a position of command, and one I\u2019m free to offer you. And it\u2019s only a month. If you do well with it . . . after midsummer, it could lead to something more.\u201d</p><p>A meaningful look passed between the men, and Bramwell\u2014now Lord Rycliff, she supposed\u2014was silent for a long moment. Susanna held her breath. A half hour ago, she\u2019d wished for nothing more than to see the back of this man and his party. And now, she found herself forced into a most unpleasant occupation.</p><p>Hoping he would stay.</p><p>At length, he stood, pulling on the front of his coat. \u201cVery well, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Rising to his feet, Papa clapped his hands together and rubbed them briskly. \u201cI\u2019ll write to the duke forthwith. Susanna, you\u2019re always fond of walking, and there\u2019s ample time before dinner. Why don\u2019t you show the man his castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the way,\u201d Susanna said, leading the men off the dirt lane and onto an ancient road grown over with grass.</p><p>The path was a familiar one. Over the years she\u2019d resided in Spindle Cove, Susanna must have walked it thousands of times. She knew each curve of the land, every last mottled depression in the road. More than once, she\u2019d covered this distance in the dark of night with nary a misstep.</p><p>Today, she stumbled.</p><p>He was there, catching her elbow in his strong, sure grip. She hadn\u2019t realized he was following so close. Just when she thought she\u2019d regained her balance, his heat and presence unsteadied her all over again.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think so.\u201d In an effort to dispel the awkwardness, she joked, \u201cMondays are country walks; Tuesdays, sea bathing . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh. Nor even smile. He released her without comment, moving on ahead to take the lead. His strides were long, but she noticed he was still favoring that right leg.</p><p>She did what a good healer ought never do. She hoped it hurt.</p><p>Perhaps, with that swooping tackle in the road, he had saved her from losing a few toes. But if not for him, there would have been no danger in the first place. If not for him, right now she would be seeing the Highwoods settled in at the rooming house. Poor Diana. Poor Minerva, for that matter. Charlotte was young and resilient, at least.</p><p>They climbed the rest of the way in silence. Once they crested the sandstone ridge, Susanna pulled to a stop. \u201cWell,\u201d she said between deep inhalations, \u201cthere it is, my lord. Rycliff Castle.\u201d</p><p>The castle ruins sat perched at the tip of an outcropping, an arrowhead of green heath jutting over the sea. Four stone turrets, a few standing arches . . . here and there, a bit of wall. This was all that remained. In the background spread the English Channel, now turning a lovely shade of periwinkle in the dimming afternoon.</p><p>Silence reigned for a long minute as the men took in the scene. Susanna kept quiet, too, as she tried to see the ancient fortress through fresh eyes. As a young girl, she\u2019d been taken with the romance of it. When one viewed the castle as a picturesque ruin, the absent walls and ceilings were the best features. The missing parts were invitations to dream; they inspired the imagination. Looking upon this as a prospective residence, however, she could only imagine the missing parts would inspire grave misgivings. Or perhaps hives.</p><p>\u201cAnd the village?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can see it from here.\u201d She led them through a standing fragment of arched corridor, across an open expanse of grass that had once been the castle\u2019s courtyard, to the bluff, where they could overlook the crescent-shaped cove and the valley that sheltered her beloved community. From here, it looked so small and insignificant. With any luck, it would remain beneath his notice entirely.</p><p>He said, \u201cI\u2019ll be needing a closer look tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing special,\u201d she hedged. \u201cJust an average English village. Hardly worth your time. Cottages, a church, a few shops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely there\u2019s an inn,\u201d Lord Payne said.</p><p>\u201cThere is a rooming house,\u201d Susanna said, leading them back from the edge of the bluff. \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ruby. But I\u2019m afraid it is completely occupied at this time of year. Summer visitors, you understand, come to enjoy the sea.\u201d And to escape men like you.</p><p>\u201cAn inn won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Lord Rycliff walked slowly about the ruins. He propped a hand against a nearby wall and leaned on it, as if to test the wall\u2019s soundness. \u201cWe\u2019ll be staying here.\u201d</p><p>This statement was received with universal incredulity. Even the stones seemed to throw it back at him, rejecting the words as false.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d the corporal said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lord Rycliff said. \u201cHere. We\u2019ll need to begin settling in, if we\u2019re to make camp before nightfall. Go see to the carts, Thorne.\u201d</p><p>Thorne nodded his compliance and quit the place immediately, descending the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean to stay here,\u201d Lord Payne said. \u201cHave you seen here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Rycliff answered. \u201cI\u2019m looking at it. So we\u2019ll be camping. That\u2019s what militiamen do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a militiaman,\u201d Payne said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t camp.\u201d</p><p>Susanna would guess he didn\u2019t. Not in those fine boots, at least.</p><p>\u201cWell, you camp now,\u201d Rycliff said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a militiaman now, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. Think again, Bram. You\u2019re not pulling me into your tin soldier brigade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you a choice. You need to learn some discipline, and this is the perfect opportunity.\u201d He cast a glance around. \u201cSince you\u2019re so fond of setting blazes, see if you can start a fire.\u201d</p><p>Susanna put a hand on Rycliff\u2019s sleeve, hoping to claim his attention.</p><p>She got it. His full, unwavering attention. His intent gaze ranged over her face, searching out her every feature and flaw.</p><p>\u201cForgive the interruption,\u201d she said, releasing his sleeve. \u201cBut surely camping isn\u2019t necessary. My father may not have made the express invitation as yet, but I\u2019m certain he intends to offer you lodging at Summerfield.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen give your father my thanks.

Difficult to do that from a mile inland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut my lord, you do understand this militia business is all for show? My father\u2019s not truly concerned about an invasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he should be.\u201d He glanced at his cousin, who was currently snapping dead branches from an ivy-covered wall. With a tilt of his head, Rycliff drew her aside. \u201cMiss Finch, it\u2019s not wise for officers to quarter in the same house with an unmarried gentlewoman. Have a care for your reputation, if your father does not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a care for my reputation?\u201d She had to laugh. Then she lowered her voice. \u201cThis, from the man who flattened me in the road and kissed me without leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d His eyes darkened.</p><p>His meaning washed over her in a wave of hot, sensual awareness. Surely he wasn\u2019t implying . . .</p> <p>No. He wasn\u2019t implying at all. Those hard jade eyes were giving her a straightforward message, and he underscored it with a slight flex of his massive arms: I am every bit as dangerous as you suppose. If not more so.</p><p>\u201cTake your kind invitation and run home with it. When soldiers and maids live under the same roof, things happen. And if you happened to find yourself under me again . . .\u201d His hungry gaze raked her body. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t escape so easily.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou are a beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a man, Miss Finch. Just a man.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Bram told himself he was looking out for Miss Finch\u2019s safety as he watched her picking her way down the rocky slope. He told himself a lie. In truth, he was utterly entranced by her figure in retreat, the way her curves gave a saucy little bounce with each downward step.</p> <p>He would dream of those breasts tonight. How they\u2019d felt trapped beneath him, so soft and warm.</p><p>Blast. This day had not gone as planned. By this time, he was supposed to be well on his way to the Brighton Barracks, preparing to leave for Portugal and rejoin the war. Instead, he was . . . an earl, suddenly. Stuck at this ruined castle, having pledged to undertake the military equivalent of teaching nursery school. And to make it all worse, he was plagued with lust for a woman he couldn\u2019t have. Couldn\u2019t even touch, if he ever wanted his command back.</p><p>As if he sensed Bram\u2019s predicament, Colin started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that you\u2019ve been played for a greater fool than you realize. Didn\u2019t you hear them earlier? This is Spindle Cove, Bram. Spindle. Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying that like I should know the name. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really must get around to the clubs. Allow me to enlighten you. Spindle Cove\u2014or Spinster Cove, as we call it\u2014is a seaside holiday village. Good families send their fragile-flower daughters here for the restorative sea air. Or whenever they don\u2019t know what else to do with them. My friend Carstairs sent his sister here last summer, when she grew too fond of the stable boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so . . . ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd so, your little militia plan? Doomed before it even starts. Families send their daughters and wards here because it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s safe because there are no men. That\u2019s why they call it Spinster Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere have to be men. There\u2019s no such thing as a village with no men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there may be a few servants and tradesmen. An odd soul or two down there with a shriveled twig and a couple of currants dangling between his legs. But there aren\u2019t any real men. Carstairs told us all about it. He couldn\u2019t believe what he found when he came to fetch his sister. The women here are man-eaters.\u201d</p><p>Bram was scarcely paying attention. He focused his gaze to catch the last glimpses of Miss Finch as her figure receded into the distance. She was like a sunset all to herself, her molten bronze hair aglow as she sank beneath the bluff\u2019s horizon. Fiery. Brilliant. When she disappeared, he felt instantly cooler.</p><p>And then, only then, did he turn to his yammering cousin. \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here, Bram. Before they take our bollocks and use them for pincushions.\u201d</p><p>Bram made his way to the nearest wall and propped one shoulder against it, resting his knee. Damn, that climb had been steep. \u201cLet me understand this,\u201d he said, discreetly rubbing his aching thigh under the guise of brushing off loose dirt. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting we leave because the village is full of spinsters? Since when do you complain about an excess of women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are not your normal spinsters. They\u2019re . . . they\u2019re unbiddable. And excessively educated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Frightening, indeed. I\u2019ll stand my ground when facing a French cavalry charge, but an educated spinster is something different entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mock me now. Just you wait. You\u2019ll see, these women are a breed unto themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women aren\u2019t my concern.\u201d</p><p>Save for one woman, and she didn\u2019t live in the village. She lived at Summerfield, and she was Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s daughter, and she was absolutely off limits\u2014no matter how he suspected Miss Finch would become Miss Vixen in bed.</p><p>Colin could make all the disparaging remarks he wished about bluestockings. Bram knew clever women always made the best lovers. He especially appreciated a woman who knew something of the world beyond fashion and the theater. For him, listening to Miss Finch expound on the weakened state of Napoleon\u2019s army had been like listening to a courtesan read aloud from her pillow book. Arousing beyond measure. And then he\u2019d made the idiotic\u2014though inevitable\u2014mistake of picturing her naked. All that luminous hair and milky skin, tumbled on crisp white sheets . . .</p><p>To disrupt the erotic chain of thought, he pressed hard against the knotted muscle in his thigh. Pain sliced through the lingering haze of desire.</p><p>He pulled the flask from his breast pocket and downed a bracing swallow of whiskey. \u201cThe women aren\u2019t my concern,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019m here to train the local men. And there are men here, somewhere. Fishermen, farmers, tradesmen, servants. If what you say is correct, and they\u2019re outnumbered by managing females . . . Well, then they\u2019ll be eager for a chance to flex their muscles, prove themselves.\u201d Just as he was.</p><p>Bram walked to the gateway and was relieved to see the wagons approaching. He couldn\u2019t remain lost in lustful thoughts when there was work to be done. Pitching tents, watering and feeding the horses, building a fire.</p><p>After one last sip, he recapped his flask and jammed it in his pocket. \u201cLet\u2019s have a proper look at this place before the dark settles in.\u201d</p><p>They began in the center and worked their way out. Of course, the current center wasn\u2019t truly the center, since half the castle had fallen into the sea.</p><p>Turning back toward the north, Bram now recognized the arch they\u2019d entered through as the original gatehouse. Walls spread out from the structure on either side. Even in spots where the walls had crumbled, one could easily trace the places where they\u2019d stood. Here in the bailey area, low, moss-covered ridges served to mark interior walls and corridors. To the southern, waterfront side, a four-leafed clover of round turrets hugged the bluff, connected by sheer, windowless stretches of stone.</p><p>\u201cThis must have been the keep,\u201d he mused, walking through the arched entryway to stand in the center of the four soaring towers.</p><p>Colin stepped inside one of the dark, hollow turrets. \u201cThe staircases are intact, being stone. But, of course, the wooden floors are long gone.\u201d He tilted his head, peering toward the dark corners overhead. \u201cImpressive collection of cobwebs. Are those swallows I hear chirping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose?\u201d Bram listened. \u201cThose would be bats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Bats. So this inches-deep muck I\u2019m standing in would be . . . Brilliant.\u201d He stomped back into the courtyard, wiping his boots on the mossy turf. \u201cLovely place you have here, cousin.\u201d</p><p>It was lovely. As the sky turned from blue to purple, a sprinkling of stars appeared above the castle ruins. Bram knew he\u2019d made the right decision to decline quarter at Summerfield. All concerns of duty and restraint aside, he never felt comfortable in stuffy English manor houses. Their door lintels were too low for him, and their beds were too small for him. Such homes weren\u2019t for him, full stop.</p><p>The open country was where he belonged. He didn\u2019t need a place like Summerfield. However, his empty stomach was beginning to argue he should have accepted a meal at Sir Lewis\u2019s table, at least.</p><p>A low bleat drew his attention downward. A lamb stood at his feet, nosing the tassel on his boot.</p><p>\u201cOh look,\u201d said Colin brightly. \u201cDinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d</p><p>Thorne approached. \u201cFollowed us up. The drivers say it\u2019s been nosing around the carts ever since the blasts.\u201d</p><p>Bram examined the creature. Must have been separated from its mother. By this time of summer, it was well past the age of weaning. It was also well past the age of being adorable. The lamb looked up at him and gave another plaintive bleat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose we have any mint jelly?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t eat it,\u201d Bram said. \u201cThe beast belongs to some crofter hereabouts, and whoever he is will be missing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crofter will never know.\u201d A wolfish smile spread across his cousin\u2019s face as he reached to pat the lamb\u2019s woolly flank. \u201cWe\u2019ll destroy the evidence.\u201d</p><p>Bram shook his head. \u201cNot going to happen. Give up your lamb chop fantasies. His home can\u2019t be far. We\u2019ll find it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we do have to eat something tonight, and I don\u2019t see a ready alternative.\u201d</p><p>Thorne strode toward the fire, carrying a brace of hares, already split and gutted. \u201cThere\u2019s your alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get those?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>\u201cOn the heath.\u201d Crouching on the ground, Thorne drew a knife from his boot and began skinning the animals with ruthless efficiency. The rich smell of blood soon mingled with smoke and ash.</p><p>Colin stared at the officer. \u201cThorne, you scare me. I\u2019m not ashamed to say it.\u201d</p><p>Bram said, \u201cYou\u2019ll learn to appreciate him. Thorne always comes up with a meal. We had the best-stocked officers\u2019 mess on the Peninsula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least that satisfies one type of hunger,\u201d Colin said. \u201cNow, for the other. I\u2019ve an insatiable craving for female companionship that must be addressed. I don\u2019t sleep alone.\u201d He looked from Bram to Thorne. \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve just returned from years on the Peninsula. I\u2019d think you two would be positively salivating.\u201d</p><p>Thorne made a gruff sound. \u201cThere\u2019s women in Portugal and Spain.\u201d He set aside one skinned carcass and reached for the other hare. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve already found one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Colin sputtered. \u201cWho? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe widow what sold us eggs at the last turnpike. She\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>Colin looked to Bram, as if to say, Am I to believe this?</p><p>Bram shrugged. Thorne was nothing if not resourceful. At every place of encampment, he\u2019d always ferreted out the local game and found a local woman. He hadn\u2019t seemed particularly attached to any of them. Or perhaps the women simply didn\u2019t attach themselves to Thorne.</p><p>Attachments were Bram\u2019s problem. He was an officer, a gentleman of wealth, and, all things being equal, he preferred to converse with a woman before tupping her senseless. Taken together, these qualities seemed to encourage a woman\u2019s attachment, and romantic entanglements were the one thing he couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>Colin straightened, obviously piqued. \u201cNow wait just a minute. I will happily be outdone when it comes to hunting game, but I will not be . . . outgamed, where the fairer sex is concerned. You couldn\u2019t know it, Thorne, but my reputation is legendary. Legendary. Give me one day down in the village. I don\u2019t care if they are ape-leading spinsters. I\u2019ll be under skirts in this neighborhood long before you are, and far more often.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeep your pegos buttoned, both of you.\u201d Bram gave the sleeping lamb at his knee a sullen nudge. \u201cThe only way we\u2019ll accomplish our task and be quit of this place is if the local men cooperate. And the local men won\u2019t be eager to cooperate if we\u2019re seducing their sisters and daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat precisely are you saying, Bram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, no women. Not so long as we\u2019re encamped here.\u201d He cast a glance at Thorne. \u201cThat\u2019s an order.\u201d</p> <p>The lieutenant made no reply, save to skewer the two skinned hares on a sharpened branch.</p><p>\u201cSince when do I take orders from you?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>Bram leveled a gaze at him. \u201cSince my father died, and I came back from the Peninsula to find you stickpin-deep in debt, that\u2019s when. I don\u2019t relish the duty, but I hold your fortune in trust for the next several months. So long as I\u2019m paying your bills, you\u2019ll do as I say. Unless you get married, in which case you\u2019d spare us both the better part of a year\u2019s aggravation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Marriage being a fine way for a man to spare himself aggravation.\u201d Colin shoved to his feet and stalked away, into the shadows.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Bram called. Colin was welcome to have his adolescent sulk, but he should take care. They hadn\u2019t checked the soundness of the entire castle, and there were those steep bluffs nearby . . .</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have a piss, dear cousin. Or did you want me to keep my pego buttoned for that, too?\u201d</p><p>Bram wasn\u2019t any happier than Colin about this arrangement. It seemed ridiculous that a man of six-and-twenty, a viscount since his tender years, should even require a trustee. But the terms of his inheritance\u2014meant to encourage the timely production of a legitimate heir\u2014clearly stipulated that the Payne fortune was held in trust until Colin either married or turned twenty-seven.</p><p>And so long as Colin was his responsibility, Bram knew of no better way to handle the situation than to make his cousin a soldier. He\u2019d taken far less promising fellows and drilled a sense of discipline and duty into them. Deserters, debtors, hardened criminals . . . the man seated across the fire, for one. If Samuel Thorne had made good, any man had hope.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll start recruiting volunteers,\u201d he told his corporal.</p><p>Thorne nodded, turning the roasting hares on the spit.</p><p>\u201cThe village seems the likely place to begin.\u201d</p> <p>Another barely perceptible nod.</p><p>\u201cSheepdogs,\u201d Thorne mused sometime later. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll find a few. They\u2019d come in useful. Then again, hounds are better for game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dogs,\u201d Bram said. He wasn\u2019t one for pets. \u201cWe\u2019ll only be here a month.\u201d</p><p>A rustling sound in the shadows had them both turning their heads. A bat, perhaps. Or maybe a snake. Then again, he supposed it was just as likely a rat.</p><p>\u201cWhat we need in this place,\u201d Thorne said, \u201cis a cat.\u201d</p><p>Bram scowled. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I am not acquiring a cat.\u201d</p><p>Thorne looked to the woolly beast at his knee and cocked a brow. \u201cYou seem to have acquired a lamb, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lamb goes home tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>In a village of women, secrets had shorter life expectancies than gnats. The moment she opened the door of Bright\u2019s All Things the next morning, Susanna was inundated with queries and questions. She ought to have known she would be besieged. Young ladies crowded around her like hens after corn, pecking for bits of information.</p><p>\u201cIs it true, what we\u2019ve heard? What they\u2019re saying, is it true?\u201d Nineteen-year-old Sally, the second eldest of the Bright children, leaned eagerly over the counter.</p><p>\u201cThat would depend.\u201d Susanna lifted her hands to untie the ribbons of her bonnet. As she worked the knots loose, anticipation in the shop built to a palpable fever.</p><p>\u201cDepend on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn who \u2018they\u2019 are, and precisely what it is they\u2019re saying.\u201d She spoke calmly. Someone had to.</p><p>\u201cThey say we\u2019ve been invaded!\u201d Violet Winterbottom said. \u201cBy men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else would we be invaded by? Wolves?\u201d</p><p>Susanna looked about the shop, taking a moment to collect her thoughts and enjoy the familiar splendor. This sight never failed to enchant her. The first time she\u2019d entered Bright\u2019s All Things shop, she\u2019d felt as though she\u2019d stumbled upon Ali Baba\u2019s treasure cave.</p><p>The shop\u2019s front was lined with south-facing diamond-paned windows, which admitted an abundance of golden sunlight. Each of its other three walls was stacked, floor to lofty ceiling, with shelves\u2014and those shelves were crammed with colorful goods of every sort. Bolts of silk and lace, quills and bottles of ink, buttons and brilliants, charcoal and pigments, comfits and pickled limes, tooth powder, dusting powder, and much, much more\u2014all of it sparkling in the midday sun.</p><p>\u201cThe inn\u2019s scullery maid had it all from her brother.\u201d Sally\u2019s cheeks were pink with excitement. \u201cA band of officers have encamped on the bluffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true there\u2019s a lord in their party?\u201d Violet asked.</p><p>Susanna removed her bonnet and laid it aside. \u201cYes, some officers are temporarily encamped on the castle bluffs. And no, there is not a lord in the party.\u201d She paused. \u201cThere are two.\u201d</p><p>The squeal of excitement occasioned by this pronouncement quite pained her ears. She looked to Sally. \u201cCould you show me those two spools of lace again? The ones I looked at Thursday last? I couldn\u2019t decide between the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang the lace,\u201d Sally said. \u201cTell us more of these gentlemen. Cruel thing, you know we are dying of anticipation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch!\u201d A most unexpected woman pushed her way to the fore. \u201cMiss Finch, what is this I hear about lords?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Highwood?\u201d Susanna blinked at the lace-capped widow in disbelief. \u201cWhat are you still doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all here,\u201d Minerva called, standing behind her mother, arm-in-arm with Charlotte. From the counter, Diana gave a shy wave.</p><p>Somehow, Susanna had missed them in the initial crush. \u201cBut . . . But I saw your carriage leaving yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama sent it to fetch all our things,\u201d Charlotte said, bouncing on her toes. \u201cWe\u2019re to stay here in Spindle Cove for the summer! Isn\u2019t it marvelous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Susanna laughed with relief. \u201cYes, it is. I\u2019m so glad.\u201d</p><p>Even Mrs. Highwood smiled. \u201cI just knew it was the right decision. My friends always say my intuition is unparalleled. Why, just this morning two lords have arrived in the neighborhood. While we\u2019re here, Diana can get well and get married.\u201d</p><p>Hm. Susanna wasn\u2019t so sure about that.</p><p>\u201cNow tell us everything about them,\u201d Sally insisted.</p><p>\u201cThere truly is not much to tell. Three gentlemen arrived in the neighborhood yesterday afternoon. They include a Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell, a Corporal Thorne, and Bramwell\u2019s cousin, Lord Payne. For his service to the Crown, Bramwell has been granted the title Earl of Rycliff. The castle is his.\u201d She turned to Sally. \u201cMay I see the lace now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe castle is his?\u201d asked Violet. \u201cHow can that be? A man just marches into town, and suddenly a centuries-old castle is his for the asking?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Lange harrumphed. \u201cThat\u2019s a man for you. Always taking, never asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was awarded the earldom in recognition of his valor, apparently,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cHe\u2019s been tasked with raising a local militia and providing a review. The field day will take the place of our usual midsummer fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Charlotte cried. \u201cNo midsummer fair? But I was so looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dear. We all looked forward to it. But we\u2019ll find other ways to amuse ourselves this summer, never fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d Sally gave her a knowing look. \u201cCor. Two lords and an officer. No wonder you\u2019re taken with the lace this morning, Miss Finch. With the new gents in residence, all you ladies will want to look your best.\u201d</p><p>Several ladies pressed into a circle around her, investigating the wares with fresh interest.</p><p>Miss Kate Taylor didn\u2019t join them. Instead, she crossed the room to join Susanna. As Spindle Cove\u2019s music tutor, Kate was one of the rooming house\u2019s few year-round residents. She was also delightfully sensible, and among Susanna\u2019s closest friends.</p><p>\u201cYou look out of sorts,\u201d Kate said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d she lied. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked too hard to build this community, and our cause is too important. We won\u2019t let a few men divide us.\u201d</p><p>Kate looked around the room. \u201cIt seems to be starting already.\u201d</p><p>The group of young women had separated in two groups\u2014those eagerly absorbing Sally Bright\u2019s beautification advice huddled on the left. On the right, the remainder stood in a defensive knot, casting worried glances at their gloves and slippers.</p><p>She\u2019d feared precisely this reaction. A handful of the young ladies in Spindle Cove would fall victim to scarlet fever, eagerly chasing after the redcoats. The awkward, demure majority would crawl back into their protective shells, like hermit crabs.</p><p>\u201cDiana must have a new ribbon,\u201d Mrs. Highwood decided. \u201cCoral pink. She always looks her best in coral pink. And a deep green for Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for Miss Minerva?\u201d Sally asked.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood made a dismissive wave. \u201cNo ribbons for Minerva. She makes a knot of them, removing and donning those spectacles.\u201d</p><p>Susanna craned her neck for a glimpse of the bespectacled girl in question, anxious for her feelings. Fortunately, Minerva had migrated to the shop\u2019s rear corner, where she seemed to be examining some bottles of ink. The middle Highwood sister was not what one could call a conventional beauty, but a keen intellect lived behind those spectacles, and it didn\u2019t need a ribbon to adorn it.</p><p>\u201cHow do the men look?\u201d Young Charlotte turned to Susanna. \u201cAre they terribly handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has that to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood nodded sagely. \u201cCharlotte, Miss Finch is absolutely right. It makes no difference whether these lords are handsome. So long as they possess a good fortune. Looks fade; gold doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Highwood, the young ladies needn\u2019t concern themselves with the gentlemen\u2019s looks, fortunes, or favorite colors of ribbon. I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll be mingling socially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? But they must, surely. They can\u2019t stay all the way up there at that damp castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t stay far away enough for me,\u201d Susanna muttered. But no one heard her uncharacteristically uncharitable remark, because at that moment Finn and Rufus Bright appeared in the storeroom door.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d Finn shouted. \u201cWe spotted them just\u2014\u201d</p><p>His twin finished, \u201cJust down the lane. We\u2019re off to mind their horses.\u201d The two disappeared as quickly as they\u2019d come.</p><p>Education was anywhere a person sought it, Susanna believed. She learned something new every day. Today, she learned what it felt like to be at the center of a wildebeest stampede.</p><p>Every person in the shop thundered past her, pushing and pressing toward the diamond-paned windows for a look at the approaching men. She flattened herself against the door, holding her breath until the dust settled.</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d Sally said. \u201cThey are handsome as anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs. Highwood, apparently too overset for multisyllabic words. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see a thing,\u201d Charlotte whimpered, stamping her feet. \u201cMinerva, your elbow is in my ear.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susanna stood on tiptoe, stretching her neck for a glimpse. She didn\u2019t have to stretch far. There were times her freakish height came in handy.</p><p>There they were. All three of them, dismounting their horses on the village green. The Bright boys eagerly accepted the reins.</p><p>Pressed around her on all sides, the ladies cooed over Lord Payne\u2019s handsome features and debonair mien. Susanna couldn\u2019t spare the man a glance. Her attention was drawn immediately and unswervingly to the horrid Lord Rycliff, who was looking more dark and medieval than ever with his unshaven jaw and that impudently long hair tied in a thick queue at his nape. She couldn\u2019t stop looking at him. And she couldn\u2019t look at him without . . . feeling him. His solid warmth against her chest. His strong grip on her elbow. His hot kiss brushing over her lips.</p> <p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Kate whispered in her ear. \u201cThey are rather . . . manly, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Yes, Susanna thought. God help her, he was.</p><p>\u201cAnd that dark one is frightfully big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should feel him up close.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes went wide, and a startled laugh burst from her lips. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr . . . I said, you should see him up close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You didn\u2019t. You said I should feel him up close.\u201d Her hazel eyes lit with a mischievous twinkle.</p><p>Ears hot with embarrassment, Susanna fluttered a hand in weak defense. \u201cI\u2019m a healer. We assess with our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Kate turned back to the window.</p><p>Violet sighed loudly. \u201cI suppose this means we\u2019ll have to cancel our afternoon salon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Susanna countered. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to alter our plans. Most likely, the men won\u2019t trouble with us at all. But if the new Lord Rycliff and his party do see fit to take tea . . . We must do our best to welcome them.\u201d</p> <p>This statement was met with a flurry of enthusiasm and a cyclone of alarm. Objections rose up all around her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch, they won\u2019t understand. They\u2019ll mock us, just like the gentlemen in Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo think, playing for an earl? I haven\u2019t anything fine enough to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall die of mortification. Positively die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies.\u201d Susanna lifted her voice. \u201cThere is no cause for concern. We will go on as we always do. In a month\u2019s time, this militia business will be over and these men will have gone. Nothing in Spindle Cove will be the different for their visit.\u201d</p><p>For her friends\u2019 sake, she must maintain a brave front in the face of this invasion. But she knew, staring through the small window in the door, that her words were false. It was too late. Things were already changing in Spindle Cove.</p><p>Something had altered in her.</p><p>After dismounting from his gelding, Bram straightened his coat and had a look about the place. \u201cA fair enough village,\u201d he mused. \u201cRather charming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Colin said, adding a petulant curse.</p><p>The green was expansive, dotted with shade trees. Across the lane sat a neat row of buildings. He took the largest to be the inn. Narrow dirt lanes lined with cottages curved out from the village\u2019s center, following the contours of the valley. Toward the cove side of the village, he spied a cluster of humble cottages. Fishermen\u2019s abodes, no doubt. And in the center of the green loomed the church\u2014a soaring cathedral, remarkably grand for a village of this size. He supposed it was a remnant of that medieval port city Sir Lewis had mentioned.</p><p>\u201cThis place is clean,\u201d Colin said carefully. \u201cToo clean. And too quiet. It\u2019s unnatural. It\u2019s giving me the shudders.\u201d</p><p>Bram had to admit, the village was oddly immaculate and eerily empty of people. Each cobble sparkled in the street. The dirt lanes were swept clean of debris. Every shop front and cottage boasted neat window boxes overflowing with red geraniums.</p><p>A pair of lads rushed toward them. \u201cCan we help with the horses, Lord Rycliff?\u201d</p><p>Lord Rycliff? So, they knew him already. News traveled fast in a small village, he supposed.</p><p>Bram handed his reins to one of two eager, towheaded youths. \u201cWhat are your names, lads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRufus Bright,\u201d the one on the left said. \u201cAnd this is Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re twins,\u201d Finn offered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d The Brights. A suitable name, what with those incandescent shocks of hair\u2014so blond as to be nearly white. \u201cSee?\u201d he said to Colin. \u201cI told you the place couldn\u2019t be devoid of men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not men,\u201d Colin replied. \u201cThey\u2019re boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t germinate from the soil. If there are children, there must be men. What\u2019s more, men whose pegos aren\u2019t withered to twigs.\u201d He beckoned one of the youths. \u201cIs your father about?\u201d</p><p>A shock of lightning hair swiveled in the negative. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . uh, not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you expect him back?\u201d</p><p>The twins looked to each other, exchanging wary glances.</p><p>Finally, Rufus said, \u201cCan\u2019t say, my lord. Errol\u2014that\u2019s our older brother\u2014he travels to and fro, bringing in wares for the shop. We own the All Things, across the way. As for Father . . . he hasn\u2019t been around for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time was almost two years ago,\u201d Finn said. \u201cCame around just long enough to get another babe on Mum and dole out his knocks to the rest of us. He\u2019s fonder of his drink than his brats.\u201d</p><p>Rufus elbowed his twin. \u201cThat\u2019ll be enough airing of family business, then. What are you going to reveal next? The patches in your smallclothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked about our father. I told him the truth.\u201d</p><p>The truth was a damned shame. Not only because these boys had an absent sot for a father, but because Bram could have used a sober Mr. Bright in his militia. He sized up the twins before him. Fourteen, perhaps fifteen at the outside. A shade too young to be of any real use.</p><p>\u201cCan you point us toward the smithy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHas your horse thrown a shoe, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I have other work for him.\u201d He needed to find the strongest, most capable men in the neighborhood. The smithy was as likely a place as any to start.</p><p>As the morning wore on, Bram began to comprehend why this Mr. Bright would have taken to drink.</p><p>This was supposed to be a simple task. As a lieutenant colonel, he\u2019d been responsible for a thousand infantrymen. Here, he required only four-and-twenty men to form a volunteer force. After an hour spent scouring the village, he\u2019d rounded up fewer likely prospects than he could count on one hand. Perhaps fewer than he could count on one thumb.</p><p>Discovering the absence of Mr. Bright was only the first disappointment, followed close on its heels by his visit to the smithy. The blacksmith, Aaron Dawes, was a strapping, solid fellow, as smiths usually were\u2014and by appearances alone, Bram would have marked him an excellent candidate. What gave him pause, however, was entering the forge to find the man not shoeing an ox or hammering out an axe blade, but meticulously fashioning the hinge on a dainty locket.</p><p>Then there was the vicar. Bram had thought it prudent to stop in at the church and introduce himself. He hoped he could explain his military mission and have the clergyman\u2019s cooperation in recruiting local men. The vicar, one Mr. Keane, was young and clever enough from the looks of him\u2014but all the excitable fellow could speak about was some Ladies\u2019 Auxiliary and new crewelwork cushions for the pews.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d Colin said, as they left their discouraging interview with Keane.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of vicar wears a pink waistcoat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne in Spindle Cove. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been telling you, Bram. Shriveled twigs. Dried currants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other men. Real men. Somewhere.\u201d</p><p>There had to be others. The fishermen were all out to sea, of course, so the row of a half-dozen hovels and net huts by the cove had been emptied of men for the day. Surely there must be farmers out in the surrounding countryside. But they\u2019d likely traveled to the nearest market town, this being Saturday.</p><p>For the time being, Bram supposed there was only one likely location to round up men. The long-favored haunt of army recruiters and navy press gangs alike.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head for the tavern,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a steak,\u201d Thorne said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I need a wench,\u201d Colin put in. \u201cDon\u2019t they have those in little seaside villages? Tavern wenches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must be the place.\u201d He headed across the green, toward a cheerful-looking establishment with a traditional tavern sign hanging above its entry. Thank God. This was almost as good as a homecoming. Proper English pubs, at least, with their sticky floorboards and dark, dank corners, were the true province of men.</p><p>Bram slowed as they approached the entrance. On closer inspection, this didn\u2019t look like any tavern he\u2019d ever seen. There were lace curtains in the window. The delicate strains of pianoforte music wafted out to him. And the sign hanging above the door read . . .</p><p>\u201cTell me that doesn\u2019t say what I think it says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Blushing Pansy,\u201d his cousin read aloud, in a tone of abject horror. \u201cTea shop and confectionery.\u201d</p><p>Bram swore. This was going to be ugly.</p><p>Correct that. As he opened the establishment\u2019s red-painted door, he realized this scene was not going to be ugly at all. It was going to be pretty, beyond all limits of masculine tolerance.</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cSorry, cousin.\u201d Colin clapped a hand on Bram\u2019s shoulder as they entered the establishment. \u201cI know you hate it when I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>Bram surveyed the scene. No sticky floorboards. No dark, dank corners. No men.</p><p>What he found were several tables draped in white damask. Atop each surface sat a crockery vase of fresh wildflower blooms. And seated around each table were a handful of young ladies. Together, they must have numbered nearly a score. Befrocked, beribboned, and in some cases, bespectacled. To a one, bemused by the men\u2019s appearance.</p><p>The pianoforte music died a quick, mournful death. Then, as if on cue, the girls turned in unison to the center of the room, obviously looking to their leader for guidance.</p><p>Miss Susanna Finch.</p><p>Good God. Miss Finch was the spinster hive\u2019s queen bee? Her molten-bronze hair was a flash of wild beauty in the room\u2019s bland prettiness. And her scattered freckles did not fall in line with the otherwise ordered calm. Despite all his intentions to remain indifferent, Bram felt his blood heating to a quick, rebellious simmer.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Lord Rycliff. Lord Payne. Corporal Thorne. What a surprise.\u201d She rose from her chair and dipped in a curtsy. \u201cWon\u2019t you join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on. Let\u2019s at least eat,\u201d Colin muttered. \u201cWhere two or more ladies are gathered, there will be food. I\u2019m fairly certain that\u2019s in the Scriptures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo have a seat.\u201d Miss Finch waved them toward some vacant chairs at a table near the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the infantryman.\u201d Colin nudged him forward. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>Bram eased and edged his way to an empty chair, dodging low ceiling beams as he went, feeling like the proverbial bull in the china shop. All around him, fragile females held highly breakable cups in their delicate grips. They followed him with saucer-wide eyes set in porcelain complexions. Bram suspected that with one sudden movement, he could shatter the whole scene.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch you some refreshments,\u201d she said.</p><p>Oh no. She wasn\u2019t leaving him alone with all this daintiness. He pulled the chair out, then held it for her. \u201cMy cousin will do it. Have a seat, Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed her features as she accepted. Bram took the adjacent chair for himself. Between the morning\u2019s observations and Colin\u2019s dire warnings . . . he knew something very strange was going on in this village. And whatever it was, Miss Finch would sit down and explain it to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, once she did sit next to him, he found his powers of concentration immediately diminished. The dwarfish size of the table forced them so close, her shoulder rubbed his arm. From there, it was all too easy to imagine sweeter sources of friction. To recall the feel of her body under his.</p><p>The music resumed. A cup of tea appeared on the table.</p><p>She leaned close, bathing him in her hothouse scent. In a hushed murmur, she asked, \u201cMilk or sugar?\u201d</p> <p>Bloody hell. She was offering him tea. His body responded as if she\u2019d stood naked before him, balancing cream jug in one hand and sugar bowl in the other, asking him which substance he\u2019d rather lick from her bare skin.</p><p>Both. Both, please.</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d Bracing himself against temptation, Bram removed the flask from his breast pocket and added a generous splash of whiskey to the steaming cup. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our weekly salon. As I told you yesterday, here in Spindle Cove we ladies have a schedule. Monday, country walks. Tuesday, sea bathing. We spend Wednesdays in the garden, and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he said, scratching his unshaven jaw. \u201cI recall the schedule. On Thursday, I hope you foster orphaned lambs.\u201d</p> <p>She went on, unruffled. \u201cAside from our group activities, each lady pursues her own interests. Art, music, science, poetry. On Saturdays, we celebrate our individual accomplishments. These salons help the young ladies develop their confidence before they return to wider society.\u201d</p><p>Bram couldn\u2019t imagine why the lady currently playing the pianoforte would ever lack for confidence in society. He had little musical ability himself, but he knew true talent when he heard it. This young woman coaxed sounds from the instrument he hadn\u2019t known a pianoforte could make\u2014cascades of laughter and plaintive, heartfelt sighs. And the girl was pretty, too. Watching her in profile, he observed thick chestnut hair and delicate features. She wasn\u2019t Bram\u2019s usual sort, but she possessed the kind of beauty with which a man could pose no argument.</p><p>And while the girl played, Bram nearly managed to stop lusting after Susanna Finch. Nothing short of musical genius could accomplish that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Miss Taylor,\u201d she whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s our music tutor.\u201d</p><p>Colin arrived, plunking a serving plate in the center of the table and helpfully dispelling the tension. \u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cFood.\u201d</p><p>Bram eyed the refreshments. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>The plate was lined with rows of tiny pastries and bite-sized cakes, each iced in a different pastel shade. Little piped rosettes and sugar pearls topped the dainty morsels.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t food.\u201d Bram picked up a lavender-iced cake between thumb and finger and stared at it. \u201cThis is . . . edible ornamentation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s edible. That\u2019s all I care about.\u201d Colin shoved a bit of seedcake into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, these lavender ones are Mr. Fosbury\u2019s specialty.\u201d She nodded toward the cake in Bram\u2019s hand and selected an identical morsel for herself. \u201cThey\u2019re filled with his own currant jelly. Divine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Mr. Fosbury made these?\u201d Bram lifted the lavender cake.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. He\u2019s owned this place for a generation. It used to be a tavern.\u201d</p><p>So, this place used to be a tavern. With pints of proper ale, one would assume. And kidney pie. Steaks so rare, a man could still hear the cow lowing. Bram\u2019s stomach gave a despairing rumble.</p><p>\u201cWhy would a tavern keeper turn to baking teacakes?\u201d He cast a look about the place, so cheerily furnished and refined. In the window, lace curtains fluttered gaily, mocking him and his lavender-iced petit four.</p> <p>\u201cThings change. Once the inn became a ladies\u2019 retreat, an alteration of business strategy only made sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. So this place isn\u2019t a tavern any longer. It\u2019s a tea shop. Instead of real, hearty food we have this assortment of pastel absurdity. You\u2019ve reduced a hardworking, decent man to piping rosettes to earn his keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. We haven\u2019t \u2018reduced\u2019 Mr. Fosbury to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the devil you haven\u2019t. You\u2019ve . . . shriveled the man to currants.\u201d Bram threw away the cake in disgust, looking for somewhere to wipe the lavender icing from his fingers. In the end, he smeared violet streaks on the damask tablecloth, enjoying Miss Finch\u2019s gasp of dismay.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rather medieval view,\u201d she said, obviously affronted. \u201cHere in Spindle Cove, we live in modern times. Why shouldn\u2019t a man make currant jam or pretty lockets, if such things please him? Why shouldn\u2019t a lady pursue geology or medicine, if she takes an interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women aren\u2019t my concern.\u201d Bram looked around the place. \u201cSo where do all these \u2018modern\u2019 men congregate of an evening, since they\u2019re deprived of a tavern?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThey go home, I suppose. What few remain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFleeing the village, are they? Not hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome joined the army or navy. Others left to seek work in larger towns. There simply aren\u2019t that many men in Spindle Cove.\u201d Her clear blue gaze met his. \u201cI realize this makes your task more difficult, but to be perfectly frank . . . We have not felt it as a deprivation.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of tea. He was surprised she could manage it through that coy little grin.</p><p>As she lowered the cup, her eyebrows arched. \u201cI know what you\u2019re wanting, Lord Rycliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I highly doubt that.\u201d Her imagination couldn\u2019t possibly be so vivid.</p><p>She reached for another cake, balancing it between her thumb and forefinger. \u201cYou\u2019d prefer we offer you a great, bloody slab of meat. Something you can pierce with your fork. Stab with your knife. Conquer, in brutish fashion. A man looks on his food as a conquest. But to a woman, it\u2019s rebellion. We are all ladies here, and Spindle Cove is our place to taste freedom, in small, sweet bites.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the iced morsel to her lips and took an arousing, unrepentant mouthful. Her nimble tongue darted out to rescue a stray bit of jam. She gave a little sigh of pleasure, and he nearly groaned aloud.</p><p>Bram forced his attention away, seeking refuge in the talented Miss Taylor\u2019s performance. She\u2019d cast such a spell over the assembly, a goodly pause elapsed between the final strains of music and the first claps of enthusiastic applause. Bram clapped along with the rest. The only soul in the tavern not applauding was Thorne. But then, did Thorne count as a soul? The corporal stood impassive by the door, arms folded over his chest. Bram supposed that for Thorne, clapping strayed too close to emotional display . . . along with dancing, laughter, and any facial expression more communicative than a blink. The man was a damned rock. No, not merely a rock. A rock encased in iron. Then, for good measure, glazed with ice.</p><p>Therefore, Bram knew something truly shocking had occurred when he saw his corporal startle. No one else in the room would have noticed it\u2014just a subtle tensing of the shoulders and a quick, fierce swallow. But for Thorne, this reaction might as well have been a bloodcurdling shriek.</p><p>Bram turned to see what had so taken his friend aback. Miss Taylor had risen from the pianoforte bench, smiling and dropping a gracious curtsy before returning to her seat. Now he was able to see what he couldn\u2019t have noticed, viewing her in profile. The other side of Miss Taylor\u2019s, fair, delicate face was marred by a port-wine birthmark. The heart-shaped splash of red pigment obscured a good portion of her right temple, before disappearing into her hairline.</p><p>A pity, that. Such a pretty girl.</p><p>As if reading his thoughts, Miss Finch gave him a pointed look. \u201cMiss Taylor is one of my dearest friends. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know a kinder person, or one more beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her voice had honed to a blade-sharp edge, and she wielded it with precise intent.</p><p>Don\u2019t hurt my friend, it said.</p><p>Ah. So this explained matters. The strange state of affairs in this village, her resistance to the militia. Miss Finch styled herself the protector of this queer little clutch of female oddities. And in her eyes, that made Bram\u2014or any red-blooded man, apparently\u2014the enemy.</p><p>Interesting. Bram could respect her intent, even admire it. No doubt she fancied herself quite the problem solver. But her arithmetic needed fundamental correction. Men couldn\u2019t simply be removed from the equation. Protecting this place was a man\u2019s duty\u2014Bram\u2019s duty, to be specific. And her brood of odd ducks complicated things.</p><p>Speaking of odd, a bespectacled young woman replaced Miss Taylor at the center of attention. This girl did not sit down to the pianoforte, or produce any musical instrument. Rather, she held a box of curiosities that she began circulating among the other ladies, whose lack of interest was plain. Bram tilted his head. From his view these treasures looked to be . . . lumps of earth. That would explain the general bemusement.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is that girl doing?\u201d Colin murmured around his third bite of seedcake. \u201cShe seems to be giving a lecture on dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Minerva Highwood.\u201d That blade-sharp tone again. \u201cShe\u2019s a geologist.\u201d</p><p>Colin made an amused sound. \u201cExplains the six inches of mud at her hem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here for the summer with her mother and two sisters, Miss Diana and Miss Charlotte.\u201d Miss Finch indicated a group of fair-haired women at a nearby table.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Colin murmured. \u201cNow they are interesting.\u201d</p><p>Another young lady rose to take her turn at the pianoforte. Colin drifted away from the table, taking the newly vacated seat\u2014which just happened to be near Diana Highwood.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Miss Finch said. \u201cMiss Highwood is convalescing. Surely your cousin doesn\u2019t mean to pursue\u2014\u201d She began to rise from her chair.</p><p>There she went, protecting again. He stayed her with a hand. \u201cNever mind him. I\u2019ll manage my cousin. We\u2019re talking now. You and me.\u201d</p><p>As she sank back into her chair, he kicked the chair leg, turning it so that she\u2019d be forced to face him. She glanced at his hand where he touched her gloved wrist. Just to vex them both, he kept it there. Satin heated beneath his fingertips. The row of buttons tempted.</p><p>Hell, everything about her tempted.</p><p>With effort, he let her go. \u201cLet me be certain I understand you, Miss Finch. You\u2019ve amassed a colony of unwed women, then driven away or gelded every red-blooded male in Spindle Cove. And yet you feel no deprivation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever. In fact, I believe our situation to be ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize, that sounds very . . .\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head in empathy. \u201cThreatening? I do understand how a man could perceive it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say, Sapphic.\u201d</p><p>Those lush, currant-stained lips parted in surprise.</p><p>Good. He was beginning to wonder what it would take to get under her skin. And by tugging that chain of inquiry, he was dredging up far too many images of her skin. The softness of it, the heat . . . those delectable freckles, sprinkled like spice.</p><p>\u201cHave I shocked you, Miss Finch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must own, you have. Not with your insinuations of romantic love between women, mind. But I would never have supposed you to be so versed in ancient Greek poetry. That is a shock indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I attended Cambridge for three terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d She stared at him in mock astonishment. \u201cThree whole terms? Now that is impressive.\u201d Her voice was a low, seductive drawl that raised every last hair on his forearm.</p><p>At some point in this conversation, she\u2019d ceased arguing with him and begun flirting with him. He doubted she even realized it\u2014any more than she\u2019d realized the danger yesterday, when her tattered frock had been one angry huff away from exposing her pale, supple breast. She lacked the experience to grasp the subtle distinction between antagonism and getting on very well indeed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So Bram went perfectly still and held her gaze. Stared deeply, directly into her eyes until he made her aware of it, too\u2014this scorching-hot cinder of attraction they juggled back and forth between them.</p><p>The air went warm with her effort not to breathe, and her gaze dipped\u2014ever so briefly\u2014to his mouth. The fleeting ghost of a kiss.</p><p>Oh yes, he told her with a subtle lift of his brow. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here.</p> <p>She swallowed hard. But she didn\u2019t turn away.</p><p>Damn, they could be so good together. Just staring into her eyes, he saw it all. Those iris-hued irises held wit and passion, and . . . depths. Intriguing depths he very much wished to explore. A man could talk to a woman like this all night. At intervals, of course. There would need to be lengthy stretches of gasping and moaning, too.</p><p>She\u2019s Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s daughter, his conscience blared in his ear. The problem was, the rest of his body didn\u2019t bloody well care.</p><p>She cleared her throat, abruptly breaking the spell she\u2019d cast on him. \u201cMrs. Lange, won\u2019t you favor us with a poem?\u201d</p><p>Bram sat back in his chair. A slender, dark-haired young woman ascended to the dais, clutching a paper. She appeared meek and shrinking.</p> <p>Until she opened her mouth, that was.</p><p>\u201cO, vile betrayer! O, defiler of vows!\u201d</p><p>Well. Now she had the room\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cHear my rage, like distant thunder. My heart, the beast doth ripped asunder. My cove, the wretched brute did plunder\u2014though not thoroughly.\u201d She glanced up from her paper. \u201cSmall wonder.\u201d</p><p>Miss Finch leaned toward him and whispered, \u201cMrs. Lange is estranged from her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d he murmured back. He lifted his hands, readying some polite applause.</p> <p>But the poem didn\u2019t stop there. Oh no. It went on.</p><p>For several minutes.</p><p>There were many, many verses of epic infamy to be chronicled, it would seem. And the longer the woman read aloud, the higher her voice pitched. Her hands even began to shake.</p><p>\u201cAll my trust he did betray, when to another he fain would stray. That cruel deed I did repay. With the help of a bronze tea tray. His blood had the temerity . . . to stain the drapes of dimity.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cI recall it well, that rusty stain. It is my promise. Never . . . never . . . never\u2014\u201d</p><p>The room held its breath.</p><p>\u201c\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cBrava!\u201d Colin shot to his feet, applauding wildly. \u201cWell done, indeed. Let\u2019s have another.\u201d</p> <p>Out of the corner of his eye, Bram saw Miss Finch\u2019s soft, lush lips twitching at the corners. She was struggling, mightily, not to laugh. And Bram was struggling, mightily, not to cover that mouth with his. To taste the sweetness of her laughter, the tart bite of her clever wit. To claim her, the way she needed to be claimed. In thorough, beastly, medieval fashion.</p><p>His only course of action was clear.</p><p>He pushed back from the table, screeching the chair legs against the floorboards. As every woman in the place turned to him in mute horror, he rose to his feet and muttered gruffly, \u201cAfternoon.\u201d</p><p>Then he walked straight out the door.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Susanna followed him.</p><p>Before she even knew what she was doing, she\u2019d launched from her chair, swept out the door, and followed the impossible man into the lane. To be sure, she wanted him gone. But she couldn\u2019t allow him to leave like that.</p><p>\u201cThat was rather abrupt.\u201d Lifting her skirts, she hurried after him as he moved to reclaim his horse. \u201cThe young ladies were anxious, but they made every effort to welcome you. You might have at least taken proper leave.\u201d</p><p>For that matter, he might have accepted a dratted lavender teacake, or dinner last night at Summerfield. He might have refrained from needling her until she blushed and girlishly fidgeted with her hair, in front of all her prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. He might have taken the trouble to shave.</p><p>What was wrong with this man, that he couldn\u2019t comport himself in polite society? His cousin was a viscount. Surely he\u2019d been raised a gentleman, too.</p><p>She caught up to him on the green, only mildly winded. \u201cSpindle Cove is a holiday village, Lord Rycliff. Visitors journey great distances to enjoy fine, sunny weather and a restorative atmosphere. If you take a deep breath and a good look around you, perhaps you\u2019ll find the place doing you some good. Because forgive me for saying it, but the presence of a dour, brooding lordship doesn\u2019t fit with the advertising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d imagine it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Rycliff took his horse\u2019s reins from Rufus Bright. He nodded toward the Blushing Pansy. \u201cI didn\u2019t belong in that place. I knew it well. The question is, Miss Finch . . . what are you doing in this village?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to explain it to you. We have a community of ladies here in Spindle Cove, and we support one another with friendship, intellectual stimulation, and healthful living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I can see how this might appeal to a mousy, awkward chit with no prospects for something better. But what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Perplexed, she turned her gloved hands palms-up. \u201cLiving happily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he said, giving her a skeptical look. Even his horse snorted in seeming disbelief. \u201cA woman like you.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. Just what kind of woman did he think she was?</p><p>\u201cIf you think yourself content with no man in your life, Miss Finch, that only proves one thing.\u201d In a swift motion, he pulled himself into the saddle. His next words were spoken down at her, making her feel small and patronized. \u201cYou\u2019ve been meeting all the wrong men.\u201d</p><p>He nudged his gelding into a canter and rode away, leaving her affronted and sputtering. She whirled on her heel, only to come nose-to-epaulet with Corporal Thorne.</p><p>She swallowed hard. From across a room, Thorne was an intimidating presence. Up close, he was terrifying. But Susanna\u2019s anger and curiosity were too greatly piqued. Together, they overrode all sense of etiquette or caution.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with that man?\u201d she asked the corporal.</p><p>His eyes hardened.</p><p>\u201cThat man.\u201d She gestured down the lane. \u201cRycliff. Bramwell. Your superior.\u201d</p><p>His jaw hardened.</p><p>\u201cYou must know him quite well. You\u2019ve probably worked alongside him for several years, his closest confidant. Tell me, then. Did it start in childhood? Was he neglected by his parents, mistreated by a governess? Locked away in an attic?\u201d</p><p>Now the man\u2019s entire face turned to stone. A stone etched with unfriendly frown lines and a ruthless slash where the mouth should be.</p><p>\u201cOr was it the war? He\u2019s haunted by memories of battle, perhaps. Was his regiment ambushed, at great loss of life? Was he captured and held prisoner behind enemy lines? I do hope he has some excuse.\u201d</p><p>She waited, watched. The corporal\u2019s face surrendered no clues whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cHe has a paralyzing fear of tea,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cOr enclosed spaces. Spiders, that\u2019s my final guess. Blink once for yes, twice for no.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t blink at all.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said, exasperated. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to drag it from him myself.\u201d</p><p>Some thirty huffing, panting minutes later, Susanna reached the top of the bluffs and the perimeter of Rycliff Castle. Naturally Lord Rycliff had arrived well ahead of her. She found his mount already unsaddled and grazing in the bailey.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff?\u201d she called. Her shout echoed off the stones.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She tried again, cupping her hands around her mouth. \u201cLord Rycliff, may I have a word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one, Miss Finch?\u201d The faint answer came from the direction of the keep. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be that lucky.\u201d</p><p>She advanced toward the collection of stone towers, training her ears for his voice. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe armory.\u201d</p><p>The armory?</p><p>Following the sound of his reply, she made for the keep\u2019s arched entryway. Once inside, Susanna turned left and entered the hollow stone turret on the northeast corner. Now the armory, it would seem. She supposed it did make a suitable place to store powder and weaponry. Cool, dark, enclosed by stone. The crunch of dry gravel beneath her feet indicated the tower\u2019s roof was sufficiently intact to keep out the rain.</p><p>She stood in the entry, waiting for her eyes to adjust to the dim light. Slowly, the scene came into focus, and as it did, her heart sank.</p><p>She\u2019d been half hoping\u2014fully hoping, she supposed\u2014that he would take this militia task lightly, limit his efforts to the bare minimum. The occasion required only a bit of show, she\u2019d reasoned. Rycliff couldn\u2019t earnestly mean to scrape together a true fighting force in Spindle Cove.</p><p>But looking on this scene, she couldn\u2019t deny the truth. The man was serious about this militia. This was a serious amount of weaponry.</p><p>A row of Brown Bess muskets lined one side of the tower. To the other direction, cannonballs and grapeshot were stacked. A few newly constructed shelves on the far side held kegs of powder. And by them, with his back to her, stood Lord Rycliff.</p><p>He\u2019d undressed on arrival and now wore only a loose shirt, breeches, and boots\u2014no coat or cravat. The pale linen gleamed in the dim light, stretching over the muscled contours of his arms and back. Susanna wasn\u2019t a doctor, but she knew human anatomy well enough. Well enough to recognize what an excellent specimen of it he was. Without the hindrance of a coat, for example, she could appreciate that his backside was particularly well formed. Tight and muscled and . . .</p><p>And a completely inappropriate object of her attention. What was happening to her? She pulled her gaze upward, allowing a moment to compose herself before she called his attention. His hair was a long, dark queue, bound with twine. Its end hung just between his shoulder blades, where it curled like a fishhook, baiting her.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff?\u201d she ventured. He did not turn. She took a deep breath and tried once again, putting some force into her voice. \u201cLord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re there, Miss Finch.\u201d His voice was quiet and controlled as he remained with his back to her, bending over something she could not see. \u201cHold your peace a moment. I\u2019m measuring powder.\u201d</p><p>Susanna took a step into the room.</p><p>\u201cThere now,\u201d he murmured, low and seductive. \u201cYes. That\u2019s the way.\u201d</p><p>Good heavens. The sultry rasp in his voice had persuasive force. It moved her center of balance, rocking her from her toes to her heels. She took a step in reverse, and her back met the wall of ancient stone. A cool ridge calmed the place between her shoulder blades.</p><p>Without turning, he said, \u201cWell, Miss Finch? What is it you\u2019re wanting?\u201d</p><p>What a dangerous question.</p><p>She realized she was still hugging the wall. Pride propelled her two steps forward. As she advanced, something bleated at her, as though chastising her for trespassing. She stopped midstep and peered at it. \u201cDid you know there\u2019s a lamb in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind it. That\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p><p>She gave it a smile and a friendly pat. \u201cHullo, Dinner. Aren\u2019t you a sweet thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his name, it\u2019s his . . . function.\u201d With an impatient oath, he turned, wiping his hands with a cloth. His palms were dusted with charcoal-colored powder, and his eyes, so dilated in the cool, dark stillness, glittered black as jet. \u201cIf there\u2019s something you mean to say, say it. Otherwise, be on your way.\u201d</p><p>She growled to herself. He was such a . . . Such a man. Crooning sweetly to his weaponry, then barking at her. As her father\u2019s daughter, Susanna understood that an ambitious man could seem married to his work. But this was ridiculous.</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cLord Rycliff, I have an interest in maintaining village harmony, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re not off to a neighborly start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet\u201d\u2014he crossed his arms over his chest\u2014\u201chere you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere I am. Because I won\u2019t be treated this way, do you see? And I won\u2019t let you terrorize my friends, either. Despite the awkwardness of our initial meeting, I have tried to be friendly. You, on the other hand, have been a perfect beast. The way you spoke to me last night. The way you behaved down in the tea shop. Even right now, this moment . . . I can tell by your gruff tone and that stern posture you mean to seem intimidating. But look.\u201d She gestured at the lamb. \u201cNot even Dinner is frightened. I\u2019m not, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re fools, the two of you. I could make a meal of you both.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, stepping toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I know you didn\u2019t expect to take up residence here, but people always come to Spindle Cove to get well. If I may say it, Lord Rycliff, I think you\u2019re hurting. You\u2019re like a great shaggy lion with a nettle in its paw. Once it\u2019s plucked, your good humor will be restored.\u201d</p> <p>A prolonged pause ensued.</p><p>One dark brow quirked. \u201cYou mean to pluck my nettle?\u201d</p><p>Flushing with heat, she bit her lip. \u201cNot in so many words.\u201d</p><p>With a hollow chuckle, he stepped back, pushing a hand through his hair. \u201cYou need to leave. We can\u2019t have this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it so very painful?\u201d she asked, in a quiet voice. \u201cAre you haunted by some tragedy? Did the ravages of war embitter you toward your fellow man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He wiped the powder measure clean and banged it on a shelf. \u201cAnd no, and no. The only thing paining me right now\u201d\u2014he turned\u2014\u201cis you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Her breath caught. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m not a nettle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. You\u2019re something far, far worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA burr?\u201d she said helpfully. \u201cA thistle perhaps? Roses have thorns, but I don\u2019t possess the right sort of beauty for that comparison.\u201d When he didn\u2019t laugh, she said, \u201cLord Rycliff, I fail to see how I\u2019m causing you any problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me explain for you, then.\u201d He spoke low and even. \u201cI ought to be headed for Spain right now, on the way to rejoin my regiment. Instead, I have an earldom I didn\u2019t ask for, a castle I don\u2019t want, and a cousin determined to drive me mad, insolvent, or both. But your father\u2019s given me a chance to move on, leave it all behind. The only thing I need do is gather two dozen local men\u2014equip them, arm them, and drill them into a respectable militia. Easy enough task, in a month\u2019s time. Almost insulting in its simplicity.\u201d He raised a single finger. \u201cBut there\u2019s a snag, isn\u2019t there? There are no local men. No real men, at any rate. Just spinsters and teacakes and poetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are men here. And if you need any help rounding them up, you only have to ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure.\u201d He chuckled. \u201c \u2018Ask Miss Finch.\u2019 Do you know how many times I heard those words this morning?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cMore than I care to count.\u201d He began circling her with slow, heavy steps. \u201cWhen I asked the Bright twins if there are seamstresses in the neighborhood, to sew uniforms . . . They said, \u2018Ask Miss Finch.\u2019 When I inquired with the smith where I might find stonemasons to do some work here at the castle . . . Well, Miss Finch would know that too. Ask her.\u201d He walked on. \u201cWhere do I find the parish register, for a list of all the local families? Well, your dandified vicar tells me, Miss Finch has been doing a study of the local birth records, and I will have to inquire with her. Ask. Miss. Finch. There\u2019s no escaping you. It\u2019s like you have the whole village playing some ceaseless round of Mother, May I.\u201d</p><p>Susanna squared her shoulders as he completed his circle and came to stand before her\u2014a fraction too close. The intensity in his eyes told her he meant to draw closer still.</p><p>No, you may not, she silently willed. You may not take two steps forward.</p><p>He took them anyway.</p><p>\u201cI try to be helpful,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. And it\u2019s natural the villagers show me a certain deference, out of respect for my father. He is the local gentleman of rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is the local gentleman of rank?\u201d He stood tall. \u201cWell, now. I happen to be the local lord.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, smiling with relief. \u201cNow I understand. Your pride is wounded. That\u2019s your problem. Yes, I can see how that would be disappointing, to be given the title and feel so little influence with the local residents. But with time, I\u2019m sure the villagers\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMy pride\u2019s not wounded, for God\u2019s sake. And no, I\u2019m not disappointed. Nor haunted, nor embittered, nor threatened. Stop trying to pin all these emotions on me like frilly pink ribbons. I\u2019m not one of your delicate spinsters, Miss Finch. This isn\u2019t about my tender feelings. I have things to accomplish, and you\u201d\u2014he poked a single finger into her shoulder\u2014\u201care hindering me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cyou are touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. And I didn\u2019t even ask. You see, I\u2019m not going to ask Miss Finch anything. I\u2019m going to tell her to stay far clear.\u201d The pressure of his fingertip bit into her shoulder. \u201cYou are my problem, Miss Finch. No, you\u2019re not a nettle, or a burr, or a delicate blossom of any kind. You\u2019re a goddamned powder keg, and every time I draw near you, we start throwing off sparks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, you do.\u201d He fingered the lacy edge of her cap sleeve, then slid a caress down her arm.</p><p>She was helpless to suppress a little shiver of pleasure.</p><p>He groaned deep in his chest. \u201cSee? You\u2019re full to bursting with passion. You may think you have it tightly capped and contained. Hidden from everyone, even yourself. Perhaps the pathetic souls who pass for men in that village are too cowed by your modern ideals to notice. But I only have to look at you, and I see it all. That core of dark, explosive potential, held together with just a bit of ribbon and lace.\u201d His voice deepened as his gaze wandered down her body. \u201cI\u2019m a damned fool to even be touching you, but I can\u2019t bring myself to stop.\u201d</p><p>His touch traced the edge of her elbow-length glove, skimming along the delicate border where satin met skin. Sensation rushed through her entire body, lifting the hairs on the back of her neck. She thought of those creases in his palms, still limned with gunpowder. So perilous. His caresses made her feel shaken, rearranged.</p><p>Just a little dirty.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d he said, keeping up his bold caress. \u201cThis is dangerous. You\u2019ll leave straightaway, if you know what\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>Leave? She couldn\u2019t move. Her body was so busy responding to his, it wouldn\u2019t spare a moment to heed her own commands. Her breath quickened. A strange ache grew in her breasts. Her heart thundered wildly, and a matching pulse beat at the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to change an unpleasant conversation. I said you\u2019re in pain, and I\u2019ve piqued your pride. Why own up to possessing feelings, when it\u2019s much more manly to be loutish and crude? If you\u2019re hoping to push me away, it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it?\u201d He propped a single finger under her chin. \u201cThis did the trick before.\u201d</p><p>He dipped his head, and his lips brushed hers.</p><p>Sparks. She could have sworn she saw them, swarming bright and orange. Pinprick heat branded her skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat of this?\u201d he asked. Another kiss. \u201cOr this, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved over hers, teasing her with a series of brief, bruising kisses. There was meaning behind those kisses, so commanding and firm. They were like little words in . . . in German, or Dutch. One of those languages she really ought to know, but had never taken the trouble to learn. And now she was left frustrated, uncertain how to respond. Were they accusations? Warnings? Desperate pleas for something more?</p><p>Whatever sort of argument they were having, she knew one thing.</p><p>She could not let him win.</p><p>She made herself tall, pressed back at his aggressive mouth with little kisses of her own. In both hands, she gathered great fistfuls of his warm lawn shirt, as if she could shake some sense into the impossible man. Or maybe just to keep from falling, as the dizzying sensations rocketed through her body. Exhilaration lifted her stomach and set her heart floating loose in her chest.</p><p>When the kisses ended, she met his gaze, rather proud of herself for not dissolving on the spot. Despite the complete upheaval of her senses, she tried to appear worldly and composed. As if this sort of thing happened to her regularly, in the course of normal interaction. As if she often stood toe-to-toe with an enormous, virile, unshaven man in a room full of explosives, feeling these lethal sparks of attraction fly around and between them. And her breasts were just always grazing against a hard wall of muscled chest, her nipples drawing to taut, needy peaks out of mundane habit. Completely expected, regularly scheduled arousal.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked. \u201cHave I made my point? Are you leaving now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to disappoint you,\u201d she said, breathing hard. \u201cBut it would take far more than that to scare me.\u201d</p><p>A quick flex of his arms, and their bodies collided. And he whispered, just as his mouth fell on hers, \u201cGod, I was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>This kiss could be the end, Bram knew. He was foolishly, thoroughly kissing Miss Susanna Finch, clutching her slender body to his while he reveled in the faint currant spice of her lips, and this could be the end of everything. The end of all his plans, his military career. Perhaps the end of him, full stop.</p><p>And if that was the case, and he\u2019d impulsively gambled his entire future on a forbidden kiss . . .</p><p>He might as well slow down and do the thing right.</p><p>He let his mouth linger over hers. She hadn\u2019t been kissed much. At least, not properly. He could tell in the way she was struggling to respond. She was unschooled, but she showed great natural aptitude.</p><p>He cradled her neck in one hand. \u201cSoftly, love. Let me show you.\u201d</p><p>He teased his lips over hers, brushing from bottom to top. Then again. And then once more, persuading her lips to part. She startled at the first touch of his tongue, but he held her tight until the instinct passed. And then he tasted her. The slow, sweet slide of his tongue against hers had him growling with satisfaction.</p><p>Yes, he told her without words. Yes. Again.</p><p>From their first meeting, he\u2019d suspected this woman to be a temptress in a teapot, and she was proving him right with every tentative stroke of her tongue against his. Her inexperience only made the whole business sweeter. The way she clutched his shirt, chased his teasing tongue, slid her gloved finger along the edge of his unshaven jaw . . . She was inventing these small intimacies as she went, acting out of pure, untutored desire. These weren\u2019t practiced motions, honed on other men.</p><p>They were only for him.</p><p>He deepened the kiss, keeping his rhythm steady and sure. Each time taking just a little more, delving just a fraction deeper. The same way he would make love to her.</p><p>No sooner had the thought surfaced in his mind, than he seized on it. He had to make love to her. Someday. Not today. Today, she was only learning to kiss. She wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>Bram, by contrast, was ready indeed. Ready, willing, and able. In a mindless, instinctive motion, he pulled her snug against his aching groin. If she could feel the abundant evidence of his arousal, she didn\u2019t shy away. Her breasts eased warm and soft against his chest as she leaned into the kiss.</p><p>Bending his head, he kissed her throat, her ear, losing himself in the scent of her. Her skin smelled of herbs, and she tasted . . . like a memory. A memory of a long-ago summer\u2019s day. Warm sun. Cool, crisp water. Tall grass and a gentle breeze. Everything good and real and fresh. Even her name was a whimsical song. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSusanna,\u201d he whispered against her ear.</p><p>She sighed in his arms, as though she loved the sound of her name on his lips.</p><p>So he said it again, murmuring that light, stubborn melody. \u201cSusanna. Susanna fair.\u201d He nuzzled her earlobe, then drew it between his lips, suckling the delicate bud. Her little gasp stoked his desire.</p> <p>She made him want so much. Too much. Damn, she made him yearn.</p><p>He kissed her again, taking time to savor each of her plump, lush lips before thrusting his tongue between them. This time, he delved deeper, took more. She made a mewling noise in the back of her throat, less a whimper than an erotic demand. There was urgency in her kiss now, and sweet frustration. He could taste how much she craved his touch, and the knowledge made him wild.</p><p>All this from a few simple kisses, with both of them fully clothed. Good Lord. He ran one hand down her arm and plucked at the topmost closure of her glove. They drove him mad with desire, these prim satin sheaths, with their endless stretches of buttons and arrow-straight seams. As matters stood, she could barely contain all that natural passion. What would happen when the gloves came off?</p><p>He loosed the top button with a flick of his thumb.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff,\u201d she said hoarsely.</p> <p>\u201cBram,\u201d he corrected, undoing another. \u201cAfter a kiss like that, you must call me Bram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBram, please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d He kissed her lips again, sliding his fingers beneath the unbuttoned satin.</p><p>Her hands slid to his chest, and she pushed, hard.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff. Please.\u201d</p><p>The desperate catch in her voice surprised him. He glanced down to find her wearing an expression of distress, her bottom lip quivering. Her eyes were downcast.</p> <p>Bram immediately found himself missing them. If he\u2019d spent so much time thinking of her eyes, it must be because in their every interaction, she\u2019d met his gaze directly. Unapologetic and undaunted. Until now.</p><p>Damn, and here he was certain she\u2019d been enjoying this. He wasn\u2019t the sort to press himself on an unwilling woman.</p><p>\u201cSusanna?\u201d He reached to capture her chin, tilt her face to his. Her gaze was wide and pleading in the dark, and his heart gave a strange kick. Within him, lust and honor warred. He wanted her, yes. But he wanted to protect her, too. He wondered briefly if that meant he was a hypocrite.</p><p>No, he decided. It just meant he was a man.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her lips parted, as though she would speak. Which would mean he needed to listen. He struggled to quell the bloodlust coursing through his veins, so he could make out her words over the mad pounding of his heart.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Her father.</p><p>His gut wrenched, and he released her at once. There it was, the instant cure for his lust. Somehow, for a solid, disastrous minute, he\u2019d managed to forget Sir Lewis Finch entirely. His late father\u2019s good friend. A national hero. The man who held Bram\u2019s fate in his hands. How could he have possibly forgotten?</p> <p>The answer was simple. Once he\u2019d made the decision to kiss Susanna, really kiss her . . . He simply hadn\u2019t possessed the space in his brain or his arms or his heart to hold anything but her.</p><p>That kiss had been all-consuming. And it could not, would not happen again.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she muttered, smoothing her upswept hair. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>She threw him a look, sharp as cut sapphires. \u201cOf course it won\u2019t. It can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stay far clear of me. Keep your distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, yes.\u201d Her words were a fevered rush. \u201cPlenty of distance. I\u2019ll stay far away from you. And you keep your men separate from my ladies, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly. It\u2019s a bargain, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her trembling fingers worked to refasten her gloves.</p><p>\u201cCan I help with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cDo you . . .\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cDo you plan to tell your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout this?\u201d She looked up at him, horrified. \u201cHeavens, no. Are you mad? He must never hear of this.\u201d</p><p>A wave of emotion pushed through him, gone before he could name it. Profound relief, he supposed. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you mentioned him. Earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d She frowned. \u201cI did. Don\u2019t speak to my father, that\u2019s what I meant to say. Not about today, not about anything. When he proposed this militia scheme, I thought it just a bit of show, but seeing all this . . .\u201d Her gaze turned to the rows of weaponry. \u201cPlease don\u2019t include him. He may want to be involved, but you mustn\u2019t allow it. He\u2019s aging, and his health isn\u2019t what it once was. I\u2019ve no right to demand anything of you, but I must ask this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to refuse. \u201cVery well. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have my thanks.\u201d</p><p>And that was all he had of her. For with those few words, she turned and fled.</p><p>That evening, as was the case most evenings, Susanna dined alone.</p><p>After dinner, she dressed for bed. Knowing she\u2019d never be able to sleep, she chose a book\u2014a weighty, soporific medical text. She tried to read, and failed miserably. After staring blankly at the same page for more than an hour, she rose from bed and made her way downstairs.</p><p>\u201cPapa? Are you still up working?\u201d</p><p>She folded an arm about her middle, wrapping her dressing gown close, and peered at the hallway clock by the light of her single candle. Already past midnight.</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d She hovered in the entrance of her father\u2019s workshop, situated on the ground floor of Summerfield. Until recent years, he\u2019d used an outbuilding as his dabbling space, but she\u2019d convinced him to move to the main house about the same time she\u2019d convinced him to give up the field tests. She liked keeping him close. When he was working, he often remained secluded for hours, even days at a time. At least in the house, she knew whether he was eating.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t eating. Not tonight, at least. His untouched dinner tray sat on a table by the door.</p><p>\u201cPapa. You know, you really must take some food. Genius cannot subsist on air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Susanna?\u201d His silver-tufted head lifted, but he did not turn his gaze. The room was lined with worktables of different sorts. A woodworking table with planes and a lathe; a station for soldering lead. Tonight, he sat at his drafting table, amid rolls of paper and discarded stubs of charcoal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He did not invite her in, and she knew better than to enter without an explicit invitation. It had always been this way, since she was a girl. When Papa was concentrating, he must not be disturbed. But if he was at work on a trifling matter, or frustrated to the point of throwing up his hands, he would invite her in and prop her on his knee. She would sit with him, marveling over his intricate drawings and calculations. They made as much sense to her as Greek. Less sense, truly, because she\u2019d taught herself the Greek alphabet one rainy afternoon. But still, she\u2019d loved sitting with him. Poring over the plans, feeling privy to arcane secrets and military history in the making.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d She recognized the absent quality in his voice. If she had something of importance to discuss, he would not turn her away. But neither did he wish to stop his work for trivialities.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to interrupt. But I saw Lord Rycliff today. In the village. We talked.\u201d And then I followed him up to his castle, where my lips collided with his. Repeatedly.</p><p>God. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking of it. His whiskered jaw, his strong lips, his hands on her body. His taste. Susanna learned something new every day, but today was the first time she\u2019d ever learned another person\u2019s taste. The secret of it was gnawing her from the inside, and there was no one she could tell. Not a soul. She was motherless, sisterless. The village was full of ladies, and she\u2019d been on the listening end of their titillating confessions countless times. But if she confided in the wrong person and her moment of weakness became public knowledge . . . all those ladies would be called home. She would risk losing every friend she had.</p><p>She gave her head a slight knock against the doorframe. Stupid, stupid. \u201cIt seems Rycliff\u2019s plans for the militia are already proceeding apace. I just thought you\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He ripped a sheet of paper in half and drew a fresh one from the waiting stack. \u201cThat is good to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know the man, Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, Bramwell?\u201d</p><p>Bram. After a kiss like that, you must call me Bram.</p><p>A shiver went through her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father was an old school friend. Went on to become a major general, highly decorated. Lived most of his commissioned years in India, but he died there not long ago.\u201d</p><p>A pang of sympathy pinched her heart. Was Bram still mourning his father? \u201cWhen, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Her father raised his head, squinting into some imaginary distance. \u201cMust be over a year now.\u201d</p><p>Not so recently, then. But grief could easily outlast a year. Susanna hated to imagine how long she would mourn Papa, should he die unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Mrs. Bramwell, too?\u201d</p><p>With a penknife, he sharpened his stub of pencil and began to scribble again. \u201cMet her a few times, the last when Victor was just an infant. Then they went to India, and that was the end of her. Dysentery, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear. How tragic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch things happen.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, knowing he meant her own mother. Though she\u2019d died with her second stillborn child over a decade ago, Anna Rose Finch lived on in Susanna\u2019s memory: vividly beautiful, unfailingly patient and kind. But Papa found it hard to speak of her.</p><p>To change the subject, she said, \u201cShall I have Gertrude bring a fresh pot of tea? Coffee or chocolate, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he muttered, bending his head. \u201cWhatever you think best.\u201d</p><p>Another sheet of paper hit the floor in a crumpled ball. Guilt pinched at the nape of her neck. She was distracting him from his work.</p><p>Susanna felt that she should leave, but something wouldn\u2019t let her go. Instead, she leaned against the doorjamb, watching him work. As a girl, she\u2019d always been amused by the gargoyle-ish contortions of his features while he worked. If a perfect chevron of a frown could coax innovation from blank parchment, he ought to receive a divine bolt of brilliance just about . . .</p><p>Now.</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d Out whisked a fresh sheet of paper. His hand danced back and forth, scribbling lines of text and calculations. There was a rhythm to genius, she\u2019d often observed, and he\u2019d caught its brisk cadence now. His shoulders hunched, walling out the world. Nothing she could say would draw his notice, save perhaps \u201cFire!\u201d or \u201cElephants!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, Papa,\u201d she said casually, \u201che kissed me today. Lord Rycliff.\u201d She paused, and then wanting to test the name on her lips, she added, \u201cBram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>There. Now she\u2019d told someone. No matter that the information had sailed straight over her father\u2019s head like an errant musket volley. At least she was talking about it aloud.</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d</p><p>Her only answer was the sound of scribbling.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t entirely truthful just now. In fact, Bram first kissed me yesterday.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cToday . . . today was something much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he muttered distractedly, running one hand through what remained of his hair. \u201cGood, good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of him. He\u2019s gruff and ill-mannered, and when he\u2019s not pushing me away, he\u2019s touching me places he shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t fear him, but when he\u2019s near me, I . . . I\u2019m a little afraid of myself. I feel as though I\u2019ll explode.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She let a few moments pass. The sounds of scribbling continued.</p><p>\u201cOh, Papa.\u201d She turned her body, resting her forehead against the doorjamb. She twisted the end of her dressing gown sash. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry. It won\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m not one of those swooning, fanciful girls, run mad with scarlet fever when officers march by. I won\u2019t let him kiss me again, and I\u2019m wise enough to know I can\u2019t allow a man like that anywhere near my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he mumbled, scribbling some more. \u201cJust so.\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Just so.</p><p>No matter how Lord Rycliff intrigued her, baited her . . . kissed her . . . she must keep the man at arm\u2019s length. Her inner peace and reputation depended on it, and the ladies of Spindle Cove depended on her.</p><p>She took a deep breath, feeling unburdened and resolved. \u201cI\u2019m so glad we had this talk, Papa.\u201d</p><p>Then she lifted the knife and fork from the dinner tray and carved the cooling hunk of roasted beef into thin slices. She split a roll and wedged the meat inside.</p><p>Breaking their unspoken agreement, she entered his workspace, walking on tiptoe around the edge of his desk. She balanced the sandwich by his inkwell, hoping he would notice it eventually.</p> <p>\u201cGood night.\u201d In an impulsive move, she leaned over the desk and kissed the top of his balding head. \u201cPlease remember to eat.\u201d</p><p>She made it all the way back to the door before he responded. And the words came in that same distant voice, as though he were speaking to her from the bottom of a fathomless well. \u201cGood night, my dear. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>When she returned to her bed, Susanna told herself she needn\u2019t worry about Lord Rycliff. They\u2019d agreed to keep the men and ladies separate. With any luck, they would both be so busy, she would scarcely see the man until the midsummer fair.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t reckoned on church.</p><p>The very next morning, there he was. Seated directly across the aisle from her at a distance of four, perhaps five feet away.</p> <p>And today, he\u2019d shaved.</p><p>She noted that detail first. But he was stunning, generally. Resplendent in his dress uniform, bathed in a shaft of golden light from a clerestory window high above. The braid and buttons on his coat flashed with such polished luster, it almost hurt to look at him.</p><p>His eyes caught hers across the aisle.</p><p>With a gulp, Susanna buried her nose in her prayer book and resolved to think pure thoughts. It didn\u2019t work. Throughout the service, she was always a beat too late in standing or sitting. Whatever the topic of Mr. Keane\u2019s homily, it was utterly lost on her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but steal glances whenever an excuse presented itself\u2014whether that excuse was an imaginary fly buzzing past, or the sudden, irresistible urge to stretch her neck. Of course, she was hardly alone. All the other parishioners were stealing looks, too. But Susanna felt reasonably certain she was the only one connecting those brief, forbidden glimpses with scandalous memories.</p><p>Those big, strong hands grasping the prayer book? Yesterday, they\u2019d swept over her body with bold, irreverent intent.</p><p>That clean-shaven jaw, so well defined and masculine? Yesterday, she\u2019d traced it with her gloved finger.</p><p>Those wide, sensual lips, currently mumbling their way through the litany? Yesterday, those lips had been kissing her. Passionately. Breathing her name in a hot, needy whisper. Susanna. Susanna fair.</p> <p>When the call to prayer finally came, she clamped her eyes shut.</p><p>God preserve me. Deliver me from this most horrible affliction.</p><p>No mistake, she\u2019d contracted a most virulent strain of infatuation.</p><p>Why him, of all men? Why couldn\u2019t she develop a silly tendre for the vicar, as so many of the innocent misses did? Mr. Keane was young and well-spoken, and he dressed very smart. Or if brute strength and heat were what enticed her, why didn\u2019t she dawdle around the blacksmith\u2019s forge?</p><p>She knew the answer, deep inside. Those other men never challenged her. If they had nothing else in common, she and Rycliff had a clash of strong wills. As a gunsmith\u2019s daughter, Susanna knew it took a good, hard strike of flint against metal to produce that many sparks.</p><p>When the service ended, she gathered her things and made ready to escape home. Papa rarely came into the village for church, but sometimes he would join her for the Sunday meal. Especially if they had guests.</p><p>\u201cMr. Keane,\u201d she called, moving against the current of people as she made her way toward the pulpit. The crowd shifted, and she glimpsed his back to her. \u201cMy father and I would be delighted if you would join us for dinner today.\u201d</p><p>The vicar turned, revealing his conversation partner. Lord Rycliff.</p><p>Drat. Too late to change course now. The vicar bowed, and Susanna found it in herself to curtsy. \u201cCan we count on you for dinner, Mr. Keane?\u201d Sliding her gaze to the left, she said coolly, \u201cLord Rycliff, you would be welcome, too.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Keane smiled. \u201cI thank you for the kind invitation, Miss Finch. But what with the call for volunteers today . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d Susanna was taken aback. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize Lord Rycliff meant to do that today.\u201d</p><p>Keane cleared his throat. \u201cEr . . . I did announce it from the pulpit. Just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Lord Rycliff\u2019s amused expression. \u201cOh. Oh, that. Yes, of course, Mr. Keane. I did hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>Rycliff spoke. \u201cSo you see, Miss Finch, the good vicar can\u2019t accept your kind invitation. He\u2019s going to volunteer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d This seemed to be news to Mr. Keane. He flushed red. \u201cWell, I . . . I am willing and able, of course. But I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s seemly for a clergyman to join a militia. I shall have to give it some reflection.\u201d He frowned and studied his linked hands. Then he brightened. \u201cI know. Let\u2019s ask Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>Rycliff\u2019s annoyance at hearing those three words could not have been more obvious. Or more satisfying.</p><p>Susanna smiled. \u201cI believe Lord Rycliff has the right idea,\u201d she told the vicar truthfully. \u201cIn volunteering, you would make an excellent example. And indirectly you would be doing my father a favor. I would be most grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll volunteer,\u201d Keane said. \u201cIf you think it best, Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She turned to Rycliff. \u201cAren\u2019t you pleased to hear it, my lord?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cEcstatic.\u201d</p><p>When they exited the church, Susanna was amazed. She hadn\u2019t seen this many people assembled on the green since last year\u2019s Feast of St. Ursula fair. As the church bell tolled, more and more villagers trickled out from the church. Yet more farming and herding folk funneled in from the countryside. She wasn\u2019t certain whether they were gathering to join the militia or simply to view the spectacle. She would imagine many of them didn\u2019t know yet, either.</p><p>She turned for home, but as she made her way across the green, Sally Bright gave a frantic tug on her sleeve. \u201cMiss Finch, please. I need your help. Mother\u2019s beside herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Has little Daisy taken ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s Rufus and Finn, the scoundrels. They\u2019re determined to volunteer for Lord Rycliff\u2019s militia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re too young,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cNot even fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it. You know it. But they\u2019re planning to lie and say they meet the requirements, and who\u2019s going to stop them?\u201d She shook her head, and her white-blond curls bounced with dismay. \u201cImagine Rufus and Finn, issued muskets. There\u2019s an omen of doomsday. But Mother doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you worry, Sally. I\u2019ll have a word with Lord Rycliff.\u201d</p><p>She searched for him in the crowd. Big as he was, and dressed in red, he couldn\u2019t be difficult to find. There he was\u2014occupied, overseeing two men arranging tables. She recognized them as the wagon drivers from the other day. Leaving Sally at the edge of the green, Susanna approached.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff?\u201d</p><p>Gathering a sheaf of papers, he drew her aside. \u201cMiss Finch, don\u2019t you have someplace else to be? Isn\u2019t there a schedule to keep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday. We have no schedule on Sunday. But I\u2019ll be happy to let you be, just as soon as I have a word with you.\u201d</p><p>He pierced her with a look. \u201cI thought we had an agreement. I keep my men away from your ladies, and you keep your distance from me. You\u2019re not holding your end of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s but a momentary interruption. Just this once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this once?\u201d He made a dismissive noise, rifling through papers. \u201cWhat about just now in the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d He stacked his papers and looked up, devouring her with his intent green gaze. \u201cYou invaded my dreams at least a half-dozen times last night. When I\u2019m awake, you keep traipsing through my thoughts. Sometimes you\u2019re barely clothed. What excuse can you make for that?\u201d</p><p>She stammered to form a response, her tongue tripping against her teeth. \u201cI . . . I would never traipse.\u201d</p><p>Idiotic reply.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He tilted his head and regarded her thoughtfully. \u201cWould you saunter?\u201d</p><p>Susanna tempered a growl. Here he went again, trying to dismiss her with boorish innuendo. Caution would tell her to walk away, but her conscience wouldn\u2019t let her back down. The Bright women were depending on her.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to you about the Bright twins,\u201d she said. \u201cRufus and Finn. Their sister tells me they mean to volunteer, but you mustn\u2019t allow them.\u201d</p><p>One dark eyebrow lifted. \u201cOh, mustn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re too young. If they tell you different, they\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I take your word over theirs? If I\u2019m going to make up a sizable company, I need all the willing volunteers I can gather.\u201d He turned to her. \u201cMiss Finch, my militia is precisely that. My militia. I gave you my word regarding your father, but beyond that I\u2019ll make my own decisions, without your contributions. Content yourself with managing all the women in this village, and I\u2019ll see to the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRufus and Finn are boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they join the militia, I\u2019ll make men of them.\u201d He looked around the crowd. \u201cMiss Finch, I\u2019m about to make the call for volunteers. Unless you mean to join the militia yourself, I suggest you remove yourself from the green and have a seat with the ladies. Where you belong.\u201d</p><p>Fuming, but seeing no immediate way to protest, she made a curtsy in retreat. \u201cAs you say, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Sally asked, once she\u2019d reached the edge of the green. \u201cDid he see reason? Did he agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that that man will ever see reason.\u201d She straightened her gloves with angry tugs. \u201cBut don\u2019t you worry, Sally. I will make him agree. I\u2019ll just need to borrow a few things from the shop.\u201d</p><p>As Bram took the center of attention, he resolved to put the woman\u2014all women\u2014out of his mind. He turned his head slowly, scanning the crowd for men. He saw some males who were imprudently young, like the twins. He caught glimpses of a few who were impossibly old, grizzled and toothless. Here and there, he spied a man who ranged between. A handful of fishermen and farmers. The jewelry-making blacksmith stood near the dandified vicar. Fosbury emerged from the tea shop kitchen, dressed in an apron and covered in sugary dust.</p><p>Bram steeled his jaw. From this unlikely assortment of men, he would need to muster an elite, impeccably drilled fighting force. The alternative was the permanent end of his military career. He would remain in England a conquered, lamed, useless wretch. Defeated in every way.</p><p>Failure simply wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he announced, lifting his voice for all to hear. \u201cMost of you will have heard, I\u2019m Rycliff. The ancient title was revived and given me, and now I\u2019m here to fortify and defend the castle. To that end, I\u2019m calling for men to take up arms. I need able-bodied men, ages fifteen to five-and-forty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had their attention. He\u2019d given the call. Now would be the ideal time to summon some motivational words, he supposed. \u201cLet it be understood, England is at war. I want willing and able soldiers. Men of courage, prepared to fight and defend. If there are men among you who wish to be challenged, to become part of something larger than themselves . . . let them come. If there are men who desire to use their God-given strength in service of a noble cause . . . let them come. If there are men in this \u2018Spinster\u2019 Cove who want to be real men again . . . let them answer this call to arms.\u201d</p><p>He paused, expecting some sort of red-blooded, rallying cry in return.</p><p>He got silence. An interested, attentive silence, but silence nonetheless.</p> <p>Well, if inspirational speeches weren\u2019t his strength, Bram still had one incontrovertible argument on his side. He straightened his coat and said the rest. \u201cDrill and training will last a month. Uniforms, firearms, and other supplies will be provided, and there will be wages. Eight shillings a day.\u201d</p><p>Now that caught their attention. Eight shillings was more than a full week\u2019s pay for most workingmen, and more than enough to overcome any reluctance. Murmurs of excitement swept the crowd, and several men began to move forward.</p><p>\u201cFall in line,\u201d he told them. \u201cSee Lord Payne for enrollment, then Corporal Thorne for outfitting.\u201d</p><p>There was a bit of a crush as the men made their way to the enrollment table, but Finn and Rufus Bright took the head of the line, no contest. Bram joined Colin behind the table.</p><p>\u201cNames?\u201d Colin asked.</p> <p>\u201cRufus Ronald Bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas Philip Bright.\u201d</p><p>Colin dutifully inscribed the names. \u201cDate of birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighth of August,\u201d Finn said, looking to his brother. \u201cSeventeen ninety-ei\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven,\u201d Rufus finished. \u201cWe\u2019re over fifteen.\u201d</p><p>Bram interrupted, fixing the boys with a stern look. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Finn stood tall and slapped a hand over his heart. \u201cI\u2019m over fifteen. May the devil take me if I\u2019m telling you false, Lord Rycliff.\u201d</p><p>Bram sighed to himself. No doubt they\u2019d stuffed scraps of papers with the number fifteen in their shoes. Oldest trick in the shiftless army recruiter\u2019s sack. With that scrap of paper beneath their heels, the lads could say with all honesty that they were \u201cover\u201d fifteen.</p><p>Susanna was right, the boys were obviously lying. And they were boys yet, not men. He regarded their matching, fresh-scrubbed faces that wouldn\u2019t know a razor\u2019s scrape for years. But if their birthdays truly were in August, that put their actual fifteenth birthday only a few months away. He surveyed the queue of men behind the twins, performing a quick mental tally. They numbered just under twenty, all in all. Not good. To form a company that would appear remotely impressive in formation, he needed twenty-four.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Colin asked, looking up at Bram.</p><p>\u201cYou heard the lads. They\u2019re over fifteen.\u201d</p><p>The boys grinned as they completed the questions for Colin and proceeded to Thorne\u2019s table for measuring and firearms. Bram didn\u2019t even feel a twinge of guilt about putting muskets in the boys\u2019 hands. If they didn\u2019t already know how to handle a weapon and shoot, it was high time they learned.</p><p>One by one, the men worked through the line, giving Colin their names, ages, and other vital information before proceeding to Thorne to be measured for coats and issued firearms. As the morning progressed, Bram\u2019s knee began to ache. Then it started to throb. Before long, the damned joint was screaming with pain\u2014so loud, he was surprised no one else could hear.</p><p>When Colin finished with the next recruit, Bram nudged his cousin aside. \u201cYou\u2019re too slow. Go help Thorne.\u201d</p> <p>Lowering himself onto Colin\u2019s vacant campstool, Bram winced. He performed a surreptitious flex of his leg beneath the table, trying to ease the pain and focus on the enrollment list before him. He took his time dipping the quill.</p><p>\u201cNow, then. Name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinch.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Bram froze, quill poised above the paper, praying his ears deceived him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s F-I-N-C-H,\u201d she spelled helpfully. \u201cFinch. Like the bird.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cSusanna, what the devil are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who Susanna is. But I, Stuart James Finch, am volunteering for your militia.\u201d</p><p>Gone was that frothy, leaf-green muslin frock he\u2019d admired in church. In its place she\u2019d donned a pair of nankeen breeches that fit her surprisingly well, a crisp linen shirt cuffed at the wrists, and a cobalt-blue topcoat that oddly enough did lovely things for her eyes.</p><p>And gloves, of course. Men\u2019s gloves. Heaven forbid Miss Finch appear in public without her gloves.</p><p>She went on, \u201cMy birth date is the fifth of November, 1788. And that\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Her hair was bound in a tight queue, and she was dressed in man\u2019s clothing, but there was absolutely nothing that wasn\u2019t feminine about her. Her voice, her bearing . . . God, even her scent. She couldn\u2019t fool a blind man.</p><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t mean to fool Bram. The interfering minx simply wanted to make a point. And she intended to make that point in front of scores of people. The entire village crowded around them, men and women alike, eager to see how this scene would unfold. They all wondered, who would emerge the victor?</p><p>He would. If he let her get the better of him today, he would never have the men\u2019s respect. What\u2019s more, he wouldn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cWrite my name,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cYou know I won\u2019t. Only men are eligible to serve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a man,\u201d she said.</p><p>He blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her voice dripped with mock innocence. \u201cYou took Rufus and Finn at their word. Why can\u2019t you take me at mine?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice and leaned forward over the table. \u201cBecause in this case, I have firsthand knowledge that contradicts your word. Would you like me to tell all these people precisely how I know you\u2019re a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my guest,\u201d she whispered through a tight smile. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather be planning a wedding than a militia.\u201d She cast a glance to either side. \u201cIn a village this small, filled this chockablock with ladies, an announcement like that is sure to incite matrimonial panic.\u201d</p><p>They stared one another down for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cIf you accept Finn and Rufus,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to accept me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, dipping the quill again. He would see just how far she was prepared to take this. \u201cStuart James Finch, born November fifth, 1788.\u201d He turned the paper and shoved it toward her. \u201cSign here.\u201d</p><p>She took the pen in her gloved hand and made a flowery signature, complete with flourish.</p><p>\u201cNext,\u201d he said, rising from the table and gesturing toward Thorne, \u201cwe\u2019ll need to measure you for a uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course.\u201d</p><p>Bram walked her over to the second table and ripped the measuring tape straight from Thorne\u2019s hand. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll see to this recruit myself.\u201d He held up the tape for Susanna\u2019s inspection. \u201cYou have no objection, Finch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone at all.\u201d She hiked her chin.</p><p>\u201cRemove your coat, then.\u201d</p><p>She complied without argument.</p><p>He found himself without words.</p><p>Sweet heaven.</p><p>Bram wasn\u2019t fond of ladies\u2019 current fashions, with their high, empire waists and draped columns of skirt. While he approved of the way such designs served up the bosom for a man\u2019s appreciative view\u2014what man didn\u2019t appreciate a nice view of plump breasts?\u2014he didn\u2019t like the way they obscured the remainder of a woman\u2019s body. He liked shapely legs, trim ankles, generous hips. He had a particular fondness for a round, cuppable arse.</p><p>Who could have guessed that gentlemen\u2019s attire would perfectly hug Susanna Finch\u2019s every last feminine curve?</p><p>Her borrowed waistcoat wouldn\u2019t button at the top, due to the ample swell of her breasts. It did, however, fit snugly around her middle, emphasizing her slender waist and the sweet flare of her hips. Her breeches ended at the knee. Below them, white stockings clung to every contour of her long, lean calves and ankles.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>She obeyed. And as she turned, she flipped her long queue of hair forward, giving him a clear view of her back . . . and backside. Those nankeen breeches stretched tight over a sweet, round arse. God, she was made for his hands. And stubborn, headstrong thing that she was, she\u2019d given him the perfect excuse to touch her.</p><p>He began with her shoulders, placing the measuring tape at one shoulder and stretching it slowly across her back to the other. He took his time, allowing his touch to skim along the elegant slopes and ridges of her shoulder blades. As though he were touching her not for tailoring purposes, but for his pleasure and hers.</p><p>Her shoulder trembled under his touch. His heart kicked.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen inches,\u201d he read aloud.</p><p>He measured her arm length next, beginning at the top of her shoulder and stretching the tape down the length of her arm, all the way to her wrist, before reading aloud the measurement.</p><p>\u201cStand tall, Finch.\u201d</p><p>As her shoulders squared, he fitted one end of the tape at the nape of her neck, just at the top of her collar. Then he stretched the narrow strip of marked fabric down the length of her spine, touching each individual vertebra. Then dipping lower, halfway down the delectable curve of her backside. He heard her sudden intake of breath, and it echoed in his groin.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six inches, for the coat length.\u201d As he stood, he pulled on the front of his own coat, hoping no one would notice he\u2019d gained several inches in his personal measurements. This scene had him so aroused, he\u2019d completely forgotten the pain in his knee.</p><p>\u201cFace me, Finch.\u201d</p><p>She performed a slow, sensual about-face. Almost as though they were dancing.</p><p>\u201cArms up,\u201d he directed. \u201cI\u2019ll measure your chest now.\u201d His blood heated at the mere thought of sliding his hands around the circumference of that lush bosom.</p><p>Her eyes flashed, and she crossed her arms, impeding him. \u201cI believe I know that measurement. It\u2019s thirty-four inches.\u201d</p><p>He sighed gruffly. \u201cPerfect.\u201d Damn, how he wanted to feel that body under his again. Yearned for it.</p><p>\u201cAre we done?\u201d she asked, shrugging back into her coat.</p><p>\u201cWeapons next,\u201d he said, struggling to regain his composure. \u201cI\u2019ll need to issue you a musket, Mr. Finch.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t balked at the public measurements, perhaps forcing her to handle weaponry would do the trick. Even though her father invented the things, most gently bred ladies were reluctant to touch firearms, if not outright terrified of them.</p><p>He selected a musket and held it out to her.</p><p>\u201cThis is a flintlock,\u201d he said, ladling out his words in slow, patronizing increments. \u201cThe ball shoots from this barrel, see? Here is the trigger, in the middle. And the other end fits against your shoulder, like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d she said wonderingly. She reached for the weapon. \u201cMay I try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlowly there.\u201d He moved behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how to hold it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYour instructions were so lucid and crisp.\u201d</p><p>And then as he\u2014and Thorne and Colin, and the entire population of Spindle Cove\u2014looked on, Susanna Finch took a cartridge from the table, ripped it open with her neat, straight teeth, and spat both paper nub and ball to the ground. Setting the gun at half cock, she sprinkled a bit of powder in the pan and closed the frizzen. Then she poured the remainder of the powder charge down the barrel and tamped it down with the ramrod. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bram had seen soldiers\u2019 wives clean and assemble their husbands\u2019 firearms. But he\u2019d never witnessed anything like this. Susanna didn\u2019t just know the proper sequence, she understood the piece. Those gloved hands moved confidently, handling the weapon with ruthless, arousing grace. His desire, and his loins, had already been stirred by that measuring exercise. Now his arousal approached rifle-barrel proportions.</p><p>She shouldered the musket, cocked the hammer, and fired the blank charge. The weapon gave a violent kick against her shoulder, but she didn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>\u201cHave I caught the trick of it, do you think?\u201d she asked coyly, lowering the musket.</p> <p>Remarkable. Bram fought the urge to applaud. He hadn\u2019t been timing, but he would have guessed the elapsed time to be under twenty seconds. Perhaps as few as fifteen. There were elite riflemen who couldn\u2019t load and shoot in fifteen seconds.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father, of course.\u201d She lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cDon\u2019t most men learn such things from their fathers?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Most men did. Bram himself had learned everything about shooting from his father. He\u2019d begged for his first fowling piece almost as soon as he\u2019d been able to form the words. Not because he\u2019d loved guns so very much, but because he\u2019d worshipped his father. He\u2019d always looked for any excuse to spend more time with the man. Those solemn, patient lessons on safety and cleaning and marksmanship . . . they were now some of Bram\u2019s most cherished memories. He wondered if it had been the same for her. If she\u2019d sat through similar lessons at Sir Lewis\u2019s side. Mastered this weapon, learned its workings inside and out, drilled and practiced until she could fire by instinct\u2014all as a way to feel closer to him.</p><p>And now Bram felt closer to her, in a way he\u2019d never expected to feel. Strange. And damned inconvenient. He scrunched his shoulders together, trying to shake the feeling off.</p> <p>\u201cDid you want to see me fix a bayonet next?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her\u2014standing tall, musket propped against her shoulder, braced in perfect position. He\u2019d thought himself so clever, letting her proceed with this \u201cI\u2019m a man\u201d charade. The joke was on him. Male or not, she was his most promising recruit. He was tempted to punish her by letting her enlist.</p><p>But she would be too great a distraction. For all the men, but for Bram most of all. Spending all day with her, while she wore those form-fitting breeches? He couldn\u2019t be leading drills with his staff at full, rigid attention.</p><p>And more importantly, he could not let her best him in front of the whole village. He would have to release her from duty somehow, without losing the Bright boys in the exchange.</p><p>His eye fell to the table. The answer gleamed up at him, polished and sharp.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing, Miss . . . Mr. Finch. One more requirement for volunteers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Bram turned to the row of ladies sitting at the edge of the green. \u201cLadies, I must prevail on you for your assistance. I need each one of you to locate a pair of scissors and bring it here, as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>The women looked to one another. Then quite the scuffle ensued, as they ducked into the Queen\u2019s Ruby to raid their dressing tables and sewing boxes. In similar fashion, the storeroom of All Things was turned out like a pocket.</p><p>When every available pair of scissors and shears had apparently been unearthed, and all the ladies were armed and assembled on the green, Sally Bright stepped forward. \u201cWhat would you like us to do with them, Lord Rycliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut them to use,\u201d he answered. \u201cIn my militia, all volunteers must have short hair. Above the collar in back. At the sides, above the ear.\u201d</p><p>He looked to Susanna. She paled a shade, and those freckles fairly danced off her face.</p><p>Turning to the recruits, he made a sweep of his arm. \u201cThe ladies have chosen their weapons. Men, choose your lady.\u201d</p> <p>The women exchanged surprised glances. Equally stunned, the men hung back. Some pairings were obvious, of course. A woman he reckoned to be Mrs. Fosbury already had her husband by the collar, tugging him over to sit on a stump and submit to the will of her shears. But the unmarried men and women of Spindle Cove stood about regarding one another in silence. Like Quakers at meeting, waiting on some signal from above. Good Lord, he needed to teach these men to take some initiative.</p><p>Bram turned to his cousin. \u201cAren\u2019t you always the one to start off the dance? Do the honors now.\u201d</p><p>Colin shot him a look. \u201cI\u2019m not a volunteer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re indebted and compelled. You have no choice whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>Colin rose slowly, pulling down the front of his waistcoat. \u201cVery well. As you say, I do like to have first pick of the ladies.\u201d He strode forward, doffing his hat with a broad, theatrical sweep and coming to kneel at Miss Diana Highwood\u2019s feet. \u201cMiss Highwood, would you be so kind?\u201d</p><p>The fair-haired lady blushed. \u201cEr, yes. Certainly, Lord Payne. I would be honored.\u201d</p><p>The ladies tittered among themselves, surely interpreting this as partiality on Colin\u2019s part. Susanna was right about the matrimonial fervor. They\u2019d be rumoring an engagement by noon. If only there were a bit of truth to it. Colin was welcome to enter an engagement, and then he wouldn\u2019t be Bram\u2019s problem anymore.</p><p>His current problem tilted her lovely, freckled head. \u201cYou were supposed to keep your men apart from my ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed I remind you who broke that agreement first?\u201d He picked up the pair of scissors on the table\u2014the ones Thorne had been using to cut the measuring tapes. \u201cWell?\u201d he asked loudly. \u201cWhat will it be, Finch?\u201d</p><p>She stared at the scissors, wide-eyed. \u201cAbove the collar, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery volunteer in the militia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo exceptions.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes pleaded with him. She lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cThey\u2019re boys. Finn and Rufus, I mean. Their mother is anxious for them. Try to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I understand.\u201d He understood that she was ostensibly trying to shield those boys from harm. But he also understood her other purpose\u2014clinging to her position of power in this village. On that score, he could not let her win. \u201cPerhaps neither you nor I wanted it, but I\u2019m the lord now. My militia. My village. My rules.\u201d He held out the scissors. \u201cShear or be shorn.\u201d</p><p>After a long moment, she removed her borrowed hat and set it aside. Reaching both hands behind her neck, she unbound her long queue of hair, then shook out the locks with a sensual toss of her head. The newly freed hair tumbled about her shoulders in lush, golden-red waves that shimmered in the sunlight, dazzling him into a near stupor.</p><p>In that instant, Bram knew he\u2019d made a grave tactical error.</p><p>With a resigned sigh, she met his gaze. \u201cVery well. It\u2019s just hair.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s just hair.</p><p>Good Lord. That molten bronze aura framing her face was most definitely not \u201cjust hair.\u201d It was living, flowing beauty. It was a crown of glory. It was . . . like the righteous breath of angry angels. Some kind of religious experience, and he was probably damned just for daring to look upon it.</p><p>A faint, wistful noise scraped from his throat. He covered it with a cough.</p><p>Let her cut it, he told himself. You have no choice. If she wins this battle, it\u2019s all over. You\u2019re done for.</p><p>\u201cLet me have them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d She reached for the shears.</p><p>He gripped them tight. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Susanna repeated, trying not to betray her panic. A brave front was important here.</p><p>She truly didn\u2019t want to cut her hair\u2014\u201cthat hair,\u201d as her cousins had less than affectionately cursed it. Wild and unfashionable as it might be, it suited her now, and it was one thing she had of her mother\u2019s. But Susanna would make the sacrifice, if it meant keeping Finn and Rufus safe.</p><p>If it meant besting him.</p><p>It would grow back, she told herself. It had all grown back once before, after that dreadful summer in Norfolk. Only she wanted to cut it herself this time. Quickly, and with as little thought as possible. She didn\u2019t think she could bear to stand still while another held the shears.</p><p>\u201cJust give me them.\u201d Growing close to desperate, she tugged on the scissors handles. \u201cI\u2019ll do it now.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cFinn and Rufus.\u201d He spoke low, only to her. \u201cI\u2019ll make them drummer and fifer. They\u2019ll be in the militia, attend drill and draw wages. But they won\u2019t be armed. Will that suffice?\u201d</p><p>She was stunned. He had her just where he wanted her\u2014on the verge of public humiliation\u2014and now he wished to compromise? \u201cI . . . I suppose that will do. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. Does this mean you\u2019re a lady again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go change straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d he said, still clutching the scissors handles tight. He gave her a bold look. \u201cBefore you leave, you\u2019ll do a service for me. Just like the other ladies are doing.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, all around them the men and women of Spindle Cove were pairing off. As Diana busied herself with Lord Payne, the blacksmith made his way to the widowed Mrs. Watson and her shears. Finn and Rufus seemed to be arguing over which of them would be stuck with Sally.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to cut your hair?\u201d Her mind\u2019s eye went to that long, overgrown tail of hair always dangling between his shoulders, taunting her.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, no exceptions.\u201d He pressed the shears into her hand. \u201cGo on, then. I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>Susanna cleared her throat. \u201cI believe you\u2019ll have to kneel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKneel?\u201d He snorted. \u201cNot a chance, Miss Finch. There\u2019s precisely one reason I will kneel before a woman, and this isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProposing marriage, I hope you mean.\u201d</p><p>A devilish spark lit his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Awareness raced through her body. She glanced around them. All around the green, the business of clipping hair had occupied her friends and neighbors. This had become a private conversation. And a fortunate thing, too, considering what took place next.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mean to kneel,\u201d she said, angling on tiptoe, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you expect me to cut your hair. All the chairs are in use. I may be tall, but there\u2019s no way I can reach\u2014oh!\u201d</p><p>He framed her rib cage in both hands and lifted her into the air. The brute power in the motion thrilled her. This made two times in three days that he\u2019d swept her off her feet. Three, if she counted yesterday\u2019s kiss.</p><p>Why was she counting? She shouldn\u2019t be counting.</p><p>He set her down atop the table, making her the taller of the two. \u201cSteady?\u201d</p><p>At her mute nod, he slid his hands from her waist. Now she was lost in memories of their embrace yesterday, the press of his body against hers . . . Their gazes clashed. The now-familiar sparks flew.</p><p>Susanna swallowed hard. \u201cTurn around, if you will.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. For once, he obeyed.</p><p>She took it in her hand, that thick, dark hank at his nape, bound with a bit of leather cord. His hair was lush, soft. Probably the softest thing on this man, she mused. Once it was cut, he would be all angles and sinew, hard all over.</p><p>\u201cWhy the delay?\u201d he taunted. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d With a steady hand, she raised the shears. Grasping the queue of hair firmly in the other hand, she aimed . . . and snipped. \u201cOh dear.\u201d She dangled the lopped-off coil before his face, then dropped it to the ground without ceremony. \u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>He only chuckled, but she thought she caught a hint of bruised pride in his laughter. \u201cI see you\u2019re enjoying your chance to play Delilah.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better hope I don\u2019t decide to play Judith. I\u2019m holding shears at the moment, and I\u2019d advise you to be still. I need to concentrate.\u201d Setting the scissors aside for a moment, she pulled back her own locks and wound them into a simple knot. Then she set about the work of clipping his hair, and they both went quiet.</p><p>And as she worked, the quiet deepened, grew profound. The task was so intimate. In order to cut his hair evenly, she had to sift her fingers through the heavy locks, lifting and angling them for the shears. She touched his ear, his temple, his jaw.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier if you removed your gloves?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d At the moment, those thin leather gloves were the only thing keeping her sane.</p><p>A palpable, sensual tension had thickened the air surrounding them. His breathing was audible, a husky sighing in and out. Her fingers faltered for a moment, and she scraped his ear with one blade of the shears. She was horrified, but he seemed to take no notice. Only the tiniest drop of blood welled at the site, but it took all she had not to press her lips to the wound.</p><p>After a few more snips, she laid the shears aside. To test the cut\u2019s evenness, she raised both hands to his hair and dragged her gloved fingertips over his scalp, slowly raking them from his hairline to his nape.</p><p>As her fingers made that long, gentle sweep, he made a sound. An involuntary moan. Or perhaps a groan. It originated not in his throat, but deep in his chest, somewhere in the region of his heart.</p><p>That rumbling sound was more than a sigh. It was a confession, a plea. With a simple brush of her fingertips, she\u2019d called forth an expression of deep, hidden yearning. Her whole body ached with an instinctive response.</p> <p>Oh goodness. Oh, Bram.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>When he obeyed, his eyes were closed.</p><p>Hers were open. Open to a whole new man. This big, brutish soldier-turned-medieval lord, now shorn close as a yearling\u2014looking vulnerable and lost, in need of care. Her care.</p><p>All his staunch denials of emotion echoed in her ears. Did he know how thoroughly he\u2019d just betrayed them? She thought of those passionate kisses yesterday. How he used every excuse to touch her, in every interaction. Heavens, the way he\u2019d taken her measurements . . . Sensation rippled down her spine, as though she could still feel the deliberate sweep of his thumb. She\u2019d thought him merely trying to rattle her.</p><p>But now she saw his motives clear. Here it was, his secret. No childhood trauma, no ravages of war. Just a deep, unspoken desire for closeness. Oh, he\u2019d rather die than admit it in such terms, but that low, yearning sound told all.</p> <p>That was the sound a great shaggy beast made when the nettle in his paw was plucked.</p><p>Here was a man who needed touch, craved tenderness\u2014and he was starved for them both. Just how much would he allow her to give? She teased her fingers through the clipped fringe at his temples. His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed in his throat. She let a single gloved fingertip skim the ridge of his cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d His eyes snapped open, cool and defiant.</p><p>Wounded by his sharp tone, she withdrew her touch.</p><p>\u201cWell, Miss Finch.\u201d Stepping back, he ran a hand over his dark, now short hair. \u201cTell me, how do the men look?\u201d</p><p>Susanna let her gaze wander the green. Everywhere she looked, she saw newly revealed, blinding-white scalp. \u201cLike a flock of yearlings, freshly shorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not look like sheep. They look like soldiers. Men with a common purpose. A team. Soon I\u2019ll have them acting like one, too.\u201d</p><p>Taking her by the waist, he lifted her off the table and put her back on firm ground. Oddly enough, the world still felt unsteady.</p> <p>\u201cHave a good look at them. In a month\u2019s time, I\u2019ll have a militia. These will become men of duty, action. I\u2019ll have shown all your prim, sheltered spinsters precisely what real men can do.\u201d The corner of his mouth quirked. \u201cSpindle Cove will be a much different place. And you, Miss Finch, will thank me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He\u2019d revealed too much. That brute male swagger couldn\u2019t intimidate her now, and she would not let such a challenge pass without a strong, confident response.</p><p>She calmly brushed stray snips of hair from his lapel. \u201cIn a month\u2019s time, this community I love, and this atmosphere we\u2019ve worked so hard to foster, will be the same. Everything I see here today will remain unaltered, except for one thing. Spindle Cove will change you, Lord Rycliff.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you threaten my ladies\u2019 health and happiness?\u201d She laid a sweet touch to his cheek. \u201cI will bring you to your knees.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cOn Mondays, we always have country walks.\u201d</p><p>Susanna paced the Highwood sisters on the sloping footpath. Together, they trailed behind the larger group. The ladies made a rainbow-hued column of muslin, filing up the path.</p><p>\u201cThe Downlands are beautiful this time of year. When we reach the top of the ridge, you can see for miles. It feels like being on top of the world.\u201d</p><p>Thank heaven for scheduled activities. After yesterday\u2019s . . . excitement . . . on the green and yet another restless night, Susanna was grateful for the distraction. She walked with vigor and purpose, inhaling deep lungfuls of the green-scented air.</p><p>\u201cThe wildflowers are lovely.\u201d Charlotte plucked a stalk of lavender-tipped rampion from the hillside and twirled it between her fingertips.</p><p>Minerva tromped along at Susanna\u2019s side. \u201cMiss Finch, you cannot know how much I hate to sound like my mother. But are you certain this exertion is good for Diana\u2019s health?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Exercise is the only way she\u2019ll grow stronger. We\u2019ll go slowly at first, and no farther than is comfortable.\u201d She touched Diana\u2019s arm. \u201cMiss Highwood, you are to tell me if you feel the slightest hint of difficulty with your breathing. We\u2019ll stop and rest at once.\u201d</p><p>Her straw bonnet bobbed in agreement.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u201d\u2014Susanna reached into her pocket and withdrew a small, capped bottle\u2014\u201cI have a special tincture for you. Keep it in your reticule at all times. It\u2019s too strong to be taken every day, mind. Only when you feel you truly need it. The cap measures the proper dose. Aaron Dawes fashioned it specially at his forge. He\u2019s so clever with these small things.\u201d</p><p>Miss Highwood accepted the small vial. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe layman\u2019s name is shrubby horsetail. Rather common-sounding, but its ability to open the lungs is unique indeed. The plant normally grows in warmer climes, but our coastal weather is mild enough that I\u2019m able to cultivate it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Susanna answered. \u201cI dabble in apothecary.\u201d</p><p>Minerva eyed the bottle warily. As they all continued their slow, steady climb, she drew Susanna aside. \u201cForgive me, Miss Finch, but my sister has suffered greatly. I don\u2019t like the idea of entrusting her health to a \u2018dabbler.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Susanna took her arm. \u201cI knew I liked you, Minerva. You\u2019re absolutely right to protect your sister, and I should not have described my work that way. No more than you should say you \u2018dabble\u2019 in geology. Why is it that we women so often downplay our accomplishments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Men are always boasting of theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo true. Let\u2019s boast to each other, then. I\u2019ve made a careful, scientific study of apothecary for several years. I make remedies for many of the visitors and villagers, and I have solid, scientific reason to believe that in a breathing crisis, the contents of that vial can do your sister some good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I trust your expertise.\u201d Minerva smiled. \u201cNow for my boasting.\u201d With a glance toward the other ladies, she slowed. They\u2019d fallen well behind the main group now. \u201cCan you keep a secret? I am the first\u2014and only\u2014female member of the Royal Geological Society.\u201d</p><p>Susanna gasped with delight. \u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy neglecting to tell them I\u2019m female. I\u2019m just M. R. Highwood to them, and all my contributions are made through written correspondence. Fossils are my area of specialty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, then you are in exactly the right place. These chalk hills are filled with strange little nuggets, and the cove\u2014wait until you see the cove tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>They went quiet for a while as the way grew steeper, and narrower\u2014so that they were forced to walk single file.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the castle.\u201d Up the path, Charlotte stood on her toes and waved her growing posy of wildflowers in the direction of the ruins. \u201cIt\u2019s so romantic, isn\u2019t it? With that backdrop of the sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Susanna said, keeping her own eyes on the ground. She knew very well what a picturesque sight it made, but she\u2019d been trying to keep castles and romance in two distinctly different, tightly corked bottles on her mental shelf.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, Miss Finch,\u201d Minerva whispered, following close behind. \u201cDon\u2019t you have your own secret to tell?\u201d</p><p>Susanna sighed. She did have a secret\u2014a scandalous, explosive secret that involved Lord Rycliff and kisses in the armory and a great many emotions she couldn\u2019t sort out. She wished she could trust Minerva with it. But men and fossils were different things.</p><p>They rounded a bend in the path and nearly collided with the other ladies. They\u2019d all stopped in their tracks at the edge of an overlook, staring down in mute wonder at the valley below.</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d said Violet Winterbottom. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look at them all,\u201d Kate Taylor breathed.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, what is it?\u201d Susanna asked, pushing to the fore. \u201cDid Mr. Yarborough\u2019s cows escape again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. These are beasts of a different sort.\u201d Kate grinned at her.</p><p>Sounds floated up to Susanna\u2019s ears. Halting, erratic drumbeats. The shrill squawk of a fife. The impatient whinny of a horse.</p><p>Finally, she got a look.</p><p>The men. There they were, down on the flat meadow just north of the castle bluffs. From this vantage, it was difficult to distinguish any of the men as individuals. She could not have singled out Mr. Fosbury or the smith. But Bram, as usual, stood out from the crowd. This time, not merely because he was the tallest and his coat the brightest, but because he rode on horseback, giving him the advantage of height to gauge the formation\u2019s precision. As they marched, he directed his mount to circle the group, giving direction from all sides.</p><p>He looked very capable and strong and active. Which was unfortunate, because those were all the qualities she found appealing in a man. She\u2019d never grieved over her disastrous London season because the gentlemen had been such disappointments. So idle and useless. She found it so much easier to respect people who did something.</p><p>Violet shaded her brow with her hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be going very well, does it?\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed. \u201cThey keep doing the same thing. Just a single line, marching back and forth. Over and over. From this end of the meadow to that. Then they stop, turn around, and do it again.\u201d She looked to Violet. \u201cHow many times now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped counting at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be watching them,\u201d Susanna said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Kate looked at her. \u201cAren\u2019t they meant to be preparing a field review? A public display?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the same, let\u2019s continue on our walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Miss Finch,\u201d Diana said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit winded. Perhaps a rest would do me good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. But of course.\u201d Unable to argue, Susanna spread her shawl and took a seat on the hillside. All the other ladies did likewise, and no one even bothered to pretend that gathering wildflowers or spotting birds would be the purpose of the moment. They all stared, riveted to the meadow below and the new militia\u2019s halting, sorry drill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susanna worried. She\u2019d agreed to keep her ladies apart from Bram\u2019s men. The physical distance separating them at the moment didn\u2019t allay her concerns. Being this far removed only made the ladies feel free to gawk and gossip.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that bright green topcoat. That must be Mr. Keane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would think his sense of rhythm would be better, what with all the singing in church.\u201d</p> <p>An elbow dug into her side. \u201cLord Rycliff\u2019s dismounting, look.\u201d</p><p>Susanna resolved not to look.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking the musket from one of them. Perhaps he means to show them himself just how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Susanna renewed her resolution not to look. The blades of grass beneath her fingertips were more interesting by far. And lo, here was a fascinating ant.</p><p>A female sigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s that small, fluffy thing trotting at his heels? Some kind of dog?\u201d</p> <p>Drat it, now she had to look. A broad smile stretched her cheeks. \u201cNo. That\u2019s His Lordship\u2019s pet lamb. The dear little thing follows him around. He\u2019s named it Dinner.\u201d</p><p>All the ladies laughed, and Susanna laughed with them, knowing how it would vex Bram to be teased. Odd\u2014and a bit disconcerting\u2014how she felt so confident predicting his reactions. For that matter, how she kept thinking of him as \u201cBram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d In a gesture that strongly recalled her mother, Charlotte pressed a hand to her heart. \u201cThey\u2019re removing their coats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only their coats.\u201d</p><p>As the ladies all sat gawping in silence, the men halted their exercise and removed first their coats, then their waistcoats and cravats.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re working hard,\u201d Diana replied. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s warm down there.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s growing warm up here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat,\u201d Susanna said, again surprised how easily she knew his mind. \u201cTheir coats are all different colors. Lord Rycliff wants them looking the same, so they\u2019ll act in unison, too.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte grabbed the spectacles from Minerva\u2019s hand and lifted them to her own eyes. \u201cDrat. I can\u2019t make out anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoose,\u201d Minerva said, giving her little sister an affectionate shove. \u201cI\u2019m farsighted. Those only help with objects up close. And I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re making such a fuss over a few men in shirtsleeves, anyhow. From this distance, they\u2019re just pale, fleshy blurs.\u201d</p><p>Except for Bram. There was nothing undefined about his torso. Even from this distance, Susanna could clearly make out the linen-sheathed muscles of his shoulders and arms. She recalled their solid heat beneath her touch.</p><p>\u201cWe should be heading back to the village.\u201d She rose to her feet, brushing grass from her skirts and folding her Indian shawl into a neat rectangle.</p><p>Violet objected, \u201cBut Miss Finch, we haven\u2019t yet reached\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Highwood is winded,\u201d she clipped, in a tone that would brook no argument. \u201cThis is far enough for today.\u201d</p><p>The ladies rose in silence, retying bonnet ribbons and preparing to walk home.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, Miss Finch?\u201d Kate smiled as the sound of feeble drumming resumed. \u201cHow many times do you suppose he\u2019ll make them march that same line?\u201d</p><p>Susanna could not have given Kate a number, but she knew the answer just the same.</p><p>\u201cUntil they do it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never get this right,\u201d Thorne muttered. \u201cBloody hopeless, all of them.\u201d</p><p>Bram swore under his breath. For God\u2019s sake, he\u2019d spent all day yesterday just trying to teach these men to march in a straight line. When they mustered on Tuesday morning, he\u2019d decided to make the task even simpler. No strict formations\u2014just marching in time across open land. Left, right, left.</p><p>But marching in time was easier with a drummer who could drum in time, and Finn Bright seemed to have been born without a sense of rhythm. Say nothing of Rufus\u2019s ear-stabbing squawks on the fife.</p><p>Despite all this, somehow they\u2019d managed to cover the crescent of high ground between Rycliff Castle and the steep cliffs marking the other end of the cove.</p><p>\u201cPut them at ease,\u201d he directed Thorne. \u201cSee if they can manage to just . . . stand there for a while, without falling on their arses.\u201d</p><p>Bram would have fallen on his own saber before admitting it, but he was the one who needed a rest. He looked out across the cove. Perched on the arm of land opposite, sat the castle. So close, if one measured as the gulls flew, but a rather long march back. Blast it, he should have brought his horse.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the spindle, I take it?\u201d Colin squinted at a column of rocks punctuating the inlet. The formation was tall and roundish, with a knobby sandstone top.</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>Colin snorted. \u201cProof positive that this place was named by dried-up old maids. No man\u2014hell, no woman with a lick of experience\u2014would ever look at that and call it a spindle.\u201d</p><p>Bram released a slow breath. He had no patience for his cousin\u2019s adolescent humor today. The sun was warm on his back. The sky and sea were having a contest to out-blue each other. Wisps of white dotted both, sea foam mirroring the clouds. Watching the gulls soar on the wind, he felt his heart pulling against its tether, floating in his chest. The water looked cool and inviting, buoyant.</p><p>And his knee felt like a collection of glass shards, encased in flesh. Never in the eight months since his injury had he walked this far without his brace. He shouldn\u2019t need the brace anymore, damn it. What was a mile or three across the fields, anyhow?</p><p>Tell that to his ligaments. His whole leg throbbed with fiery pain, and he wasn\u2019t sure at all how he\u2019d make it back to the castle. But he would. He would lead them all the way home, and never betray a wince.</p><p>The pain was good, Bram told himself. The pain would make him stronger. Next time, he would push himself a bit farther, and it would hurt a bit less.</p><p>A bright flutter down in the cove caught his eye. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am growing dangerously out of practice,\u201d Colin answered. \u201cBut they look like ladies to me.\u201d</p><p>His cousin was right. The ladies\u2014and Bram was certain he recognized Susanna Finch\u2019s tall, slender form among them\u2014were picking their way along the shore. They paused as a group, removing their bonnets and wraps and draping them on the branches of a twisted, scrubby tree. As their headwear came off, Bram caught a glimpse of golden-red flame, and desire kindled to life inside him. He\u2019d know that hair anywhere. It had played a rather vivid role in his dreams last night.</p><p>As they reached the shingle beach, the ladies disappeared from view. The curve of the inlet guarded them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose they\u2019re doing?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday,\u201d Bram said. \u201cThey\u2019re sea bathing.\u201d Mondays are country walks. Tuesday, sea bathing. Wednesday, we\u2019re in the garden . . . That promise of gardening gave him hope. God, perhaps tomorrow he\u2019d finally have a chance of escaping Susanna Finch and her maddening sensual distractions. As if it weren\u2019t bad enough watching her climb the hillside yesterday, now he had to suffer the knowledge that somewhere not too far below, she\u2019d soon be wet to the skin.</p><p>The Bright twins set aside the drum and fife and joined them at the edge of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use craning your necks from here,\u201d Rufus said. \u201cThey\u2019re well hidden when they change into their bathing costumes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathing costumes?\u201d Bram snorted. \u201cLeave it to Englishwomen to civilize the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want a better view, the best place to peek is down the ridge a bit,\u201d Finn said, gesturing toward the tapering point of land. When Bram raised an eyebrow, the boy\u2019s cheeks flushed red. \u201cOr so I hear. From Rufus.\u201d</p><p>His twin gave him an elbow to the side.</p><p>By now the rest of the men had gathered, clustering around the edge of the bluff.</p><p>\u201cTell me about this path,\u201d Bram said.</p><p>\u201cJust there.\u201d Finn pointed. \u201cSteps, cut into the sandstone by pirates in our grandfather\u2019s day. Once was, at low tide you could climb all the way from sea to bluff. The path\u2019s eroded now. Breaks off halfway. But follow it down a bit, and you have the best view into the cove.\u201d</p><p>Bram frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re certain no one could climb up this way? If spies or smugglers learned of it, this path could present a true risk.\u201d He turned to the fishermen volunteers. \u201cAre your boats available? I\u2019d like to have a look at these bluffs from the water.\u201d</p><p>The vicar rushed to his side. \u201cOh, but my lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what, Mr. Keane? It\u2019s a fine enough day. High tide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ladies have their sea bathing, my lord.\u201d Keane wiped his reddened face with his sleeve. \u201cMiss Finch wouldn\u2019t like the intrusion.\u201d</p><p>Bram huffed an impatient sigh. \u201cMr. Keane. The purpose of this militia is to protect Miss Finch\u2014and all denizens of Spindle Cove\u2014from unwanted intrusions. What if a French frigate sailed into view this moment, setting course for this cove? Or an American privateer? Do you think they\u2019ll hold off on invading merely because it\u2019s Tuesday? Are you going to postpone fighting them, simply because the ladies have their sea bathing?\u201d</p><p>The blacksmith scratched his neck. \u201cIf any ship\u2019s stupid enough to set course for this cove, we\u2019ll all sit back and watch the rocks chew her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t so many rocks right here.\u201d Bram looked over the edge. In the patch of aquamarine water directly below them, very few boulders littered the surface. A decent-sized rowboat could make its way right up to the bluff\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Fosbury said, \u201cthere\u2019s no French frigate on the horizon today. Nor any American privateers. We\u2019ll leave the ladies to their privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivacy?\u201d Bram echoed. \u201cWhat privacy? You\u2019re all standing up here leering at them while they flip and float like mermaids.\u201d</p><p>Of course, he was no better than the rest. They all stood in silence for a long minute, as one by one the ladies took to the water, rapidly submerging themselves up to their chins in the sea. He counted them. One, two, three little spinsters . . . All the way up to eleven, and Miss Finch\u2014with her unmistakable head of hair\u2014made twelve.</p><p>By God, Bram would welcome a swim right now. He could all but feel the water surrounding him, cool and sensuous. He could all but see Susanna in his mind\u2019s eye, swimming alongside him. Stripped to a wet, translucent shift and wreathed with that glorious, unbound hair. She lay in the shallows, tracing lazy circles with her arms while foamy waves lapped at her breasts.</p><p>Focus, Bramwell.</p><p>Milk-white breasts, just the perfect size for his hands. Tipped with pert, rosy nipples.</p><p>Focus on something else, you addled fool.</p><p>Lowering his weight to a nearby boulder, he began working loose his boots. Once he had them both off, he rolled his sleeves to the elbow. Clad only in breeches and shirt, Bram walked to the extreme end of the rocky ridge where it jutted out over the sea, gripping the sandstone surface with his bare toes.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Colin said. \u201cJust what are you doing? I know this militia isn\u2019t going how you\u2019d planned, and the only thing this set of pathetic souls have in common is shriveled, pathetic sets of their own. But surely matters aren\u2019t that dire.\u201d</p><p>Bram rolled his eyes at his cousin. \u201cI\u2019m just having a look at this path for myself. Since the thought of a rowboat survey has everyone in such a tizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a tizzy,\u201d Colin said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not stupid enough to go walking that cliff\u2019s edge, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I think we could use some time apart.\u201d Bram walked out as far as he could and investigated. As Finn and Rufus had told him, the cut-stone steps descended a ways down the bluff before crumbling into nothingness. No one could ascend this cliff face without the help of ropes and pulleys. Maybe wings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Having satisfied his curiosity, he turned on his boulder perch and faced the men. He wasn\u2019t wearing his officer\u2019s insignia, but he mustered the mien of authority and voice to match.</p><p>\u201cListen sharp, all of you. When I give an order, it will be followed. Today is the absolute last instance in which I will tolerate a moment\u2019s hesitation, on any man\u2019s part. Hemming, hawing, hedging, and fidgeting\u2014and most especially \u2018ask-Miss-Finch-ing\u2019\u2014will heretofore be grounds for immediate discharge, without pay. Am I understood?\u201d</p><p>A mumbled chorus of agreement rose up.</p> <p>He jabbed a thumb into his chest. \u201cI\u2019m your lord and commander now. When I say march, you march. When I say shoot, you shoot. And no matter what Miss Finch would think about it . . . if I tell you to take a flying leap off this cliff, you will damned well leap with a smile.\u201d</p><p>Before he alighted, he allowed himself one last glance down at the cove. All the ladies bobbing and floating in that cool, enticing, blue-crystal sea. One, two, three little spinsters . . .</p><p>He stopped. Frowned. Concentrated and looked again. And then his heart left his chest and tumbled straight off the cliff.</p><p>He counted only eleven.</p><p>Twelve</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Lord Rycliff doing up there?\u201d Charlotte asked, pointing up at the bluff. \u201cPeeping at us? Where are his clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Squinting as she continued to tread water, Susanna watched the barefooted Bram inching closer to the edge of the bluff.</p><p>\u201cHe looks very dire and serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always looks that way.\u201d</p><p>From high above, she heard Lord Payne call out. \u201cDon\u2019t do it, Bram! You have so much to live for!\u201d</p><p>The ladies shrieked as Rycliff, apparently ignoring his cousin, flexed his legs\u2014and jumped.</p> <p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Horrified, Susanna watched his long, perilous dive into the sea. \u201cHe\u2019s done it. He\u2019s seen how hopeless the men are, and it\u2019s driven him to suicide.\u201d</p><p>A mighty splash announced his impact with the water. She could only pray it wasn\u2019t the prelude to an impact with something else. That area was rocky. The entire cove was rocky. More likely than not, he\u2019d struck his head on a boulder and would never surface.</p><p>\u201cGo for help,\u201d she told Charlotte, hitching up the skirts of her bathing costume. \u201cCall to the men up there and tell them to follow the path around to the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . but I\u2019m not dressed. Whatever would Mama say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, this is no time to be missish. This is life and death. Just do as I say.\u201d</p><p>Susanna propelled herself into the water, swimming toward the place he ought to have landed. She sliced through the waves with fast, confident strokes, but her progress was hampered by the dratted bathing costume they all wore for modesty\u2019s sake. The fabric dragged around her ankles, heavy and tangled.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff!\u201d she called, nearing the bottom of the cliff. She pulled up and began to tread water, looking this way and that in vain. She saw a great number of rocks, but none of them resembled his stony lump of a head. \u201cLord Rycliff, are you well?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Her skirt snagged on an obstacle, and the sudden tug pulled her under. She took a swallow of seawater. As she surfaced, she sputtered and coughed.</p> <p>\u201cBram!\u201d she shouted, growing desperate now. \u201cBram, where are you? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>He broke through the surface of the water, not two feet in front of her. Soaked to his skin and wearing a dark, dangerous look.</p><p>He was alive. The burst of relief was so visceral, so swift, she was nearly overwhelmed by it. \u201cBram, what on earth are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He ignored her entirely, looking around the cove instead. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumber twelve.\u201d With a gulp of breath, he disappeared beneath the water\u2019s surface, leaving her treading water, utterly bewildered.</p><p>Number twelve? He wasn\u2019t making any sense. Heavens, this was like that ridiculous sheep-bombing all over again.</p><p>He broke the surface, pushing water off his face. \u201cHave to find her. Dark-haired girl.\u201d</p><p>Minerva. Now it made sense. He was looking for Minerva Highwood. He\u2019d dived off a cliff to save her. The brave, heroic, reckless, misguided idiot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look over there.\u201d He took off swimming, stroking his way around a cluster of boulders.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called, swimming after him. \u201cBram, I can explain. She\u2019s not drowned, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was here. Now she\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it looks that way. But if you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gulped a deep breath and submerged himself again. It seemed an eternity before he surfaced. The man had the lung capacity of a whale.</p><p>When he finally came up for air, Susanna launched herself at him to keep him from going under again.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>She caught him from behind, like a child riding piggyback, wrapping her arms around his shoulders, and her legs\u2014such as the bathing costume permitted\u2014around his waist.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine!\u201d she shouted in his ear, shaking him back and forth. \u201cListen to me. Number twelve. Minerva Highwood. She\u2019s alive and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he managed, breathless. He shook himself, and seawater sprayed her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cave.\u201d She sandwiched his head between her two hands and turned it. \u201cThat way. The entrance is under water at high tide, but I showed her how to swim into it. She\u2019s alive and well and looking for rocks. Geology. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeology.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a time. She rose and fell in the water as he worked to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cIt was good of you,\u201d she said, pressing her cheek to the back of his neck. \u201cIt was good of you to try to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And so are you, thank the Lord.</p><p>Several panting breaths later, he said, \u201cI believe you\u2019re safe to release me. It\u2019s shallow enough to stand.\u201d</p><p>That was when she realized he hadn\u2019t moved once, for all her furious thrashing. She peered over his shoulder. The water hit him midtorso, matting his open shirt to his body. In the notch of his open collar, little droplets of spray clung to the dark hair on his chest, sparkling in the sunlight. Small waves licked at his dark male nipples, perfectly delineated by wet linen.</p><p>And she was plastered to his back, limbs clinging in every direction. Like a deranged octopus.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mortified, she slid off his back. She stretched her feet under her and found solid footing. \u201cWell, that\u2019s rather embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>When she finally dragged her gaze up to his face, she realized he was staring at her nipples now. How predictable. Just like a man. Here she\u2019d been worried he was dead, and he had the nerve to be alive. Outrageously, manifestly virile and strong and alive. How dare he. How dare he?</p><p>What with the excitement of that water rescue exercise, atop several days\u2019 worth of unspoken tension, a revealing haircut, and not least of all, that explosive kiss . . . There was too much emotion building inside her, and it had only two possible outlets. Irrational anger, or . . .</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to contemplate \u201cor.\u201d Irrational anger it would be.</p><p>\u201cYou reckless fool,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou mollusk-brained addlepate. What were you thinking, making a dive like that? Don\u2019t you see these rocks? You could have been killed!\u201d</p><p>His chin jerked. \u201cI might as well ask what you\u2019re doing, swimming out in that horrid getup. You could be dragged underwater like Ophelia and drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swam out here to rescue you, you beastly man. I\u2019m a very strong swimmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. I don\u2019t need rescuing.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and spat another mouthful of seawater. \u201cOh, you will when I\u2019m through with you.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the water\u2019s surface, something brushed her waist. A fish? An eel? She batted at it, whirling.</p><p>\u201cEasy. It\u2019s just me.\u201d His arm slid around her waist, and he pulled her close. They sank into the water, up to their necks. With a one-armed stroke, he tugged her between two boulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at the bluff. \u201cGiving us some privacy. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? Now? We couldn\u2019t converse in some normal time and place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d He pushed a hand through his dark, wet hair. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you. All the time. Everyplace. I have work to do up there. Men to drill. A watch to organize. A castle to defend. But I can\u2019t even concentrate, for thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. This? This was the conversation he wished to have. Well, she could see why he wouldn\u2019t come calling at the house to bring it up over tea.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me why that is, Susanna. Keep in mind, you\u2019re talking to a man who\u2019ll march a hundred miles out of his way, just to avoid a romantic attachment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttachment?\u201d She forced a casual laugh. An unconvincing string of ha-ha-has. \u201cA barrel of warm pitch couldn\u2019t attach me to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, looking perplexed. \u201cI even like it when you snipe at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen me with a gun. If I were to snipe at you, I promise you\u2019d feel it. And you wouldn\u2019t like it one bit.\u201d She had to extricate herself from this situation, and his big, brawny arms. She wrestled in his grip, but he only embraced her more tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away. Not yet.\u201d His deep voice sent ripples through the water. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have this out, you and me. Right here. Right now. I\u2019m going to tell you every wild, erotic, depraved thought you\u2019ve inspired, and then you\u2019re going to run home scared. Lock your bedchamber door and stay there for the next month so I can concentrate and do my damned duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a very poorly thought-out plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking\u2019s not my strong point, of late.\u201d</p><p>This rush of sensual awareness . . . oh, it was dangerous. She could grow to enjoy it. To be honest, she already enjoyed it. But she could grow to crave it, and that would make for difficult, lonely times ahead. She knew he needed a bit of human closeness. Perhaps because of the war he\u2019d gone without it for too long. But at most, he had in mind a frantic tangle of body parts, not a meshing of hearts and souls.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he said simply. Starkly. Composure-destroyingly.</p><p>See? she told herself. He couldn\u2019t be any more plain than that.</p><p>\u201cI want you. I dream about you. I am desperate to be near you,\u201d he said, sending a fresh shiver down her spine. \u201cTo touch you. All over.\u201d His hands roamed over her arms and back. \u201cWhat is this hideous thing you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bathing costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels like a shroud. And it\u2019s too damned opaque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well. That\u2019s rather the point. Opacity.\u201d Her breathing was quick; her words, stupid.</p><p>One of his hands slid down to capture her fingers. He raised them above the water\u2019s surface, shaking them as though they were some kind of damning evidence. \u201cWho wears gloves in the ocean?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese gloves of yours, they drive me mad. I want to strip them from your hands. Kiss those slender wrists, suck on each of those long, delicate fingers. And that would only be the beginning. I want to see the rest of you, too. Yours is a body made for a man\u2019s pleasure. It\u2019s a crime against nature to hide it.\u201d</p><p>This could not be happening. Not to her. She squeezed her eyes shut, then opened them again. \u201cLord Rycliff. You\u2019ve forgotten yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d His green eyes held her captive. \u201cI recall precisely who I am. I\u2019m Lieutenant Colonel Victor St. George Bramwell, the Earl of Rycliff since a few days back. You\u2019re Susanna Jane Finch, and I want to see you bare. Bare, and pale, and soaked to the roots of your hair, glistening with moonlight and drops of seawater. I\u2019d lick the salt from you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His tongue swiped over her cheek, and she gasped. Her nipples peaked, straining against the rough, wet fabric.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>His lips grazed her ear. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly clear of mind. Want to test my recollection? On Mondays, you have country walks. On Tuesdays, sea bathing. Tomorrow, perhaps I\u2019ll come find you in the garden and pull you into the shrubbery.\u201d</p> <p>The suggestion made her weak. She imagined his body, atop hers. The heat of him, contrasting with the cool, damp ground. Her mind conjured the scents of grass and earth.</p><p>\u201cAnd on Thursday . . .\u201d He pulled back and gave her a wicked look. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. We never did get to Thursday. Please tell me on Thursdays you oil yourselves up and wrestle Grecian-style.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou are horrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you love it. That\u2019s the worst of the matter. You want me every bit as badly as I want you. Because I\u2019m exactly what you need. There\u2019s no one else in this village strong enough to take you on. You need a real man, to show you what to do with all that passion seething beneath your surface. You need to be challenged, mastered.\u201d</p><p>Mastered? \u201cYou need to be caged, you beast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA beast is just what you want. A big, dark medieval brute to throw you to the ground, tear the clothes from your body, and have his wicked way with you. I know I\u2019m right. I haven\u2019t forgotten how excited you were in the aftermath of that blast.\u201d</p><p>The nerve of him!</p><p>How could he tell?</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t forgotten the sound you made when I first touched your brow. It wasn\u2019t even a moan, it was more like . . . like a whimper.\u201d</p><p>He made a dismissive sound.</p><p>\u201cOh yes. A plaintive, yearning whimper. Because you want an angel. A sweet, tender virgin to hold you and stroke you and whisper precious promises and make you feel human again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re just begging to be taught a hard, fast lesson in what it means to please a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just longing to put your head in my lap and feel my fingers in your hair.\u201d</p><p>He backed her up against a rock. \u201cYou need a good ravaging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she breathed, \u201cneed a hug.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for long, tense moments. At first, looking each other in the eye. Then looking each other in the lips.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d he said, coming closer. So close she could feel his breath wash warm against her cheek. \u201cI think we\u2019re having one of those vexing arguments again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind where both sides are right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p> <p>And this time, when they kissed, they both made that sound. That deep, moaning, yearning, whimpering sound.</p><p>That sound that said yes.</p><p>And at last.</p><p>And you are exactly what I need.</p><p>She could feel the tension and urgency coiled in his muscles. But his kiss was patience itself. His mouth brushed hers, teasing her lips apart. Her pulse hammered as he made that first tantalizing pass with his tongue.</p><p>Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear.</p><p>There was passion, stockpiled inside her. He\u2019d called her a powder keg, but that would be understating. She saw it all now, stretching in her mind\u2019s eye. Vast storehouses, whole magazines. Here were crates of kisses, never shared. Casks of sweet caresses kept sealed from the rain. Row upon row of breathy moans and sighs, all carefully bottled and tightly corked.</p><p>He uncapped one now, with a clever flick of his tongue. Pressed his thumb to the hinge of her jaw, unlocking yet more desire. He kissed her slow and deep, taking time to explore.</p><p>\u201cBram,\u201d she heard herself whisper. She pushed her hands through his cropped, sleek hair. \u201cOh, Bram.\u201d</p><p>The further he raided, the closer he came to the other rooms. Those unused, cobwebbed chambers of her heart. Would he dare to venture there? She doubted. Jumping off a cliff was a flashy sort of courage, but a man would need true strength and valor to break through those padlocked doors. There were dark, uncharted spaces within her that had been built to house love, and even she was afraid to explore them. Terrified to learn just how vast and how achingly empty they truly were.</p><p>And her heart wasn\u2019t the only aching, empty place. Between her legs, she was both. As they kissed, he slid his hands to her backside and lifted her, bringing her pelvis flush against his. The prominent, hot ridge of his arousal rubbed against her sex. She moaned into his kiss, a wordless plea for something more. Surely he would know how to answer.</p><p>And answer he did.</p><p>He bit down on her lip. Hard.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d He winced away from her, completely breaking their embrace.</p><p>Susanna opened her eyes to see him clutching his head and grimacing with pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil . . . ?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTake that, you brute.\u201d Minerva Highwood moved between them, soaked to the skin and clutching a weighted pouch in her hand.</p><p>\u201cMinerva?\u201d Reeling from the abrupt interruption, Susanna touched a finger to her lip, testing for blood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Finch. I\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>She must have swum out from the cave and . . . and seen them. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, truly.\u201d Susanna\u2019s gaze snapped to the pouch dangling from Minerva\u2019s wrist. It looked like a reticule, fashioned from oilcloth. \u201cWhat\u2019s in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRocks. What else?\u201d</p><p>Rocks. Good Lord. Susanna looked to Bram with fresh concern. The man had just taken a cudgel to the head. It was a wonder he hadn\u2019t fallen unconscious. She started toward him, but Minerva gave a little shriek and backed up, throwing her body in front of Susanna\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself. Here he comes again, the . . . the rutting Zeus.\u201d</p><p>Bram was clearly still dazed, rubbing his head with one hand. With a growl of pain and a sudden, lurching motion, he stood tall\u2014rising head, shoulders, and exquisitely chiseled torso out of the water. Water droplets sprayed everywhere, catching the sunlight and flashing like tiny sparks.</p><p>Rutting Zeus, indeed. He did rather look like a linen-draped Greek god, dripping with potency and a divine air of possession. The sight took Susanna\u2019s breath away. She briefly wondered if she\u2019d been hit over the head with a sackful of rocks. He was beautiful. Dazzling in his masculine perfection.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Minerva scrambled onto a nearby boulder, readying her stone-packed reticule. \u201cI\u2019ll save you, Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>Susanna reached for her. \u201cMinerva, no! There\u2019s no need. He wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Splash.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Bram came to consciousness slowly, floating into awareness on a gentle, soothing wave. The world was dark, but he was warm all over. Delicious sensation lapped at his wounded leg, stroking away all the pain and soreness with a light, rhythmic touch.</p><p>As his eyes fluttered open, questions teased at the frayed edge of his mind. Where was he? Just who was touching him? And how did he make sure it never, ever stopped?</p><p>\u201cOh, Bram.\u201d Susanna\u2019s voice. \u201cMy goodness. Just look at this.\u201d</p><p>He struggled up on one elbow, wincing at the sudden lash of pain. He saw a tangle of white sheets. He saw his own dark, hairy legs. He saw her hands on his skin.</p><p>Her bare, ungloved hands.</p><p>He fell back against the mattress, seeking sleep again. Obviously, he was hallucinating. Or dead. Her touch felt like heaven.</p><p>\u201cThis explains so much,\u201d she said, clucking her tongue in mother-hen fashion. \u201cYou\u2019re compensating for this withered appendage.\u201d</p><p>Withered appendage? What the devil was she talking about? He shook his head, trying to clear it. Colin\u2019s dire predictions of shriveled twigs and dried currants rattled in his skull.</p><p>Wide awake now, he fought to sit up, wrestling the sheets. \u201cListen, you. I don\u2019t know what sort of liberties you\u2019ve taken while I was insensible, or just what your spinster imagination prepared you to see. But I\u2019ll have you know, that water was damned cold.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cI\u2019m referring to your leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His leg. That withered appendage.</p><p>How long had he been unconscious? An hour? More? She\u2019d changed into a frock of striped muslin, but her hair was still wet, combed back from her face in dark amber furrows.</p><p>Her hands kept stroking. He saw that her fingers were glistening, coated with some sort of liniment. The herbal scent of it filled his head. Lust sent his blood rushing everywhere else. It had to be a sign of his prolonged celibacy that viewing her ungloved hands aroused him more than a woman\u2019s full nakedness had in the past.</p><p>Or maybe it was a sign that he wanted this woman more fiercely than he\u2019d ever wanted another.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked, looking about the room. A light, airy bedchamber, done up in chintz and hardwood. The mattress beneath him felt bowed like a hammock, strained and tested by his weight.</p><p>\u201cSummerfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith great difficulty. You weigh as much as an ox. But you\u2019ll be glad to hear your men rallied to the challenge.\u201d</p><p>Deuce it. Damn it. Devil take it and fling it off a cliff. His second full day in command of new recruits, and he\u2019d capped it by dropping unconscious, felled by a squinty bluestocking and her reticule. They\u2019d carried his dead weight all the way here, likely passing through the village on the way and attracting a crowd of onlookers. Even the sheep had probably watched the processional, bleating with smug satisfaction. He was their lord and commander, and now they\u2019d all seen him at his most feeble.</p><p>\u201cMust have amused you, seeing me bludgeoned so soundly by a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI was terrified.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t terrified at the moment. Just look at her leaning over him, giving him bold flashes of her pale, freckled bosom. Stroking his bared leg with talented, fearless fingers. Earlier, she\u2019d called him a beast. Now she was treating him like a broken-winged bird.</p><p>He snarled down at his wounded leg. Withered appendage, indeed.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She pressed a cup into his hand. \u201cDrink this.\u201d</p><p>He eyed it skeptically. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelief from pain, in liquid form. My own special preparation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a healer?\u201d He frowned, and it hurt. \u201cShould have figured you for one of those females with her little basket of herbs and sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHerbs are good. They have their uses. For a wound like this, you need drugs.\u201d</p><p>He sipped. \u201cUgh. That is vile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much for you? If you like, I can add some honey. That\u2019s what I do for the village children.\u201d</p><p>He tossed back the rest of her potion without comment. He truly couldn\u2019t comment, what with the bitter taste scorching his throat.</p><p>After setting the drained cup aside, she returned her attention to his leg. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bullet happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle you didn\u2019t lose the leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a miracle, it was sheer force of will. Believe me, those bloodthirsty field surgeons tried to take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I believe you. I\u2019ve known my share of bloodthirsty surgeons. My youth was rife with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you ill as a child?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She dipped her fingers into the crock of liniment and moved her attentions up his leg, to his aching thigh muscles. Of course, by soothing the pain in those muscles, she was only creating new aches in his groin. Didn\u2019t she know how dangerous it could be to provoke a man this way?</p><p>He ought to tell her to stop. He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Her touch was . . . God, it was just what he\u2019d been needing. She was talented indeed.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you fend them off?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe field surgeons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne,\u201d he said. \u201cSat by my bedside with a pistol cocked, ready to fire at the first gleam of a bone saw.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI imagine Thorne could have scared them off with a look.\u201d She traced a scar on the side of his knee, a thin line that stood out against the gnarled mess. \u201cBut someone operated here. Someone skilled.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTook three days, but we found a surgeon who promised not to amputate.\u201d</p><p>She traced a horizontal line across his thigh, above the bullet wound. There was no scar tissue there, but a leather strap had worn him bald in a telltale stripe of pale, baby-smooth skin. A matching band of hairless skin circled his upper calf. She touched that, too. He winced, not at the pain, but at the exposure. He hoped she wouldn\u2019t understand the significance of those bands.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been wearing a brace,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you remove it? Bram, you can\u2019t simply ignore an injury of this magnitude.\u201d</p><p>He had to ignore it. His purpose was not only training men, but leading them, inspiring them. How could he accomplish that with such an obvious weakness?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m healed,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt scarcely pains me anymore.\u201d</p> <p>She made a gruff, incredulous noise. \u201cLiar. You\u2019re in great pain. And more than the usual amount today, I\u2019d wager, after all that marching about the countryside. The water must have felt good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did. But not as good as you.\u201d He reached for her, suddenly eager to take the aggressive role. He\u2019d been lying here helplessly for much too long.</p><p>She batted his hand aside. \u201cYou should still be wearing the brace. Look at this swelling.\u201d Her fingertip traced his red, misshapen knee. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready to march without it.\u201d</p><p>Her pitying touch, those limiting words . . . Something in him snapped.</p><p>He seized her wrist in a grip so tight, she gasped. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I\u2019m ready to do.\u201d He squeezed harder still. \u201cDo you hear me? Don\u2019t ever tell me what I can\u2019t do. Those surgeons told me I\u2019d never walk again. I proved them wrong. My superiors think I can\u2019t command troops. I\u2019ll prove them wrong, too. If you mean to treat me like an invalid\u2014a man you can coddle and nurse and stroke without any hint of danger . . .\u201d He yanked on her wrist, pulling her atop him. He cinched his other arm around her waist. \u201cI\u2019ll have to prove you wrong, as well.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed. \u201cRelease me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>She struggled in his grip, and her short, quick breaths gave him a luscious display of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work, love. My leg might be injured, but I\u2019m strong as a bull everywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven bulls have their weaknesses.\u201d He felt her wriggling, insinuating one of her lithe, slender legs between his. The hot friction of their bodies, through just the thin layers of her frock and a linen sheet, had him aching. She made a quick strike, trying to knee him in the groin. Oh, she understood how to hurt a man. But he was one move ahead of her. He scissored his good leg over hers, trapping her lower body. Then he flipped them both, putting her on her back.</p><p>\u201cThere. I have you,\u201d he said, pinning one hand over her head. \u201cAnd what will you do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll scream. There are two footmen just outside this room. My father\u2019s sleeping down the corridor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, scream. Call the footmen and your father in. We\u2019ll be found in a very compromising position. My career will be over, you\u2019ll be ruined, and we\u2019ll be stuck together for life. We can\u2019t have that, now can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, no.\u201d</p> <p>Bram stared down at her. Odd. He\u2019d spent his entire adulthood avoiding romantic entanglements. But here he was, completely tangled with this woman, and the idea of being forced to marry her didn\u2019t horrify him the way it ought. In fact, if he let himself envision spending a lifetime of nights in a graciously appointed bedchamber, atop a soft, clean mattress, with her lovely scent of herbs in the air and her pale body writhing under his . . .</p><p>It was the strangest, most foreign and unlikely image. But curiously, he didn\u2019t hate it.</p><p>She squirmed beneath him. \u201cBrute. Beast.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he kissed her on the forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d He\u2019d much rather have her scorn than her pity. Pity made him feel helpless. Provoking her ire made him feel alive. And she was so wonderfully easy to provoke.</p><p>\u201cGod, having you under me, in a bed . . .\u201d He kissed her, just at the corner of her lips. \u201cYou drive me mad with wanting, Susanna. We\u2019d be so good together.\u201d</p><p>He gentled his grip on her wrist, but kept it pinned with just the weight of his arm atop hers. He slid one thumb along the line of her jaw, covering her racing pulse. Then dipping lower, caressing the tender slope of her throat. Her skin was so soft. Had she bathed? he wondered. Or would she still taste of the sea?</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point. You\u2019re a big, strong man, and I\u2019m a helpless female. Now let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll release you, if that\u2019s truly what you want. But I don\u2019t think it is.\u201d</p><p>Flipping his hand, he slid the backs of his fingers down her chest, all the way to her bosom. He skimmed the exposed edge of her chemise. The sheer, lacy fabric rose and fell with her rhythmic breaths, like froth riding the edge of a wave.</p><p>If she wanted him to stop, she could stop him. Her arms were virtually unrestrained. He levered his weight onto one elbow. A quick dart to the side, and she\u2019d be free.</p><p>She glanced in that very direction, obviously thinking the same.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t move. She wanted this, too.</p><p>In a slow, sure claiming, he fitted his palm over her breast. She bit back a gasp.</p><p>Bram struggled to contain his own groan of pleasure. The soft, round swell fit his hand so perfectly, warming under his touch. As he held her, her nipple tightened to a knot, pressing against the center of his palm. Just a small, concentrated dot of sensation, but unspeakably arousing. Her body was responding to his, calling to his. His cock answered, stiffening to a painful degree.</p><p>He bent his head and pressed his lips to her bared throat, kneading the taut globe of her breast as he kissed a slow trail downward. She did taste of salt, and of sweet femininity. He licked her, sliding his tongue in a lazy, serpentine path over her collarbone. Then dipping down, to trace the border of her d\u00e9colletage. There, her close-fitted bodice thwarted him. He slipped a single finger between fabric and skin, forcing the neckline to give, just a little. He needed to touch her there, feel that tight bead of her nipple press against the pad of his fingertip.</p><p>Working in tiny arcs, he skimmed his touch lower, exploring the warm satin of her skin. Learning the unique geography of the plump, delectable globe. His thumb finally grazed the textured edge of her areola, and triumph surged through him. He felt like a conquistador discovering a new territory. An enticing round island of promise, bordered by rippling dunes and capped with an upward-thrusting peak. He climbed it in increments, panting for breath. God, just a little further . . .</p><p>There.</p><p>She gave a startled, breathy cry, and her whole body bowed against his. Her passionate response nearly undid him. His thoughts unraveled, leaving him with just one thread of concentration.</p><p>More.</p><p>That was all he could think, all he could understand. More. He needed more of her. How could he stroke more, touch more, kiss more? He still had one of her arms pinned overhead. If he lowered it to her side, he reasoned, her neckline would have more give. He would make it yield to him, so he could take that delicious, straining peak into his mouth. But when he rose up a bit, meaning to draw her arm down to her side . . .</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>He froze, staring. Struggling to make sense of what he beheld. From wrist to elbow, her delicate skin was a crosshatch of scars.</p><p>With a sharp mental tug, he reined in the arousal charging through his body. So here was the reason she always wore those enticing, buttoned gloves. She was hiding something, too.</p><p>Something much more serious than a nettle in her paw.</p><p>\u201cSusanna fair,\u201d he said, skimming a touch over her marked skin. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>Susanna winced at his touch. Inside, she crumpled. She ought to have known she couldn\u2019t hide them forever. That she would never get this close to a man without those dratted scars ruining everything, one way or another.</p><p>\u201cHow old are these?\u201d he asked, tracing a thin, healed line with his fingertip.</p><p>\u201cQuite old,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing. From gardening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGardening? Did you pick a death match with a rosebush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She arched her back, rubbing her breasts against his chest. His touch had felt so good. So right. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we just go back to where we left off?\u201d</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>As she wriggled beneath him, he used his weight and strength to keep her pinned. Not out of conquest, it seemed, but out of concern. \u201cWhat happened? Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She hesitated. Then she took a deep breath and decided to just be honest. He could make of the truth what he would. \u201cThey\u2019re from bloodletting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many?\u201d He cursed softly, running his fingertips over the ladder of scarred skin. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t ill as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ill. That didn\u2019t stop the surgeons from trying to cure me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her gaze slanted to the corner. A wild pulse pounded in her ears, like a warning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my scars,\u201d he reminded her, easing aside to give her space. \u201cI\u2019ve told you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the year after my mother died.\u201d Her own voice sounded flat, remote. \u201cPapa thought I needed feminine influence\u2014someone to see that I grew into a young lady. So he sent me to Norfolk, to stay with relations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you took ill there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly with homesickness. But my cousins didn\u2019t know what to do with me. They saw it their duty to make me ready for society, but they lamented that I would never fit in. I was tall and freckled, and my hair gave them the vapors. Not to mention, my behavior left much to be desired. I was . . . difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you were.\u201d</p><p>She felt a stab of hurt at the flip comment. It must have been evident, for he quickly qualified his remark.</p><p>\u201cI only mean,\u201d he said, \u201cthat was perfectly natural. You were sent to live with virtual strangers, and your mother had just died.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey understood that, at first. But when weeks went by and my comportment failed to improve . . . they thought something more must be wrong. That was when they called in the doctors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho bled you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo begin with. They prescribed a variety of treatments, over time. I didn\u2019t respond as they hoped, you see. I do have an obstinate streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ve noticed that.\u201d He smiled a little. The warmth in his eyes gave her strength to continue.</p><p>\u201cThe doctors bled me more, dosed me with emetics and purgatives. After that, I refused my meals, took to hiding in the cupboards. They called the doctors back again, and again. When I fought them, they decided I suffered from hysteria. My treatments increased. Two footmen would restrain me, so the doctor could take yet more blood, dose me with more poison. They would bind me in blankets until I was drenched with sweat, and then force me to bathe in ice-cold water.\u201d</p><p>The painful memories rushed in on her, but they weren\u2019t as difficult to voice as she\u2019d thought they\u2019d be. After all this time, the words just flowed out of her, as if\u2014</p><p>Oh, now there was an ironic thought.</p><p>As if she\u2019d opened a vein.</p><p>\u201cThey . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cThey shaved off all my hair and applied leeches to my scalp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Guilt twisted his features. \u201cThe other day on the green, when I threatened to cut your hair . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Bram, please don\u2019t feel that way. You didn\u2019t know. How could you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cJust tell me everything now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told the worst of it, truly. Just one vile, useless treatment after another. In the end, I was so weakened by it all, I truly took ill.\u201d</p> <p>Frowning intently, he smoothed the hair from her brow. His eyes were the angry green of tempest-swept seas.</p><p>\u201cYou look so grieved,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pinched. Truly? Why would he care about the medical travails of a spinster, years upon years in the past? Surely war had shown him much worse. It had done far worse to him. And yet, something in his serious, battle-ready expression told her he did care. That if it were in any way humanly possible, he would go back in time and impale those surgeons on their own bloody lancets.</p><p>She could love him. God help her, she could love him for that alone.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right now. I did survive.\u201d She gave him a smile tipped with self-effacing humor, to keep the tale from growing too maudlin. Or perhaps to keep herself from bursting into grateful tears.</p><p>\u201cThat obstinate streak was to thank, I imagine. No doubt you simply refused to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. I don\u2019t remember much of the illness, mercifully. I grew so weak, they sent an express to my father, thinking my time was near. He arrived, took one look at me, bundled me up in his cloak, and had me out of that house within the hour. He was furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can believe it. I\u2019m furious now.\u201d</p><p>Blinking a moist sheen from her eyes, she cast a glance around the room. \u201cThat\u2019s when we moved here, to Summerfield. He bought the place so I could convalesce by the sea. Slowly, I recovered. I didn\u2019t need doctors or surgeons. Just nourishing food and fresh air. Once I was well enough, exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said thoughtfully, running his thumb over her scars, \u201cthese are why . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re why.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask for further explanation, but she gave it anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou see, my father did eventually take me to London for my presentation at Court. And just as my cousins had predicted, I didn\u2019t fit in. But while I was standing at the edges of those elegant ballrooms, I realized there were others like me. Girls who, for one reason or another, didn\u2019t square with expectations. Who were in danger of being sent to some dreadful spa to take a \u2018cure\u2019 they didn\u2019t need. I began inviting them here for the summer. Just a few friends at first, but the number has grown each year. Mrs. Nichols is glad for the steady custom at the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you turned your own talents to healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take after my father, I suppose. He\u2019s an inventor. All those surgeons\u2019 failed experiments made me curious to find better methods.\u201d</p><p>Again, he traced his fingertips over the crosshatch of scars. So many of them, from the razor-thin, superficial lines to the thick, gnarled evidence of a formidable fleam\u2014a wooden implement nearly as thick as her wrist. She still shuddered to recall it.</p><p>\u201cDamned butchers,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen veterinarians tap horses\u2019 arteries with less injury incurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marks would have been fainter if I\u2019d struggled less. Do they . . .\u201d She resisted the urge to look away. \u201cDo they disgust you?\u201d</p> <p>In response, he pressed a kiss to her scarred wrist. Then another. Emotion swelled in her breast.</p><p>\u201cDo you think me weaker for them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He cursed in denial. \u201cThese have nothing to do with weakness, Susanna. They\u2019re only proof of your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I don\u2019t think you weaker for your scars, either.\u201d She stared deep into his eyes, willing him to absorb the meaning of her words. \u201cNo one would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d he argued, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. Your wounds can be hidden. They don\u2019t cause you to limp, or fall, or lag behind those you\u2019re meant to lead.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps not. But she was only just beginning to understand, her scars had held her back in different ways. She\u2019d been afraid, for so long, to come this close to a man. To let the gloves come off, and take the chance of being hurt again.</p><p>\u201cThere are differences, to be sure,\u201d she whispered, drawing him down. \u201cBut I do know how it feels to fight a long, slow recovery. To feel confined in your own body, so frustrated with its limitations. And I know what it is to crave closeness, Bram. You don\u2019t have to attack me every time you wish to be touched. To be held.\u201d</p><p>She stretched her arms around him. He lay silent atop her, and she knew a moment of fear. She wanted to give him the same comfort he\u2019d given her, but she was afraid of doing everything wrong. With trembling fingers, she stroked a light caress down his spine.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He exhaled against her neck. \u201cYes, touch me. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>She caressed him with both hands now, covering his back with smooth, even strokes.</p><p>\u201cSusanna?\u201d he said, after minutes had passed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel strange. Can\u2019t lift my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the drugs. They\u2019re taking you under now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSu-san-naa,\u201d he half whispered, half sang, in a slurred, drunken tone. \u201cSusanna fair with brazen hair.\u201d As she laughed, he pressed his brow to her pounding pulse. \u201cThat\u2019s the perfect word for you, \u2018brazen.\u2019 Do you know why? Because your hair is like molten bronze. All gold and red and glowing. And you\u2019re bold and fearless, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have so many fears.\u201d Her heart was thumping like a hare\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fear me. That first day, when we met. Those few seconds after the blast . . . you were under me, just like this. Soft. Warm. The perfect place to land. And you trusted me. I could see it in your eyes. You trusted me to guard you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t help myself. So pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d She turned her head to kiss him quiet. Her heart couldn\u2019t take any more. The faint, drugging taste of laudanum lingered on his lips. \u201cJust rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould have garroted those surgeons,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYour relations, too. Never would have let them hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but smile at his sweet promises of violence, offered up like a posy of carnivorous blooms.</p><p>\u201cI suppose they did mean to help,\u201d she said. \u201cMy relations, I mean. They just didn\u2019t know better. Looking back, I know I presented a challenge. I was so awkward and stubborn. Not a ladylike bone in my body. They used to set me at copying pages from this horrid, insipid book. Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom for Young Ladies. Oh, Bram. You would laugh at it so.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long moment. Then his chest rumbled\u2014not with a laugh, but with a loud, resonant snore.</p><p>She laughed at herself, and at the same time hot tears spilled from her eyes. In his sleep, he flexed a protective arm around her. His embrace felt so right.</p><p>Perhaps she could trust him to guard her. He was strong and principled, and she had no doubt he would risk his life to keep her safe, in body. But he couldn\u2019t make any promises to guard her heart.</p><p>And in her heart, she feared she was already falling. Tumbling headlong toward a world of pain.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>Susanna released the rose blossom and stared at the tiny drop of welling blood on her finger. Reflexively, she stuck it in her mouth, soothing the hurt.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d she called across the garden, \u201cwould you finish the roses for me? I\u2019ve forgotten my gloves this morning.\u201d</p><p>Incredible. She never forgot her gloves.</p><p>She left the roses and moved to the herbal bed, gathering great fistfuls of thorn-free lavender and snipping them free with shears. Soon her basket was heaped to overflowing with fragrant stalks. And still, she kept piling them higher.</p><p>Whenever she tried to still them, her hands began to tremble. Maybe because they were still heavy with the feel of his skin, his hair.</p><p>At this very moment, Bram remained asleep upstairs on the upper floor of Summerfield. Meanwhile, down here in the garden, Susanna was forced to keep up the Wednesday habit of hosting the Spindle Cove ladies. Gardening first, tea after. Normally, she appreciated both their company and their help. But today, she would have far rather been alone with her thoughts.</p><p>Because her thoughts were all of him. They made her blush. They made her feel uncorseted, exposed. They made her sigh\u2014aloud, for heaven\u2019s sake. Ladies clustered all around her, pulling weeds, cutting blooms, sketching bumblebees and blossoms. But when Susanna knelt beside the feverfew and let her gaze go unfocused, her thoughts climbed straight upstairs.</p><p>She saw him. Dark, powerful limbs, covered with even darker hair, all tangled among the white, crisp sheets. Her sleeping beast. In her mind\u2019s eye, she approached the bed, eased onto the mattress beside him. Stroked his cropped, velvet hair. Kissed the notch carved between his throat and clavicle. Heat raced along her skin, gathered between her thighs.</p><p>And then he woke, capturing her with his strong arms and that compassionate green gaze. His heavy weight atop her was a blessing, not a burden or a threat.</p><p>Susanna fair, he said. You were the perfect place to land.</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch. Miss Finch!\u201d</p><p>She shook herself, coming back into the present. \u201cYes, Mrs. Lange?\u201d How long had the poor woman been trying to catch her attention?</p><p>\u201cDid you want me to divide these lilies today? Or shall we leave them for another week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Whatever you think best.\u201d</p><p>From beneath her straw bonnet, the other woman gave her an impatient look. \u201cIt is your garden, Miss Finch. And you always have an opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, dear?\u201d Mrs. Highwood asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you to be so distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s not. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what has you so out of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a what.\u201d Minerva looked up from her sketchbook. \u201cIt\u2019s a who.\u201d</p><p>Susanna gave her a warning look. \u201cMinerva, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I do. And you mustn\u2019t be ashamed to talk about it, Miss Finch. You needn\u2019t suffer in silence, and the ladies ought to know. They may need to protect themselves.\u201d She closed her sketchbook and turned to the assembled ladies. \u201cIt\u2019s Lord Rycliff, the vile man. He did not hit his head when he made that dive yesterday. He survived the fall with no harm, and then he attacked Miss Finch in the cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva.\u201d Susanna put her hand to her temple. \u201cHe did not attack me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did!\u201d She turned to the others. \u201cWhen I came upon them, they were both drenched to the skin. Poor Miss Finch was shaking like a leaf, and he had his hands . . . Well, let\u2019s just say he had his hands in places they oughtn\u2019t be. She tried to fend him off, but he wasn\u2019t having any of it.\u201d</p><p>I like it when you snipe at me. A thrill raced through her at the memory.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate I came along when I did,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cAnd that I\u2019d made such a good find of weighty specimens that morning.\u201d</p><p>Fortunate? Perhaps it was. Lord only knew what liberties Susanna would have allowed him without Minerva\u2019s interruption. And if those drugs hadn\u2019t carried him off to sleep last night . . .</p><p>She\u2019d stayed an hour in his arms, unable to leave. Stroking his strong back and shoulders and listening to his gentle, rumbling snore. When she\u2019d sensed herself drifting off to sleep too, she\u2019d extricated herself from the bed and returned to her own room. Watching over a wounded man as he slept . . . that much was a healer\u2019s duty. Sleeping with him . . . now that was the privilege of a wife.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t his wife, she reminded herself. She had no business sharing a bed\u2014or a cove, or an armory\u2014with the man. No matter how passionate he proved her to be, or how exhilarated his caresses made her feel, or how sweetly he kissed her damaged wrists. If she gave into fleeting pleasure with him, she could lose everything she\u2019d worked so hard to build. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could lose everything now, if Minerva\u2019s \u201chelpful\u201d reports weren\u2019t contained.</p><p>\u201cMinerva, you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cYou weren\u2019t wearing your spectacles, and you don\u2019t know what you saw.\u201d To the others, she declared, \u201cI swam out to check on Lord Rycliff\u2019s health. We were discussing it when Minerva came along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t discussing, it was grappling,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not that blind. I know very well what I saw. He kissed you!\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Lange made an outraged squawk. \u201cI knew it. Men are such filthy invaders. I shall write a poem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kissed you?\u201d Kate\u2019s eyes flew wide. \u201cLord Rycliff kissed you? Yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Minerva answered for her. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t the first time, from the looks of things. Clearly he\u2019s been molesting her ever since he arrived in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Susanna lowered herself onto the nearest bench. She felt her life unraveling at its seams.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is wonderful,\u201d Mrs. Highwood said, coming to sit at Susanna\u2019s side. \u201cI knew you\u2019d caught his eye, my dear. And Lord Payne has shown a marked preference for my Diana. Just think, the two of you could be cousins by marriage!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am not marrying Lord Rycliff,\u201d Susanna insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would cause you to say such a thing.\u201d And she wished the older woman would stop saying it so loud. The man was still on the grounds of Summerfield, and there was no way of knowing when he might wake. He could be awake now.</p><p>He might be stretching, flexing those powerful limbs beyond the edges of the mattress and yawning like a grizzled lion.</p><p>\u201cLord Payne has not shown me any particular favor,\u201d Diana said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t wish him to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPish. The man asked you to cut his hair! He\u2019s titled, handsome as the devil, and rich besides. Pretty as you are, he\u2019ll no doubt offer for you soon. See if you can\u2019t contrive to be trapped in a cove with him. A kiss would do the trick, I warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d Diana and Minerva spoke in unison.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with all of you?\u201d Mrs. Highwood asked, looking from one to the other. \u201cThese men are lords. They are powerful, wealthy. You ought to encourage them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve me, encouragement is the last thing that\u2019s needed.\u201d Upon speaking the words, Susanna instantly worried. Would Bram take their encounter last night as encouragement? Did she wish him to? They understood each other now, on a level that went more than skin-deep. Assuming he retained some memory of the conversation when he woke.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff is not looking for a wife,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cAnd neither is his cousin. If we were so foolish as to \u2018encourage\u2019 them, we would risk not only our own reputations, but the reputation of Spindle Cove.\u201d She looked from woman to woman around the group. \u201cDo you all understand me? Nothing is going on here. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Miss Finch\u2014\u201d Minerva objected.</p><p>\u201cMinerva.\u201d Susanna turned to her, hoping her new friend would someday understand and forgive her this harshness. \u201cI am sorry to say it, but you are mistaken in what you saw, and your persistence is becoming wearisome. Lord Rycliff did not attack me yesterday, or any day. Nothing improper has transpired between us. In fact, he only made that jump from the cliff because he thought you had drowned and he hoped to save your life. To impugn his character after that brave, albeit misguided action seems most ungracious. My part in this conversation is concluded.\u201d</p><p>Minerva blinked at her, clearly hurt. Susanna felt horrible, but the future of their community was at stake. Where would Minerva hunt her fossils if word reached London of spinsters gone wild, and the Queen\u2019s Ruby was forced to close its doors?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be called to tea shortly.\u201d She picked up her basket and headed inside. \u201cUntil then, I\u2019ll be in the stillroom, pounding herbs. I\u2019m running low on liniment.\u201d</p><p>Kate followed her. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d As they neared the house, she whispered, \u201cHow was it? The kiss.\u201d</p><p>Susanna suppressed a little cry of frustration.</p> <p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d Kate said, propping open the stillroom door. When both had entered, she swiftly shut and locked it behind them. \u201cMiss Finch, you know I won\u2019t tell a soul. I have nowhere else to live but here. Spindle Cove\u2019s fate is my fate, too.\u201d</p><p>Susanna leaned against the door and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWas it wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful\u201d wasn\u2019t the word. There were no words to describe the wild, breathless flood of sensation.</p><p>And there was no way she could keep it a secret one instant longer. She gave a tiny nod and whispered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Kate clutched her arm. \u201cI knew it. You must tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kate. I can\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t even have admitted that much.\u201d She began taking bottles down from the shelves and snipped a bundle of dried St. John\u2019s wort from its string. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t ever happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he means to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. And I have no plans to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry,\u201d Kate said. \u201cTruly, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just my only chance to know. I mean . . . It won\u2019t ever be me, kissed in the cove by a lord.\u201d</p><p>Susanna let pestle drop against mortar. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be you? You\u2019re beautiful, and so talented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an orphan of unknown family. A nobody. What\u2019s more, a nobody with this.\u201d She touched the birthmark at her temple.</p><p>Susanna set aside her work entirely and placed both hands on her friend\u2019s shoulders, looking her square in the eye. \u201cKate, if that little mark is your greatest imperfection, then you are surely the most lovely and lovable woman I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t seem to agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve been meeting all the wrong men.\u201d</p><p>At the echo of Bram\u2019s words to her, Susanna bit back a rueful smile. No matter what happened, life would always be a bit different now. Because at last, Susanna knew what it was to feel desired, flaws and all. She felt the unexpected warmth of it lighting her from the inside, and she wanted Kate to experience the same.</p><p>\u201cYour admirer will come along someday. I\u2019m sure of it. But in the meantime . . .\u201d She tugged one of her friend\u2019s chestnut curls. \u201cThis is Spindle Cove, Kate. We base our self-worth on our qualities and accomplishments, not just the opinions of gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I know.\u201d A sheepish look stole into Kate\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible to stop thinking about them, just the same.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Susanna silently agreed. It was. And with their leader indisposed upstairs, she suddenly worried what trouble the rest of the men were finding today.</p><p>In the shadow of Rycliff Castle, Colin Sandhurst regarded his troops.</p><p>They were his troops for the day, he presumed, since his fool cousin remained unconscious. Colin had warned him not to take that ridiculous dive off the cliff, but did Bram ever listen to him? Oh no. Of course not.</p><p>He\u2019d half expected the whole militia business to be over after that show of absurdity. But apparently the lure of eight shillings and the promise of high entertainment had brought the recruits back for another day.</p><p>He clapped his hands together. \u201cRight, then. Gather round, fellows. Over here.\u201d</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Thorne shot him a smug look. \u201cFall in line!\u201d he barked.</p><p>The men fell in line.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Corporal Thorne.\u201d Colin cleared his throat and addressed the men. \u201cAs you all know, our stalwart commander is currently flat on his back, nursing a head wound. A wound, I might add, given him by a little nothing of a girl. So today, as your first lieutenant, I am in charge. And we\u2019re going to have a different sort of drill today.\u201d</p><p>Keane, the vicar, raised a hand. \u201cAre we going to learn a new formation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin told him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stage an invasion. Those little ladies down there in Spindle Cove have occupied what should be your village. Our village. Are we going to roll over and take that?\u201d</p><p>The men looked from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Colin supplied, exasperated. \u201cNo, we are not going to take that, not one evening more.\u201d</p><p>Bram had the right idea, at least. These men definitely needed some help reattaching their bollocks and reasserting their dominance in this village. But his cousin had the wrong tactic, appealing to some vague sense of honor and duty. There was a much better source of motivation\u2014that primal, undeniable impulse that drove every man.</p><p>Sex.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he announced, \u201cis the night we take back that village. And we\u2019re not going to do it by marching in lines or committing acts of brave idiocy. We\u2019re going to do it by being men. Manly men. The kind of men a woman wants to take control.\u201d</p><p>Brows wrinkled in confusion.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d The blacksmith looked around the group. \u201cWe are men. Last I checked, anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of having the proper equipment. It\u2019s using the equipment properly.\u201d Leaping up on a crate, Colin spread his arms wide. \u201cLook at me. Now look at yourselves. Now look back at me. I am the man you want to be like.\u201d</p><p>Dawes crossed his arms. \u201cWhy is that, precisely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many women I\u2019ve bedded?\u201d When Rufus and Finn perked, he waved at them. \u201cHave a guess, boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen,\u201d offered Finn.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . nineteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here all day. Let\u2019s just call the number more than you can imagine. Because clearly, that is the case.\u201d Under his breath, he added, \u201cPerhaps higher than you know how to count.\u201d He raised one arm over his head. \u201cTonight, we\u2019re going to march down to that village, and we\u2019re going to enjoy ourselves in our tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the tea shop?\u201d Fosbury asked. \u201cBut this is the ladies\u2019 card night.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018But this is the ladies\u2019 card night,\u2019 \u201d Colin mimicked in a high-pitched voice. \u201cThat right there is your problem. You\u2019ve all let yourselves be henpecked. Gelded, by this gaggle of bluestockings. Tonight, the ladies are not going to play cards. They\u2019re going to dance.\u201d</p><p>Fosbury scratched the back of his neck. \u201cWell, that is what they do sometimes on Fridays. Dancing. But just with each other. They don\u2019t ask us to join in.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Colin massaged the bridge of his nose. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait for them to ask us, Fosbury.\u201d He dropped his hand and motioned to Dawes. \u201cYou, there. How do you ask a woman to dance?\u201d</p><p>The blacksmith shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>Finn\u2019s hand shot up. \u201cI know! I\u2019ve heard Sally saying it to the mirror. \u2018May I have the pleasure of this dance?\u2019 \u201d He affected a flourish and bow.</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d Colin said. \u201cAll wrong.\u201d He lifted his voice. \u201cEvery man, repeat after me. \u2018I believe this dance is mine.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The men mumbled the words back at him.</p><p>Pathetic.</p><p>Colin drew out his double-barreled pistol, cocked it carefully, raised it level with his shoulder, and shot it into the air. The resounding crack caught the group\u2019s attention. \u201cSay it with conviction. \u2018I believe this dance is mine.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The men cleared their throats and shuffled their feet, saying, \u201cI believe this dance is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. Try this. Your hair is a river of silk.\u201d When he got only puzzled stares in return, he explained, \u201cThe first line gets her in your arms. If you\u2019re going to woo a woman to your bed, you need a few more pretty words. Now repeat after me, damn it. \u2018Your hair is a river of silk.\u2019 \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c \u2018Your hair is a river of silk,\u2019 \u201d they echoed.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere.\u201d He paused, considering. \u201cNow this one. \u2018Your eyes sparkle like diamonds.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>They repeated, with a bit more spirit this time.</p> <p>\u201c \u2018Your breasts are alabaster orbs.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rufus objected. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m not saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have some better suggestion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just say she\u2019s got a fair set of titties?\u201d</p><p>Colin looked to Keane. \u201cVicar, cover your ears.\u201d</p> <p>The man actually did it.</p><p>Colin groaned. Leaping down from the crate, he approached Rufus. \u201cNow listen, lad. You don\u2019t go speaking of titties. It\u2019s crude. The ladies won\u2019t like it. Not unless you\u2019re well into the heat of things. Then, depending on the woman, she may like it well indeed. But when seduction is your aim, you can\u2019t go wrong with alabaster orbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all sorts of wrong, that is.\u201d Thorne crossed his arms. \u201cAlabaster\u2019s cold and hard. Don\u2019t know what kind of teats you\u2019ve been suckling, but I like flesh-and-blood women myself. Don\u2019t you have something better than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. But I\u2019m not wasting my best lines on you lot.\u201d He raised the pistol and fired his second shot into the air. \u201cStand tall, snap those shoulders back, and say it loud and proud. \u2018Your breasts are alabaster orbs.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>It took a half dozen more tries, but Colin finally heard the line roared back to his satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d he said, pacing to and fro before them. \u201cNow for the rewards. Ale.\u201d He thumped his fist on a sturdy barrel. With his boot, he rattled a nearby crate. \u201cWine.\u201d Pausing for dramatic effect, he hefted a cask he\u2019d raided from Bram\u2019s personal supply. \u201cWhiskey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we going to do with all that?\u201d Rufus asked.</p><p>\u201cUse it for bootblack,\u201d Colin said dryly. \u201cWe\u2019ll drink it, of course. Tonight is the night we eat, drink, carouse, and make love to our women like we mean it. But wait. There\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d saved the sign for last. He\u2019d spent all night working on the thing by torchlight. Not because he found any enjoyment in woodworking, but because the alternative was another sleepless night on his cold, uncomfortable pallet. After almost a week out of London, he was starved for a warm body and good sleep.</p><p>There was more than principle at stake tonight. He needed to find a woman, and soon.</p><p>\u201cAnd with this, men\u201d\u2014he unveiled the painted sign with a swoosh of fabric\u2014\u201cI give you back your tavern.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Bram woke to searing light, stabbing him straight through his eyelids. Someone placed a cool cup in his hand. He couldn\u2019t even bear to open his eyes and determine who it was, or investigate the contents of the cup. After a cautious sniff, he gulped it down. Water. Clear, crisp water. The most delicious thing he\u2019d ever tasted. He would have muttered some words of thanks, but his tongue was too heavy. He couldn\u2019t coax it to move.</p><p>A beneficent hand closed the drapes. Darkness pulled on him, tugging him back to the pillows and back to sleep.</p> <p>When he woke again, the harsh light was gone. Pushing back the bedclothes, he rose up on one elbow. He was alone in the bedchamber. A single flickering taper in a candlestick provided the room\u2019s only light.</p><p>Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he sat up and swung his bare feet onto the floor. How much time had he lost? He peered at the clock on the bedside table. The clock read half-past seven. But if that were the case, the sun should be up. Unless . . .</p><p>Unless it was evening again. Wednesday evening. He massaged his aching temples. Damn it. He\u2019d lost an entire day.</p><p>His officer\u2019s coat hung on a hook near the door. Draped over a chair nearby were a shirt, trousers, and waistcoat. He recognized them as his own, but they weren\u2019t the ones he\u2019d been wearing yesterday. Thorne must have come by and taken his sea-drenched clothes, replacing them with new.</p><p>Perched on the mattress edge, he tested his knee, flexing and straightening the joint. Remarkably, his leg pained him no worse for the long day of marching. In fact, it felt measurably better. Whether he could attribute that to Susanna\u2019s liniment, her noxious potion, her soothing touch, or simply a full day\u2019s sound sleep, he couldn\u2019t guess. One way or another, he had her to thank.</p><p>With sudden, visceral force, a memory yanked him back some twenty hours. He was in this bed, and she was under him. He had her taut, plump breast in his hand, and her fingertips were soothing over his back, lulling him to sleep.</p><p>He\u2019d been swamped by emotion, dragged underwater by its vicious undertow. Aroused by her touch, comforted by her whispered words, touched by the secrets she\u2019d confessed. He\u2019d simply felt close to her, in every possible way.</p><p>Out of habit, he pushed both hands through his hair, as if to smooth it back into a queue. Of course, his fingertips only brushed the bandage wrapped about his head and whatever meager fringe had escaped her shears the other day.</p><p>This woman was changing him.</p><p>After draining a glass of water, he made good use of the washbasin and soap. He toweled himself dry, then dressed in the fresh clothes. After two days laid up in bed, he needed a shave, but that would have to wait. With a quick check of his cravat knot in the tiny mirror, he left the room.</p><p>Summerfield was well-appointed, but it wasn\u2019t a large house. He easily located the back stairs and descended them with a brisk step, confident he\u2019d find the kitchens nearby. Etiquette and simple decency demanded he search out Susanna and thank her for her care and hospitality\u2014but he could better stomach that slice of humility after he\u2019d found a morsel to eat. His stomach rumbled with hunger, and his head was light with it. Wouldn\u2019t do to reach the castle only to collapse in front of his men, yet again.</p><p>\u201cHo, there. Is that Rycliff?\u201d</p><p>The question stopped him dead in the corridor. \u201cSir Lewis?\u201d</p><p>The short, stoutish man emerged through a doorway, wearing a leather apron and wiping his hands on a rag. The few tenacious wisps of silver hair that still clung to his scalp were flying in all directions.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said, waving toward his disheveled state. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in my laboratory.\u201d</p><p>Bram nodded. The small action hurt.</p><p>Sir Lewis wadded the grease-stained rag into his apron pocket. \u201cSusanna mentioned that she\u2019d quarantined you in the house.\u201d The older man\u2019s blue eyes slid to Bram\u2019s bandaged crown. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He tilted his head and looked past the man, into a large, lamp-lit space. \u201cYour workshop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Sir Lewis\u2019s eyes gleamed as he jerked his head toward the room\u2019s interior. \u201cCome have a look, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to disturb you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, not at all.\u201d</p><p>Bram followed him through the door, ducking to avoid bashing his head on the lintel. This room must have been a scullery at one point, or perhaps a laundry. The floor was ancient scoured slate, not wood parquet as in the corridor. Exposed brick covered the walls. A large, high window occupied much of the room\u2019s south side, admitting a purple gleam of fading daylight.</p><p>On the walls, all sorts of weapons were mounted on hooks. Not just the standard rifles and dueling pistols, but blunderbusses, crossbows . . . Above the door hung an ancient mace with spikes.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like,\u201d Sir Lewis said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you the medieval hall later. Shields, chain mail, and so forth. We don\u2019t get so many young men coming around to Summerfield, but those who do always take an interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Bram was beginning to understand why Susanna Finch remained unmarried. This house would frighten all but the most intrepid suitors away.</p><p>The thought of Susanna made him wince. He turned his gaze to a mahogany plaque above the hearth. On it were mounted a pair of gleaming, polished pistols. Pistols exactly like the one Bram, along with every commissioned officer in the British army, carried as his personal sidearm.</p><p>Finch pistols. Standard issue for decades now.</p><p>The diminutive, eccentric Sir Lewis Finch was, in his own way, one of England\u2019s greatest war heroes. Bram wouldn\u2019t be exaggerating to say he owed the man his life. He also owed Sir Lewis his newly bestowed title, the opportunity to raise a militia, and this one slim chance at regaining his command. And he\u2019d spent yesterday tussling with the man\u2019s only daughter. Assaulting her in the cove. Pinning her to the bed with his naked limbs and groping her.</p><p>Blast it all. Susanna deserved better treatment. Sir Lewis deserved better treatment. And Bram probably deserved to be staring down the barrel of a Finch pistol just about now. Somehow he had to master his lust and refocus on his mission. If the menacing contents of this workshop didn\u2019t help him in those struggles, nothing would.</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over his face, he turned his gaze from the weapons adorning the walls to the room\u2019s furnishings. Underneath the window lodged a long worktable, covered with soldering tools, measuring devices, rasps, and more. On a smaller desk, he found a disassembled flintlock mechanism. It was much like the standard firelock on most rifles, but the hammer was an unusual shape.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked, reaching for it.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Bram picked up the firelock and turned it over in his hands, inspecting the intricate bit of machinery.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be an improved rifle lock,\u201d Sir Lewis said. \u201cI almost have it perfected, I think. But I\u2019ve left it alone for the moment, to work on the blasted cannon again. I\u2019ve been agonizing over this one for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cannon?\u201d He noticed the wooden scale model on the worktable. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>Sir Lewis mussed his hair and made a sound of frustration. \u201cI\u2019ve been tinkering with this idea on and off for decades. It\u2019s a rifled cannon.\u201d</p><p>Bram whistled through his teeth, impressed. All cannons had smooth-bored barrels. They were the artillery equivalent of muskets\u2014decent range and power, but only middling accuracy. But if a cannon could be grooved inside, like a rifle barrel, its projectiles would not only fly farther and faster, but their aim would be much more accurate. A rifled cannon would give the British army a keen advantage in any siege situation. It could be just the ace Wellington needed to boot Napoleon out of Spain.</p><p>\u201cI must have tried a dozen variations on the design,\u201d Sir Lewis said, gesturing toward the miniature cannon on the tabletop. \u201cAnd hundreds of concepts never left the drafting table. But I have a good feeling about this one.\u201d He patted the model. \u201cThis is it. I feel it in my old, creaky bones.\u201d</p><p>The older man smiled at Bram. \u201cI understand you, Rycliff. Better than you know. We\u2019re both men of purpose and action, in our own separate ways. Neither of us is ready to retire the field just yet. I know it\u2019s difficult, being stuck in this quaint, tiny village while wars are being waged. Must be torture for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture pretty well describes it.\u201d Sweet, freckled torture of the purest kind.</p><p>\u201cIs my Susanna giving you trouble?\u201d</p><p>Bram choked on his tongue. He felt his face heating as he coughed into his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can be candid with me.\u201d Sir Lewis patted him on the back. \u201cThe dear girl means well, but I know she has a tendency to overreach. Clever as she is, she has the whole village hanging on her advice. She likes to help.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Bram thought. He was beginning to understand that Susanna Finch was driven to care for those around her. Whether it meant offering food, encouragement, healing salve . . . or the sweetest, most generous embrace a man could ever hope to know.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to attack me every time you wish to be touched. To be held.</p><p>He swallowed hard, trying to clear her taste from his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sir Lewis went on, \u201cBut my daughter doesn\u2019t always understand a man\u2019s need to feel useful. To keep striving, working toward his goals.\u201d He spread his arms, indicating the workshop. \u201cSusanna would rather I give this up entirely. But I can\u2019t do that, not a day before I give up breathing. I know you understand.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Bram did understand Sir Lewis perfectly. And it came as a great relief to finally feel understood. In the months since his injury, none of his peers\u2014nor his superiors, for that matter\u2014had sympathized with his unwavering determination to return to command. They all seemed to think Bram should be content, if not outright grateful, to retire and get on with the rest of his life. They couldn\u2019t comprehend that this was his life.</p> <p>\u201cFor men like us, it\u2019s not enough to merely live. We need to leave a legacy behind.\u201d Sir Lewis touched a fingertip to the scale model cannon. \u201cThis cannon will be mine. I may be old and balding, but my greatest invention is yet to be unveiled.\u201d</p><p>His keen blue eyes met Bram\u2019s. \u201cAnd you may be wounded, but I know your finest battles are yet to be fought. I want to give you every chance I can. I\u2019ve written Generals Hardwick and Cummings and invited them to attend the militia\u2019s field review. I feel certain they\u2019ll see what I do. That you\u2019re your father\u2019s son. A man who won\u2019t remain hobbled. They\u2019ll doubtless agree England needs you back in command.\u201d</p><p>Emotion thickened his throat. \u201cSir Lewis . . . I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t how to thank you.\u201d</p><p>That was a lie. Bram knew exactly how to thank the man\u2014and that was by keeping his head on straight, doing his duty, drilling a militia to pin-sharp precision, and staying the hell away from Susanna Finch.</p><p>A clock on the wall chimed eight.</p> <p>\u201cCan I interest you in dinner, Rycliff?\u201d</p><p>Bram\u2019s stomach answered for him, loudly. \u201cI appreciate the invitation, but . . . I\u2019m not properly dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d Sir Lewis laughed and indicated his own disheveled attire. \u201cWe don\u2019t stand on ceremony in this house, Rycliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I wish you\u2019d just call me Bram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBram it is.\u201d The older man untied his apron and laid it aside. Then he clapped Bram on the shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go find something to eat, son.\u201d</p><p>The old man ushered him out of the workshop, down the corridor, and up a half flight of stairs.</p> <p>As they wound through the house, rich, dark paneling welcomed Bram from room to room, and the collective warmth of dozens of candles seemed to seep into his bones. Not since his infancy had he resided in a house like this. For years now, he\u2019d slung his campaign-weary bones in tents and barracks and officers\u2019 quarters. Then hospital beds and finally, in London, simple bachelor\u2019s rooms. He\u2019d always avoided family residences such as Summerfield, purposely. Because they were more than houses. They were homes, and they weren\u2019t for him. They made him feel out of place, and strangely achy inside.</p><p>\u201cSusanna will be pleased to see us, no matter what we\u2019re wearing,\u201d Sir Lewis said. \u201cMost evenings I don\u2019t make it to the dining room at all. She\u2019s always after me to eat more, take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Bram drew a deep breath and exhaled it slowly, trying to purge all improper thoughts of Susanna from his mind, body, heart and soul. Dinner was perfect. A completely civilized, chaperoned setting in which to see her, converse with her, and learn how to act like a normal human in her presence, rather than a slavering beast. His behavior over the last few days had been reprehensible. Beneath this warrior\u2019s coat, he was a gentleman by birth. He\u2019d lost sight of it somehow in all those freckles, but unless he meant to throw away this chance at redemption and Sir Lewis\u2019s goodwill, it was time to start acting the part.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Sir Lewis led Bram around a turn in the corridor and through a set of paneled double doors, announcing loudly, \u201cWe have a guest tonight, Susanna. You may wish to order another table setting.\u201d</p><p>Here they went, Bram thought. He would eat dinner. He would use the correct forks. He would engage her in conversation that did not include the words \u201cskin,\u201d \u201click,\u201d or \u201cpowder keg.\u201d He would thank her for her kind hospitality and helpful ministrations. Then he would kiss her hand, take his leave . . .</p><p>And never lay a finger on Susanna Finch again. On this he was absolutely, irrevocably resolved.</p><p>Until he turned the corner.</p><p>Bram halted midstep. His vision blurred at the edges. He felt certain he would faint. And his light-headedness had nothing to do with his recent head injury or his famished state. It had everything to do with her.</p> <p>Hideous bathing costume and men\u2019s breeches aside, he\u2019d yet to see her wearing anything besides a simple muslin day dress. Tonight she was dressed for dinner, clad in a sumptuous violet silk gown with beaded brocade trim. The crystal wine goblets on the table took the candlelight and honed it to luminous arrows, shooting brilliance in all directions. Picking out every seed pearl sewn into her sash, every ribbon weaving through her shimmering, upswept hair. As she bent to smooth a wrinkle in the tablecloth, artfully curled tendrils framed her face and caressed the pale slope of her neck.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff.\u201d Straightening, she gave him a shy smile.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t speak. She looked . . .</p><p>Beautiful, he supposed he should say. But \u201cbeautiful\u201d wasn\u2019t a strong enough word. Neither was \u201cdazzling,\u201d \u201cbreathtaking,\u201d or \u201cdevastating\u201d\u2014though that last came a bit closer than the rest.</p><p>Her outward appearance was only part of the effect. What called to him was the invitation implicit in her posture, her voice, her lovely blue eyes. She looked as though she\u2019d been waiting on him. Not just tonight, but every night.</p><p>She looked like home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you awake,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought my father to the dining table, only five minutes past eight. In this house, that\u2019s a small miracle.\u201d</p><p>Sir Lewis laughed. \u201cAnd now that I\u2019m here, I must beg you to excuse me for a moment.\u201d He raised work-streaked hands. \u201cI\u2019ll just go wash before dinner.\u201d</p><p>The older man quit the room, and the two of them stood there, regarding each other.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered. It was the truth. He wasn\u2019t sure of anything at the moment, except the fact that his boots were now carrying him forward. All his chaste resolutions and respect for Sir Lewis aside, he simply couldn\u2019t do otherwise. Whatever this was between them, it commanded his loyalty in a forceful, visceral way. To deny her pull would seem a dishonor all its own.</p><p>He watched her blush deepen as he drew near. It was some comfort to know that he affected her, too. He reached for her hand, where it rested atop the damask tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cNo gloves tonight?\u201d he asked, running his thumb over her soft, protected skin, tracing each of her fingers and the delicate webs between.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t worn them all day. I mean to, but then I keep forgetting.\u201d</p><p>He tumbled into her gaze. Passed a small eternity wandering there.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d he started.</p><p>\u201cYou . . .\u201d she began.</p><p>To hell with words, he thought, sliding his hand around her waist. To hell with it all. If they had only moments together, he could not let them go to waste. Cool silk teased against his palm as he pulled her close. He drew a ragged breath, and his senses exploded with her unique, essential perfume.</p><p>\u201cBram,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And then he bent his head, seeking her kiss. Her mouth softened beneath his, lush and welcoming. Her kiss was tender and sweet, and in that quiet, stolen moment, worth any risk.</p><p>Light footsteps clattered down the corridor, jolting them apart.</p><p>A young woman tore into the room, followed by an apologetic footman.</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch! Miss Finch, you must come at once.\u201d As the girl paused for breath, Bram recognized her as one of the young ladies from the Queen\u2019s Ruby. One of the quieter ones, whose name he hadn\u2019t yet learned.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s trouble in the village,\u201d she said.</p><p>Susanna crossed the room in a swift, determined ripple of silk. \u201cWhat is it, Violet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Miss Finch, you won\u2019t believe it. We\u2019ve been invaded.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been invaded.</p><p>Minerva touched a fingertip to her spectacles. She knew she had to be wearing them\u2014she never went anywhere without her spectacles. But at the moment, nothing within her view was clear. The lines of reality had blurred, and the world simply didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>A mere quarter hour ago, the ladies had been sitting down to cards in the Blushing Pansy. Seated at the window table with her mother and sisters, Minerva had begun to split and shuffle the deck of cards.</p><p>And then\u2014before the first round could even be dealt\u2014the men had come thundering in without warning, bringing with them what looked to be numerous bottles of liquor and the prelude to sheer chaos.</p><p>Down came the lace curtains and the Blushing Pansy\u2019s gilt-lettered sign. Up went an ancient broadsword and a set of steer horns mounted above the hearth. And outside, above the door, a new sign dangled.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d her mother asked, peering out the window.</p><p>Minerva looked over her spectacles. \u201cThe Rutting Bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Diana muttered.</p><p>The ladies all froze in their seats, uncertain how to react. What was the proper etiquette, when civilization crumbled around a girl? Not even Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom covered this.</p><p>Leaping up a step to the small dais, Lord Payne took the center of attention. No surprise. Wherever the ladies were gathered, that man always took the center of attention. Minerva detested him. If Diana wished to marry, she deserved so much better than a proud, preening rake. Unfortunately, their mother seemed to have already embraced him as a future son-in-law.</p><p>\u201cFair ladies of Spindle Cove,\u201d Payne announced, \u201cI regret to inform you that the Blushing Pansy tea shop has closed for the evening.\u201d</p><p>A murmur of confusion and dismay swept the ladies.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Payne went on, \u201cit is my great pleasure to announce that the Rutting Bull tavern is open for business.\u201d</p><p>A loud huzzah went up from the men.</p><p>\u201cThere will be drinking. There will be dancing. There will be dicing and debauchery of every pleasant sort. Ladies, you have been warned. Leave now or live high.\u201d</p><p>A man she didn\u2019t recognize\u2014one of the farmers or fishermen, she supposed\u2014produced a battered violin. He put bow to strings and began sawing away, producing a wild country dance.</p><p>The other men wasted no time clearing tables and chairs to the edges of the room. In some cases, with the mortified ladies still seated upon them. The blacksmith approached their table. With a curt nod and an intense, silent look, the big man reached under their table with one hand, lifting the entire piece of furniture by its pedestal and carrying it aside.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d Diana said, as someone pressed a brimming flagon into her hand. She sniffed at its contents, then passed the drink to Minerva. \u201cIs that ale, Min?\u201d</p><p>She sipped at it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Miss Kate Taylor was urged to the pianoforte. A few of the younger girls grabbed hands and fled, trailing some vow to fetch Miss Finch.</p><p>\u201cWe should leave,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Charlotte said, raising her voice above the crescendo of music. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpportunity, my dears.\u201d Their mother\u2019s face lit up like a bonfire. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And don\u2019t think of leaving. We\u2019re staying right here. Smile, Diana. Here he comes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lord Payne cut a swath through the hubbub, making his way straight for their group. \u201cMrs. Highwood.\u201d He bowed deeply, gifting the fair-haired sisters with a brilliant, gleaming smile. \u201cMiss Highwood. Miss Charlotte. How lovely you look this evening.\u201d Belatedly, he turned to Minerva and gave her a cool smile. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t our resident giant-slayer, Miss Miranda.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cIt\u2019s Minerva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Did you come armed this evening? With something other than those dagger-sharp looks, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn that case\u201d\u2014he extended a hand to Diana\u2014\u201cMiss Highwood, I believe this dance is mine.\u201d</p><p>When Diana didn\u2019t immediately accept, their mother intervened. \u201cWhat are you waiting for, Diana? Permission? Of course you may dance with Lord Payne.\u201d</p><p>As the pair proceeded to the center of the floor, Minerva nudged her mother. \u201cYou cannot allow her to dance. Not like this. What of her asthma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPish. She hasn\u2019t suffered an attack in ages now. And Miss Finch is always saying healthful exercise will do her benefit. Dancing is good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about dancing, but Lord Payne is not good for her. Not in any way. I don\u2019t trust that man.\u201d</p> <p>One of the Bright twins stepped into her line of vision, drawing her notice away. He made a nervous bow to Charlotte. \u201cMiss Charlotte, your hair is a river of diamonds and your eyes are alabaster orbs.\u201d</p><p>Minerva couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cCharlotte, do you have cataracts?\u201d</p><p>The poor youth flushed vermillion and stuck out his hand. \u201cCare to dance?\u201d</p><p>With a brief glance toward their mother for consent, Charlotte launched from her chair. \u201cI\u2019d be honored, Mr. . . . Er, which one are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Finn, miss. Unless I accidentally tread on your toes, in which case I\u2019m Rufus.\u201d He grinned and offered a hand. The two joined the dancers.</p><p>Minerva stared at her mother. \u201cYou\u2019re letting Charlotte dance now? She\u2019s barely fourteen!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in good fun. And it\u2019s just a local dance, not a London ball.\u201d Her mother clucked her tongue. \u201cBe careful, Minerva. Your envy is showing.\u201d</p><p>She huffed a breath. She was not envious. Although, as more and more couples paired off around her, she did begin to feel conspicuously alone. It wasn\u2019t an unfamiliar sensation.</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you, Minerva. If only you\u2019d give your cheeks a pinch and remove those spectacles, you\u2019d be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be blind as a bat, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut an attractive bat. They\u2019re only spectacles, you know. You do have a choice whether or not to wear them.\u201d</p><p>Minerva sighed. Perhaps she would like to catch a gentleman\u2019s attention someday, but not one whose entire opinion of her could be swayed by a minor alteration of appearance. If she married, she wanted a man with a brain in his head and some substance to his character. No vain aristocrats for her, no matter how slick their words or how devilishly handsome their smiles.</p><p>It just rankled, to always feel rejected by men like Lord Payne without ever having the chance to reject them first.</p><p>She lifted the flagon of ale in her hand and took a long, unladylike draught. Then she rose from her chair, determined not to sit and play the wallflower.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going, Minerva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say, Mother. I\u2019ve decided to take this unplanned interruption as an opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Pushing through the increasingly raucous throng of dancers and drinkers, Minerva made her way to the exit. She\u2019d left off in the middle of composing a most important letter that afternoon, and she might as well take this time to finish it. The members of the Royal Geological Society required adjustment in their thinking.</p><p>They were, after all, men.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Susanna raced from the house, picking up her skirts and dashing down the lane.</p><p>\u201cWe could take a carriage,\u201d Bram said, catching her on the first turn. \u201cOr ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough time,\u201d she said, gulping the cool night air. \u201cThis is faster.\u201d</p><p>Truth be told, she was glad of a chance to run. There were too many questions between them, so many emotions she felt unprepared to face. She slid a glance in his direction, wondering if his knee was paining him. She knew better than to ask. He would never admit to it, if it were.</p><p>But she slowed, just a little.</p><p>As they neared the center of the village, a dull roar reached her ears. There was no question about the source of the din. Together they raced the last distance past the church, and across the village green.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d He halted beside her, panting for breath.</p><p>She clutched her side, staring up at the sign above the tea shop door. \u201cThe Rutting Bull? What\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it means. It means the men have taken back their tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur tea shop, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d He grinned, shaking his head. \u201cHa. This scheme has Colin written all over it. But it\u2019s good to see them taking some initiative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t amusing.\u201d Her hands flew to her hips. \u201cDid you know they were planning this?\u201d</p><p>At her accusing tone, his posture became defensive. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know they were planning this. I\u2019ve spent the past thirty hours knocked cold. Someone dosed me with enough laudanum to drop a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Bram. Someone dosed you with the appropriate amount, and your battered body took the much-needed opportunity to rest. I was looking out for your well-being. And now I\u2019m looking out for the well-being of my friends.\u201d She gestured toward the tea shop. \u201cWe have to put a stop to that scene. Those girls in there, they\u2019re unused to this sort of attention. They\u2019re going to make more of it than they ought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one making too much of it. It\u2019s only a bit of dance and drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. To a man like yourself, that\u2019s just harmless carousing. But these are delicate, sheltered young ladies. Their hearts and hopes are vulnerable. Too vulnerable. Not to mention their reputations. We have to intervene.\u201d</p><p>Together they looked to the tea-shop-turned-tavern. Loud music and laughter drifted out to them on the breeze, along with the sound of clinking glass.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to put a stop to that scene, and neither are you. What\u2019s going on in there is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPublic drunkenness is important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, on occasion. More than that, fellowship. Brotherhood within a band of soldiers, and the duty those men are charged to carry out. It\u2019s all important. It\u2019s called pride, Susanna, and those men are getting their first taste of it in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, their first taste of it? They are decent, honorable men, all. Or at least they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome along. Before I arrived in this village, you and your muslin-clad minions had them reduced to mending lockets and piping icing on teacakes. You don\u2019t understand. Men need a purpose, Susanna. A worthy goal. One that we feel in our guts and our hearts, not just in our heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen need a purpose?\u201d She sighed, exasperated. \u201cCan\u2019t you understand women are the same? We crave our own goals and our own accomplishments, our own sisterhood as well. And there are precious few places we can find it, in a world ruled by the opposite sex. Everywhere else we are governed by men\u2019s rules, live at the mercy of male whims. But here, in this one tiny corner of the world, we are free to be our best and truest selves. Spindle Cove is ours, Bram. I will fight to my last breath before I let you destroy it. Women\u2019s needs are important, too.\u201d</p><p>He put both hands on her, tugging her away from the buildings and onto the green. Soon he had her ensconced beneath the canopy of an ancient willow tree. She\u2019d always loved this tree, and the way its protective, low-hanging limbs made a sort of separate world. A green, fresh, gently tickling shelter that allowed just the right amount of sunlight through, yet kept out all but the heaviest rain. She\u2019d always felt comfortable and safe under its branches.</p><p>Until now. The hungry glint in his eyes was danger itself. When he spoke, his voice had darkened. The whole night had darkened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s most important of all. It\u2019s this.\u201d He flexed those barrel-like biceps, drawing her body flush against a solid wall of muscle and heat. \u201cNot women, not men, but what lies between two people who want each other more than air. You can argue with me all you want, but you can\u2019t fight this. I know you feel it.\u201d</p><p>Oh yes. She felt it. Hot, electric sensation hummed through her whole body, all the way to the beds of her toenails and the roots of her hair. Between her thighs, she was molten with it.</p><p>\u201cThis is important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most vital, undeniable force in Creation. You can\u2019t deprive the whole village of it just because you\u2019re afraid of losing control.\u201d</p><p>Laughter burst from her throat. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to lose control? Oh, Bram. Please.\u201d</p><p>This, from the man so desperate to order someone\u2014anyone\u2014about, he was paying shepherds and fishermen exorbitant wages just to march at his command. Let it not be forgotten, he\u2019d bombed a flock of sheep.</p><p>He was the one afraid of losing control. Terrified to his core. And she would happily remind him of all this\u2014perhaps even admit she found it oddly endearing\u2014if only he\u2019d permit her the use of her lips and tongue.</p><p>But no. The impossible man had to conquer those, too.</p><p>He swept her into a kiss so wild and unrelenting, she had no choice but surrender.</p><p>Her mouth softened, and his tongue swept between her lips, probing deep. She accepted the challenge, parrying his thrusts with her own, enjoying the way they sparred so equally. He moaned with satisfaction, and she smiled against his lips. Apparently, she was good at this. She loved the way he brought out new strengths in her; talents she hadn\u2019t known she possessed.</p><p>He covered her neck with kisses, grinding his hips against hers in a crude, delicious manner. \u201cGod, how I\u2019ve been aching for you. Have you any idea what kind of dreams laudanum gives a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you dream of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrequently.\u201d Kiss. \u201cVividly.\u201d Kiss. \u201cAcrobatically.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, she pulled back to meet his gaze. \u201cOh, Bram. I had dreams of you, too. They all involved very high cliffs and very sharp rocks.\u201d She touched a hand to his cheek. \u201cAnd sea monsters.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cLittle liar.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she should have been offended, but she was too busy being stupidly thrilled. No one ever called her \u201clittle\u201d anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd just look at you,\u201d he said, stepping back and skimming his possessive hands over her waist and hips. \u201cI don\u2019t even have words for how beautiful you are. You wore this for me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPredictable arrogance. I always dress for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you thought of me as you dressed. I know you did.\u201d</p><p>She had. Of course she had. And though she always dressed for dinner, she seldom wore anything this fine. Tonight she\u2019d selected her best. Not because she planned for him to see it, but for a much simpler, more selfish reason. He\u2019d made her feel beautiful inside, and it only seemed fitting that her outward appearance should match.</p><p>\u201cAnd these bits of your hair, curling down . . . They\u2019re for me, too.\u201d He caught a stray lock and wound it about his fingers. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how I\u2019ve been dying to touch your hair. Even softer than I dreamed.\u201d His touch dipped to her neckline, where he eased the violet silk aside to reveal a pale sliver of her white chemise. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he said, fingering the neatly hemmed edge. \u201cWhite and crisp and new. It\u2019s your best, isn\u2019t it? You wore your best for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, so entranced by his low, sensual whisper that she\u2019d lost any capacity for denial.</p><p>\u201cI want to see it,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Surely he couldn\u2019t be suggesting she remove her gown here, in the middle of the village green.</p> <p>His hands slid to her back, and the closures of her gown. \u201cYou wore it for me, so let me see it. Just the shift, love. Just the shift. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve seen a girl in a plain white shift?\u201d</p><p>Susanna didn\u2019t like speculating on the answer to that question. She only knew she hated all the girls who had come before.</p><p>His lips brushed her cheek, her neck. The scrape of his whiskers set her senses ablaze. \u201cLet me see you. I only want to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe touch, just a little. But only through your shift. I swear, nothing more. I\u2019ll remain clothed. If you tell me to stop, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d He tipped her chin. \u201cYou can trust me.\u201d</p> <p>Could she? She felt herself nod.</p><p>His hands slid around her ribs and went to the closures at the back of her gown. \u201cAre these false buttons?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for her answer, he eased the top hook free. Then another. And another. Her bodice began to gape in front. Cool night air rushed over her skin, drawing her nipples to tight peaks.</p><p>\u201cBram. We can\u2019t do this. Not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we go somewhere else?\u201d He loosened another closure at the back of her gown. Her left sleeve slipped from her shoulder in a ripple of violet, baring more of her crisp white chemise. Her ribs pressed against her stays as she struggled for breath.</p><p>Her gaze darted to the Blushing Pansy.</p> <p>\u201cNo one can see,\u201d he murmured, pulling her close. His lips brushed the side of her neck. \u201cThey\u2019re all occupied in the tavern. Don\u2019t think of anyone else. It\u2019s just the two of us right now.\u201d</p><p>Another hook surrendered, and she felt her gown falling away. He drew the right sleeve down her shoulder, trailing kisses down the side of her neck. As if by instinct, she tilted her head to give him better access. His tongue slid lazily over her pulse, setting her senses aflame.</p><p>\u201cBram . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right to want this.\u201d</p><p>His words soothed her nerves. Still, her fingers trembled as she drew her arms out of her sleeves. Once she\u2019d freed them, the violet silk bodice fell slack at her hips. From the waist up, she was clothed only in her corset and chemise.</p><p>His hands went to the small of her back, where her corset laces were secured in a tight knot. He fumbled a bit as he picked the tapes loose, as if his hands were unsteady. That subtle hint of uncertainty was comforting.</p><p>The laces slid free of their holes, and her corset fell away from her body. Air rushed into her lungs, dizzying and fresh. He let the garment fall softly to the grass. With it went all her confidence. She might as well have been stark naked, considering how vulnerable and exposed she felt.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d Her voice shook.</p> <p>His breath caressed her ear. \u201cJust breathe.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her jaw. \u201cJust be here with me. Just be you.\u201d</p><p>Warmth bloomed in her heart, suffusing her entire body.</p><p>Just be you, he said. He didn\u2019t want her to be different. He didn\u2019t wish she were someone else. He just wanted her to be herself.</p><p>She cupped his face in her hands and kissed him full on the lips. Because those precious words deserved a kiss. But most of all, because she was being herself\u2014and kissing him was what she most wanted to do.</p><p>They sank into each other, deepening the kiss by slow, sensuous degrees. His tongue teased and coaxed, and she responded in kind. They kissed in an unhurried, almost playful fashion. For a minute. And then matters became serious indeed.</p><p>\u201cI need to see you.\u201d His hands tugged at her gown, pushing it down over her hips. \u201cAll of you. Now.\u201d</p><p>She helped him, shimmying in place until the fabric gave way and slipped to the ground in a shimmering pool. He took both her hands and helped her step free. Then he stood back from her a pace, angling her to catch the best light. His gaze roamed over her. Every inch of her. Beneath the thin muslin, her nipples strained for his touch. The longer the silence stretched, the more impatient she grew. Then more uncertain. Her shift was thin, but it was so dark. Just how much could he see? Did he like what he saw? How did she compare with all those other girls he\u2019d seen in plain white shifts, so very long ago?</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d A ragged sigh shook free of his chest. \u201cSo lovely. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He drew a single fingertip up the inner slope of her arm. As his touch swept over her scars, she held her breath. But her wounds didn\u2019t give him a moment\u2019s pause.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said, tracing over her shoulder and dipping his fingers to the neckline of her shift. His touch blazed a fiery trail across the tops of her unbound breasts. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing in the world more enticing than a shift like this. Sweet and pure, yet so revealing. Lace, ribbons, silks, furs . . . Nothing can compare.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid down, cupping her breast. She swallowed anxiously. But he stayed calm, kneading the soft globe with tantalizing pressure and rolling the taut nipple beneath his thumb.</p><p>With a thoughtful tilt of his head, he turned his attention toward her other breast. Now he cupped them both in his hands, plumping the left, then the right . . . as though he were testing and weighing them against each other. Men were so very strange. He pinched both her nipples at the same time, and she gasped with surprise and pleasure.</p><p>She covered the noise with a nervous laugh. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you at least kiss me when you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed the hollow of her throat. Again, and then again. Light, feathery kisses that tore apart her resistance, shredded any resolve. His hands roamed her curves.</p><p>\u201cBram . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust kisses,\u201d he murmured, his lips covering her racing pulse. \u201cJust kisses. I swear, I\u2019ll press you no further. I\u2019ll stop the moment you say the word. Only let me kiss you, Susanna.\u201d He trailed his tongue down her neck.</p><p>And she sighed her approval, tilting her head to aid his descent. Just kisses. What harm could a few kisses be? It was no more than they\u2019d already done. In her desire-drugged mind, he made so much sense.</p><p>His bent his head, and his tongue made a sure, deliberate pass over her nipple. Then he drew the linen-covered peak into his mouth.</p><p>She cried out, shocked by the sudden burst of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he murmured against her breast. \u201cJust kisses. That\u2019s all. Just kisses.\u201d</p><p>Just kisses. Ha. Oh, certainly, these were just kisses. And the Great Pyramids of Egypt were merely little stacks of stone.</p><p>Sensation rocketed through her entire body. She\u2019d never known anything so unbearably, exquisitely sweet. He licked and teased and pulled at her nipple, swirling his tongue in ever-widening circles until the fabric of her shift clung wet and heavy to her breast and the rosy flush of her skin showed through.</p><p>He gave her other breast the same careful attention, mouthing every curve. Pasting the linen to her aroused flesh.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he breathed, drawing back to look at her. With his hands he framed her bosom, pulling the wet fabric tight until the dark buds of her nipples were thrust into relief. \u201cSweet heaven. Like rosebuds in a drift of fresh snow. And this\u201d\u2014he kissed his way down her belly, sinking lower and lower\u2014\u201cthis, Susanna, is what will bring a man to his knees.\u201d He pressed his brow to her navel. His mouth settled in the cleft of her thighs, warm and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cBram,\u201d she whispered, frantic. \u201cBram, please get up. This can\u2019t be good for your injured leg.\u201d</p><p>He made a dismissive noise.</p><p>Well, now she\u2019d botched matters. The stubborn fool would rather dive off a cliff than admit to a little pain. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to rise to his feet now.</p><p>He groaned a little, nuzzling her thigh. His big hand cupped her bottom. \u201cYou wanted this, remember? You said you\u2019d bring me to my knees.\u201d</p><p>Of course she\u2019d wanted him on his knees. Begging, pleading. Acknowledging her power over him. And now she had him doing exactly that\u2014but something had gone all wrong. She was the one being conquered.</p><p>\u201cJust kisses,\u201d he said, framing her waist in his hands and pulling the fabric of her shift taut. \u201cJust kisses, I swear. Let me show you how good it can be. I know exactly what you need.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his open mouth to the linen covering her cleft. His tongue darted out, stroking her straight through the fabric, circling over that small, secret place that could bring her so much pleasure. Bliss forked through her, and her knees buckled.</p><p>Her breath caught, and she clutched wildly at his shoulders. \u201cBram, I can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened about her waist. Pausing briefly, he murmured, \u201cI have you. You\u2019re safe with me. I won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t make herself answer.</p><p>His husky laugh teased her in unbearable ways. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He applied himself with purpose now, stroking more firmly with his tongue. Waves of pleasure pushed through her, and she surrendered to them, going limp in his strong embrace. With his shoulder, he gently prodded her knee to the side, spreading her wide to his kiss. Exquisite sensation mounted higher and higher. The moist heat of his mouth mingled with the dew of her arousal. Dampness surged between her legs.</p><p>His attentions centered on that sensitive, swollen bud at the crest of her sex. He licked and stroked and nibbled until she was helpless with pleasure. The muscles in her thighs began to quiver. A whimper eased from her throat.</p><p>And the world began to constrict. The remote din of music and laughter faded. The wind ceased to blow. Everything was forgotten. Nothing existed but the two of them: his wicked, talented mouth and her intense, spiraling joy. He pushed her higher and higher, until she tumbled straight over the edge into a soul-shaking climax.</p><p>She cried out with it, rocked by waves of pleasure.</p><p>As she came back to herself, he held her tight, pressing his brow to her belly and whispering soothing words. His thumbs sketched comforting circles on the small of her back.</p><p>She sank to her knees, and he pulled her down to the ground. There they lay beneath the willow tree, their limbs tangled and knotted as tree roots. Their combined breath made a little cloud of fog\u2014as if they had their own sky hanging over them, here in this world apart.</p><p>He flexed his strong arms, drawing her close. It wasn\u2019t until he had her molded against his chest, surrounded by his heat, that she realized she was trembling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he murmured, pressing kisses to her brow.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid, just . . . overwhelmed. What did this mean to him? What did it mean to her? Just kisses, she reminded herself. To him, these were just kisses. He didn\u2019t want romantic attachments.</p><p>Don\u2019t get any ideas, she sternly told her heart.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re so passionate. So beautiful. There\u2019s so much more I could show you. So much pleasure we could share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what possessed her to play innocent. Susanna certainly understood the concept of intercourse, if not from personal experience. She knew what the books said about coitus and human reproduction, and she\u2019d worked alongside midwives, and she heard how the scullery maids giggled and gossiped among themselves. But she wanted to hear what it meant to him. What he thought it would mean between them.</p><p>He took her hand and brought it to his body, cupping her palm over the bulge tenting his breeches\u2019s fall. \u201cFeel this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. How could she fail to feel it? It wasn\u2019t precisely a negligible size. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kept her hand pressed snug, dragging her palm over his full length. His organ throbbed and strained beneath her touch. \u201cIt\u2019s for you, Susanna. For your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens. All of it?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled low and kissed her neck. \u201cYes, all of it. It\u2019s made to fit inside you.\u201d</p><p>Leaving his manhood in her grasp, he let his own hand drop to the hem of her shift. He gathered the light, thin fabric and eased it up to her thigh, skimming his fingers along the sensitive hollow of her knee. Then his hand delved between her legs, spreading her thighs apart. His fingers found her warm, wet intimate flesh. As he traced the contours of her sex, gently exploring and teasing her apart, a low moan pulled from her chest.</p><p>\u201cThis\u201d\u2014he ground his erection against her hand\u2014\u201cbelongs here.\u201d His finger slid inside her, giving her an exquisite sense of fullness and bliss. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p><p>As simple as that.</p><p>So this was coupling, as he understood it. An uncomplicated, natural act. A mutual sating of needs and desires. They were made for this. His body belonged inside hers.</p><p>He pumped his finger in a slow rhythm, plunging a fraction deeper with every stroke. Though she\u2019d just experienced a wrenching climax minutes ago, her arousal built at an astonishing pace. Soon she was arching her hips to meet his clever fingers, stroking her hand over his arousal in time with his thrusts. He kissed her thoroughly, forcing her jaw wide and delving deep with his tongue. She struggled to reciprocate, tasting and teasing him with voracious hunger. He growled his approval against her lips.</p><p>He slid his finger from her aching cleft, and she whimpered at the sudden loss. Her complaint was swiftly addressed, however, when he moved atop her, nestling between her thighs. She had to spread her legs wide to accommodate his hips\u2014an act which drew her feminine mound snug against his hardness. He rocked against her in just the right place, and pure, bright pleasure shimmered through her veins.</p><p>He framed her face in his big hands. His gaze was dark and hungry as a wolf\u2019s. \u201cDo you want me, Susanna?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t dissemble. Her body made an answer of its own, as her hips tilted and arched, rubbing sinuously against his arousal. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Another man would have taken her at her first answer, if he\u2019d bothered to ask at all. But he wanted to be absolutely certain she wanted this, too. If she\u2019d harbored any lingering reluctance, his thoughtful concern dissolved it.</p><p>Yes, she wanted this. Not just this. She wanted him. Perhaps she would never marry. Perhaps she would never know true, lasting love with a man. But she wanted to explore passion and pleasure, and she wanted it to be with Bram. In all her five-and-twenty years, no man had ever made her feel this way. She might be waiting another five-and-twenty to experience this wonderful yearning again.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Still, he hesitated. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t. Not tonight. Your first time really should be in a bed. What\u2019s more, that bed should be a marriage bed, for a girl like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never planned to marry at all. And as for beds . . .\u201d She looked up at the willow branches sheltering them, and the scattered stars twinkling through. A more romantic setting couldn\u2019t exist. \u201cEveryone has beds. I\u2019ll take this. So long as\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cYou will be careful, won\u2019t you? At the end. I shouldn\u2019t want to get with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be careful. But you should know, there\u2019s always a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m willing to take the risk, if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be with you?\u201d He kissed her lips. \u201cI\u2019d risk a firing squad.\u201d</p><p>Her heart turned over in her chest. \u201cThen yes. To all of it.\u201d</p><p>This time, he took her at her word. With one hand he impatiently pushed her shift higher, baring her abdomen and her left breast. He paused a moment, just looking.</p> <p>\u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The words rushed over her skin on a hot, ragged breath, drawing her nipple to a tight pucker. He bent his head and suckled her, drawing the aroused peak deep into his mouth and swirling his tongue around the sensitive tip. As he sucked and licked, the rough fringe of his whiskers scraped over her tender skin. Her every nerve attenuated, drawing tense and thin with the mounting pleasure.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he urged, between swipes of his tongue. \u201cI want to feel your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>Susanna had never been happier to take his direction. She reached down, yanking his shirt free of his waistband and sliding both palms beneath it, exploring the smooth, muscled planes of his back. Then she wiggled a hand between their bodies, searching for the closures of his trousers. With an eager tilt of his hips, he aided her search. She undid the buttons on one side of the flap, working her fingers inside.</p><p>Oh. My.</p><p>Her senses were overwhelmed. The heat and weight of him, filling her grip. His needy groan of encouragement, buzzing around her nipple.</p><p>She stroked gently, as much as the cramped circumstances would allow, skimming her palm along his length and marveling at the texture. Like ridged velvet over heated iron. So smooth and so strong.</p><p>This belongs inside me. Her intimate muscles clenched at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said, abandoning her breast. \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>She released her grip on him as he pushed her shift higher, bunching the fabric under her arms. His erection wedged hot and eager between their bodies. He thrust against her bared sex, teasing up and down her cleft. The intense pleasure left her breathless, mindless.</p><p>\u201cLast chance,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, changing his angle and tilting her hips. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want this, Susanna . . .\u201d</p><p>The feral snarl of his lips gave her a heartbeat\u2019s pause. He was right, this was the most vital, undeniable force in nature. Her whole body craved release, possession. The power of the moment was almost too much.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d she managed. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m yours,\u201d Bram whispered, nudging into her heat, just an inch. Rapture chased along the surface of his skin. \u201cTake me. Take me in.\u201d</p><p>He worked into her slowly, in steady, deepening thrusts, putting most of his weight on his good knee and forcing himself to be patient as her body learned to accommodate his. She looked up at him with eyes so wide and unguarded, he could read her every emotion. He saw anxiety, trepidation. Understandable, as this was her first time. But there was trust as well, overwhelming her fear.</p><p>Overwhelming him.</p><p>With each exquisite, incremental advance, he offered words of encouragement and praise. \u201cYes, love . . . You feel so good . . . So good . . . Just like that . . . Just a bit more . . .\u201d</p><p>As he sheathed himself fully with one last, unfettered thrust, she gave a pained gasp. His heart twisted in his chest. He hated to hurt her.</p><p>\u201cIs the pain too much?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip bravely and shook her head no.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2014\u201d Her body clenched around his, and he released a helpless groan of pleasure. \u201cCan you bear it if I move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs moving necessary?\u201d</p><p>He struggled valiantly not to laugh. \u201cI think so, love. I . . . I have to move, or I\u2019ll go mad.\u201d</p><p>He slid out of her just a bit before plunging back in, even deeper than before. She was so warm and soft, and so damned tight. The pleasure had a keen, sweet edge. Balancing his weight on his elbows to keep from crushing her flat, he worked his hips back and forth, gently. For what seemed like ages, he restrained himself to only the most easy, gliding, undemanding of motions. All the while, the need for fast, furious, pumping release clamored in his veins. He fought it back through sheer force of will. She deserved better than an animalistic humping. This was a precious gift she\u2019d bestowed on him, and he didn\u2019t want her to regret it. Not tonight. Not forty years from now.</p><p>\u201cIs it better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>A little. A little wasn\u2019t enough. With a silent curse, he lowered his body to cover hers. \u201cI want to make this good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is good,\u201d she breathed. Her hands slid over his back, and her breasts molded beneath his chest, soft and warm. \u201cI like this. I like having you so close to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>As he slid into her the next time, her hips canted to meet his. She gave an encouraging moan. So he did it again. And again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . .\u201d She arched again, riding his thrusts like a wave. \u201cOh, Bram. It\u2019s so good now.\u201d</p><p>Holy God, it was. It was so damned good now. The angle, the rhythm, the way her body fit and moved with his. They\u2019d achieved true unison of bodies and purpose, and it was like nothing he\u2019d ever felt before. He\u2019d never known he could so completely lose himself in a woman, and at the same time, feel he\u2019d come home.</p><p>There was a world out there, somewhere beyond these willow branches. Oceans, mountains, glaciers, dunes. Somewhere, far away, wars were being waged. Bram could not have cared less. He didn\u2019t want to be anywhere else but inside this woman, as deep as he could go. He had no purpose, no duty in this life other than to fill her and please her and make her gasp and moan and scream.</p><p>She was where he belonged.</p><p>He reached down to lift her leg and wrap it over his hip, and her body drew him deeper still. They kissed deeply, too. He took his time exploring her lush, generous mouth, marveling at how good it felt to claim her both ways at once. Tall as he was, with other women he couldn\u2019t always kiss and thrust deep at the same time. But Susanna was his perfect match.</p><p>What their kisses lost in finesse, they gained in sensual urgency. Her fingernails bit into his shoulders, and the effect was that of a bee sting to a grazing bull. It drove him into a frenzy. His hips bucked as he pushed into her again and again, abandoning all gentleness, single-minded in his pursuit of her climax.</p><p>She had to come. She had to come first.</p><p>Which meant she had to come soon.</p><p>Please, Susanna. Please.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered closed, and her head rolled back. Her pale swan\u2019s neck stretched into an elegant, erotic curve, gleaming like quicksilver in the dark. So lovely, it made his heart ache.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful. You\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her body tightened around his, and she cried out. He rode the exquisite wave of her climax as long as he dared. And when he knew he couldn\u2019t last another thrust without spilling, he pulled free of her tight, clasping embrace and took himself in hand. He spent his seed all over the sweet, rounded slope of her belly\u2014not into a fold of his shirt or her shift, as might have been the more gentlemanly manner. In some primitive way, it satisfied him to mark her.</p><p>You\u2019re mine now.</p><p>He lowered himself beside her, curling his body around hers and caging her with his limbs. The protective impulses swelling inside him were almost more than he could bear. They choked his speech for a moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked, once he could manage words.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nestled into his chest, and he tightened an arm around her, drawing her close. \u201cOh, Bram. I never dreamed it could be that way.\u201d</p><p>Neither did I, he felt like saying. Neither did I.</p><p>He\u2019d had his share of tumbles, and he\u2019d always enjoyed them thoroughly. But it had never been like this. It seemed impossible that they\u2019d grown so close, so fast. But here they were, and he wouldn\u2019t wish to be anywhere else. He pressed a kiss to her hair and held it, inhaling deep of her sweet, fresh scent.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have done this,\u201d he said, failing to muster any hint of regret.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sighed, sounding equally uncontrite. \u201cBut I\u2019m so glad we did. It was lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more than lovely. It was . . .\u201d He grasped for another word and came up empty.</p><p>\u201cIndescribable?\u201d He heard the smile in her voice. \u201cYes. It was.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sudden noise made him freeze. Angry shouting, originating from somewhere a fair distance away . . . but even so, all too near.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d she asked, clutching him tight.</p><p>And then the crash of breaking glass jolted them apart.</p> <p>Bram hurried to gain his feet, then extended a hand to help her do the same. Individually, they began reassembling garments without further discussion. Ignoring the noise was never an option. Whatever disturbance had occurred, it would no doubt require one\u2014or both\u2014of them to sort it out. Their idyllic interlude was over. Duty called.</p><p>Bram had his breeches refastened in a matter of moments. He turned to help Susanna with her gown.</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d she said, tilting her head toward the unknown source of the commotion. \u201cGo on ahead.\u201d</p><p>He took her at her word, dashing out from beneath the willow\u2019s canopy and making his way across the green.</p><p>There, in the lane between the All Things shop and the Blushing Bull, or the Rutting Pansy, or whatever it was called tonight\u2014a small crowd had formed. The way the men bunched and jostled in a ring, Bram suspected fisticuffs had broken out.</p> <p>He pushed his way to the center, eager to break up the fight before any more damage could be done, to bodies, property, or morale. Much as he\u2019d hoped to imbue his men with a bit of red-blooded combative spirit, it wasn\u2019t meant to be directed within the ranks.</p><p>However, he didn\u2019t find any of his men at the center of the circle.</p><p>He found the boys. Rufus and Finn, rolling around on the ground. Scrapping but good, with fists swinging\u2014and teeth and knees involved, too. By the looks of the scene, they\u2019d tumbled straight through the tea shop\u2019s front window. Shards of broken glass and bits of window leading covered the ground.</p><p>\u201cDodgy bastard,\u201d one of the twins spat. A trickle of blood from his temple made it hard to tell which one.</p><p>\u201cShite for brains,\u201d the other replied, reversing their positions and landing a punch to the gut. \u201cWe\u2019re twins. If I\u2019m a bastard, you\u2019re one too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one what\u2019s a lying scum.\u201d</p> <p>As they rolled, glass crunched beneath them. Time to put a stop to this, Bram decided. He reached out and plucked the topmost Bright twin\u2014he still didn\u2019t know which\u2014off the other. \u201cThat\u2019ll be enough, you two. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRufus started it,\u201d one said, pointing.</p><p>\u201cAye, but it\u2019s Finn\u2019s fault,\u201d the other shot back, dabbing the blood at his temple.</p><p>Well, at least now Bram had their identities sorted out. He turned to Rufus. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Rufus glared at his brother. \u201cHe lied to Miss Charlotte, he did. Danced with her twice. First, as himself. Then once again, saying he was me.\u201d</p><p>Finn just tugged his ear and grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re just sorry you didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pound you, you little\u2014\u201d Rufus lunged, but Bram held him back.</p><p>\u201cHold there,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d Once he had both boys by the collar, he cast a glance at Charlotte Highwood, who looked as excited as any fourteen-year-old girl could be about having two boys fight over her attentions. She surely wasn\u2019t going to be of any help in calming them. The crowd of onlookers appeared more amused than anything.</p> <p>Bram knew he had to make it clear that boys or no, brothers or no, such fighting wouldn\u2019t be tolerated. \u201cNow, listen,\u201d he said sternly, giving each boy a rough shake. \u201cThis isn\u2019t seemly behavior for two\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp! Oh, help!\u201d</p><p>They all turned toward the frantic female voice.</p><p>The ladies clustered in the entry of the tea shop-turned-tavern. Miss Diana Highwood sat slumped in the doorway, struggling for breath. Her complexion was pale and clammy, and her fingers were curled into misshapen fists.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her asthma again,\u201d Mrs. Highwood said, her hands fluttering. \u201cOh dear. Oh dear. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen here. Miss Finch promised Spindle Cove would be her cure.\u201d</p><p>Susanna was already there, one hand soothing the gasping woman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHer tincture,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cWhere is her tincture? She keeps it in her reticule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know. It might be inside, or at the inn, or . . .\u201d Charlotte paled. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSearch inside,\u201d Susanna told Fosbury. \u201cThe tables, the floor, the pianoforte.\u201d To a few of the other ladies, she said, \u201cGo search the Highwoods\u2019 rooms at the inn.\u201d</p><p>Once these runners had been dispatched, she caught Rufus\u2019s eye. \u201cI have a spare batch in my stillroom. A blue bottle, right side of the top shelf. You and Finn run as fast as you can to Summerfield and bring it back.\u201d</p><p>The twins nodded and dashed off down the lane.</p><p>\u201cLet me go instead,\u201d Bram said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey need the distraction.\u201d Her gaze flicked to Bram\u2019s knee. \u201cAnd they\u2019re faster.\u201d</p><p>Right. And Bram was just a lamed, useless lump. \u201cShall I go for a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered firmly. \u201cShe\u2019s been subjected to enough doctors. And there\u2019s no proper physician for miles, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stepped back. Damn it. He would never shy from a battle. He\u2019d accept any risk to his own life, if it meant saving another\u2019s. But there was nothing he could do to help Susanna right now, and the feeling ate him raw. If he\u2019d learned one thing in his eight months of convalescence, it was that he didn\u2019t cope well with helplessness.</p><p>But Susanna had this entire scene under control. Turning her attention to Diana, she spoke calmly, stroking the young woman\u2019s back in slow, soothing circles. \u201cJust relax, dear. Remain calm, and you\u2019ll come through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here. The tincture. It\u2019s here.\u201d The blacksmith emerged from the tea shop, his face stark and pale. He pressed a tiny bottle into Susanna\u2019s hand and stepped back immediately.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d With sure fingers, Susanna unscrewed the bottle\u2019s top and measured a capful of dark liquid. She looked to Bram. \u201cWill you hold her? If she trembles, the medicine might spill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Finally, something he could do. He knelt beside the gasping woman and wrapped her slender body in his arms. Her tremors shook through him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to hold her tight,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cJust keep her immobile.\u201d She tilted Diana\u2019s head back to rest against his shoulder, then poured the capful of tincture between her quivering, blue-tinged lips. \u201cSwallow, dear. I know it\u2019s difficult, but you can do it.\u201d</p><p>Miss Highwood nodded a bit and managed a choking, harsh swallow. Then her gasping resumed.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Bram asked, looking to Susanna.</p><p>\u201cNow we wait.\u201d</p><p>They waited, in tense, painful silence, listening to the sounds of Miss Highwood struggling for breath. After a few minutes, her rasping softened to a gentler wheeze, and a faint wash of pink returned to her cheeks. No matter what ribbing he might take for it later, Bram decided right there\u2014pink was his new favorite color.</p><p>As Diana\u2019s struggles eased, everyone watching drew a deep, grateful breath.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Susanna murmured to her friend. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Take deep, slow breaths. The worst is behind you now.\u201d</p><p>Bram released the young woman and left her in Susanna\u2019s care.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear,\u201d she mumbled, stroking Diana\u2019s damp brow. \u201cIt\u2019s over now. All\u2019s well.\u201d Then Susanna glanced up, and her face went blank with dismay. \u201cHeavens. Just look at this place.\u201d</p><p>Bram watched as she made a slow, heartrending survey of the scene. Her gaze traveled from the shambles of the tea shop, to the broken glass in the lane, to the trembling woman in her arms. Miss Highwood might have survived this episode, but Spindle Cove\u2019s peaceful atmosphere had not.</p><p>Minerva Highwood came dashing out from the Queen\u2019s Ruby. She flew straight to her sister\u2019s side, taking her hand. \u201cDiana. My God, what\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a breathing crisis,\u201d Susanna answered. \u201cBut she\u2019s better now.\u201d</p><p>Minerva kissed her sister\u2019s pale brow. \u201cOh, Diana. I\u2019m so sorry. I should never have left you in that place. I knew the dancing was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hardly your fault, Minerva.\u201d</p><p>Minerva\u2019s head whipped up. \u201cOh, I know very well whose fault it was.\u201d Her gaze focused on a distant target. \u201cThis is all your doing.\u201d</p><p>To a one, every head in the crowd swiveled to face Colin. But Bram felt the guilt landing squarely on him. To be sure, his cousin was responsible for this mess. But Bram was responsible for his cousin.</p><p>Susanna knew it, too. While everyone else was glaring daggers at Colin, her eyes met Bram\u2019s. And her gaze couldn\u2019t have said any more plainly, I warned you this would happen.</p><p>\u201cWe never should have stayed in this wretched place,\u201d Mrs. Highwood wailed, clutching a handkerchief to her mouth. \u201cLords or no lords. I knew that spa in Kent would have been the better choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, please. Let\u2019s discuss this inside.\u201d Minerva took her mother by the arm.</p><p>Slowly, Susanna helped Diana Highwood to her feet. \u201cCome along, ladies. Let\u2019s take her back to the rooming house where she can rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we help you move her?\u201d Bram asked, putting a hand under Miss Highwood\u2019s elbow to help.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, my lord.\u201d Susanna gave him a sad half smile. \u201cYou and your friends have done quite enough this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSee you back to Summerfield later.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help. Give me something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave me be,\u201d she whispered. Her eyes darted to the side, and he could tell she was conscious of how everyone stared at the two of them. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>To leave her be, when she was so clearly upset and vulnerable, went against every protective impulse in his body. But he\u2019d asked her what he could do, and she\u2019d answered him. Honor bade him to comply. For now.</p><p>With a reluctant nod, he stepped back. Young ladies clustered around her as they all retreated to the Queen\u2019s Ruby.</p><p>He\u2019d let her down. She\u2019d asked him to put a stop to this madness, and he\u2019d refused. Now Miss Highwood was taken ill, the tea shop was in shambles, and he\u2019d put both her reputation and her cherished community at risk. After all their confessions last night, he understood what this place meant to her, how much effort and care she\u2019d devoted to its success.</p><p>She\u2019d given him her virginity under the willow tree. And he\u2019d let her down. Bloody hell.</p><p>Tomorrow, he\u2019d see about making it up to her.</p><p>Tonight, his cousin would have hell to pay.</p><p>\u201cGo home, all of you,\u201d he told the men milling about the lane. \u201cSleep off your drink and return to this spot at sunrise. There\u2019ll be no drill tomorrow until we put this place to rights.\u201d</p><p>One by one, the men dispersed, leaving him and Colin alone.</p><p>Colin shook his head, regarding the scene. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve certainly left my mark on this place. There isn\u2019t a tavern or ballroom or woman in England I can\u2019t leave ruined and panting for more.\u201d</p><p>Bram glared at him, enraged. \u201cYou think this is amusing? Fosbury\u2019s establishment is in splinters, and a young lady almost died here tonight. In my arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Looking grieved, Colin pushed both hands through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not amusing at all. But how was I to know she would suffer such an attack? I never meant any harm, you must know. We only meant to have a bit of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun.\u201d Bram fired the word back at him. \u201cDid you ever stop to think that perhaps the ladies have a reason for keeping this a peaceful village? Or that perhaps the mission we\u2019re here to accomplish is more important than an evening\u2019s debauchery?\u201d When Colin didn\u2019t immediately reply, he said, \u201cNo. Of course you didn\u2019t consider it. You never consider anyone else, except to see them standing in the way of your fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease. You never consider the feelings of others, either. We\u2019re all just obstacles to your military glory.\u201d Colin threw up his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to be in this godforsaken, disgustingly charming place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave. Go find one of your many dissolute friends and leech off him for the next few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that idea hasn\u2019t occurred to me, on a damned near hourly basis since we arrived? Good Lord, as if I couldn\u2019t find better accommodations than that ghastly castle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re my cousin, Bram!\u201d</p><p>For a well-established fact, this sudden outburst rather surprised them both.</p><p>Colin made a fist. \u201cYou\u2019ve been my closest kin since my parents . . . since I was a boy. And since your father died, I\u2019m all you\u2019ve got, too. We\u2019ve barely spoken to each other in over a decade. I thought it might be nice to try this \u2018family\u2019 thing the rest of the world seems so keen on. An idiotic notion, clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d</p> <p>Bram paced in a slow circle, swinging his arms in frustration. This was brilliant. Just exactly what he needed to hear right now\u2014that atop betraying Sir Lewis, deflowering Susanna, and contributing to the village\u2019s destruction tonight, he was somehow failing Colin, too. This was why he needed to return to his regiment. In the army, he had a routine, a drill book, marching orders. There, he always knew what to do. If he never resumed his command, this would be his life, it seemed. A string of disappointments and failures.</p><p>The futility of it all incited him to unreasoned anger.</p><p>Colin scratched behind his ear. \u201cJust think, and all those years growing up alone, I thought I was missing out on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you learned your lesson there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does either of us know about family, anyhow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know something about it,\u201d Bram returned. \u201cI know we\u2019re doing it wrong. I don\u2019t respect you. You don\u2019t respect me. We\u2019ve only been at each other\u2019s throats this whole time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a principled, arrogant ass. If you respected me, I\u2019d have your sanity challenged. And so far as filial affection is concerned . . .\u201d Colin gestured angrily toward the spot where the Bright twins had grappled. \u201cIt seems clawing at one another\u2019s throats is the standard practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case.\u201d With his left hand, Bram grabbed Colin by the shirtfront. His right fist made an impulsive swing at his cousin\u2019s jaw. He checked the strength of the blow somewhat, but it still landed with enough force to send Colin\u2019s head whipping left. \u201cThat\u2019s for Miss Highwood.\u201d He drove a halfhearted, joyless punch into his cousin\u2019s gut. \u201cAnd that\u2019s for . . . for fun.\u201d</p><p>He waited, breathing hard, holding his cousin by the collar and bracing himself for retaliation. Longing for it, truly. Bram knew he had blows coming to him\u2014for Susanna, for Sir Lewis, for everything. The impact could only come as a relief.</p><p>But his cousin wouldn\u2019t do him even that favor. He simply touched his tongue to his bruised lip and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be off in the morning, Bram. I\u2019d let you be rid of me sooner, but I don\u2019t travel at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t.\u201d Bram gave him a shake.</p><p>Damn it, what was he going to do with this man? If he left here, nothing good could come of it. Of him. As a young, unattached, soon-to-be-wealthy peer, Colin had no checks on his behavior. Since a tragically young age, he\u2019d been lacking both a father\u2019s example and a mother\u2019s understanding.</p><p>Susanna, he thought with a bittersweet twinge, would probably argue Colin needed a hug.</p><p>Well, Bram didn\u2019t know how to offer his cousin any of those things\u2014not with a straight face, at any rate. But he knew how to be an officer, and experience had taught him that duty and discipline could patch a good many holes in a man\u2019s life.</p> <p>He might be the only person in the world who could offer Colin this: the chance to rise to expectations, rather than sink to them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving,\u201d he told him. \u201cNot now, and not tomorrow, either.\u201d He released his cousin, then gestured at the scene of destruction and chaos. \u201cYou broke this, and you\u2019re damned well going to mend it.\u201d</p><p>Spindle Cove was falling to pieces.</p><p>Once she\u2019d seen that Diana was safely upstairs and resting in her bed, Susanna descended to the drawing room of the Queen\u2019s Ruby. There she found her whole world breaking apart. Complaints and confessions detonated in every corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cOh Lord. Oh Lord,\u201d a voice pitched above frantic flapping. A gull\u2019s wing couldn\u2019t have worked harder than that fan. \u201cI feel an attack of nerves coming on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I drank whiskey,\u201d mourned another. \u201cAnd danced with a fisherman. If my uncle hears of this, I\u2019ll be called home in such disgrace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I ought to go upstairs. Start packing my things now.\u201d</p><p>And then came the observation that froze Susanna\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch, what\u2019s happened to your gown? The buttons are all askew. And look at your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Susanna strove to keep calm. \u201cI suppose I dressed too hurriedly tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like that at Summerfield,\u201d Violet Winterbottom said. \u201cAnd I thought for certain you would have arrived in the village long before me\u2014I was forced to rest for so long\u2014but you didn\u2019t. Did you meet with some accident on the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d As she melted into a nearby chair, Susanna\u2019s conscience stabbed at her. Then she knew the piercing quality of Kate Taylor\u2019s curious gaze. Then Minerva\u2019s.</p><p>They all turned to her, every lady in the room. Staring. Noticing. Then wondering.</p><p>She\u2019d been so foolish. What she\u2019d shared with Bram had been . . . indescribable, and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to regret it. But to engage in it on the village green, where they had every chance of discovery? While complete pandemonium broke out nearby, putting a woman\u2019s life at risk?</p><p>And Miss Highwood wasn\u2019t the only one in danger. Women like Kate and Minerva . . . If Spindle Cove ceased to be a reputable place, what chance would they have to pursue their talents and enjoy the freedom of independent thought?</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch?\u201d Kate asked quietly, coming to sit beside her and take her hand. \u201cIs there anything you wish to tell us? Anything at all?\u201d</p><p>Susanna squeezed her friend\u2019s hand and looked around the room. She was not a resentful person as a matter of course. But in that brief moment, she rather hated the world. She hated that all these bright, unconventional women were here because they\u2019d been made to think there was something wrong with them. That they had to escape from society, just to be themselves. She hated that the slightest hint of her behavior tonight could put their safe haven at risk\u2014assuming that tavern debacle hadn\u2019t ruined everything anyway.</p><p>And most of all, she hated that she could not sit here with her only friends and confess to them that she\u2019d just given her virginity to the strongest, most sensual, wonderfully tender man. That beneath her rumpled clothing, she was still flushed and damp and . . . pleasantly sticky from his attentions. That she was changed inside, still reeling from the pleasure and profundity of it all. Little echoes of bliss cinched tight in her belly, and her heart brimmed with emotion. And did they know the wicked things a man could do with his tongue?</p><p>It was so wrong, that the world forced her to keep quiet. But Susanna had long ago resigned herself to the fact that she could not single-handedly change the world. At best, she could protect her small corner of it.</p><p>Tonight, she\u2019d failed at even that.</p><p>\u201cOn my way into the village, I had a tumble,\u201d she said, \u201cand my gown took the brunt of it. That\u2019s all.\u201d She rose from her chair, preparing to leave. \u201cI\u2019m going home to rest. I suggest you all do the same. I know it\u2019s been an unusual evening, but I hope to see you all in the morning. It\u2019s Thursday, and we do have our schedule.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Mondays are country walks. Tuesdays, sea bathing. Wednesdays, you\u2019d find us in the garden.</p><p>\u201cAnd on Thursdays . . .\u201d Bram said aloud, \u201cthey shoot.\u201d</p><p>Of course they did.</p><p>He stood with Colin on the edge of a green, level meadow near Summerfield. The two of them watched as the assembled fragile-flower ladies of Spindle Cove donned doeskin gloves and arranged themselves in a rail-straight line, facing down a distant row of targets. Behind the women sat a long wooden table, atop which lay bows, arrows, pistols, flintlock rifles. Quite the buffet of weaponry.</p><p>At the head of the line, Susanna announced the first course. \u201cBows up, ladies.\u201d She herself fitted an arrow to her bowstring and drew it back. \u201cOn three. One . . . Two . . .\u201d</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>In unison, the ladies released arrows that flew true to their targets.</p><p>Bram craned his neck to see how Susanna\u2019s had landed. Dead center, of course. He wasn\u2019t surprised. At this point, very little would surprise him, where Susanna Finch was concerned. She could tell him she ran an elite espionage ring out of her morning room, and he would believe it.</p><p>The ladies walked briskly across the meadow to retrieve their arrows. Bram\u2019s eyes were fixed on Susanna as she crossed the ground in smooth, confident strides. She moved through the tallish grass like an African gazelle, all long legs and graceful strength.</p><p>\u201cPistols, please,\u201d she said, once they\u2019d all returned. She traded her bow and arrow for a single-barreled weapon.</p><p>Each lady in line lifted a similar firearm and held it in braced, outstretched arms, staring down her respective bull\u2019s-eye. When Susanna cocked her pistol, the others followed suit. The chorus of clicks raced down Bram\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cI find this scene wildly arousing,\u201d Colin murmured, echoing Bram\u2019s own thoughts. \u201cIs that wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it is, I can promise you company in hell.\u201d</p><p>His cousin made an amused sound. \u201cAnd you thought we have nothing in common.\u201d</p><p>Susanna leveled her pistol and took aim. \u201cOne . . . Two . . .\u201d</p><p>Crack.</p><p>Neat, smoking holes appeared on each of the targets. In unison, the girls lowered their pistols and set them aside. Bram whistled low, admiring the accuracy of the ladies\u2019 marksmanship.</p><p>\u201cRifles next,\u201d Susanna called out, shouldering her own firearm. \u201cOne . . . Two . . .\u201d</p><p>Bang.</p><p>Once again, true shots, all. One of the targets exploded with a little burst of paper, rather than the usual batting and straw. A breeze carried a scrap of it to land at Bram\u2019s boots.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Colin asked. He bent to retrieve it. \u201cA page from some book. By a Mrs. Worthington?\u201d</p><p>The name was oddly familiar to Bram, but he couldn\u2019t think why.</p><p>Colin shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea why this place is called Spinster Cove. It ought to be Amazon Inlet. Or Valkyrie Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Here Bram had been straining and sweating through his effort to round up the local men and train them into a fighting force. Meanwhile, Susanna had already organized her own army. An army of females, no less.</p><p>She was, quite simply, the most amazing woman he\u2019d ever known. More the pity that this morning, as she stared down that target, she was probably envisioning Bram\u2019s face on it\u2014if not his nether regions.</p><p>Steeling his nerve, he strode forward into the breach. As he walked the line of markswomen, he had the distinct sensation of being a moving target. Susanna caught sight of him and stopped short.</p><p>As he neared her, he held up his open hands in a gesture of peace. \u201cI told you I\u2019d risk a firing squad.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching. Admiring.\u201d He flicked a glance toward the women. \u201cYou\u2019ve trained your ladies well. I\u2019m impressed. Impressed, but not surprised.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A blush climbed her throat. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed a woman should know how to protect herself.\u201d She reached for the powder horn and a gleaming, polished example of the pistol with which she shared a name.</p><p>\u201cThe men have been working since sunup to put the tea shop back to rights,\u201d he said. He nodded toward his cousin. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve brought Payne along to apologize. If he doesn\u2019t do a fair job of it, you can use him for target practice.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile. \u201cUnfortunately, the tea shop is the least of the damage incurred. And it\u2019s not me who deserves his apology.\u201d</p> <p>Concerned, he looked around the shooting party. \u201cIs Miss Highwood still feeling poorly?\u201d</p><p>She poured a measure of powder into the pistol, following the charge with a patch-wrapped ball. \u201cI stopped by early this morning. She\u2019s resting for caution\u2019s sake, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll suffer any lasting effects from the incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever\u201d\u2014she cocked her weapon\u2014\u201cher mother is now set on removing her daughters from Spindle Cove. There\u2019s a new spa in Kent, you see. She\u2019s heard they do remarkable things with leeches and mercury.\u201d</p><p>Susanna turned, leveled her pistol at the distant target, and shot. A whisper of smoke wafted from the gun barrel. He could have sworn he glimpsed smoke emanating from her ears, as well.</p> <p>Bram muttered an oath. \u201cI\u2019ll send my cousin to call on them, too. I\u2019m told he can be very charming and persuasive with the ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all honesty, my lord, I\u2019m not sure which has the greater toxic potential. Your cousin\u2019s charm, or the mercury.\u201d She lowered her weapon and her voice. \u201cMrs. Highwood is all but packing her trunks. Miss Winterbottom and Mrs. Lange are speaking of leaving, too. If they leave, others will doubtless follow. If the general concern reaches Society at large, our reputation as a safe haven will be destroyed. All the families will call their daughters and wards home. Everything will come to an end. And for what? This absurd militia is doomed to fail. The men are hopeless.\u201d</p><p>Never mind the weapons, or the dozen ladies looking on. Bram longed to pull her into his arms, hold her just as close and tight as he had beneath that willow tree.</p><p>\u201cSusanna, look at me.\u201d</p><p>He waited until those clear, iris-blue eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cI will mend this,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I let you down last night, but it won\u2019t happen again. My cousin and I will convince the ladies it\u2019s safe to stay. Until the midsummer fair, I will keep the men tightly reined and out of your way. And someway, somehow, over the course of the next fortnight, I will drill them into an elite, precise militia to impress your father\u2019s guests.\u201d</p> <p>She made a sound of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBecause that\u2019s an officer\u2019s duty. To make unlikely men into soldiers, and to ensure they turn up trained and prepared, wherever and whenever they\u2019re needed. It\u2019s what I do, and I\u2019m good at it.\u201d</p><p>She released a breath. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a very capable commander, when you don\u2019t have to contend with teacakes and poetry and cudgel-wielding bluestockings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been distracted. But that\u2019s all to do with you, Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved a little. A tiny fishhook of a smile that had his heart instantly snagged.</p><p>But then it faded, and she turned from him, looking off to the distance, toward the village. Her spine was straight; her shoulders, bravely squared. But the fear was there, in the tiny quiver of her bottom lip and the gooseflesh dotting the graceful curve of her shoulder. She felt responsible for the place, and she was scared.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let her feel that way. Not when he had the perfect opportunity and every honorable reason to make her problems his own. To make Susanna his own. Right now, this very morning. He\u2019d been thinking on the possibility all night, but now the decision simply clicked within him. Crisp and clear as the sound of a pistol being cocked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. About anything.\u201d He stepped back a pace, heading in the direction of the house. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave my cousin here to grovel before your ladies. Make him fall on his knees, if you would. I\u2019m off to have a talk with your father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, turning back to him. \u201cYou promised not to involve my father. You gave me your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He turned away. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to him about the militia. This is strictly to do with you and me.\u201d</p><p>Susanna watched him as he walked toward the house, wondering if she\u2019d understood him correctly. Did he just say he meant to speak with her father? About the two of them?</p><p>If he intended that the way it sounded . . .</p><p>\u201cOh drat.\u201d She picked up her skirts and gave chase.</p><p>She caught up to him just as he reached the house\u2019s side entrance. \u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d she asked, panting, \u201cthat you\u2019re going to speak to my father? About us? Surely you can\u2019t mean that the way it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly I can.\u201d</p><p>A footman opened the door for him, and he walked through. Leaving her on the threshold with no further explanation. Teasing, cryptic man.</p><p>\u201cWait just a minute,\u201d she called, chasing him down the corridor. \u201cAre you referring to\u201d\u2014she dropped her voice to a scandalized whisper\u2014\u201cmarriage? And if that\u2019s the case, shouldn\u2019t you be talking to me first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we did last night renders that conversation rather irrelevant, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t agree.\u201d Panic struck her in the breastbone. She put a hand on his arm, arresting his progress. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell my father. About last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words. But when I offer for you so abruptly, I wager he\u2019s going to gather the reason why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. And if my father gathers the reason why, everyone will. All the ladies. The whole village. Bram, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna, I must.\u201d His jade-green gaze captured hers. \u201cIt\u2019s the only decent thing to do.\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cSince when do you care about decent behavior?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, only turned and walked on. This time, there was no stopping him until he\u2019d turned down the rear corridor and halted in the entry of her father\u2019s workshop.</p><p>\u201cSir Lewis?\u201d He rapped smartly on the doorjamb.</p><p>\u201cNot now, please,\u201d her father replied, his voice hazy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working,\u201d Susanna whispered. \u201cNo one disturbs him when he\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>Bram only raised his voice. \u201cSir Lewis, it\u2019s Bramwell. I need to speak with you on a matter of some urgency.\u201d</p><p>Good God. Susanna urgently needed to knock some sense into this man.</p><p>Her father sighed. \u201cVery well, then. Go on to my library. I\u2019ll meet you there in a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Bram turned on his heel without further comment, making his way toward Sir Lewis\u2019s library. Susanna stood there for a moment, dumbstruck, wondering whether her best hopes lay in reasoning with Bram or distracting her father. Perhaps she ought to simply run upstairs, pack a valise, and abscond to a small, uncharted territory. She\u2019d heard the Sandwich Islands were lovely this time of year.</p><p>The idea was tempting, but she took her chances with the library. Bram stood grim and monolithic in the center of the Egyptian-themed room, looking like a man awaiting his own funeral.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth are you doing this?\u201d she asked, shutting the door. Obviously, not because he wished to.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the honorable thing. The only thing I can do.\u201d He released a curt sigh. \u201cI should not have done what I did last night if I weren\u2019t prepared to do this today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t I enter this question at all? Don\u2019t you have the slightest regard for my feelings in the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have every regard for you and your feelings. That\u2019s the point. You\u2019re a gentlewoman, and last night I took your virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take it. I gave it. Freely, and with no expectations.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cListen, I know you\u2019re full of modern ideas. But my own views on marriage are more traditional. Or medieval, as you\u2019re so fond of saying. If a man deflowers a gently bred virgin in a public square, he ought to marry her. End of story.\u201d</p><p>End of story. That was the problem, wasn\u2019t it? She might not be so panicked at the idea of marrying him\u2014in fact, the prospect might make her dizzyingly happy\u2014if he saw their wedding as the beginning of a story. A story that included love and a home and a family, and ended with the words \u201chappily ever after.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t, as his next words made clear.</p><p>\u201cIt will come out to your advantage, you\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll marry before I go back to war, and then you\u2019ll be free to do as you please. You\u2019ll be Lady Rycliff. You can continue your work, but as a countess. It can only help the village\u2019s reputation.\u201d As an offhand addition, he told the desk blotter, \u201cI have money. A good deal of it. You\u2019ll be well provided for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very practical,\u201d she muttered. It had been many years since Susanna had daydreamed about receiving marriage offers, but she was certain none of those imagined proposals had sounded quite like this.</p><p>She moved into his line of sight, standing in front of her father\u2019s desk. She placed both hands on the desk\u2019s carved wood edge and hoisted herself up so that she sat on the desktop, legs dangling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lack money. Nor do I lack social influence. If you go through with this fool plan this morning, however, you may find yourself lacking a pulse.\u201d She raised her hands to shoulder height. \u201cEvery room of this house holds lethal weaponry. You do realize, there\u2019s a solid chance my father could kill you.\u201d</p><p>If he doesn\u2019t collapse of an apoplexy first.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf I were him, I\u2019d want to kill me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd even if he doesn\u2019t,\u201d she went on, \u201che could ruin you. Strip you of all your honors and insignia. Have you demoted to the lowest rank of foot soldier.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply right away. Aha. So that argument made some impression.</p><p>\u201cThink of your commission, Bram. And please stop being so dratted chivalrous, or I\u2019ll . . .\u201d She gestured wildly toward the alabaster sarcophagus. \u201cOr I\u2019ll stuff you in that coffin and close the lid.\u201d</p><p>His brow quirked. \u201cWhen you talk like that, you know you only make me want you more.\u201d</p><p>He took a step forward, drawing close. Too close.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just chivalry.\u201d His voice was a low, arousing rumble. His hand brushed her calf, and desire forked through her like lightning. \u201cYou must know that. What we shared last night? I want to do it again. And again. And again. Hard and fast. Slow and sweet. Every way in between.\u201d</p><p>A long, languid sigh escaped her lips. Just those words had her warm and pink all over. How stupid she\u2019d been, to think one taste of passion would satisfy her for a lifetime. She would hunger for this man as long as she lived.</p><p>He leaned in for a kiss, but she put a hand to his chest. Keeping some distance between them, but also maintaining contact. Enjoying the strong, male feel of him under her touch.</p><p>\u201cBram,\u201d she said, swallowing hard, \u201clust isn\u2019t a good reason to marry.\u201d</p><p>He paused to reflect. \u201cI think it\u2019s the reason most people marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not most people.\u201d She felt herself frowning as she searched for a way to make him understand. \u201cThis may be silly to say now, after all that\u2019s happened between us, but I . . . I like you.\u201d</p><p>His chin ducked in surprise. \u201cYou . . . like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I do. I\u2019ve come to like you. A great deal, you see. And I respect your deep commitment to your work. Because I feel the same. I wouldn\u2019t want you to destroy your career and reputation. And I hope you wouldn\u2019t want to see mine destroyed. But that\u2019s what could happen, for both of us, if you insist on talking to my father today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stood tall and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI have to offer for you. I have to offer for you, or I can\u2019t live with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have offered.\u201d Tilting her head, she gestured loosely between them. \u201cIn some way that involves no declarations of sentiment or actual posing of questions, you\u2019ve offered to wed me in haste, bed me with enthusiasm, and then leave me alone to deal with speculation and scandal, all so you can go throw yourself in front of another bullet with a clear conscience. Please accept my polite refusal. My lord.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s the deceit, Susanna. I can\u2019t stomach the lies. Your father has done a great deal for me. He at least deserves my honesty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHullo. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Her father stood in the doorway, still dressed in his work apron.</p><p>Susanna smiled, sat tall on the desk, and chirped, \u201cOh, nothing. Lord Rycliff and I were just having a scandalous, clandestine affair.\u201d</p><p>Her father froze.</p><p>Susanna kept that smile pasted on her face.</p> <p>And finally, with the same palpable, atmospheric relief that accompanied a storm breaking, Papa finally burst into wry, disbelieving laughter.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she whispered, brushing past a stunned Bram as she dismounted the desk. \u201cNo more deceit.\u201d</p><p>She tapped her chin meaningfully. Taking the hint, he shut his gaping mouth. He shot her a fierce green look, equal parts admiration and annoyance.</p><p>Rubbing his hands on his apron, Papa said, still chuckling, \u201cI did wonder why I found myself dining alone last night. Rycliff is lucky I heard about that hubbub in the village last night. If not, I might be testing the new rifle lock on him this morning.\u201d He crossed to the bar and unstoppered a decanter of whiskey. \u201cWell, Bram? Out with it. Let\u2019s keep this brief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Bram said. \u201cSir Lewis, I came to discuss an important matter with you. It involves Miss Finch. And a proposal.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach plummeted to the floor. Still? He meant to pursue this still? Oh, he was so wretchedly honorable and good.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of proposal?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>Bram cleared his throat. \u201cThe usual kind. You see, sir . . . Last night, Miss Finch and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere talking,\u201d Susanna interjected. \u201cAbout the militia review.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Papa turned and handed Bram a tumbler of whiskey.</p><p>Bram lifted the glass, sipped\u2014then seemed to think better of the gradual approach and drained the rest in a single swallow. \u201cAs you know, we were called away from the dining room to deal with some disturbance in the village. But when we arrived there, one thing led to another, and . . .\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cSir Lewis, we engaged in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntense debate,\u201d Susanna finished. \u201cWe argued. Most\u201d\u2014she flicked a glance at Bram\u2014\u201cpassionately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever about?\u201d Sir Lewis frowned as he lifted his own glass.</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d</p> <p>Bram, curse him, just thrust that word into conversation. It was bold, bald, and unfortunately for her, impossible to cut short. In the ensuing tense silence, he slid her a look that said, Take that.</p><p>She hoisted her chin. \u201cYes. Just so. The sexes. Male and female. In our village. You see, Papa, the militia endeavor has been disrupting the ladies\u2019 restorative atmosphere. It seems the needs of men and women in this village are at odds, and Lord Rycliff and I exchanged some rather heated words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I gave Miss Finch quite the tongue-lashing.\u201d</p><p>A violent coughing fit seized Susanna.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Bram continued, \u201cwhen we concluded that argument, we adjourned to the village green. And that was where we joined\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForces,\u201d Susanna supplied, fairly shouting the word. An echo bounced back at her from the ancient sarcophagus.</p><p>Her father blinked at her. \u201cForces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smoothed her damp palms on her skirts. \u201cWe decided to put aside our differences and work together for the good of the whole.\u201d</p><p>She slid a glance toward Bram. He leaned one hand against a papyrus-shaped column and made a magnanimous wave with his empty glass. \u201cOh, do go on. You tell him everything. I\u2019ll wait and have my say at the end.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged looks of challenge and amusement. It must be wrong, she thought\u2014very wrong indeed, that this conversation was fraught with imminent peril, and yet they were having so much fun.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, trying for a more serious tone, \u201cthat this militia review is important. Important to you, Papa.\u201d She turned to her father. \u201cAnd important to Lord Rycliff, as well. But if I may say it . . . much as I know this is difficult for Lord Rycliff to admit . . . initial prospects do not look encouraging. Quite frankly, his recruits are hopeless. The review could prove a disaster, embarrassing us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, wait,\u201d Bram said, pushing off the column. \u201cThat\u2019s premature. We\u2019ve only had a few days. I will train those men into a\u2014\u201d</p><p>Susanna raised an open palm. \u201cYou did tell me I could have my say.\u201d Turning back to her father, she continued, \u201cAt the same time, Papa, the ladies at the Queen\u2019s Ruby are growing concerned. The militia exercises have disrupted their schedule, and they\u2019ve lost the highlight of their summer\u2014planning the midsummer fair. Some are thinking of leaving Spindle Cove entirely, which could prove disastrous in its own, albeit different way.\u201d</p><p>She drew a deep breath. \u201cSo Lord Rycliff and I have decided to join forces and work together, to protect what\u2019s most dear to us both. The militia drills and preparations will become the joint project of all village residents. Men and ladies, together. There\u2019s so much to be done, and Lord Rycliff has admitted he can\u2019t do it without my help.\u201d She gave Bram a cautious glance. \u201cBut together, we can plan a display to do you proud. What do you think, Papa?\u201d</p><p>Her father sighed. \u201cIt all sounds eminently logical. And entirely unworthy of this urgent conference that disrupted my work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something else,\u201d Bram said. \u201cA question that requires your answer.\u201d</p><p>Susanna gulped. \u201cCan we have a ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ball?\u201d Bram and her father echoed in unison.</p><p>\u201cYes, a ball.\u201d She\u2019d blurted out the idea without thinking, but upon reflection, Susanna saw that it was perfect. \u201cThat\u2019s the proposal. We\u2019d like to hold a ball here, at Summerfield. An officers\u2019 ball, directly following the field review. I know you will have esteemed guests for the occasion, Papa. A ball is the perfect way to honor and entertain them. It will also serve as a reward for the militia volunteers, after all their hard work. And it will give the young ladies something to look forward to. A reason to stay. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, Susanna. You may have a ball.\u201d Her father plunked his glass on the desk.</p><p>And then his manner changed, somehow. His gaze roamed the blotter absently, as though he\u2019d misplaced his chain of thought. And Susanna felt dropped, without warning, into one of those awful, terrifying moments. Those moments where the filter of daughterly affection slipped, and suddenly she wasn\u2019t looking at her dear familiar papa, the charismatic, eccentric hero of her childhood\u2014but simply at a stranger named Lewis Finch. And that man looked so old and so tired.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes. \u201cI know this militia business seems rather silly on the face of things. But there\u2019s a great deal hanging in the balance\u2014for us all, in one way or another. I\u2019m gratified to see the two of you working together to ensure its success. Thank you. Now, if you\u2019ll both excuse me.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone, exiting through the side door.</p><p>Bram turned to her. His expression was blank. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe I did what? Save your life and your career? Not that you seem to make a distinction between the two.\u201d</p><p>He stared out the window. \u201cSusanna, you just gave him reason to doubt me. He assigned me a duty, and you told him I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>She winced. How was it that men could be so big and strong in body, and yet so fragile when it came to pride?</p><p>\u201cI told him you can\u2019t do it alone. And there\u2019s no shame in that.\u201d She moved to stand at his side. She began to reach for him, but thought better of it, crossing her arms instead. \u201cAs my father just said, a great deal hangs in the balance. I know what this means to you, truly. You need to prove yourself after your injury, and this is your one chance.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of denial crossed his features, like a knee-jerk reflex. But then he nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She wanted so badly to hug him. Perhaps, once this militia was a success and he had proved himself, he could turn his attention to all those other, less easily admitted needs. Like his palpable yearning for closeness and affection. Or his obvious, unspoken desire for a true home. Perhaps he\u2019d even change his mind, and decide to stay. But she knew he couldn\u2019t consider any of those things until he felt strong and whole again, in command of himself and others.</p><p>\u201cThen let me help.\u201d She said honestly, \u201cFor both your sake and my father\u2019s, I want to see you succeed. But we must face facts. You have a little more than a fortnight to get those men uniformed, drilled, and trained to perfection. Not to mention all the preparations for the day itself. There\u2019s so much work to be done. I know this village, inside and out. You can\u2019t do it without me.\u201d</p><p>He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve thrown an officers\u2019 ball into the mix, I suppose I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a spur-of-the-moment idea,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut a good one. If anything can convince Mrs. Highwood and the others to stay, it\u2019s the prospect of planning a ball. We\u2019ll need everyone working together, men and ladies. If we\u2019re going to keep both our dreams from disintegrating, we have to make this day a grand success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tells me Miss Finch has a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a plan,\u201d she said, smiling a little. \u201cA schedule. As you know, Mondays are country walks. Tuesdays, sea bathing. On Wednesdays we\u2019re in the garden, and Thursdays we shoot. On Fridays, we\u2019ve always climbed up to the castle. To picnic, sketch, stage our little theatricals. Or sometimes just to plot and scheme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t disrupt the ladies\u2019 schedule, now can we? Bring them all up, then. It\u2019ll be a good way for the men to patch things over, after last night\u2019s mayhem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll plot and scheme together, Bram. You\u2019ll see, it will all come out right.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, so handsome and strong. Along with all the other firsts he\u2019d given her, he\u2019d now made her first offer of marriage. A forced and unromantic one, but still. She rather treasured the sentiment, and she wanted to repay it somehow.</p><p>On impulse, she leaned forward and kissed his cheek. \u201cThank you. For everything.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her elbow, forbidding her to retreat. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d His words were hot against her ear. \u201cHow do matters stand between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I . . . I still like you.\u201d Nerves fluttered in her chest, but she kept her tone light. \u201cDo you like me?\u201d</p><p>A few moments passed in silence. She would have counted them in heartbeats, but her foolish heart had become a most unreliable timepiece. It gave three pounding beats in a flurry, then none at all.</p><p>Just when she\u2019d begun to despair, he turned his head, catching her in a passionate, openmouthed kiss. He put both arms around her, fisting his hands in the fabric of her dress, lifting her up and against his chest. So that her body recalled every inch of his, every second of their blissful lovemaking. The now-familiar ache returned\u2014that sweet, hollow pang of desire that only deepened as his tongue flickered over hers. In a matter of seconds, he had her gasping. Needing. Damp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he set her back on her toes. Pressed his brow to hers and released a deep, resonant sigh. And just before turning to leave, he spoke a single word.</p><p>He said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p> <p>He did not \u201clike\u201d Susanna Finch. Of this much, Bram was certain.</p><p>\u201cLike\u201d was . . . the verbal equivalent of blancmange. Pleasant enough, blandly sweet. Always on the table. Not something a man turned down, but not something he asked for second helpings of, either. The word \u201clike\u201d did not communicate an unspoken connection of similar minds, or an obsessive attention to freckles. It certainly didn\u2019t encompass the sort of wild, reckless, unreasoned lust that had driven him to deflower a virgin on the village green.</p><p>No, he did not \u201clike\u201d her. Beyond that, Bram was at a loss to describe his emotional state. Putting labels on feelings was Susanna\u2019s hobby, not his.</p><p>And at the moment, she was occupied.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Lange has excellent penmanship,\u201d she muttered, scratching with a pencil on paper as she did. \u201cI\u2019ll put her on invitations.\u201d</p> <p>She had arrived at the castle early that morning, well in advance of the picnicking girls. Together, they\u2019d convened their council atop the southwest turret of Rycliff Castle\u2019s keep. They\u2019d been sitting here on campstools for hours now, with a backdrop of gulls swooping over the brilliant aquamarine sea, sorting out all the tasks to be accomplished in the next fortnight.</p><p>Well, she had been sorting out the tasks. Bram had mostly been staring at her, occasionally stealing sips of whiskey, and trying to sort out the tangle of feelings and impulses churning in his chest.</p><p>\u201cPatches will be Charlotte\u2019s task. As well as . . . rolling . . . cartridges.\u201d She scribbled as she spoke, adding to the bottom of a very long list. She kept her gaze stubbornly trained on the paper.</p><p>His gaze was riveted to her. He was fascinated. Just when he\u2019d started to think he knew Susanna Finch, the morning light introduced her all over again. Every hour\u2014every minute, perhaps\u2014announced another facet of her beauty. Each tilt of her head invented new alloys of copper and gold. And now\u2014just this second\u2014the advancing veil of sunlight made its way over the crest of her shoulder, and he could see how the skin of her d\u00e9colletage was so delicate and fair . . . nearly translucent.</p><p>And bloody hell. This journeyed far beyond \u201clike,\u201d rocketed straight past \u201cfondness,\u201d and pushed all the way to the brink of absurdity.</p><p>He knew all her objections to marriage were logical. She\u2019d built her life and village around happy spinsterhood, and the demands of his military career left no room for a wife. A hasty wedding could mean grief for Sir Lewis, scandal for Susanna, and God knew what for Bram. But he was going to marry her, despite it. Because when he looked at Susanna, all he could think was one word. It wasn\u2019t a particularly elegant or poetic word, any more so than \u201clike.\u201d But it had a straightforward eloquence all its own.</p> <p>Mine.</p><p>No matter what it cost him, he simply had to make her his.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s everything.\u201d She let the list fall to her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s so much work. But I think we can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we can.\u201d He took the list from her and read through it. It was every bit as thorough and well planned as he\u2019d known it would be. He forced himself to focus, setting aside all his lustful desires and marital plans. For the next fortnight or so, these tasks required his full attention. He didn\u2019t want to let Susanna and her father down. Nor the rest of the village, which he was suddenly\u2014and unexpectedly\u2014beginning to care about.</p><p>\u201cI think everyone\u2019s arrived by now.\u201d She peered down over the crenellated edge of the turret. Below, the assembled men and women of Spindle Cove were picnicking on the grassy, even ground of the bailey.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that means my cousin groveled prettily enough.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI suppose it does. And what an occasion the rest of your men have made it. You\u2019ve outdone yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d But Bram had taken the picnic invitation in earnest. In anticipation of their guests, his militia volunteers had set out canopies and blankets and heaped a table with refreshments, courtesy of the Blushing Pansy. At least, he assumed the Fosburys\u2019 establishment was back to being the Blushing Pansy. The building was returned to rights, but last he\u2019d been in the village, no sign at all had swung above the red-painted door.</p> <p>\u201cRufus and Finn seem to have mended their differences,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve learned their lesson. That they\u2019ll catch more female attention united in mischief than divided by rancor.\u201d</p><p>The twins had tied a scarf to that dratted lamb, and offered a prize to the first girl to remove it. Giving chase, Charlotte dashed after Dinner for the full length of the keep, only to catch her toe on a rock and sprawl to the ground.</p><p>Beside him, Susanna gave a sharp gasp. She clutched Bram\u2019s hand. Even through her gloves, her fingernails bit into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey\u2019re made of India rubber at that age. She\u2019ll bounce back up.\u201d</p><p>He understood, in that moment, how keenly she felt it when any of her young ladies suffered the smallest humiliation or pain. When the situation demanded it, as was the case during Diana\u2019s attack, she could be strong and collected and brave. But here with him, she didn\u2019t hide her concern. She would allow him to comfort her. And perhaps, someday, she would listen patiently if a dark, dreary night found him well in his cups and he drunkenly confessed to still feeling scores of wounds that weren\u2019t his own, but those of men under his command.</p><p>As they looked on, Mr. Keane helped Charlotte to her feet. The girl gamely brushed out her skirts. Fosbury offered a consolatory teacake, and everyone watching had a good-natured laugh.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s unharmed.\u201d He squeezed her fingers, only too glad for the excuse. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor dear.\u201d She didn\u2019t withdraw her hand. Instead, she leaned into him, just a little. \u201cBut after that disaster with the tea shop, it\u2019s good to see them all like this. The ladies and men together, enjoying each other\u2019s company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d best enjoy themselves now,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter this morning, there\u2019ll be no time for amusement. Every soul in Spindle Cove will have a great deal of work ahead of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr her,\u201d she finished pointedly. \u201cRight. We should go down and make the announcement. If we\u2019re asking them to work together, I think it\u2019s important we present a united front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d he said, as they descended the circling stone staircase. He paused, just before they stepped onto the green. \u201cHere\u2019s an idea. Why don\u2019t I introduce you as the future Lady Rycliff?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew wide with panic. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d But you will be. She ought to know he had no idea of abandoning his suit, only postponing it. He considered. \u201cThe future future Lady Rycliff, perhaps? Or I could just call you my mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBram!\u201d She nudged him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cMy illicit lover, then.\u201d At her pained look, he said, \u201cWhat? So long as you refuse to marry me, that\u2019s exactly what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re horrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod help me,\u201d she whimpered, as he tugged her out of the keep and onto the bailey green.</p><p>\u201cGather round,\u201d Bram called as they came to stand in the center of the grassy expanse. \u201cMiss Finch and I have some announcements to make.\u201d</p><p>At his use of her proper name, Susanna exhaled with relief. She hoped Bram wouldn\u2019t be so bold as to announce their tryst as a matter of public business . . . but after that narrow escape with Papa yesterday, she wasn\u2019t sure she could put it past him.</p><p>All around the green, the ladies and men exchanged intrigued glances as they set aside their teacakes and lemonade to listen.</p><p>\u201cAs you all know,\u201d Bram began, \u201cI\u2019ve given my word to Sir Lewis Finch, and by proxy, the Duke of Tunbridge, that Spindle Cove will present a field review. A precise, choreographed display of our military might and readiness on the date of the midsummer fair, scarcely more than a fortnight away.\u201d</p><p>The men looked to one another.</p><p>Aaron Dawes shook his head. \u201cRather a daunting task, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA daunting task?\u201d Fosbury said. \u201cTry \u2018hopeless.\u2019 We can\u2019t march in a straight line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even have proper uniforms,\u201d Keane added.</p><p>A murmur of general agreement rippled through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not hopeless,\u201d Bram said, in an authoritative voice that made everyone present snap to attention, Susanna included. \u201cNor even daunted. We have manpower. We have supplies. And we have a plan.\u201d He waved to her. \u201cMiss Finch will explain.\u201d</p><p>Susanna held up the list in her gloved hand. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to work together. The ladies and the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ladies?\u201d Mrs. Highwood exclaimed. \u201cWhat place have ladies in planning a militia review?\u201d</p><p>Susanna replied calmly, \u201cIn Spindle Cove, ladies can do anything. I know it\u2019s outside the realm of our usual activities, but on this short notice, everyone must contribute according to his or her strongest talents. The men need our help, and we need the men to succeed. If the militia is found lacking, do you think the duke will leave the castle unprotected? No. He will surely send other troops to encamp here. And needless to say, if a company of strange soldiers encamp on these bluffs, Spindle Cove as we know it\u201d\u2014she turned her gaze from lady to lady\u2014\u201cas we love and need it, will cease to exist.\u201d</p><p>Dismay rumbled through the group.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, the village would be overrun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d all have to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here we\u2019ve just fixed up the tea shop.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte leaped to her feet. \u201cWe can\u2019t let it happen, Miss Finch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen, Charlotte. We just have to show the duke and a few visiting generals that Lord Rycliff\u2019s militia is ready and able to defend Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>Bram took over. \u201cAll volunteers will encamp here, at the castle. Your time and full efforts, sunup to sundown, will be required. We\u2019ve worked out a schedule. Corporal Thorne will take charge of drilling you through the formations. Prepare to march your feet to stumps. The lines must be crisp; the formations, exact. Lord Payne\u201d\u2014he shot a look at his surprised cousin\u2014\u201cwith his natural talent for explosions, will be in charge of artillery. As for firearms . . .\u201d He motioned in Susanna\u2019s direction. \u201cMiss Finch will lead daily practice in marksmanship.\u201d</p><p>A murmur of surprise swept the assembled ladies and men.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mrs. Highwood cried. \u201cA lady, teaching men to shoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d Bram asked, sliding her a knowing look. \u201cShe\u2019s a thing of beauty with a gun.\u201d</p><p>Fighting a blush, Susanna returned her attention to the list. \u201cMiss Taylor will suspend her regular music lessons to give Finn and Rufus Bright intensive tutoring. Mrs. Montgomery and Mrs. Fosbury will jointly lead the uniforms committee. All available ladies will assist with the sewing in the evenings.\u201d She lowered the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that the men look their polished and tailored best, to make a good impression.\u201d</p><p>Bram added, \u201cIt\u2019s also vital that the visitors be entertained. They\u2019ll be guests at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummerfield,\u201d Susanna finished, growing a touch excited despite herself. \u201cWe\u2019ll be hosting an officers\u2019 ball, to follow the field review.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ball?\u201d Mrs. Highwood said. \u201cOh, that is good news. At long last, my Diana will have her chance to shine. She\u2019ll have recovered her health by then, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m certain of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lord Payne, you devil . . .\u201d The matron\u2019s face creased with a smile as she waved her handkerchief at Colin. \u201cYou must promise her a nice, slow quadrille this time. None of that wild country dancing.\u201d</p><p>Colin bowed. \u201cAs you like, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>Hoping to redirect the conversation, Susanna cleared her throat. \u201cNow, for preparations. I will ask Miss Winterbottom and Mrs. Montgomery to assist with the menus. Sally Bright and Mr. Keane\u2014you two possess the best eye for color, so decorations are yours. Miss Taylor is the natural choice for music, and Mr. Fosbury, I do hope you\u2019ll bake us some cakes. Our chef at Summerfield can\u2019t match your confections.\u201d She smiled at him over the paper. \u201cNow, Mrs. Lange\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman in question sat tall. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask. I\u2019d be glad to compose a poem for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be very . . .\u201d Susanna paused. \u201cSpecial,\u201d she finished. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Lange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Charlotte waved her hand. \u201cEveryone else has a task. I want one, too.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI have a very important job for you, Charlotte. And I\u2019ll explain it to you later, back at the rooming house.\u201d She lowered the paper. \u201cIt goes without saying, our usual activity schedule is suspended.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d Bram said. \u201cAnd it starts this afternoon. Finish your refreshments. Pack away the blankets and canopies. Take the scarf off the sheep. All men should assemble for drill in a quarter hour\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Susanna called out, before the entire group dispersed, \u201cwe will adjourn to the inn to begin cutting pieces for uniforms.\u201d</p><p>As the men and women rose from their blankets and began to remove all evidence of merriment, she turned to Bram. \u201cI think that went as well as could be expected.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt went well indeed.\u201d</p><p>To be truthful, she\u2019d enjoyed the past quarter hour immensely. Standing next to Bram as an equal, rather than squaring off against him. Speaking together, instead of over each other\u2019s words. As they\u2019d addressed their friends and neighbors, the air had hummed with a pleasant chord of harmony, and she\u2019d almost felt as if . . .</p><p>She dropped a step back, cocked her head, and peered at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, looking self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . You look very lordly, all of a sudden. Standing there in front of the keep, addressing all the villagers. It\u2019s as though you were born to the Rycliff title, instead of gifted it a week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d His brows drew together. \u201cMy father was a major general, not an earl of any sort. I don\u2019t mean to forget that, ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I didn\u2019t mean it that way. Your father was a great man, and naturally you\u2019ll always be proud to be his son. But that doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t be proud of you today, does it?\u201d</p><p>He had no reply to that. After a prolonged pause, he said, \u201cI\u2019d best go ready myself for drill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I suppose I should be going, too.\u201d</p><p>As he began to walk past her toward the keep, she once again noted the slight hitch in his gait. An impulse seized her. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She could have reached out to catch his arm or his shoulder. But no. She had to go pressing her hand flat against his strong, solid chest. Realizing her mistake, she snatched it back\u2014but the thumping echo of his heartbeat lingered on her palm.</p> <p>A furtive glance around her indicated that no one had observed the bold gesture. Not this time, at least. But judging by the hot blush scalding her cheeks, Susanna knew she was going to have to work very hard to keep her attraction to Bram below notice.</p><p>Which made her next words imprudent as anything.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one other task we need to address. One not on the list.\u201d She still clutched the paper in her hand and spoke low. \u201cSomething that requires the two of us to work together. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Surprise\u2014and desire\u2014flared in his jade-green eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that I\u2019m intrigued. Name the place and time. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cove,\u201d she murmured, sending up a prayer that she wasn\u2019t making an enormous mistake. \u201cAfter dark. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Stars blanketed the clear night, and the moon hung large and yellow in the sky. A fortunate thing, or Bram would have had no light by which to pick his way down to the cove. He kept his eyes trained on the path, careful not to misstep. As a result, he reached the pebbled shore without any idea where\u2014or even if\u2014he would find Susanna. He didn\u2019t see her anywhere along the beach.</p><p>Perhaps she hadn\u2019t been able to slip away. Perhaps she\u2019d changed her mind about meeting him. Perhaps she\u2019d never intended to meet him at all, but only meant to play him a clever trick.</p><p>A soft splash drew his attention.</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d he heard her call.</p><p>He approached the water\u2019s edge. \u201cSusanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. In the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the water?\u201d His eyes adjusted to the darkness. There she was, his alluring mermaid, submerged to her neck in the sea. \u201cWhat are you wearing under there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome join me if you want to find out.\u201d</p><p>Bram had never shucked his clothes faster. He stripped straight down to his skin. This wasn\u2019t one of Spindle Cove\u2019s warm, sunny afternoons. He would have a long walk back to the castle, and he didn\u2019t want to make it in sopping wet clothes.</p><p>\u201cDamn, this water is cold,\u201d he said, testing it with his toes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad tonight, truly. You\u2019ll grow accustomed to it.\u201d</p><p>He dashed into the sea, knowing it was better to douse himself all at once than to draw out the torture by slow degrees. He met her some distance out from shore, in a place where the water line hit him mid-abdomen. Unable to get a good look in the dark, he gave her shoulder an exploratory grope.</p><p>When he caught a handful of rough fabric, he groaned. \u201cNot the wretched bathing costume.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a husky, arousing laugh.</p><p>Blast it, he knew he shouldn\u2019t press matters too far. But she was so close, and they were finally alone again. He couldn\u2019t resist doing what he\u2019d been wanting to do all day. In a quick move, he pulled her close, wrapping arms and legs about her slender form. Holding her tight.</p><p>In his arms, she went utterly still. He felt her every muscle go rigid as steel.</p><p>\u201cBram. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m embracing you. It\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d She lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I forgot my bathing costume.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen all there is to see of me already. And there\u2019s no one here but the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is it we\u2019re whispering?\u201d</p><p>Peeved, she said aloud, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He teased her ear with his breath. \u201cWe could warm each other.\u201d</p><p>She made a frustrated noise and pushed away. \u201cBe serious, please. We\u2019re here for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know I\u2019m here for a reason. The reason is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The reason is your knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy knee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know it\u2019s been paining you. If you\u2019re going to make it through these next few weeks, you need to care for it properly. And if you\u2019re determined to return to field command after that . . . Well, I\u2019m equally determined to send you back with as much strength and stamina as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am strong.\u201d His pride was piqued. \u201cAnd you should know, I have abundant stamina.\u201d</p><p>With a dismissive noise, she moved away. She swam a few strokes to a nearby boulder, reaching for something. The way the mysterious object rattled, he imagined it to be some sort of chain. When she returned carrying it just at the water\u2019s surface, he caught the gleam of metal in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked, peering at it. \u201cSome sort of medieval torture device?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s exactly what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. I was joking. But you aren\u2019t, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I borrowed it from my father\u2019s collection. There\u2019s an ankle cuff, and this ball is attached. It\u2019s deuced heavy. Here.\u201d She dumped the ball into his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, his voice suddenly strained. \u201cIt is deuced heavy.\u201d</p><p>From a cord tied about her neck, she produced a thick key. With a bit of trial and error, she managed to fit the key into a hole in the iron cuff. The two halves opened like a clamshell.</p><p>\u201cThis fits around your ankle, see?\u201d she said. \u201cStand on your good leg, lift the bad, and I\u2019ll secure the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait just a minute. Let me be certain I understand this. You have me out here in the freezing ocean, naked\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to be naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you propose to leg-shackle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in the literal sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s the literal sense that concerns me. Being literally leg-shackled is bad enough, no need of metaphors. So once you have me bound and chained, how am I to know you won\u2019t just leave me here to freeze all night and be picked apart by gulls tomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>She unlooped the key from her own neck and transferred the necklace to him. \u201cThere. You may hold the key. Does that make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I still don\u2019t understand what your purpose is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll understand soon enough. Just lift your leg.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed, tilting his head back to stare up at the night. There was nothing like a sky full of stars to make a man reckon with his own humility. How, precisely, had he arrived at this? He was taking orders from a spinster, willingly submitting himself to her medieval torture devices. And she wasn\u2019t even naked.</p><p>\u201cYou can never tell a soul about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean it, Susanna. I\u2019ll deny it to my grave. My reputation would never recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour reputation? Do you think I\u2019m eager to spread tales of this scene?\u201d She fixed the cuff around his leg, and it snapped into place. \u201cNow slowly lower your foot, and drop the ball into the water.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he did as directed. The ball sank quickly to the pebbled bottom, dragging his foot down with it.</p><p>\u201cThere. Now you have resistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was short on resistance. I rather thought you\u2019d been giving me ample supply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical resistance.\u201d She retreated soundlessly, slicing back through the calm water to put space between them. \u201cWalk toward me, slowly. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward onto his good leg. When he tried to take a step with his injured leg, the ball and shackle dragged behind him. Heavy, but with the water\u2019s help, not impossible to move.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said, backing up another pace. \u201cKeep moving. Be certain to lift your leg, not drag it. As if you\u2019re marching.\u201d</p><p>He took several lunging paces more, chasing her through the chest-deep water. \u201cTell me why I\u2019m doing this?\u201d He backed her against a boulder, but she darted to the side, swimming away.</p><p>\u201cCome this way now,\u201d she directed, shaking her hair free of salty spray. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>He moved forward again. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this, Bram. You\u2019re a large man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, you\u2019re heavy. You\u2019re absolutely right that you need to use your leg in order to recover your full strength. Once your wound healed, staying abed was of no further benefit. But when you walk\u2014or run, or march\u2014on solid ground, you\u2019re adding your entire body weight to every step. And you\u2019re so big, it\u2019s too much strain. Here in the sea, the buoyancy relieves the pressure on your knee. And the shackle gives you a weight to work against.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He almost reached her, but again she swam out of his reach. He received only a splash of seawater for his pains.</p><p>\u201cIf you do this regularly,\u201d she called out to him, surfacing some distance away, \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to rebuild your strength without heaping more damage on your knee.\u201d</p><p>He had to admit, the theory of it made some sense. \u201cWho taught you all this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one. Two summers ago, we had a girl here recovering from a nasty fall from a horse. She\u2019d broken her leg and hip. Even months later, she could barely hobble around. Her physician at home had told her she would be an invalid. The poor thing was devastated. Only sixteen, you know. She thought she would never have a season, never marry. Fortunately, her father decided to send her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a cure?\u201d Bram lunged in her direction. He was catching the rhythm of this exercise now, and this time she barely escaped him.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he had any hope of a cure. He was probably hoping she would acclimate to life as an invalid spinster. But the sea bathing helped her tremendously. We did exercises like these several times a week. By the time she left at the end of the summer, she was walking unaided. Even dancing.\u201d He could hear the pride in her voice. \u201cI received a letter from her just a month ago. She\u2019s engaged. Her new betrothed is the heir to a barony. He\u2019s very handsome, I\u2019m given to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her. But what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is it you\u2019ve never married?\u201d</p><p>A soft splash. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy enough thing. Every morning I wake up, go about my day, and return to bed at night without having recited marriage vows. After several years, I have the trick of it down.\u201d</p><p>The tone of her remark was easy, light\u2014but he could tell there was a deeper emotion beneath it. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me no one ever asked.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t tell him that.</p><p>\u201cI never had any reason to marry,\u201d she said. \u201cI am my father\u2019s only child, and there is no entail. His fortune and Summerfield will come to me, eventually. Though hopefully no time soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut security isn\u2019t the only reason you might wish to marry. Don\u2019t you want a husband and children? Or are you too modern for that?\u201d</p> <p>She was silent for a while. When she finally spoke, she said, \u201cTurn around. Walk to that boulder, and then double back to this spot.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, just crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cOh no. You can\u2019t pull that trick with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeflecting an uncomfortable question by giving an order. It won\u2019t work, not with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d She tried to sound bored.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cOf course you do. Because you once accused me of doing the exact same thing.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a woman like you. You\u2019re so much like me. It\u2019s as though we\u2019re two examples of some rare, exotic breed. Only I\u2019m the male specimen, and you\u2019re the female. Clever as you are, you must know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means we should mate. We have a responsibility to Nature.\u201d</p> <p>Laughing, she pushed a wave of spray in his direction. \u201cYou must have learned that line from your cousin. Does it work on other women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other women?\u201d He barely remembered that other women existed. Tonight, they were like a waterlogged rendition of Adam and Eve, and this cove was their isolated Eden. For him, she was the only woman in the world.</p><p>God, he wanted her so fiercely. She could have no idea. With every erotic splash of her lithe body undulating in the water, his imagination ran wild. He pictured the two of them, linked in all manner of strange, salty embraces. His cock stiffened to a painful degree, jutting out in front of him despite the cold, carving his way through the water like the prow of a ship. The HMS Priapism.</p><p>\u201cThe boulder,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cMarch to the boulder and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll turn around, walk all the way to that boulder\u201d\u2014he pointed to one much farther distant, near the spindle\u2014\u201cand double back in under a minute\u2019s time. But you must remain in that exact spot. And when I reach you, I want a reward for my pains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really? And what sort of reward would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Absolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome along.\u201d He stood tall, shoulders and torso emerging from the water. Seawater traced cold rivulets down his chest and back. \u201cYou\u2019ve been leading me a merry chase, weaving circles in the shingle as if we\u2019re playing some foolish parlor game. I deserve a forfeit. A kiss.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAfter the other night? I know there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018just a kiss\u2019 with you. We\u2019re here to work on your knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not moving until I\u2019m promised a kiss.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment. \u201cVery well. A kiss. But you don\u2019t get to kiss me. I will be the one to kiss you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Oh, he understood. He understood this little exercise of hers was about to become very interesting.</p><p>Energized with a new sense of motivation, he did just as he\u2019d promised. He turned, covered the distance to the far boulder in large, powerful strides, and then he worked his way back to her. By the time he\u2019d completed the circuit, his breath was a loud, painful rasp.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, taking her by the waist and pulling her close. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>The moon had emerged from behind a cloud, bathing her in silvery light. So beautiful. She could have been a water nymph, or a fierce, avenging angel. She framed his face in both her hands. Those elegant, yet so capable hands. He moved with her as she tugged his head down, reflexively wetting his lips in preparation.</p><p>And then she kissed him\u2014square on the forehead. Her lips pressed to his brow and lingered, blessing him with warmth and sweetness.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she whispered, pulling away.</p><p>He stared at her, his throat working. He didn\u2019t know whether to rage or laugh or weep. No, that kiss hadn\u2019t been the openmouthed, passionate tangle of tongues his body craved. It had been exactly what his soul needed. He wouldn\u2019t have known to ask for a kiss like that. The warmth of it sank straight through him, coming to rest in his heart.</p><p>She still held his face in her hands. Her thumb dabbed a salty drop from his cheek. \u201cI know what you need, Bram.\u201d</p><p>Sweet heaven. Perhaps she did. And what else did he need, that he couldn\u2019t have known to put into words? He was desperate to find out. Wordlessly, he slipped away from her. Covered the distance to the boulder in strong, purposeful strides. Returned to her, splashing his way through wave and foam, to stand breathless with need and longing.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>This time she reached for his hand. She lifted it to her face, curling his wet fingers over the curve of her cheek. Then she turned her face, nuzzling into his caress. Her breath rushed over his chilled flesh, rousing his every nerve to attention. And then she pressed a kiss to the exact center of his palm.</p><p>A bolt of bliss streaked from the spot, rushing straight for his core. Bloody hell. A tiny kiss on his palm. He felt it everywhere. His knees went weak. He wanted to fall at her feet, lay his head in her lap for hours. I am your slave.</p><p>He withdrew his hand, flexing it to disperse the sensation and get a grip on himself. Who could have guessed a fully grown man could be utterly felled by such a tiny, precise assault? Did the army know this? Maybe they ought to issue plate armor to protect soldiers\u2019 vulnerable palms.</p><p>\u201cSusanna.\u201d He reached for her.</p><p>Quick as a fish, she wriggled away. \u201cIf you want more, you must work for them.\u201d</p><p>He retreated again, making his way to the boulder more slowly this time. Partly out of fatigue, but mostly because he needed time to calm himself. His heart thudded loudly in his chest, battering his ribs. He couldn\u2019t let her see, didn\u2019t dare let her know that with those two tiny kisses, she\u2019d shaken him to his soul.</p><p>On his way back to her, he tried to shrug off the sensation and find a way to regain control. He was a soldier, he told himself. Not a supplicant. As he slashed his way through the water, his blood rushed through his limbs, hot and powerful.</p><p>But just as he neared her, he misjudged his step. The chain caught on a rock, and his ankle turned. He lunged forward, loosing an involuntary growl of pain.</p><p>She dashed to him, fighting her way through the water. \u201cAre you all right? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, denying the fresh stab of agony. It wasn\u2019t his knee that hurt so fiercely, but his pride. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough for tonight.\u201d She unlooped the ribbon and key from his neck and disappeared beneath the water. After a bit of tugging, he felt the cuff release.</p><p>\u201cPut it back,\u201d he said, once she\u2019d surfaced. \u201cI can do more. I\u2019m not even fatigued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe patient with yourself.\u201d She pushed the water from her face. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a remarkable recovery, and you\u2019ll get stronger still. But you were shot, Bram. You have to accept that your leg will never be quite the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be the same. It has to be. I can\u2019t accept anything less than a complete recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to lead.\u201d</p><p>She choked on a laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a perfect knee for that. You have more leadership in your great toe than most men have in their whole bodies.\u201d</p><p>He made a pained face that was meant to indicate modesty.</p><p>She took it as Do go on, please. \u201cTruly. People just naturally want to please you. Take Rufus and Finn. You don\u2019t know them well enough to see it yet. But I do, and those boys worship the ground you limp on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose boys just need a man to look up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they couldn\u2019t have chosen a better one.\u201d She wreathed her arms around his neck.</p><p>Cool water swirled around them, emphasizing the heat where their bodies met. Right now, he felt closer to her than ever, and still he wanted more. Every cell in his body craved that perfect union of bodies they\u2019d achieved under the willow tree. But if he ignored the frantic clamor in his loins and took time to hear the insistent, steady message of his heart . . . simply holding her was lovely. Peaceful. Right.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m such a remarkable leader,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy is it I can\u2019t bring you in line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to. You like me this way.\u201d She smiled the smug little smile of a woman who was utterly convinced she was right.</p><p>But she was wrong. He didn\u2019t like her this way.</p><p>He thought he might love her this way.</p><p>Damn. Love. It wasn\u2019t something Bram had much experience handling. The very idea of it seemed dangerous, unsafe. So he dealt with it the same way he treated other hazardous, explosive things. He tucked it away in a cool, dark place inside him\u2014to be examined and measured at some later time. When his hands weren\u2019t trembling, and his loins weren\u2019t aching with unspent lust. And his heart wasn\u2019t pounding so damned loud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bram.\u201d Her features screwed into an expression of dismay.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t make that face. Every time I propose to you, you make that twisty, unhappy face. It wears on a man\u2019s confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be making a different, much more pleasant face\u2014if only you were planning to stay. Not just marry me before you leave and get on with the rest of your life.\u201d She glanced out toward the open sea. \u201cThere\u2019s a peculiar curse to residing in a holiday locale. Friendships are abundant, but brief. Ladies stay for a month or two, then they go home. Just when I\u2019ve grown close to people, they leave. It\u2019s bearable, for a friendship.\u201d She eyed him. \u201cPerhaps even for a scandalous, clandestine affair. But a marriage?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t offer to bring you with me. The way you describe your life here sounds rather like life on campaign. With one notable difference. Just when I\u2019ve grown close to people, they die.\u201d His own mother had been the first in that succession, but far from the last. He could never put Susanna at risk.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said slowly, teasing her fingers through the hair at his nape, \u201cyou and I could grow very, very close. You could promise not to leave. And I could promise not to die. Wouldn\u2019t that be a welcome change for us both?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI can promise to come back. Eventually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom war? Bram, no one can make such a promise. I wish I understood why returning to field command is so important to you. Is it just a matter of proving you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not entirely.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, those patient blue eyes sparkling in the night. If he couldn\u2019t talk to her, he couldn\u2019t talk to anyone.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t have anything else. I\u2019m an infantry officer, Susanna. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever been, all I\u2019ve ever wanted since I was a boy. I wanted it so badly, I left Cambridge the month I turned twenty-one. That was when I could finally access the small legacy my grandfather left me, and I used it to purchase my first commission. My father made a show of being angry, but I know he was secretly pleased that I\u2019d done it on my own. I never relied on his influence. I paid my dues, rose up through the ranks. I made him proud. When news reached me of his death\u2014\u201d He broke off, unsure how to continue.</p> <p>Beneath the water\u2019s surface, her hand found his. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Bram. I can\u2019t even imagine how devastating it must have been.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine, and he didn\u2019t know how to explain. Bram thought of his father\u2019s last letter. He\u2019d received it through the usual mail, a full week after the express informing him of the major general\u2019s death. The letter\u2019s contents were nothing out of the ordinary. But Bram would never forget the closing. Don\u2019t feel rushed in writing back, his father had written. I know you\u2019ve been writing too many letters, of late.</p><p>His father had obviously learned of Badajoz, where the allied forces had taken the garrison at human costs so great, Wellington himself wept over the carnage. And therefore he\u2019d known Bram was writing condolence letters by the dozen, to the surviving families of his fallen men\u2014to the point where his hand cramped up and his vocabulary went dry as the inkwell. There were only so many words for \u201cregret.\u201d</p><p>His father hadn\u2019t offered any hollow words of comfort or tried to impose meaning on senseless death. He\u2019d simply let Bram know he understood.</p><p>Bram couldn\u2019t voice what it meant, to know they\u2019d reached a place where they understood each other as men, as fellow officers. As equals. If he retired from command and became just another privileged lord loafing around England . . . He wasn\u2019t sure his father would still understand that man. Bram wasn\u2019t sure he would understand himself.</p><p>\u201cLosing my father was hard,\u201d he said. \u201cDamned hard. But what it made it a little easier was telling myself I\u2019d continue making him proud. Carry the family banner forward. Keep his legacy alive.\u201d He released a breath. \u201cThat lasted all of a few months, and then I was shot. Couldn\u2019t be so lucky as to have a glorious, noble death on the battlefield. Now I\u2019m just another lamed soldier with no prospects of returning to command.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Bram.\u201d She brushed his face with her free hand, pushing aside drops of salt water on either cheek. He feared they weren\u2019t all from the sea.</p><p>\u201cSir Lewis was my very last chance. I\u2019ve written to every retired general I could imagine, asking for a good word. I\u2019ve felt out every colonel who might be in need of a lieutenant, hoping one of them would put in a request. Nothing. No one wants me like this.\u201d</p><p>The night\u2019s silence was profound.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do.\u201d</p><p>At her words, his heart seized. He clutched her tight with both arms, as if this tiny cove were a bottomless ocean, and she a life preserver.</p><p>\u201cI want you like this,\u201d she said again. Bending her head, she kissed the underside of his jaw. Her lips lingered there for a hot, sensuous moment. Then she ran her tongue down his neck and brought her body flush with his. \u201cJust as you are. Right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>\u201cRight here?\u201d he echoed, his voice breaking with surprise. \u201cRight now?\u201d</p> <p>Susanna couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little. It felt good to catch him off guard, lighten the sadness in his voice. \u201cIt can be accomplished in the water, can\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded numbly. \u201cIt can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you have some objection.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, just as numbly. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to the buttons down the front of her bathing costume. His throat worked as she loosened them one by one. She wriggled her arms free and pushed the garment down into the water so she could step out. Then she tossed the whole sodden heap over a nearby rock.</p><p>\u201cWait, Susanna\u2014\u201d He took her by the waist. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this just because . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She put her fingers to his lips. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>When she dropped her hand, placing it flat against his chest, his heartbeat whomped beneath her touch. His palpably anxious response made her own heart flutter.</p><p>He needed her right now. He needed to know that someone could see all his weaknesses, all his flaws\u2014and still find him not only desirable, but worthy and strong. Vulnerable as she felt, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to deny him that reassurance. Not when it was the simple truth.</p><p>What was more, she needed him, too.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so stunned,\u201d she teased. \u201cI want you, Bram. So much. All the time. When it comes to you, this buttoned-up spinster is just seething with wild, insatiable passion.\u201d She kissed him, teasing her tongue over his lips. \u201cIt should hardly come as any surprise. You\u2019ve been telling me so since the very beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said wonderingly. \u201cI know. The surprise is that you listened.\u201d He cradled her neck in one hand and claimed her mouth in a deep, masterful kiss.</p><p>She reveled in the sensual surrender for a few moments. Then she gently pushed away. \u201cWait,\u201d she said, panting. \u201cThis is my turn tonight. I want to touch you, everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He spread his arms in invitation. \u201cI won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>She began by running her hands over those massive, muscled arms, tracing every cord and sinew. Then skimming up to his shoulders and down his chest\u2014rock-hard and lightly covered with damp, dark whorls of hair. She trailed her fingers down his tensed, ridged abdomen and through a rougher thicket of hair before finally claiming her prize.</p><p>With a single fingertip, she traced the smooth, flared crown of his erection. When she slid her palm along the underside, skimming down the thick, ridged column, he jerked and bobbed away from her touch.</p><p>Come back here, you. She wrapped both hands around him, stacking her grips in an attempt to envelop his full length. She couldn\u2019t, not quite\u2014so she treated them both to a long, luxuriant stroke, dragging her touch from his base to his tip.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He gave a strangled groan. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you kiss me when you do that?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth watered at the mere suggestion. She moved forward, angling to kiss his jaw, his throat. With her tongue, she traced the ridge of his collarbone before dipping just beneath the water\u2019s surface to graze his nipple. The salty tang of the seawater mingled with the earthy musk of his skin.</p><p>Arousal built within her, and she could feel his erection swelling even larger in her hands. But they made the unspoken decision not to rush. To continue exploring each other as long as they could resist the temptation for more.</p><p>As she caressed him below the water, he fondled her breasts. First kneading them separately, then pushing them together so he could bend his head and nuzzle both tips. He mouthed each peak thoroughly, teasing her with the alternating hot and cold sensations.</p><p>Then he pulled back, studying her in the dark. \u201cHave you noticed,\u201d he said conversationally, \u201cthat your right breast is a bit larger than the left?\u201d</p><p>Susanna was sure her cheeks must be glowing in the dark, her blush came so fast and fierce. \u201cThey\u2019re my breasts. Of course I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d And I\u2019ve only been self-conscious about it all my adult life, thank you very much.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like they have two different personalities. One\u2019s generous and nurturing.\u201d He lifted the other. \u201cAnd the other . . . it\u2019s saucy, isn\u2019t it? It wants a tweak.\u201d He gave her left nipple a pinch.</p><p>\u201cBram.\u201d What a conversation. Hoping to distract him, she slid her hand down his shaft and teased her fingers lower, until she cupped the soft, vulnerable sac beneath. He groaned and shivered, encouraging her as she explored, rolling the two pendulous weights in her palm.</p><p>Interesting. He wasn\u2019t symmetrical everywhere, either.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be vexed,\u201d he said, still fondling her breasts. \u201cI meant it as a compliment. I quite adore them both.\u201d</p><p>That was some comfort, she supposed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were men with penchants for mismatched breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore them because they\u2019re yours, Susanna. I adore every bit of you.\u201d His hands roamed lower. \u201cThese hips make me wild. This round, cuppable arse was made for my hands. And your long, shapely legs . . .\u201d He kissed her deeply, skimming a hand down her leg and lifting it to drape over his hip, pulling their bodies into intimate contact. \u201cGod, I love that you\u2019re tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d She\u2019d been in the habit of thinking it her greatest detraction where suitors were concerned. Well, aside from the freckles. And the hair. And her habit of voicing contrary opinions when she ought to dispense demure nods. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m tall,\u201d he said, nuzzling her throat. \u201cWith a short woman, it\u2019s always deuced awkward. Bits don\u2019t align the way they should.\u201d</p><p>Lord. That would teach her to ask. How she hated the idea of him \u201caligning bits\u201d with petite, delicate beauties. The very thought made her ill.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love this.\u201d His fingers found her cleft, parting her to slip deep inside. \u201cI love feeling how tight you are. Knowing that there haven\u2019t been others.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little, still feeling the stab of jealousy. \u201cOf course there haven\u2019t been others. Could you tell me the same?\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, he stared deep into her eyes with a bone-melting, erotic sincerity. \u201cI can tell you this. There\u2019s never been anyone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed, as his fingers plunged deep.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d His teasing tone took on a rougher undercurrent. \u201cSay the words. Say you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Alarms clanged in her heart. She knew he needed to feel strong and powerful right now, but truly. There was possessive, and then there was . . . medieval. \u201cIt\u2019s so belittling, Bram. I wish you wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just wish you didn\u2019t like it so much.\u201d He added a second finger to the first. \u201cMine. Mine. Mine.\u201d He thrust his fingers deeper with each repetition. Her intimate muscles clenched around them, and she gasped with pleasant shock.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he gloated.</p><p>Drat it. For a man, he was right entirely too often. It did feel so good. But ever since her illness and those horrid treatments, she\u2019d set a great of deal of comfort in the idea that her body was hers. No one else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling her ear. His thumb circled her pearl. \u201cSusanna fair. I want to hear you say you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She framed his face in her hands and looked him in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ll say this. I claim sole possession of my body, my heart, and my soul. And tonight, I choose to share them all with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His fingers slid from her body, leaving her feeling hollow inside. \u201cGod. That\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappointing? Intimidating? Too much, too soon?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, moving in for a kiss. \u201cI was going to say, it\u2019s even better.\u201d His tongue traced her bottom lip. \u201cSo much better.\u201d</p><p>Her heart ballooned in her chest. She\u2019d never dreamed it could hold so much joy.</p><p>As they kissed, he grasped her hips, lifting her in the water.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, love.\u201d His breath was labored. \u201cWrap your legs around my waist.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked, locking her ankles at the small of his back. As he supported her weight, she reached between them to guide his erection. They came together in a slow, sensuous joining.</p><p>She gasped as he filled her, stretching her wide. It didn\u2019t hurt anymore, but just like the first time, she doubted she could take him all. He was patient, however, working into her by delicious degrees until they were one.</p><p>As isolated and alone as they were in this cove, they could have been loud, loosing wild cries and urgent groans into the dark of night. Instead, they moved in swift, rhythmic silence. The only sounds were the soft splashes of the water and their increasingly ragged breath.</p><p>She clung to his neck. The rest of her went boneless in the buoyant water. For the moment, she was only too happy to give him complete control. With strong, purposeful motions, he lifted her hips again and again, sliding her up and down his hard length. With every stroke, pushing her closer and closer to bliss. The tendons of his neck and shoulders stood out like ropes, and his jaw was tensed with effort.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt so powerful, so desirable. So safe to release all her inhibitions and cares. To surrender to the strong, guiding force of his thrusts as he prodded her higher. And higher still. So close to that teasing, elusive peak.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he panted, taking one of her hands and wedging it between them, right where their bodies joined. \u201cTouch yourself here.\u201d</p><p>His hands took her hips again, and he thrust even deeper. As he moved within her, her trapped fingertips rubbed back and forth over the swollen nub at the crest of her sex, giving her just the friction she needed. Her climax built in the distance, gathering strength. In her mind\u2019s eye, she saw it coming, as if she were viewing a wave from the shore. An imminent, devastating swell of pleasure. It awed her\u2014frightened her, even\u2014as it loomed near, inescapable and intense. Then the wave broke, crashing over and through her body as he kept up his steady, powerful rhythm.</p><p>She cried his name. She might have cried a few joyous tears, as well.</p><p>He cursed.</p><p>With an urgent gasp, he pulled free of her body. She reached for him, tangling her grip with his as he stroked himself the remaining distance to release. His seed jetted against her belly, a burst of welcome heat in the cooling cove.</p><p>His temple pressed against hers as he brought her close. His labored breath crashed hot against her ear. \u201cHold me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Bram.</p><p>She lashed her bare arms and legs around his body, clutching him as close as she could. Kissing his shoulders, his throat, his jaw, his ear. Running her fingers through his damp, clipped hair. Rocking him, just a little. Back and forth, in time with the waves.</p><p>A flood of tenderness rushed from her heart and spread through her entire body, suffusing even her fingers and toes with warmth. She brought him closer still, wanting him to feel it. As if she could wrap him in a blanket of affection and hold him there forever. He had so much pride, and so much family honor, wrapped up in returning to war. How could she possibly entice him to stay? She was going to try her damnedest, but the day might come quite soon when she would have to let him go.</p><p>But for tonight, he\u2019d asked her to hold him, and Susanna was going to do just that. Hold on to this passionate connection they shared. Hold on to this transcendent, if all too fleeting, joy.</p><p>Hold on to him. Just as long as she possibly could.</p> <p>Twenty-two</p><p>Really. The man was impossible. When Susanna managed to get her hands on him, she was going to fling him off the bluffs herself.</p><p>It was late afternoon, almost evening. After a long day overseeing progress in the village, she ought to be heading home, making sure her father had eaten something today. Instead, she huffed all the way up to the castle ruins. On the way, she passed Corporal Thorne drilling the majority of the militiamen on the flat. Straight lines, straighter posture, a respectable unity of rhythm. Not perfect yet, but they\u2019d made formidable progress in the past week. At marksmanship, she had all but a few of them loading and shooting in under twenty seconds now.</p><p>A few minutes\u2019 more walking, and she reached the castle.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your lord?\u201d she asked a lone volunteer standing sentry at the ancient, crumbling gatehouse. She recognized him as one of Bram\u2019s farm recruits.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon, miss. I . . . I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s not available? He\u2019s found time to devil me with these ridiculous orders all day.\u201d In her fist, she clutched his latest handwritten missive. \u201cThis is the third one he\u2019s sent this afternoon alone. I know he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d the man hedged, \u201cbut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff!\u201d she called, striding past the soldier.</p><p>Dinner greeted her as she crossed the bailey, with a friendly bleat and a questing nudge at her pocket.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s been spoiling you.\u201d Pausing to spare the lamb a brief pat, she passed into the grassy, open center of the castle grounds, drew to a halt, and lifted her voice. \u201cLord Rycliff, I need a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp here, Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to view the keep.</p><p>\u201cOn the parapet,\u201d he called.</p><p>Shading her eyes, she let her gaze climb higher still. From atop the southwest turret, between the crenellated notches of the battlement, he lifted a hand in salutation. The sinking, amber sun lit him from the back, bathing him in a glowing corona of light. Like a halo of fire\u2014perfectly befitting the handsome, tormenting devil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate if you\u2019d come down, my lord,\u201d she called. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn on watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the commander. Can\u2019t you make it someone else\u2019s turn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t shirk my duty that way, Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>Susanna marched through the keep\u2019s open door, crossed the roofless, ancient hall, and went straight for the spiral staircase of the southwest tower. If he refused to come down and talk to her, she would simply climb up to confront him.</p><p>As she ascended the stone risers, she called out, \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of all these missives? The seamstresses are tying their fingers in knots, trying to appease your absurd demands with the uniforms. First, you send a note demanding the coat lining should be bronze silk. We\u2019re twelve pieces into the cutting, and now another note: Not bronze anymore, but blue. Not just any blue, mind. Iris blue. Well, no sooner do we have the blue laid out, than the next missive arrives. \u2018I want pink,\u2019 it says. Pink, of all colors! Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>Lord, there were a great many stairs. Her brain whirled with the constant circling. She paused a moment, leaning a hand on the stone wall and gathering breath for the remainder of the climb. As well as for the remainder of her complaints.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my militia, Miss Finch,\u201d he called down to her. \u201cI want what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as though we have nothing else to do, you realize,\u201d she went on. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the uniforms. We\u2019ve only a matter of days before the field review. I have the ladies rolling cartridges. Miss Taylor is struggling valiantly to repair Finn and Rufus\u2019s sense of rhythm. With marksmanship practice scheduled to last all tomorrow morning, we simply don\u2019t have time for your capricious whims regarding coat lining and\u2014\u201d</p><p>No sooner had she gained the top of the stairs than he had her wrapped in his arms. He swept her straight off her feet.</p><p>In a swift motion, he carried her to the opposite side of the tower and pressed her against the parapet of cool, hard stone. At her back, the top edge of the wall caught her just beneath the shoulder blades. From the front, his solid heat and brute strength trapped her. Excited her. She\u2019d already been short of breath, but this . . . ? This was dizzying.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he said in a low, possessive growl, \u201cI want what I want. And what I want right now, so fiercely I can scarcely see straight, is you.\u201d His kiss bruised her mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it took three of those ridiculous notes to get you up here. Stubborn girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was your purpose? Bram, you might have just said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did say so.\u201d His lips traced the curves of her neck. \u201cThose notes were all about you. This shimmering bronze hair. Your iris-blue eyes.\u201d He licked the underside of her jaw. \u201cAll your many, many, luscious shades of pink.\u201d</p><p>A sigh of pleasure eased past her lips. \u201cBram.\u201d</p><p>She should have been angry, but his embrace felt so good. So necessary. In the week since their tryst in the cove, they\u2019d managed to steal a few hours together nearly every evening, making love beneath the night sky and then conversing on every topic under the stars. Still, she couldn\u2019t be parted from him for a minute without missing him. These big, grasping hands and these hot, hungry kisses.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the uniforms?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTo the devil with the uniforms. Make the coat linings any color you wish. I don\u2019t give a damn about any of it.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands to her bottom and pulled her flush against him, bringing her belly in contact with his prominent arousal. The evident, intense hunger in his eyes sent desire racing through her.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he said. Rather redundantly.</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cPerhaps tonight I can slip away from Summerfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not tonight.\u201d He kneaded her backside with both hands, lifting and molding her body to his. \u201cHere. Now.\u201d</p><p>The idea made her heart race, and made her intimate places go soft with longing. She glanced to either side. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t possibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can see us,\u201d he said, guessing her question. \u201cNot on this side of the tower. There\u2019s only rocks and sea below us here.\u201d</p><p>The other three parapets were unoccupied. All the men were down the slope, at drill. He was right, there was no one to see. A mild breeze whipped around and between them. The purpling sky hung so close overhead, she felt as though she could brush it with her fingertips. They stood on top of the world, alone.</p><p>His teeth caught lightly on her earlobe. \u201cI swam alone last night, you know. Worked my way back and forth across that cove until my muscles were jelly. You owe me more kisses than I can count.\u201d</p><p>She had a vision of the two of them, tangled in a warm, pillow-heaped bed. He was outstretched on the mattress, utterly naked, and her hair was unbound, dragging over them both as she repaid those kisses she owed. Ran her lips and tongue over his every last hot, needy inch.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She gasped as his palm slid to cup her breast. \u201cI thought you were meant to be on watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I am.\u201d He kneaded the taut globe thoughtfully, rolling her hardened nipple beneath his thumb. \u201cVery well. Keep watch with me.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, he grasped her by the waist and spun her about, so that she faced the stone parapet. He moved her sideways, positioning her before one of the crenels\u2014a gap in the battlement designed for an archer to shoot through.</p><p>\u201cCan you see?\u201d he asked roughly, bending her forward so that her elbows rested in the crenel notch and pulling up her skirts. \u201cSee the cove clear, and the Channel beyond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Below them, she could clearly survey the rocky inlet and expansive waters. In the distance, a few white sails puffed. To the west, the orange-yellow sun was slinking toward the horizon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood. Keep your eyes open. The watch is yours.\u201d</p><p>With firm, insistent tugs, he gathered her skirts and petticoats, lifting them to her waist. He found the slit in her drawers and widened it with a loud rent of fabric, baring her delicate flesh to the cooling breeze and his warm, rough touch.</p><p>He petted her, parted her, spread her wide to his view. His fingertips traced every contour of her intimate flesh. She\u2019d never felt so exposed. If she\u2019d paused to think too hard about what he was seeing and doing, Susanna would have lost her nerve altogether. So she did as he said. She kept the watch, training her eyes on the sparkling blue water and the silver-kissed horizon.</p> <p>A muted rustle told her he was freeing the closures of his breeches. She grew restless with need, damp with anticipation. A little cry of relief escaped her when his hot, aroused length sprang up to lodge snug against her cleft.</p><p>His hands caressed her bared bottom and thighs. \u201cGod, I think I\u2019m going mad. You can\u2019t imagine how much I think of this. All the time, everywhere. Yesterday, I stopped in the shop for ink, and all I could think of was you, spreading your legs for me on the countertop. Or bent over the display case. Then slammed against the storeroom shelves, skirts hiked to your waist and one leg propped on a crate. Every waking moment, I\u2019m thinking of this. Every night, I\u2019m aching for it.\u201d He worked his hard, thick shaft against her, sliding back and forth over her sensitized flesh. \u201cTell me you want it, too.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t showing enough? She wriggled her hips, increasingly desperate for him.</p><p>\u201cTell me, love. I need to hear it. I need to know this madness isn\u2019t mine alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI want you.\u201d Excitement raced along her skin. Just uttering those syllables pushed her to a new, wanton degree of arousal. The madness was definitely shared.</p> <p>\u201cYou want this.\u201d He nudged her opening with the smooth, blunt crown of his erection. \u201cIn you, hard and deep. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Those words . . . so indecent. So crude. So utterly arousing.</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>He licked her ear. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>Decency be damned. She had to have him, soon, or she would die of wanting. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI want it. All of it. In me. Now. Please.\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p> <p>Yes. He entered her on a slow, gliding stroke. Stretching her. Filling her. Then retreating for a brief, agonizing pause before thrusting deeper still.</p><p>He set a rhythm, rocking her against the ancient parapet, and as they moved together, he lavished kisses over her bared neck and shoulders. The tight knots of her nipples chafed against her corset seams. Bliss curled and coiled from her center, spreading through every inch of her body.</p><p>He slid one hand around her hips, sifting through the folds of petticoat. His talented fingers knew just how to please her, circling gently over that needy bud as he kept up his strong, steady thrusts.</p><p>\u201cBram,\u201d she gasped. \u201cHold me. Tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have you.\u201d His arms tightened around her middle. His pace did not relent. \u201cI have you.\u201d</p><p>She stared, eyes wide and unfocused, at that thin, indigo line of horizon. And then he pushed her beyond it. Flinging her off the map of charted sensation and into unknown, unimagined bliss. It went on, and on. She rode the crest of pleasure as far as it would take her. Startled sounds of pleasure pushed from her throat, mingling with the cries of gulls. She was helpless to stop them.</p><p>\u201cHoly God.\u201d With a profane growl, he pulled her hips tight to his, burying his full length inside her. Her intimate muscles clamped around his thickness. They moaned in unison. After a few thumping heartbeats\u2019 pause, he began to move again.</p><p>He was close to his peak. She could sense it in the acceleration of his rhythm and the new, deeper angle of his thrusts. His guttural noises of satisfaction. If he wasn\u2019t careful . . .</p> <p>\u201cBram. Take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take care.\u201d He bent close, breathing in her ear. \u201cI want to take you. Mark you. Spend inside you, and feel you holding me tight while I fill you with my seed. I want the world to know you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Those words . . . they both frightened and aroused her. She opened her mouth to object, to plead with him. Take care, take care. Take care with my heart when you say such things. But then he shifted, thrusting deeper still, and his thumb grazed her flesh just where she needed it. Pleasure racked her body for a second time, and the only sounds from her mouth were primal, desperate moans.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known, hadn\u2019t dreamed she could feel so exposed. With each one of these hasty, stolen couplings, he stripped yet more layers from the woman she\u2019d always believed herself to be. He denuded her of witty banter, of polite virtue, of all the trappings of a gently bred, overly educated spinster. Reducing her to nothing but raw, wild sensation and a fiercely thumping, wholly unguarded heart.</p><p>While the last pulses of her climax were still shuddering through her, he withdrew from her body. She felt the hot splash of his seed against her thigh. In the aftermath, he held her, brushing sweet kisses to her temple and cheek.</p><p>His breath came in ragged huffs. He pressed his brow to her shoulder and gathered her close. \u201cThat gets more difficult every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Tugging down her petticoats, she slid free. When she had her clothing rearranged, she slowly turned to face him. The words stuck in her throat, but she forced them out. \u201cPerhaps this time should be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna. You know I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d He hiked his breeches from where they hung tangled about his knees. With impatient motions, he began to straighten the falls and fasten the buttons.</p><p>She smoothed her hair. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He grasped her wrist, forbidding her to leave. \u201cWhat do you mean? You can\u2019t mean to run away from me. From this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running away. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s leaving. And we can\u2019t keep doing this. We\u2019re going to be caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if we are caught?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know I plan to marry you. I\u2019d marry you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And then you\u2019d leave me a few days after that.\u201d</p><p>With the hint of an ironic smile, he gestured out over the castle ruins. \u201cIf I\u2019m not inducement enough, this great, moldering heap of stone could be all yours.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, looking around the jumble of walls and turrets that had once housed all her dreams. \u201cYou have no idea the affection I hold for this great, moldering heap of stone. I just wish a resident Lord Rycliff came with it.\u201d</p><p>He belonged here in Spindle Cove. Ever since he\u2019d addressed the village the day of the picnic, Susanna had felt certain of it. Bram was strong and capable. A good leader, with an innate sense of loyalty and honor. This place could use a man like him. If he would only trade his military life for a calmer, more peaceful existence, she could see him being so happy, living here as Lord Rycliff.</p><p>And she could be so happy\u2014so blissfully, completely happy\u2014as his wife.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want a real home, Bram? You know, a place with a roof and . . . and walls, and those rare luxuries called windows? Upholstery, even. Carpets, drapes. Proper meals and a nice, warm bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been one for homely comforts. Five-course meals on fine china, wallpapered parlors . . . That life just isn\u2019t for me. But I could grow to appreciate a bed, if you\u2019re the one warming it.\u201d He tugged on her wrist, attempting to draw her close.</p><p>She resisted. She would never have the strength to say this without the benefit of some distance between them. \u201cA home isn\u2019t only defined by what you need, Bram. It\u2019s also about the people who need you. What am I to do when you\u2019re gone? What about your cousin? What about all the men and women in Spindle Cove who are working so hard for you right now, even as we speak? You\u2019re their lord. Doesn\u2019t that mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It does.\u201d His gaze firmed, and so did his grip. \u201cIt means a great deal. And the best way I know how to repay them is by finishing this war. Protecting the freedoms they enjoy and the sovereignty of the land they call home. Susanna, this isn\u2019t a matter of England clinging to some island it probably should have never seized. You know Bonaparte must be defeated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he can\u2019t possibly be defeated without your personal presence in Spain? That\u2019s a bit arrogant, don\u2019t you think? My father has done more to combat Napoleon\u2019s forces than you ever will, and he hasn\u2019t left Sussex in a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not like your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d She lifted one shoulder. \u201cAnd once Napoleon is defeated, what then? There will always be another conflict, another campaign. An outpost somewhere that requires defense. Where does it end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about duty,\u201d he bit out. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, slowly shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>He made a dismissive noise.</p><p>\u201cYou are. You are a big, strong man with a wounded leg, who feels useless and terrified. You say you don\u2019t need a home or a family or a community or love?\u201d She gave a disbelieving laugh. \u201cPlease. You want those things so badly, the yearning just wafts from you like steam. But you\u2019re afraid to truly reach for them. Afraid you\u2019ll fail. You\u2019d rather die chasing your old life than screw up the courage to forge a new one.\u201d</p><p>His hand clenched her wrist, tight as a manacle. \u201cWho said anything about dying or failing? Christ, you\u2019re always limiting people, holding them back. Your father\u2019s too old to work. Your friends are too delicate to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLimiting people? After all you\u2019ve learned of me and this place, you would accuse me of holding these young women back?\u201d A lump formed in her throat. \u201cHow can you say such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all you\u2019ve learned of me, you still can\u2019t trust me? Marry me, and trust that I\u2019ll finish this war and come back to you. For God\u2019s sake, Susanna\u2014\u201d His voice broke, and he looked away briefly before continuing. \u201cI\u2019m no stranger to doubt, this past year. But of all people, I thought you believed in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d A tear trickled down her cheek, and she dabbed it with the heel of her free hand. \u201cI do believe in you, Bram. I believe in you more than you believe in yourself. Do I believe you can be a capable field commander? Of course I do. But I also believe you could be so much more. A leader off the battlefield, as well as on. A respected lord, essential to his community . . . perhaps even a voice for your soldiers in Parliament.\u201d She pressed a fist to her belly. \u201cI believe you\u2019d make a wonderful husband and father.\u201d</p><p>His grip on her arm gentled. \u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t marry you, not like this.\u201d She tugged her wrist from his clasp. With her other hand, she cradled it, rubbing away the red marks of his grip and cursing the scars that would never, ever fade. She stumbled a pace in retreat. \u201cCan\u2019t you understand? I won\u2019t be abandoned again.\u201d</p><p>The world was suddenly so quiet. No crashing waves, no gusting breeze. No calling gulls.</p><p>When she finally gathered the strength to look at him, his eyes were intense, searching. And his question pierced her straight through the heart.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s afraid now?\u201d</p><p>She let action be her answer. She turned and fled.</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>A few evenings later, Bram stood watch on the very same turret. It was a dark, cloudy night, and there was nothing but shifting mist to see. With so little to occupy his thoughts, he once again found himself reliving that last encounter with Susanna. Again and again, the night brought her words back to him.</p><p>I won\u2019t be abandoned again.</p><p>God above, he did not intend to abandon her. All he wanted was to marry the woman, so that no matter how far apart the world flung them, there would always be a tether connecting her life to his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She needed a man like him. A man sure enough of himself to enjoy her cleverness, rather than be cowed by it. A man brave enough to challenge her, to push her beyond the boundaries she\u2019d set for herself. A man strong enough to protect her, if she ventured a little too far. Those were all the things she needed, as the remarkable woman she\u2019d become.</p><p>But somewhere inside that woman huddled an awkward, frightened, wounded girl, who desperately craved something else: a man who would tuck neatly into her safe, scheduled life and promise to never, ever leave her alone. Bram just didn\u2019t think he could\u2014or even should\u2014be that man for her.</p><p>When Thorne came to relieve him at the pitch-black hour of two, Bram accepted the torch his corporal silently offered and made his way down the winding stairs. Moths fluttered around him, drawn to the heat and flame.</p> <p>He emerged onto the bailey and surveyed the neat rows of tents. The sounds of snoring and the occasional cough kept the night from growing too still. A fluffy ghost of a creature wandered toward him, emerging from the shadows.</p><p>Bram stared down at the lamb.</p><p>The lamb stared up at him.</p><p>He gave in and withdrew a handful of corn from his pocket, strewing it on the ground. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I eat you?\u201d he asked irritably. Though he knew the answer well enough. \u201cBecause she named you, you miserable thing. And now I\u2019m stuck with a pet.\u201d</p><p>Ever since he\u2019d arrived here, Susanna had been busy as a spider, spinning little wisps of sentiment, connecting him to this place in ways he had no wish to be connected. If he didn\u2019t leave soon, he\u2019d begin to feel trapped.</p> <p>He approached the tent he knew to be Colin\u2019s and softly cleared his throat. A rustle moved through the tent. There was a muffled banging noise, and one of the tent poles shivered. Good, he was awake.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bram,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI need to speak with you about the artillery demonstration.\u201d</p><p>No reply. No further movement.</p><p>Bram crouched and held his torch near the canvas flap, knowing the light would shine through. \u201cColin.\u201d He nudged the canvas with his elbow. \u201cColin. We need to discuss the artillery demonstration. Sir Lewis has a new\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone standing behind him tapped his shoulder. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Bram jumped in his skin, nearly dropping his torch. \u201cJesus.\u201d He rose to a standing position, turned, and lifted his torch to illuminate . . .</p> <p>Colin.</p><p>His cousin stood next to him, the picture of nonchalance, dressed in an unbuttoned, uncuffed shirt and loose trousers. In one hand, he clutched a bottle of wine by its slender neck. \u201cYes, Bram? What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Bram looked at Colin. Then he looked at the tent. \u201cIf you\u2019re out here with me,\u201d he said, waving his torch at his cousin, \u201cthen . . . who\u2019s in your tent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend. And I\u2019d like to get back to entertaining her, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Colin uncorked the wine bottle with his teeth and spat the cork aside. \u201cWhat is it that can\u2019t wait for morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing with a woman in your tent?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cHm. Just how detailed would you like my answer to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever she is, you\u2019re marrying her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Colin took a few steps away from the tent, motioning Bram to follow. Once they were some paces away, he lowered his voice and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can sleep, Bram. It\u2019s either a woman\u2019s embrace or an interminable night awake. When I told you I don\u2019t sleep alone, it wasn\u2019t an expression of preference. It\u2019s a statement of fact.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter all these years?\u201d Bram lifted the torch to make out his cousin\u2019s expression. \u201cStill?\u201d</p><p>Colin shrugged. \u201cStill.\u201d He lifted the bottle of wine to his lips and drew a long pull.</p><p>A pang of sympathy took Bram by surprise. He knew Colin had suffered nightmares and sleeplessness in his youth, after the tragic accident that took his parents\u2019 lives. During Colin\u2019s first year at school, a few boys in his dormitory had taken to teasing him over the nighttime shouts and tears. Bram\u2014then the biggest boy in fourth form\u2014had pummeled some sense into the bullies, and that had been the end of that. None of them had dared to tease Colin again, and Bram had assumed his cousin\u2019s dreams eventually ceased.</p><p>Evidently, they hadn\u2019t ceased. They\u2019d persisted. For decades. Damn.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s in the tent?\u201d Bram asked. A bat swooshed by his ear, and they both ducked. \u201cNot Miss Highwood, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d Colin laughed a bit. \u201cMiss Highwood is a lovely girl, no mistake, but she\u2019s refined, innocent. And too delicate by far for my needs. Fiona and I . . . well, we understand each other on a more basic level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiona?\u201d Bram frowned. He didn\u2019t even recall a woman named Fiona.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Lange,\u201d Colin clarified, brushing past him. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me when her poetry improves.\u201d</p><p>Bram caught him by the arm. \u201cBut she\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in name.\u201d He cast a peeved glance at Bram\u2019s grip. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not planning to give me some sermon on morals. As many times as you\u2019ve been skulking off to meet Miss Finch?\u201d</p><p>Bram could only stare at him. Here he\u2019d thought he and Susanna had been so careful, remaining beneath everyone\u2019s notice. But evidently Colin had been awake. And paying attention.</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t judge me,\u201d his cousin said. \u201cFiona and I have a mature understanding. I may be a rake, but I\u2019m not a total cad. I\u2019ve yet to ruin an innocent girl. And I\u2019ve never come close to breaking a woman\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to ruin Susanna,\u201d Bram insisted. And hers isn\u2019t the only heart involved.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re marrying her?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Holding out for better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? God, no.\u201d Better? Bram didn\u2019t know a soul alive who could best Susanna for cleverness, courage, beauty, passion, or generosity of spirit. A better woman didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cAh, so you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are. You\u2019re human. We\u2019re all scared, every last one of us. Afraid of life, of love, of dying. Maybe marching in neat rows all day distracts you from the truth of it. But when the sun goes down? We\u2019re all just stumbling through the darkness, trying to outlast another night.\u201d Colin downed another swig of wine, then stared at the bottle. \u201cExcellent vintage. Makes me sound almost intelligent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are intelligent. You could be making something of your life, you know. If you weren\u2019t so determined to waste all your talents, along with your fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak to me of wasting gifts, Bram. If that woman loves you, and you toss that away . . . I don\u2019t ever want to hear another \u2018life lesson\u2019 from your lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m not tossing anything away. But I don\u2019t know that she loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Colin waved the wine bottle at him. \u201cYou\u2019re rich, and now titled as well. Granted, there\u2019s that stiff knee to contend with, but you do have all your own teeth.\u201d He raised an impish brow. \u201cAnd assuming handsomely sized male equipment runs in our family line . . .\u201d</p><p>Bram shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Colin said pityingly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does\u201d\u2014Bram made a fist\u2014\u201cnot matter.\u201d</p><p>This was absurd. Since when did his cousin dispense witty aphorisms and advice? Damn it, Bram was supposed to be the voice of wisdom in this relationship. \u201cNo matter how many inches are in a man\u2019s trousers, no matter how many pounds are in his bank account . . . those numbers don\u2019t add up to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. And more\u2019s the pity for me.\u201d Colin nodded thoughtfully. \u201cWell, Lord Elevated-to-the-Peerage-for-Valor, here\u2019s a wild notion. If you want to know if Miss Finch loves you, have you considered taking a firm grip on your bollocks, and . . . I don\u2019t know . . . asking her?\u201d</p><p>Bram just stared at him.</p><p>\u201cGood. You stand there and think about that.\u201d Backing away in the direction of his tent, Colin waved a dismissal. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, a warm bed awaits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a faster way, Charlotte,\u201d Susanna said, tugging off her gloves and gently nudging the girl aside. \u201cAt this pace, you\u2019ll be here all day.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte and a few of the other ladies had been spending every afternoon rolling black powder cartridges. However, the men had been using so many during their daily marksmanship drills, the women had scarcely been able to keep pace. With the review scheduled for tomorrow morning, Summerfield\u2019s breakfast room had become a temporary powder magazine, amid all the preparations for the officers\u2019 ball. There was simply no more time to waste.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spending too much time cutting large sheets of paper down to size. I found long ago that the pages of this\u201d\u2014she flung a blue leather-bound book onto the table\u2014\u201care the perfect size.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stared at it. \u201cBut Miss Finch, that\u2019s Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. It is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said it was a very useful book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a useful book. It\u2019s the perfect size for propping open windows. Its pages make excellent cartridges, and its contents are good for the occasional laugh. Beyond that? Don\u2019t ever pay it a moment\u2019s heed, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Opening the volume, Susanna mercilessly ripped out a page at random and smoothed it flat on the table. \u201cFirst, make certain you have everything within reach and at the ready.\u201d She skipped her fingers over each item. \u201cPaper, dowel, balls, powder, thread. Roll the paper around the dowel, forming a tube,\u201d she said, demonstrating, \u201cand then use the ball to push the dowel through. When the ball\u2019s come almost to the end, pinch it off and give it a good twist. Then pour the powder.\u201d</p><p>Clasping the paper-wrapped ball between her fingers, she filled the rest of the slender tube with black powder, leaving a half inch of excess at the top. \u201cNo need to measure now, you see? Just stop pouring when the powder comes even with the margin of text. Another twist, and a bit of knotted thread . . . There.\u201d With a satisfied smile, she handed the cartridge to Charlotte. \u201cWith practice, you\u2019ll have the trick of it.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte took the cartridge and blinked at it. \u201cMay I ask you a question, Miss Finch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Susanna ripped two more pages from the book and passed one to the girl. \u201cSo long as we work while we talk.\u201d</p><p>Cocking her head like a macaw, Charlotte peered at Susanna\u2019s ungloved wrists. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you there?\u201d</p><p>Susanna froze. Slowly, she flipped her forearm and regarded the exposed scars. She\u2019d spent so many years carefully hiding them under sleeves and cuffs and gloves, or dismissing them with a lame excuse when someone stared or questioned.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Here she was, more than a decade later. Not a girl anymore, but a grown woman of sense and education. At this moment, she was literally ripping apart the restrictive teachings society foisted upon women, and showing a well-bred young lady the fine art of fashioning not painted tea trays, but black powder cartridges. Perhaps the world had left a few slashes on her, but she\u2019d made her own small mark on the world. Here in Spindle Cove, where women were safe to be their best and truest selves.</p><p>She ran her fingers over the old, familiar map of pain. These scars were a part of her true self. They weren\u2019t all of who she was, but they were a part. And suddenly, there seemed no earthly reason to hide them.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re healed injuries,\u201d she told Charlotte. \u201cFrom bloodletting. Years ago now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl winced. \u201cDo they hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her own smile caught her by surprise. \u201cNot at all. I know they look impressive. But truthfully, sometimes I forget about them for whole days at a stretch.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke the words, she marveled at how true they were, and how much lighter she felt for saying them. Her affair with Bram was over, it seemed. He hadn\u2019t spoken to her in days. There\u2019d been no further notes. Still, she would be forever changed by what they\u2019d shared. Changed by him. He\u2019d given her this precious, freeing gift\u2014the courage to accept herself as she was. Scars, freckles, passions, and all.</p> <p>In time, did a broken heart scar over? After a decade or so had passed, would she be able to forget about Bram for whole days at a stretch?</p><p>Somehow she doubted it.</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch!\u201d Violet Winterbottom appeared in the doorway. \u201cMiss Bright needs you in the hall. She wants your opinion on the decorations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there presently.\u201d</p><p>Susanna handed the cartridge-making supplies to Charlotte before rinsing her hands at the washbasin and leaving the breakfast room. She left her gloves behind.</p> <p>She walked through the drawing room, where the militia volunteers stood like a field of scarecrows, arms outstretched, as pin-chewing ladies flitted and circled, marking final alterations to their uniforms.</p><p>When Susanna reached the hall, she found it similarly abuzz with activity. At one end of the long, narrow room, Kate Taylor was practicing on the pianoforte. Along the bay of plate-glass windows, Mr. Fosbury and two footmen were busy arranging tables for the buffet. Ladies and servants bearing flowers and furniture hurried this way and that, their footfalls clattering over the wood inlay floor. By tomorrow night, this scene would be a tableau of elegance\u2014she hoped. But for the moment, it was the picture of chaos.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Sally Bright said, thrusting a wriggling baby into Susanna\u2019s arms. \u201cTake Daisy while I climb the staircase. We have a few different choices for the swags.\u201d</p><p>Susanna waited patiently in the center of the room, staring up at the balustrade and bouncing the youngest Bright sibling in time to Kate\u2019s rapid scales on the pianoforte. Daisy had plumped in recent months. As the minutes passed, Susanna began to feel her arms would fall off.</p><p>\u201cShe loves you, Miss Finch!\u201d Sally called, draping swags of fabric over the banister. \u201cNow, this is the red. It\u2019s striking, but maybe it will be too much, with all the uniforms in the room? And then we have this blue, but it\u2019s a touch dark for an evening affair. Which do you think best?\u201d</p><p>Susanna tilted her head, considering.</p> <p>\u201cI agree wholeheartedly, Miss Finch,\u201d Mr. Keane called down, appearing next to Sally on the balcony. \u201cNeither will do. We need something with more spark. I suggest gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, vicar,\u201d Sally said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough of the gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Unless . . .\u201d The vicar snapped his fingers. \u201cI know. We\u2019ll combine it with the tulle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tulle!\u201d Sally exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s divine inspiration, that is. Just hold a moment, Miss Finch. We\u2019ll show you what he means.\u201d</p><p>They both disappeared, ducking to rummage in their boxes of supplies.</p><p>Susanna sighed, shifting Daisy from one arm to the other.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. I\u2019ve been searching for you all over.\u201d Bram was suddenly at her side.</p><p>Thrown off balance, she juggled the infant in her arms. \u201cYou have?\u201d</p> <p>Save a few glances across the green, she hadn\u2019t seen him for the better part of three days. And of course, he would show up so dangerously attractive, wearing only an open-collared homespun shirt under his brand-new officer\u2019s coat. She tried not to look at him, but avoiding direct eye contact was the best she could manage. Instead, her gaze lingered on the strong angle of his jaw, the sensual set of his lips. Then dropped to the exposed wedge of his bare chest, and the dark hair curling there.</p><p>Was he trying to torture her?</p><p>\u201cWhat, pray tell, are these?\u201d He displayed his newly hemmed cuff for her, pointing out the brass buttons studded there.</p><p>\u201cOh, those.\u201d She bit back a smile. \u201cAaron Dawes made the mold and did the casting. Every proper militia needs a symbol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but proper militias don\u2019t choose a lamb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall it, the lamb chose you.\u201d</p><p>His thumbnail traced the motto\u2014a tiny crescent of Latin. \u201cAries eos incitabit. A sheep shall urge them onward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, my lord. Your three terms at Cambridge are showing.\u201d</p><p>His mouth softened into that subtle hint of a smile she\u2019d come to love. \u201cButtons aside, you\u2019ve done a remarkable job. You and all the ladies. The uniforms, the training . . .\u201d He glanced around the room. \u201cAll these preparations.\u201d</p><p>His approval warmed her inside. \u201cWe\u2019ve all worked hard. I happened to see part of drill the other day. Very impressive, my lord. Tomorrow will doubtless be a splendid triumph.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence grew between them, until Daisy filled it with a wet gurgle.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d He nodded at the squirming infant in her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been introduced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u201d\u2014she swiveled to give him a better view\u2014\u201cis little Daisy Bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould have guessed it from the hair.\u201d</p><p>The towheaded babe stretched a chubby hand toward Bram, reaching for the shining buttons on his coat. Susanna yearned to reach for him, too. On impulse, driven by equal parts emotional distress and arm fatigue, she thrust the child at him. \u201cHere. Why don\u2019t you hold her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Wait. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she left him no opportunity to object, settling little Daisy in the crook of his arm. The delighted infant grasped for a button and gave it a yank.</p><p>\u201cSomeone likes the buttons, see?\u201d Susanna looked up at Bram. The poor man was frozen to stone, positively stricken with terror. \u201cDo try to be calm,\u201d she teased. \u201cShe\u2019s a baby, not a grenade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more experience with grenades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine.\u201d Relinquishing the button, Daisy grasped for Bram\u2019s thumb and squeezed it tight. \u201cLook, she adores you already.\u201d</p><p>A lump rose in Susanna\u2019s throat as she watched him holding the infant so gingerly, viewed those stout little fingers wrapped secure around his thumb.</p><p>There he went again, with the torture. She\u2019d never given it much thought before, but now . . . oh, how she wanted a child. She loved the image of her breasts and belly swollen with pregnancy. Loved the idea of staying up nights, feeling the babe kick at her from the inside. Loved dreaming about what the child would look like, wondering which of his parents he\u2019d favor. She loved everything about the idea of carrying not just a child, but Bram\u2019s child.</p><p>Because she loved him.</p><p>She loved him. And perhaps he was too stubborn to admit it, but he needed her love. She couldn\u2019t let him walk away.</p><p>She did have one last hope, she supposed. There was the gown. A great ivory cloud of a gown, dripping with pearls and brilliants, currently hovering in her dressing room upstairs. She hadn\u2019t worn it but once, a few years ago in Town. But when she\u2019d tried it on last week for fitting, the bodice stretched over her form like a second skin. The neckline pushed her breasts high and plump, and the sewn-in boning trimmed her waist.</p><p>She\u2019d entertained this foolish vision of herself, floating down the grand staircase in that lovely, ethereal gown tomorrow night. In her imagination, Bram stood at the bottom of the steps, regarding her with a mixture of pride and sheer lust-struck wonder. Despite every indication that he wasn\u2019t much of a dancer in actuality, her Dream Bram claimed her hand and pulled her into a slow, romantic waltz. And there, before a crowd of admiring onlookers, he twirled her to a halt and confessed his undying adoration.</p><p>It was a lovely, silly dream.</p><p>But that was before they\u2019d argued on the turret. Before he\u2019d accused her of being mistrustful and afraid. Difficult to imagine simply donning a pretty dress would change his opinions on that. And if a pretty dress was all it took\u2014she wasn\u2019t so sure she\u2019d retain her respect for him.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with you,\u201d he said low. He turned a glance around the crowded room. \u201cSomewhere else. Somewhere private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate?\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s piano scales suddenly ceased, and Susanna\u2019s heartbeat kicked into a faster rhythm than ever. The wainscoted walls began to press in on her, and she felt the scrutiny of every soul in the crowded room. She cast a glance around the hall, looking around at her assembled friends, neighbors, servants. Just as she\u2019d suspected, everyone was watching them. Noticing. Wondering.</p><p>Well . . . good.</p><p>Not just good. Excellent. The anxious weight in her stomach dissolved into bubbles of giddy joy, fizzing through her like fine champagne. Suddenly, she knew exactly what to do.</p><p>\u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cDance with you. You mean tomorrow night, at the officers\u2019 ball?</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I mean here. Now.\u201d</p><p>What kind of a modern woman was she, if she didn\u2019t reach for her own dream? Maybe it was time to sweep the man off his feet, for a change. She untied her work apron at the back and lifted it over her head, tossing it over the banister and smoothing the wrinkles from her blush-pink frock. It wasn\u2019t a voluminous, dazzling silk cloud, but it would have to do.</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor,\u201d she called, slicking back a stray lock of hair, \u201cdo play a waltz for us?\u201d</p><p>Bram shifted his weight, eyeing her with what seemed to be genuine alarm. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right. Neither am I.\u201d She lifted little Daisy from his arms and passed the babe to a nearby chambermaid. \u201cKindly make it a slow waltz, Miss Taylor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had much practice at all, even before this.\u201d He gestured toward his injured knee.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She took his hands and tugged him toward the center of the hall. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Space cleared around them as the curious onlookers pressed to the margins of the room. Kate\u2019s talented fingers sent the first few measures of a melodic waltz lilting from the pianoforte.</p><p>Susanna stood in front of him in the center of the floor, lifting his left hand in hers and placing his other hand on her waist. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see. How does this go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d His right hand slid, sure and confident, to the space between her shoulder blades, and a quick flex of his arm snapped her close.</p><p>Her breath caught in a gasp of delight.</p><p>He seemed to have realized that he had two options, and escaping this dance wasn\u2019t one of them. He could either appear coerced and uncomfortable in front of all these people, or he could take control.</p><p>No surprise he chose the latter.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She managed a nod.</p><p>With commanding grace and a slight, endearing limp, he waltzed her across the room.</p><p>And it was a dream come true.</p><p>They moved in perfect time to the music. Susanna suspected that was because Kate laid a syncopated pause on the third beat of each measure, to allow for their halting steps. So perhaps the music moved in time to them, but it was magical all the same.</p><p>He sent her into one turn, then another. Her flounced skirt swirled around her ankles, in little eddies of pink froth. And the sun, progressing on its slow slide toward the horizon, just then ratcheted a notch lower in the sky. So that its amber rays streamed straight through the bank of plate-glass windows lining one side of the hall. The ancient, warped glass took that day-worn light and made it precious, painting the room and all its occupants a glittering corona.</p><p>But no one caught more magnificence than Bram. Rosy fingers of light shone through the fine hairs at his brow. The melting afternoon lay like gold plate on his shoulders. Brilliant, shining armor. And he bore up under the weight of it beautifully, whirling her across the freshly waxed parquet. She heard more than one young lady\u2019s wistful sigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was just like something from a fairy tale.</p><p>He stared deep into her eyes. Little sparks danced in his wide, dark pupils. \u201cAre you going to tell me why we\u2019re doing this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou were right the other day, when you accused me of being afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. You were right. I have been afraid. You see, I\u2019ve always told the ladies that Spindle Cove is a safe place for them. A place where a woman can be her best and truest self, regardless of what anyone thinks. But for the past few weeks, that hasn\u2019t been the case for me. I\u2019ve been hiding a part of my true self. This vital, growing part of me that holds all my feelings for you. I\u2019ve been keeping it a secret from everyone, convinced I daren\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>The music went on, but they twirled to a halt.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s ridiculous, isn\u2019t it? And unfair to us both. When I looked at you just now, I knew. I knew in my heart, I couldn\u2019t conceal it one minute more. I wanted to dance with you. I wanted everyone to see us.\u201d A lump rose in her throat. \u201cTo see me, in love with you.\u201d</p><p>And for all this was her moment to be fearless and direct, she suddenly couldn\u2019t bear to meet his gaze. Instead she fingered the gold braid on his new red wool coat. Stroking her bare fingertip over the neat ridge. Cherishing him with her touch. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to say. I haven\u2019t any practice with these things. I would tell you you\u2019re the best, bravest man I know. But considering how few men I know, that seems too small a compliment.\u201d</p> <p>She finally mined some reserve of strength and raised her face to his. \u201cSo I will just tell you I love you. I love you, Bram. I want everyone to see it, and I want you to know . . . you\u2019re a part of this place now. No matter where duty takes you, Spindle Cove will always be here for you. And so will I.\u201d</p><p>He put both arms around her, pulling her flush against his chest. \u201cYou beautiful, brazen thing.\u201d</p><p>Then he went silent, just holding her gaze for what seemed like eons. Nerves multiplied in her stomach with every passing second.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything else to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 springs to mind. Beyond that . . .\u201d He brushed a caress down her cheek. \u201cDoes this mean that if I proposed marriage to you right now, you might not make that twisty, unhappy face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me and see.\u201d</p> <p>And then a smile\u2014a broad, boyish, shameless grin\u2014spread across his face. It was a smile unlike any she\u2019d ever seen him wear, forever defining the crescent as the shape of pure joy. She felt its mirror stretching her own cheeks.</p><p>He propped a finger under her chin. \u201cSusanna Jane Finch, w\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna Jane Finch. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d The familiar voice startled them both.</p><p>Papa.</p><p>She beat down the impulse to hide, or to scurry from Bram\u2019s embrace. Too late for all that subterfuge, and no need anyhow. She wouldn\u2019t hide from her own father what she was eager to share with the world.</p><p>Still smiling, she caught Bram\u2019s hand in hers and wheeled on her slipper heel to face her father. \u201cPapa, I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>But her father\u2019s expression did not read as happiness. As he approached them, moving across the hall in slow, even steps, he looked wary, at best. He turned his gaze around the room, surveying the shambles of half-finished preparations. Summerfield\u2019s servants jarred themselves into motion. In an instant, the bustle of moving furniture and hanging swags had resumed. Kate went back to playing scales.</p><p>Susanna bit her lip. \u201cIs it the hall, Papa? I know it looks a true calamity at the moment, but just you wait for tomorrow. Everything will be perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about tomorrow.\u201d His watery blue eyes fixed on Bram.</p><p>Susanna felt suddenly protective of the man at her side. She clutched Bram\u2019s arm. \u201cPapa, we were only dancing.\u201d</p><p>One hoary eyebrow arched. \u201cOnly dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not only dancing, it\u2019s more than that. You see, Bram and I have grown very close these past weeks, and . . .\u201d She cast a fleeting glance at Bram. \u201cAnd I love him.\u201d It made her so happy, just to say it. She never wanted to stop. \u201cI love him, Papa. I do.\u201d</p><p>Her father looked at the floor and released a long, measured breath. She stared at him, oddly amazed. How could anyone breathe at a time like this?</p><p>Then he raised his head . . . and her heart fell.</p><p>She\u2019d just told her father she was in love. For the first time in her life, in love. And he refused to even look her direction. From the distant expression on his face, she could tell Papa was going to receive this news in the same spirit he received all her other secrets and confessed emotions.</p><p>He was going to ignore it. As if he\u2019d never even heard.</p><p>Oh Lord.</p><p>Had it been this way, all those other times? When she\u2019d believed herself to be confiding to a distracted genius, had she truly been pouring out her heart to someone who just didn\u2019t care? The idea was nauseating. Unthinkable. Of course Papa cared for her. He\u2019d saved her life. He\u2019d given up so much to live here at Summerfield.</p><p>Bram cleared his throat. \u201cSir Lewis, we obviously need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Indeed we do.\u201d Her father calmly reached into his breast pocket and withdrew an envelope. \u201cI was going to wait until after the field review tomorrow. But I think now is the ideal time.\u201d</p><p>Bram released Susanna\u2019s hand and accepted the folded paper. He opened the envelope and scanned its contents. \u201cBloody hell. Are these what I think they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWritten orders,\u201d her father said. \u201cYes. I made inquiries with my friends in the War Office. More like strong suggestions. There\u2019s a navy vessel leaving from Portsmouth this coming Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>Susanna gasped. \u201cTuesday?\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s demeanor was cool. \u201cYou\u2019ll be on it, Rycliff. And back with your regiment in a matter of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . .\u201d Bram swallowed hard as he stared at the paper. \u201cSir Lewis, I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><p>Say no, she wanted to scream. Say you can\u2019t possibly leave so soon. Say you\u2019re marrying me.</p><p>\u201cNo need for thanks.\u201d With his palm, Papa smoothed his wispy silver hair. \u201cI view it as an even exchange. If not for your militia review, I\u2019d never have this chance to demonstrate the new cannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new cannon?\u201d Susanna turned to Bram, mortified. He\u2019d given her his word he wouldn\u2019t involve Papa in the militia. Surely he wouldn\u2019t have lied to her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Susanna,\u201d her father said. \u201cThe new cannon. It will be unveiled tomorrow, as part of the militia review.\u201d He looked to Bram. \u201cI do hope you\u2019ve managed to whip those farmhands into shape? I\u2019m counting on an impressive display, in exchange for the favors I pulled.\u201d He tapped the letter in Bram\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Susanna shook her head. From across the room, Kate\u2019s plinking arpeggios hammered away at the last bits of her composure. \u201cBram, please tell me I\u2019m misunderstanding this somehow. Tell me you haven\u2019t gone back on your word to me, in some underhanded ploy to regain your command.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I can explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me I can trust you,\u201d she rushed on, emotion tweaking her voice. \u201cTell me you haven\u2019t been lying to me this whole time. Tell me I haven\u2019t made the most wretched, foolish mistake of my life, or . . . or I don\u2019t know how\u2014\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cSusanna,\u201d her father said sharply. \u201cStop embarrassing yourself. You know you\u2019re given to overwrought emotion. Whatever silly infatuation you\u2019ve developed, it will pass. Tomorrow isn\u2019t about your girlish fancies, it\u2019s about legacies\u2014both Bramwell\u2019s and mine. Perhaps we\u2019ve humored you to a point, my dear. But there comes a time when men must be men. You can\u2019t keep holding us back.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>Cursed cannon.</p><p>Colin wrestled with the ropes as he hauled the cannon into the wagon. For a scale model prototype, the thing was damned heavy. The barrel was thick as his thigh, fashioned of solid brass.</p><p>He straightened. \u201cYou. Don\u2019t touch those.\u201d From his perch on the wagon bed, Colin waved the Bright twins away from a pyramid of straw-packed crates. \u201cLeave those be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in them?\u201d one of the boys asked.</p><p>\u201cFireworks for tomorrow night. Don\u2019t touch them. Don\u2019t even breathe on them. Took more than a week for those to arrive from Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we help you with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, gritting his teeth. Those fireworks were meant to be his surprise, his own unique stamp on the day\u2019s festivities. Colin was going to produce the display himself, and he was going to do it well\u2014prove to Bram he could be good for something. There wasn\u2019t much he could seem to get right in this life, but he did have a knack for artistic destruction. What better canvas than the clear night sky?</p><p>But first, to deal with Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s masterpiece. The cursed cannon.</p><p>He grasped a rope in both hands and rocked back on his heels, tugging with all his might. Being responsible for artillery had seemed a plum assignment, until Colin had realized just how much heavy lifting was involved. All day, he\u2019d been hustling to and fro\u2014taking powder to the ladies, then rolled cartridges to the armory, smuggling fireworks to Summerfield, and now carting Sir Lewis\u2019s prototype up to the castle. Loading the thing was taking longer than he\u2019d planned. He was racing nightfall now.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this one?\u201d one of the twins asked.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Colin saw Finn brush the straw from a noisemaker. Before he could object, the boy gave the cord a tug. The firecracker exploded with a sharp pop and a dusting of smoke.</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d Rufus said, grinning. \u201cTry another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you two to leave off,\u201d Colin bit out. He stood tall\u2014just in time to watch Dinner scuttle off with a frightened bleat. The startled lamb squeezed under the fence that bordered Summerfield\u2019s gardens. \u201cNow look what you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve gone and frightened the damned sheep. You know how Rycliff dotes on the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we fetch him?\u201d Finn asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll have to do it. He\u2019ll be scared of you now.\u201d Colin vaulted the side of the wagon. He clapped the fraying strands of hemp from his hands and wiped his perspiring brow with his sleeve.</p><p>Clambering over the fence, he entered the kitchen gardens, where the house\u2019s vegetables and savories were grown. He watched as the lamb trotted a path between two rows of turnips and squeezed under a second fence to enter a fallow plot bounded by meadow.</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d he called, giving chase again and entering the meadow. \u201cDinner, come back now.\u201d</p><p>When he reached the center of the field, he paused to catch his breath and scan the area for telltale tufts of wool. When the lamb failed to appear, he cupped his hands around his mouth and tried again. \u201cDinner!\u201d</p><p>This time, his call earned an answer. Several answers. In fact, the ground shook with the collective bestial response. He spied several large, dark forms lumbering toward him through the twilight dusk. He blinked, trying to make them out. These weren\u2019t sheep. No, they were . . .</p><p>Cows. Large cows. Remarkably fast and menacing cows. A small herd of them, all thundering straight for him where he stood in the center of the field.</p><p>Colin took a few steps backward. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, holding up his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean you.\u201d</p><p>The beasts didn\u2019t listen to reason apparently. A shame, because they did have rather large ears. Or were those . . . horns?</p><p>He turned and made a mad dash for the fence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blighted idiot, he cursed himself as he pumped arms and legs, scrambling over the furrowed field. Corkbrained fool. What kind of imbecile entered a pasture at twilight and shouted \u201cDinner\u201d at the top of his lungs?</p><p>One who hadn\u2019t left London in a decade, that\u2019s who.</p><p>\u201cI hate the country,\u201d he muttered as he ran. \u201cI hate it. I bloody damned well hate it.\u201d</p> <p>In his hurry, he\u2019d chosen a different route of escape than the way he\u2019d entered the field. Rather than reaching a simple wooden stile, he ran smack up against a hedgerow. A thorny hedgerow.</p><p>\u201cHate it,\u201d he said, pushing his way through the bramble and twigs. \u201cLoathsome, miserable, reeking, wholesome farmland. Feh.\u201d</p><p>He emerged on the other side of the hedge to find himself once again in the Summerfield gardens\u2014the pretty bit, this time. He was scraped, but mercifully untrampled. He stood staring at the hedgerow a moment, picking bits of hawthorn from his clothing and cursing country life.</p><p>Then something odd caught his attention. A light smack on the head.</p><p>He wheeled around, batting blindly with a hand.</p> <p>The next smack caught him across the face. A red burst of pain stung his already abraded cheek.</p><p>Good Lord, what was this? The Seven Plagues of Colin Sandhurst, squeezed into the space of one hour?</p><p>He raised his hands in defense, dodging the repeated blows.</p><p>\u201cYou villain,\u201d a female voice accused. Smack. \u201cYou deceitful cur.\u201d</p><p>Colin lowered his hands to get a proper look at his attacker. It was the middle Highwood sister. The dark-haired one. Miriam, was it? Melissa?</p><p>Whoever she was, she was hitting him. Repeatedly. With a glove.</p> <p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d He dodged another smack, moving deeper into the gardens. He stumbled over a clump of daisies and narrowly missed a collision with a rosebush.</p><p>She chased him, still swinging away. \u201cI want a duel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all about you and Mrs. Lange, you . . . you rutting . . .\u201d Apparently lacking either the imagination or the bravery to complete the insult, she moved on. \u201cI never liked you, I hope you know. I\u2019ve always known you for a worthless bounder, but now my mother and sisters will suffer the pain of the revelation. You\u2019ll have disappointed their hopes.\u201d</p><p>Ah. So that\u2019s what this was about. He was being made to answer for . . . for what, precisely? Flirting?</p><p>\u201cDiana has no father or brothers to defend her honor. The duty falls to me.\u201d She slapped him across the face again. \u201cName your seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God. Will you stop with the glove?\u201d He ripped the thing from her hand and tossed it into the thorny rosebushes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to accept your challenge. There will be no duel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Because I\u2019m a woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, because I\u2019ve seen the way you spinsters handle a pistol. You\u2019d shoot me dead where I stood.\u201d Colin pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cListen, calm down. I haven\u2019t touched your sister. Not in any improper way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you haven\u2019t touched her improperly, but you\u2019ve improperly led her on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLed her on? Perhaps I danced and flirted with her a bit, but I\u2019ve flirted with every young lady in this village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every young lady.\u201d</p><p>He paused, stunned. As he stared at her, he felt a grin nudging his cheeks. \u201cSo you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd,\u201d she replied, much too quickly to be credible.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d He wagged a finger at her, no longer on the retreat. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous. I\u2019ve flirted with every young lady in the village but you, and you\u2019re envious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not envious, I just . . .\u201d She made a gesture of frustration. \u201cI just want to hurt you. The way you hurt my sister.\u201d</p><p>The way he\u2019d hurt her, she meant. If Diana Highwood had suffered one moment of pain on his account, Colin would swallow a Chinese dazzler. But this one . . . she was hurt.</p><p>Well, exactly how did she expect him to flirt with her? Lines like \u201criver of silk\u201d and \u201csparkling diamonds\u201d would never work on a woman like this. She was too clever by half. Moreover, such comparisons would be wildly inaccurate. Her hair was nothing like silk, and her dark eyes bore no resemblance to diamonds.</p><p>Cooled volcanic glass, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said in a placating tone. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Melinda. You are a tolerably pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTolerably.\u201d She rolled her eyes and made a dismissive noise. \u201cTolerably pretty. What kind of compliment is that? And my name\u2019s not Melinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not tolerably pretty,\u201d he said, tilting his head for a better look. \u201cGenuinely so. If only you\u2019d . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. Everyone says it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone says what?\u201d</p><p>She spoke in a low, mimicking tone. \u201c \u2018If only you\u2019d remove your spectacles, you\u2019d be lovely.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to stay that,\u201d he lied. \u201cWhy would I say that? What a perfectly stupid thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re lying. You dissemble as easily as you breathe. But my feelings aren\u2019t at issue here. This is about your cruel misuse of Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I\u2019ve not come close to using your sister, cruelly or otherwise. I apologized for all that business at the tea shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. You apologized quite prettily. You made them believe you were decent. That you cared. And then you took up with a married woman.\u201d</p><p>Colin rubbed the back of his neck. He really didn\u2019t have time for this. He had fireworks to set, a cannon to mount, and a lamb to catch. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you hope to gain by pursuing this conversation. I tell you now, I won\u2019t offer marriage. Not to your sister, not to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph. I\u2019d never allow you to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want justice! I want you to be responsible for your actions, instead of always weaseling out of them with a few pretty words.\u201d</p><p>Do you see? Colin wanted to say. This is why I avoid you. It was as if those spectacles gave her the power to see straight through him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like my cousin,\u201d he said. \u201cI do hope you\u2019re not planning to give me the same treatment you gave him.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a moment. \u201cWhat an excellent idea.\u201d With a swift, swooping motion of her arm, she drew back her reticule and let it fly.</p><p>Colin flinched just in time to take the blow on his shoulder, rather than his crown. Still, the cinched velvet purse landed with surprising force. Pain exploded through his shoulder. \u201cWhat the devil is in that thing? Rocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>What else, indeed. How could he have forgotten her ridiculous obsession with geology? Vile harpy. \u201cListen, Marissa . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Minerva.\u201d She raised her hand to swing the rock-filled reticule again.</p><p>This time, he was ready. In a lightning-quick motion, Colin caught her wrist. He spun her around and pulled her to him. Her spine pressed flush against his chest, and he cinched his arm around her middle.</p><p>Her spectacles slipped from her face and tumbled to the grass.</p><p>She wrestled his grip. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just yet. You\u2019ll step on them, if you don\u2019t stop struggling.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he truly wanted her to stop struggling. From where he was standing, poised to look straight down her bodice, all that wrestling did wonderful things for her breasts. No cool, perfect alabaster to be found here. Just warm, womanly skin. And as enticing as she looked, she felt even better. So angry and alive.</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He pressed his lips close to her ear. Her hair smelled of jasmine. The scent swirled through his head, muddling his thoughts. \u201cBe calm,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Be calm, he told himself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be calm. I want a duel.\u201d She wriggled in his arms, and desire pulsed through him, as fierce as it was appalling. \u201cI demand satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he thought. This was a woman who would demand satisfaction. In life, in love. In bed. She would demand honesty and commitment and fidelity, and all manner of things he was unwilling to give.</p><p>Which was just the excuse he needed to let her go.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, or you\u2019ll crush them.\u201d He bent to retrieve her wire-rimmed spectacles from where they\u2019d landed in a clump of ivy. After brushing them clean of dirt and moss, he held them up to the moonlight to inspect them for scratches.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t broken, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She made a lunging grab for the spectacles, but he held them back. She stumbled, pitching forward to collide with his chest. As she looked up at him, blinking hard in her attempt to see clear, her lashes fluttered like thick, plumed fans. Her tongue darted out to wet her lips.</p><p>Good God. For a buttoned-up bluestocking, she had damned sultry lips. Luscious, plump, and a deeper red at the edges. Like two slices of a ripe, sweet plum. His mouth watered.</p><p>She leaned into him, cheeks flushed. As if she wanted his kiss. More than that. As if she wanted him. Every incorrigible, rakish, broken part.</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be right.</p><p>\u201cYou know, they have a point,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do look different without your spectacles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You look squinty. And confused.\u201d He fitted the spectacles back on the bridge of her nose, hooking the rims over her ears. Then he put a finger under her chin, tilting her face for his appraisal. \u201cThere, that\u2019s some improvement.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him through the discs of glass, her gaze sharpening to that familiar, piercing ray of mistrust. \u201cYou are a horrid man. I despise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRightly so, pet.\u201d And just because he knew it would vex her, he touched a fingertip to her nose. \u201cNow you\u2019re seeing clear.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>Bram stared at the letter in his grip. This folded square of paper gave him back his command. For months now, this had been all he\u2019d wanted. He\u2019d worked tirelessly to recover his strength, pursued this one goal with single-minded determination. He couldn\u2019t have dreamed anything would make him happier than the very scrap of parchment he now held.</p><p>He wanted to throw it in the fire.</p><p>And then toss Sir Lewis Finch after it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. Oh my God.\u201d Susanna sobbed into her hand, and then ran from the hall before Bram had any chance to stop her.</p><p>\u201cSusanna, wait.\u201d He started in pursuit.</p><p>Sir Lewis flung an arm in front of his chest, stopping him cold. \u201cLet her be. She gets this way. All women do. I\u2019ve found she always sorts these things out on her own, in time. If only you let her be.\u201d</p><p>Bram stared at the man, fuming. \u201cOh really. The same way you let her be, when she was distraught after her mother\u2019s death? Sending her to that ghastly torture in Norfolk?\u201d With a curled finger, he thwacked the envelope containing his new orders. \u201cHow long have you had this, Sir Lewis? Days now? Weeks? Since before I even arrived in Spindle Cove, perhaps? Obviously, there wasn\u2019t any true need for a field review. Did the Duke of Tunbridge really ask you to muster a militia here, or was that a lie, too? I always knew you were a brilliant inventor, but perhaps you ought to try your hand at espionage.\u201d</p><p>The older man bristled. \u201cI am a patriot, you ungrateful whelp. Tomorrow, before an audience of dukes and generals, I will introduce the weapon that could save many of your soldiers\u2019 lives. And what do you care if I engaged in some harmless exaggeration? You\u2019ve got what you wanted, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean this?\u201d Bram shook the envelope at him. He lowered his voice to a growl. \u201cThis piece of paper has exactly one virtue right now. One quality that keeps me from crushing it under my heel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me free to say this. Go to hell.\u201d</p><p>Bram left the old man sputtering and hurried down the same path Susanna had taken when she\u2019d fled the room. As he reached the end of the corridor, an open door to the gardens beckoned. Picking up speed, Bram charged through it.</p> <p>And nearly collided with a stunned Minerva Highwood.</p><p>\u201cHold the cudgel,\u201d he said, raising his hands. \u201cDid Susanna come this way?\u201d</p><p>The bespectacled girl cast a glance over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bram didn\u2019t wait for the rest of her reply. He simply followed the direction she\u2019d indicated with her glance\u2014a slate-paved pathway that disappeared around a tall, manicured hedge. As he rounded it, he caught a glimpse of Susanna\u2019s unmistakable hair as she dashed through a distant arch.</p><p>\u201cSusanna!\u201d</p> <p>She paused, but didn\u2019t stop. She entered a square, ornate garden bounded by hedges on all sides and a trellis in each corner. Bram followed her, closing the gate behind him.</p><p>She heard the latch click and wheeled, knowing herself to be penned. Her eyes were wide with fear and disbelief. Of course she was terrified. Her beloved father\u2014her only parent and protector for so many years\u2014had just revealed himself to be an ambitious, selfish, unfeeling jackass.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, raising his hands in peace. \u201cSusanna, love. I know how upset you must be right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo idea.\u201d Her hands balled into fists, and she pressed them tight to her belly, as though afraid they might get loose.</p><p>\u201cWill it help to hit something? You can hit me.\u201d Approaching her, he dropped his arms to his sides. \u201cGo ahead, love. Do your worst.\u201d</p><p>No sooner had the words passed his lips than her fist met his gut, driving into his side like a mallet. A mallet with a knobby little row of knuckles. The blow came before he\u2019d had the chance to prepare, to tense his muscles in defense.</p> <p>\u201cOof.\u201d He clutched his side, reeling. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Susanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked for it,\u201d she cried defensively, nursing her punching hand close to her breast and rubbing her knuckles. \u201cYou told me to do my worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d He straightened, blowing away the pain with a deep exhalation. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . your worst was worse than I was anticipating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know by now, I\u2019m just full of surprises.\u201d Her breath caught on a wild sob. She pulled back for another blow.</p><p>This time he intercepted it, easily catching her fist in his own. \u201cHold a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold nothing.\u201d She kicked him in the shin. His good shin, fortunately. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined everything. I\u2019m furious with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me?\u201d His head jerked back in surprise. After the callous, disgusting way Sir Lewis had just treated her in the hall, she was angry with him?</p><p>\u201cHow could you do this to me? You gave me your word. You promised you wouldn\u2019t involve my father in any of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was involving him, not in the way you meant. I only agreed to demonstrate his new invention. It\u2019s not as though I put him in uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see how this is so much worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t see that at all.\u201d He put his hands on her shoulders and tried to soothe her with a brisk caress. \u201cSusanna, I never meant to deceive you, I swear it. And regardless of how I feel about your father right now . . . Even I have to admit, his cannon is a brilliant idea. It should be made known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cannon is a brilliant idea. But in practice, it doesn\u2019t work. Do you know how many prototypes he\u2019s tried? How many near-disasters we\u2019ve evaded? The last one blew up, Bram. Practically in his face. He suffered a mild heart attack, remained abed for weeks. He promised me he\u2019d discontinue experiments and send his drawings to colleagues for testing instead.\u201d She pressed the back of her hand to her mouth. \u201cHe promised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he broke his word. To us both.\u201d He cast a pointed glance at his breast pocket, where he\u2019d stuffed the envelope. \u201cHe could have given me these orders weeks ago, don\u2019t you see? But he decided to use me while he had the chance. This event we\u2019ve been working so hard to plan has nothing to do with the Duke of Tunbridge or defending the cove, and everything to do with your father\u2019s taste for glory. It\u2019s all a bit of gold braid and red-coated flash to set off the jewel that is his new cannon. He\u2019s manipulated us both. Not only us, but the whole damned village. For the sake of his pride, he\u2019s put all your work, all your friends at risk.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut and pressed her hands over her ears. \u201cStop! Stop talking. I don\u2019t want to hear any more. Just stop.\u201d</p><p>He knew her anger wasn\u2019t truly for him. The betrayal and devastation she felt were all to do with her father. That familiar, awful sense of helplessness descended on Bram, as he realized there was nothing he could do to alter the past. He couldn\u2019t mend this for her.</p><p>But he could be here, with her. He could listen, and hold her tight.</p><p>So he did. Bram wrapped her in his arms and clutched her close to his chest. She put her head on his shoulder and wept. He held her like that for several minutes, murmuring words of comfort in her ear. Lending her the warmth and strength of his body until the tremors ceased racking hers.</p><p>When at length she raised her head and drew a deep, shaky breath, he led her to one of the corner arbors. \u201cCome, let\u2019s sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Your knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s not that.\u201d He pulled her down to sit with him. The arbor bench was narrow, and it would only accommodate the two of them if she sat half in his lap. He slid one arm about her waist. Her slender, stockinged legs twined with his knee boots. One of her slippers fell to the grass.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d With his free hand, he wrested the flask from his pocket. He unscrewed the top with his teeth, then spat it aside. \u201cHave a sip of this. It will help.\u201d</p><p>He raised it to her quivering lips, and she took a healthy swallow. Immediately, she seized up with a violent coughing fit.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, patting her back. \u201cYou\u2019re so proficient at shooting and Latin and so forth, I forget you haven\u2019t mastered every manly pursuit.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat and gave him a wry smile. \u201cThis is one I hadn\u2019t tried yet. As for the others . . . I just wanted something in common with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, love. I know it well.\u201d He brushed the stray hair from her face. \u201cIt was always the same with me.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her face with her hands. \u201cHe promised me, Bram. He promised me so many things, and I was such a fool to believe. He told me he\u2019d look after himself, stop causing me so much worry. And now this cannon business.\u201d A bittersweet laugh broke through her tears. \u201cHe told me once, long ago, that Rycliff Castle was mine. Did you know that? It was my prize, he said. My reward for recovering. He encouraged me to store all my hopes and dreams there, and then . . .\u201d She reached for the flask and took another nip of whiskey, swallowing with a grimace. \u201cAnd then one afternoon, he just gave it away.\u201d Her tearful eyes met his. \u201cTo you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Only a girl\u2019s foolishness. But I\u2019m a foolish girl, it seems.\u201d She sniffed and laid her head to his chest. \u201cHe promised me I\u2019d be safe, that summer in Norfolk. That time spent there would be . . .\u201d Her voice pinched. \u201cWould be good for me. Now I know, he just wanted me out of the way. You heard him earlier. How he said I\u2019m always becoming overwrought, holding him back. That summer, I must have proved too difficult to ignore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, love. Hush.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her crown. \u201cDon\u2019t distress yourself so.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled around his lapel. \u201cAnd all this might be somehow bearable, if I had you. But now you\u2019re leaving. Tuesday. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll survive it. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, his heart danced a nimble little waltz in his chest.</p><p>She loved him.</p><p>She\u2019d said as much inside the house. Four times, if he recalled correctly. But with every repetition, she only heaped more joy atop joy. He was well and truly wallowing in it now.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go,\u201d she whispered, clutching his coat. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes held so much heartrending doubt. As if he would be the second man today to destroy her trust. He didn\u2019t know that he could find the words to convince her otherwise, so he answered with a kiss instead. He lowered his lips to hers, meaning to give her a chaste, reassuring peck.</p><p>But she had other ideas.</p><p>Her lips parted beneath his, inviting and lush. Drawing him in. Welcoming him home.</p><p>God. Yes. That first taste of her, after long days of separation, sent lightning forking through his body. A low groan rumbled from his throat.</p><p>They kissed hungrily, trading light nips and deep passes of their tongues. Susanna came alive in his arms, seized by some kind of sensual frenzy. She clutched his shoulders. Pushed aside his lapels to rub her breasts against his homespun-clad chest. Speared her fingers through his thick, cropped hair and twisted in his lap, driving their kiss deeper still.</p><p>Perhaps it was that small taste of whiskey\u2014but in all their previous encounters, he\u2019d never known her to be this aggressive. Her hands were bold. Her lips and tongue made demands.</p><p>Bram found he rather liked it. He liked it a great deal.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d she urged, licking over his pulse. \u201cHold me, close and tight. Promise you\u2019ll never let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He slid one hand to her backside and pulled, hiking her higher onto his lap. But it wasn\u2019t enough. With one hand, she gathered and lifted the folds of her skirts. They made a sensuous rustle as she pushed up on her knees and moved to straddle him on the bench.</p><p>He slid a hand up her thigh. She was bare beneath her petticoats. Bare, and already wet for him. Their moans mingled as he explored her dewy cleft with his fingertips, finding and circling her swollen pearl. Her feminine spice mingled with the scent of roses, filling the air with an intoxicating, arousing perfume.</p><p>Her hand flew to the closures of his breeches front. She adjusted her weight, giving herself space to work the buttons free. The shift in her pose thrust her bosom in his face. Bending his head, he nuzzled the soft pillows of her breasts, greedily thrusting his tongue into the dark, fragrant valley between them.</p><p>As he kissed and licked the luscious curves, a needy whimper eased from her throat. \u201cI need you,\u201d she said, reaching through the unbuttoned flap to stroke his aroused flesh. \u201cI need you now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to ask twice. He worked his cock through the layers of buckskin and fabric, positioning the engorged, eager tip just at the entrance to bliss.</p><p>She lowered herself a fraction of an inch, then backed off\u2014her slick heat lapping at the crown of his erection. He thought he would lose his mind, but he forced himself to be patient for a moment more, allowing his head to fall back so he could drink in the sight of her. The coils and wisps of her molten bronze hair, tumbling loose around her pale shoulders. Those full, berry-stained lips, swollen with his kisses. The flush of passion on her face. So beautiful, she made his heart twist.</p><p>He guided her hips, until she settled in just the right spot. And then he helped her sink by slow degrees. Inch by delicious inch. Until molten bliss enveloped him, all the way to the root.</p><p>They stayed that way for a long moment, each of them panting for breath, resisting the desire to move.</p><p>When the desire to move became an imperative, she rolled her hips. Slowly at first, but quickly accelerating to a brisk, urgent rhythm. He helped with his hands, clutching her backside tight and lifting, lowering . . . sliding her over his rigid length again and again. Faster, harder. Until their bodies met with resounding, erotic smacks of skin against skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brow fell to his shoulder. He could tell from the helpless whimpers of pleasure rising from her throat, she was close to the edge. He was already dangling over the edge, clinging to it by his gritted teeth. Pleasure buzzed up and down his spine, desperate for an outlet.</p><p>Hold out, he told himself. Just a minute more.</p><p>He needed to feel her body convulse around him, hear the cries she made when the pleasure hit. His pleasure would be meaningless without hers.</p> <p>Knowing full well it would shred the last remnants of his control, he arched his hips for deeper penetration and quickened his thrusts. Her breath came hot and fast against his ear. Her nails bit into the soft flesh of his nape, and her breasts galloped against his chest. He was losing his battle for restraint, careening full-speed toward what was sure to be the most devastating pleasure of his life.</p><p>\u201cLove, I can\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she said. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he forced through gritted teeth. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>They stayed together, and they came together. Bucking, gasping, clutching each other tight. With the first tight, delicious pulse of her climax, she pulled him straight over the edge into bliss. Somehow her mouth found his, and they swallowed each other\u2019s cries of passion. Bram thought he would burst from his skin with elation. The blinding pleasure of his climax was only eclipsed by the fierce joy of filling her with his seed.</p> <p>She was his now, forever. And he was hers, body and soul.</p><p>They were one.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she murmured, slumping forward and pressing her damp brow to his chin. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>His heart squeezed. He wouldn\u2019t desert her, ever. But he had orders now, and she needed to get away from this place. \u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of incredulity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly serious. It\u2019s not exactly a pleasure cruise, but I have guaranteed passage to the Continent next week. Come with me. As my wife.\u201d</p> <p>Her brow creased. \u201cBut . . . I thought you believed women don\u2019t belong on campaign.\u201d</p><p>He forced down the instinctive surge of worry. \u201cMost don\u2019t. But you\u2019re stronger than most. You know how to look out for yourself. We\u2019ll sail from Portsmouth, and the captain can marry us on board. We\u2019ll honeymoon in Portugal.\u201d He skipped a light touch up her spine, tangled his fingers in her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful there, Susanna. Vineyards and olive trees. An ocean so warm and blue. Groves of citrus, overburdened with fruit. Imagine, wading ankle-deep in lemons and oranges. The scent haunts you for days.\u201d He nuzzled her neck. \u201cWe\u2019ll let a villa by the sea. We\u2019ll make love on sandy beaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking it might be nice to make love in a bed, just the once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you the finest bed you ever imagined. Heaped with mattresses three feet thick. Sheets of silk and the softest down pillows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds lovely, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. Just say yes.\u201d</p><p>She lifted herself off his flagging erection and resettled on his lap. Her lip folded under her teeth, and her eyes were downcast. Maybe he was pushing her too hard, too fast. He took his time refastening his breeches, giving her a moment to contemplate.</p><p>\u201cI know this day has been devastating for you. You\u2019re feeling confused, overwhelmed, betrayed. But I\u2019m here to tell you, there\u2019s only one decision you need to make right now. And that\u2019s to trust me. Trust me to look after your happiness, Susanna. I swear, I will not let you down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do trust you. I\u2019d trust you with my life. But think of the village, Bram. All the young ladies.\u201d</p><p>He caught her face in his hands, forcing her to meet his gaze. \u201cThink of you. Brilliant, beautiful, remarkable you. You do great things here in Spindle Cove, but I know you\u2019re capable of far more. Let me show you the world, Susanna. More than that, let me show the world you. Don\u2019t let fear hold you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel a little scared. You\u2019re asking me to leave behind everything and everyone I know, and you haven\u2019t even said . . .\u201d She went silent.</p><p>Ah. So that was the problem. She was waiting to hear his feelings. He should have guessed as much. Hadn\u2019t labeling those emotions always been the sticking point with her?</p><p>At that moment, the air trembled with the force of a distant explosion. With a surprised cry, she huddled into the protection of his coat. Overhead, the sky burst into sparkling trails of gold.</p><p>She stared up in wonder. \u201cAm I hallucinating, or are those fireworks?\u201d</p><p>He swore with amusement. \u201cThose can only be Colin\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Another whistling rocket soared into the air, exploding into silver sparks. Bram\u2019s heart lit up like a Roman candle. This was just like the first time they\u2019d met. She was in his arms, so soft and warm. The perfect place to land. And she trusted him to keep and protect her, while the world exploded around them.</p><p>He turned her face to his. Her pupils sparkled, mirroring the fireworks overhead. But even those glittering reflections couldn\u2019t outshine the emotion in her eyes.</p><p>Ridiculous, how damned nervous he felt. He was a big, strong man. All she asked of him were three tiny syllables. But somehow, it seemed easier to order his life around the sentiment than voice it aloud. What if he said the words, and they still weren\u2019t enough?</p><p>He wet his lips and steeled his nerve. \u201cSusanna fair. I . . . God, how I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Boom.</p><p>His words were stolen by a fresh explosion\u2014a louder, earthbound, bone-jarring blast.</p><p>After that, all they heard were screams.</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>\u201cOh Lord.\u201d Susanna\u2019s heart stalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>There was so much noise, and she couldn\u2019t make sense of any of it. A loud ringing filled her ears. Her blood thundered in her chest. Frantic voices rose in indecipherable cries. Horses whinnied. The soles of her shoes slapped the packed-dirt lane.</p><p>She was running. When had she started running?</p><p>Bram paced her, loping at her side. His hand settled at the base of her spine, steadying her. Pushing her onward. They rounded the corner and joined the throng of people rushing toward the carriage house and stables.</p><p>There was blood. A great deal of it. She smelled it even before she glimpsed the spatter of red on the straw-covered ground. The pungent odor worked as a helpful antidote to the encroaching panic. She could not lose her head. Someone was wounded, and she had work to do.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s injured?\u201d she asked, elbowing a wailing Sally out of the way and pushing her way through the stable door. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Finn.\u201d Lord Payne was there, pulling her through the crush of bodies, into an empty stall lit by a hanging carriage lamp. \u201cHe\u2019s been hurt.\u201d</p><p>To say Finn Bright had been hurt was rather an understatement. The boy\u2019s left leg was a raw, ragged horror below the knee. His foot, or what remained of it, dangled at a grotesque angle. White slivers of bone gleamed from the open wound.</p><p>Susanna knelt beside the boy. From the sickly pallor of his face, she could tell he\u2019d already lost a great deal of blood. \u201cWe need to stop the bleeding, immediately.\u201d</p><p>Bram said, \u201cWe need a tourniquet. A girth or billet from the tack room will serve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime . . .\u201d Susanna turned to Lord Payne. \u201cGive me your cravat.\u201d</p><p>He complied, loosening the knot of his neck cloth with trembling, jerky motions and sliding the length of fabric loose. Susanna reached for it and wound it about Finn\u2019s calf just below the knee, pulling with all her might to cinch it.</p><p>That accomplished, she turned her attention to the boy. His breathing was shallow, and his gaze unfocused. The poor youth was going into shock.</p><p>\u201cFinn,\u201d she said in a loud, clear voice, \u201ccan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. His teeth chattered as he whispered, \u201cYes, Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d She put a hand to his cheek and tried to meet his gaze. \u201cWe\u2019re all here. We\u2019re going to have you put to rights just as soon as we can.\u201d</p><p>Aaron Dawes crouched at her side. \u201cI\u2019m readying a cart. We\u2019ll have to take him to the smithy for bonesetting.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her agreement. While Susanna dispensed salves and tinctures to the villagers, anything that required brute force\u2014the setting of bones, the pulling of teeth, and so forth\u2014all fell to Dawes, as the village blacksmith. Although, from the looks of Finn\u2019s wound, she wasn\u2019t at all sure this injury could be set. There was a very good possibility he would lose the foot entirely.</p><p>Assuming he lived.</p><p>She smoothed hair from Finn\u2019s sweaty brow. \u201cAre you in a great deal of pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-n-no,\u201d he said, shivering. \u201cJust cold.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>Bram knew it, too. He handed her a buckled strap of strong, cured leather. As she wound the strap around Finn\u2019s leg, he found a horse blanket and draped it over the boy\u2019s torso.</p><p>\u201cThere now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBe strong, Finn.\u201d</p><p>Bram took the strap from Susanna\u2019s grip and yanked it tight, securing it much better than she could have done herself. Obviously, battle had given him a great deal more experience with wounds of this nature than with attacks of asthma. The blood loss instantly decreased.</p><p>Rufus knelt at his brother\u2019s head. Susanna could tell he was struggling to hold back tears. \u201cWill he be all right, Miss Finch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said, trying to convince herself. \u201cBut how did this happen?\u201d</p><p>Lord Payne shook his head in dismay. \u201cThe fireworks. I meant them to be a surprise for tomorrow, but . . .\u201d He turned his head to spit a violent curse. \u201cSeems I can\u2019t touch a damned thing without ruining it. I was distracted, and the boys got it into their heads to test a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut fireworks could not have caused a blast that strong. Could they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the cannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cannon?\u201d Dread sank like a stone to the bottom of her gut.</p><p>\u201cAfter the fireworks, they coaxed Sir Lewis into a demonstration. The thing backfired.\u201d</p><p>Oh Lord.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my father?\u201d Releasing Finn, she struggled to gain her feet. She stood on tiptoe, craning her neck to view the group. \u201cPapa?\u201d</p><p>The men bustled about, preparing a cart to transport Finn to the smithy. Susanna forced her way through the crush of bodies. She found her father in the courtyard, picking through the cannon\u2019s wreckage.</p><p>\u201cDamnation,\u201d he said in an anguished voice. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa, don\u2019t!\u201d She grabbed his arm just as he reached for a brass fragment. Leaning back with all her might, she tugged him away from the scene. \u201cYou\u2019ll burn yourself. You shouldn\u2019t be near this at all, with so much explosive still about.\u201d</p><p>Just then, a wafting spark landed in an open crate of fireworks, setting the packing straw alight and sending a rocket shooting sideways.</p><p>\u201cLook out!\u201d she cried, pushing her father to the ground and diving after him. She tripped and landed awkwardly, bouncing on her side. A half-buried rock crunched into her rib cage.</p><p>Ignoring her smarting ribs, she crawled to her father\u2019s side. \u201cAre you well, Papa? Is your heart paining you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could it not?\u201d Struggling up on an elbow, he lifted a handkerchief to his face, wiping away a mixture of tears and sweat. \u201cWhat senseless destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident, Papa.\u201d One that should have never happened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what went wrong,\u201d he muttered. \u201cToo much powder? A flaw in the casting? I was so certain this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been certain several times before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he moaned. \u201cSuch a tragedy. My beautiful cannon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him, horrified. \u201cPapa.\u201d Smack. \u201cTo the devil with your cannon. Finn could die.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her, stunned. Susanna was stunned, too. God help her, she\u2019d cursed at her own father and smacked him in the face. It was awful. And satisfying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Papa. But you earned that.\u201d She took advantage of his shock to press her hand to his throat and feel for his pulse. For a few horrific seconds, she couldn\u2019t find any heartbeat at all. But at last, her fingers located the elusive rhythm.</p> <p>The beat was fast, but steady. Healthy and strong.</p><p>Tears of relief pressed to her eyes. Her father might be a selfish old man, enslaved to his ambition. Perhaps he\u2019d never loved her the way a motherless, awkward girl yearned to be loved. But he had given her life. Not once, but twice. And he had given her this home she adored so much. He was her father, and she loved him. She didn\u2019t want to lose him today.</p><p>She flagged down a passing stable hand. \u201cTake my father in to the housekeeper. Tell her Miss Finch says Sir Lewis must take to his bed and rest. No arguments.\u201d</p><p>With that settled, she turned back to the carriage house, where the men were hitching horses to the cart. The beasts stamped and whinnied, made nervous by the explosions and scent of blood.</p><p>The groom offered a hand, helping her into the cart to sit at Finn\u2019s knee. Her skirts crushed beneath her as she settled into the straw. Corporal Thorne and Aaron Dawes were already present, crouching on either side of Finn to keep him immobile. Thorne kept his hands clamped tight about the boy\u2019s calf, just above the tourniquet, adding the force of his grip to staunch the flow of blood.</p> <p>\u201cGo on ahead,\u201d Bram ordered the driver. He and his cousin prepared to mount their horses. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch you on the road.\u201d</p><p>The cart lurched into motion, turning off Summerfield property and trundling down the dirt lane. They\u2019d nearly covered the distance to the smithy by the time Susanna realized she wasn\u2019t the only woman in the cart.</p><p>Diana Highwood was there, holding Finn\u2019s head in her lap and wiping his brow with a lacy white handkerchief. \u201cThere, there,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so well. The ride\u2019s almost over.\u201d</p><p>As they pulled into the smithy\u2019s small yard, Aaron Dawes vaulted from the cart and rushed ahead to throw open the doors. Bram slid from his horse and hurried to lift Finn in his arms and carry him inside. Thorne and Payne flanked him, to assist.</p><p>As Susanna alighted from the cart, she winced, feeling a sharp pain where she\u2019d fallen. She paused for a moment, pressing a hand to her bruised side, until the pain subsided. Then she moved to follow the men inside the smithy.</p><p>Miss Highwood did the same.</p> <p>Susanna caught the fair-haired beauty\u2019s arm. \u201cMiss Highwood . . . Diana. This will be an unpleasant scene. I don\u2019t think you should be here.\u201d Susanna wasn\u2019t at all sure how she would make it through, herself. This went well beyond her usual realm of poultices and salves.</p><p>\u201cI want to help,\u201d the young woman said, with clear-eyed resolve. \u201cYou all helped me, during my time of distress. You, Lord Rycliff, Mr. Dawes. Rufus and Finn, as well. I want to repay the kindness. I haven\u2019t the men\u2019s strength, or your knowledge, Miss Finch. But I\u2019m not a swooning sort of girl, and I\u2019ll do anything I can.\u201d</p><p>Susanna regarded the young woman with admiration. Apparently, the delicate Miss Highwood was made of stronger stuff than everyone else had imagined . . . Susanna included.</p><p>Good for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be certain to step out, if it becomes too much?\u201d</p><p>Diana nodded. \u201cAnd I have my tincture, of course.\u201d</p><p>Susanna gave her arm a grateful squeeze before releasing it. \u201cThen let\u2019s go in together.\u201d</p><p>Aaron Dawes hurried ahead of them all, clearing the tools from a long, wooden table and moving it to the center of the space. \u201cSet him down here, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>Bram hesitated for a moment, as if reluctant to let Finn go. But then he silently moved forward and lowered the moaning boy to the smooth, sanded surface. Thorne still held his viselike grip on Finn\u2019s wounded leg.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Finn,\u201d Bram murmured. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of you.\u201d He turned to Dawes. \u201cLaudanum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent Rufus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Rufus dashed into the room, holding up a brown glass bottle. \u201cTook it from All Things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch a spoon or a cup,\u201d Miss Highwood offered.</p><p>\u201cSave it for afterward,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cHe\u2019s already unconscious, and we can\u2019t wait for it to take effect.\u201d The smith poked gingerly at what had recently been a recognizable foot. \u201cThere\u2019s no saving it. I\u2019ll start readying the tools.\u201d</p><p>Susanna was saddened, but unsurprised. Even if the bone weren\u2019t splintered, the wound was an unholy mess\u2014studded with bits of metal, boot leather, and other debris. It would prove impossible to clean thoroughly. If the blood loss didn\u2019t take Finn\u2019s life, infection would.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Lord Payne asked. He stood at the edge of the room, his face ashen and drawn. \u201cDawes, give me something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fire going. It\u2019s growing dark.\u201d The smith jerked his head toward the forge. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lamp in my cottage, across the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the lamp,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, halt!\u201d Bram shouted. He loomed over Finn, his face hard and commanding. \u201cNo one is touching this boy\u2019s foot, do you hear me? I\u2019m going for a surgeon.\u201d</p><p>Susanna winced. She ought to have known how Bram would receive this, after he\u2019d so nearly lost his own leg. But that was a different sort of wound, incurred under much different circumstances.</p><p>Drawing up to his full height, Bram looked around the room and spoke with cool authority. \u201cNo one cuts into this boy. Not until I return. That\u2019s an order.\u201d He turned to his corporal. \u201cDo you hear me, Thorne? No one touches him. You have my permission to use whatever means you must.\u201d</p><p>He turned and strode from the forge, leaving everyone stunned, staring blankly at one another. They all knew what Bram refused to admit\u2014that preserving Finn\u2019s foot could mean losing his life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d said Lord Payne, moving for the door.</p><p>Susanna stopped him. \u201cWait, my lord. Let me try.\u201d</p><p>A look of understanding passed between them. He nodded. \u201cStubborn fool never listens to me. Never listens to anyone, I\u2019d wager. But he loves you, so perhaps there\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>Susanna blinked at him, startled.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he said so yet?\u201d Payne shrugged. \u201cCowardly bastard doesn\u2019t deserve you. Go on, now.\u201d He gave her a fond nudge.</p><p>Susanna rushed out of the smithy and into the yard, where Bram was readjusting his horse\u2019s saddle, preparing to mount.</p><p>\u201cBram, wait,\u201d she called, dashing to his side. \u201cI know this is horrible for you. It\u2019s a tragedy, truly. But we can\u2019t wait on a surgeon\u2019s opinion tonight. Dawes must operate quickly, if Finn\u2019s to have any chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you lame him. He\u2019s fourteen years old, for Christ\u2019s sake. Full of a young boy\u2019s plans and dreams. Take that foot, and you take his whole future with it. The Brights aren\u2019t a privileged family. They work for their living. What kind of life is Finn going to have, with one leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But at least he will have a life. If we delay, Finn will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Susanna. I\u2019ve seen a great many more wounds of this nature than you have. You may have a talent with herbs and such, but you\u2019re no surgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She stepped back, feeling the sting of his rebuke. That ache in her ribs reasserted itself. \u201cI know I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d His jaw clenched as he tightened the saddle girth. \u201cYou seem eager enough to pretend. You\u2019d sentence that boy to life as an invalid, just because you\u2019ve been hurt in the past. You\u2019re letting your own fear of doctors put Finn at risk.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arm, forcing him to face her. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fears that are putting Finn at risk. It\u2019s yours, don\u2019t you see? You\u2019re still so caught on this notion that you can\u2019t be a whole man, can\u2019t be worth anything unless you prove you have two strong, perfectly functioning legs to carry you into battle. You\u2019d even drag me along to Portugal before you\u2019d admit otherwise. But this is not about you, Bram.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a defensive glare. \u201cI hadn\u2019t planned to drag you anywhere, Susanna. I\u2019d planned to take you willingly, happily\u2014or not at all. Are you telling me you don\u2019t want to come?\u201d</p><p>How could he put such choices to her, at a time like this?</p><p>\u201cI love you. I want to be with you. But dashing off to Portugal next Tuesday, just because my father\u2019s a selfish, unfeeling old stick? It sounds romantic, to be sure . . . but also a bit juvenile. Aren\u2019t we both a little too old to be running away from home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis may be your home, but it will never be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Bram. Home is where people need you.\u201d She gestured at the smithy. \u201cAnd right now, the people in there need you desperately. Aaron Dawes needs every strong pair of hands to help. Finn needs you to stand beside him, and help him to be brave. To show him a man can be a man, whether he has two good legs or one. And after all is said and done, I\u2019m going to need you to hold me. Because helping with this surgery is going to be the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>When he still didn\u2019t cease his preparations, a knot of fear formed in her throat. \u201cBram,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this. Not an hour ago, you promised to never leave me.\u201d</p><p>He ceased wrestling with the saddle and released an angry sigh. \u201cSusanna. Not an hour ago, you claimed to trust me with your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not off to a very good start then, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. Then he turned, placed his foot in the stirrup, and swiftly mounted his horse.</p><p>That pain in her side returned. Though logically, she knew the pain to be placed too low, she couldn\u2019t help but suspect her heart was breaking. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had a thought of doing otherwise, Susanna.\u201d The horse danced under him, sensing its rider\u2019s impatience to be off. \u201cThe only question is whether I have a reason to return. If you let them take that boy\u2019s foot while I\u2019m gone . . . I\u2019ll never be able to look at you again.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned his horse and left.</p><p>She stood watching him until he disappeared into the darkening night. Then she turned and walked numbly back to the forge.</p><p>When she entered alone, all present turned to her.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff has gone,\u201d she said, although it hardly seemed to need saying. \u201cHow is Finn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeakening.\u201d Aaron Dawes\u2019s face was grave. \u201cI have to do it soon.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked to Thorne, who\u2019d been ordered by Bram to stop them. The grim, stalwart officer who had once kept vigil at a wounded Bram\u2019s bedside, pistol cocked, ready to fire at the first gleam of a bone saw. Would he fight them now? Between Dawes and Payne, she supposed they had the corporal outnumbered. But even if they had a dozen men, the smart odds would still seem to favor Thorne.</p><p>\u201cCorporal Thorne,\u201d she said, \u201cI know you are loyal to your lord. But angry as he is right now, if he returns to find this boy dead, he\u2019ll be devastated. We must allow Mr. Dawes to operate.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t stopped loving Bram when he rode away from her. No matter what threats or ultimatums he\u2019d given, she was looking out for Finn\u2019s well-being and his.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe have to save Finn\u2019s life, or Bram will always feel responsible. We all care about him. And we don\u2019t want him to live under that burden of guilt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Recognition gleamed sharp in the corporal\u2019s eyes. And Susanna found herself wondering just what burdens of guilt this quiet, ruthless man shouldered.</p><p>Thorne nodded. \u201cDo it, then.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-seven</p> <p>Bram spent the three-hour ride to Brighton steaming with righteous anger, feeling like a misunderstood, maligned hero.</p><p>He spent the three-hour ride back to Spindle Cove swamped with fierce regret, feeling like a perfect jackass.</p><p>Daniels wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>\u201cLet me understand this,\u201d his friend said, when they stopped to change horses halfway. \u201cNow that I\u2019m more than half awake.\u201d</p><p>Daniels paced the lit area in front of the coaching house stables, pushing a hand through his wild black hair. \u201cA boy got his foot blown apart in a cannon explosion. You had a capable blacksmith and an experienced apothecary all prepared to amputate. But you told them all to hold off for eight or nine hours. So you could ride breakneck to the Brighton Barracks . . .\u201d He motioned to the right. \u201cHaul me out of a warm bed, and drag me all the way back . . .\u201d He waved the same hand to the left. \u201cTo do what, exactly? Pronounce the boy dead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re going to save his leg. The way you saved mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBram.\u201d The surgeon\u2019s flint-gray eyes were unforgiving. \u201cA lone bullet passed through your knee in a straight, clean trajectory. To be sure, it tore your ligaments up\u2014but at least it left edges that could be sewn together. Heavy artillery wounds are like shark attacks. All that\u2019s left is chum. You\u2019ve seen battle. I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>Bram scrubbed a hand over his face, absorbing the censure. \u201cJust shut up and ride.\u201d</p><p>Joshua Daniels and Susanna Finch were two of the most intelligent people Bram had ever known. If the two of them agreed on something, that pretty well guaranteed Bram was wrong. Damn it all. If he hadn\u2019t torn off in such a hurry, he likely would have come around to reason, eventually. But he\u2019d gone a little mad at the idea of just standing by helpless, allowing Finn to be permanently lamed. Susanna was right; after all his own struggles to recover his strength, it had hit too close to home.</p><p>But Susanna was stubborn, he told himself. Headstrong and brave. She\u2019d never listened to him when it didn\u2019t suit her, so why should she start now? No matter what dire proclamations he\u2019d made, surely she wouldn\u2019t have heeded them. Not if Finn\u2019s life hung in the balance. But then again, he\u2019d told Thorne to use any means necessary to prevent an amputation. And Thorne had some formidable, ruthless means at his disposal.</p><p>Jesus Christ, what had he done?</p> <p>Day was breaking as they rode over the crest and caught their first glimpse of Spindle Cove. His heart lurched at the sight. The charming little village, nestled snug in its valley. The ancient castle ruins, standing sentinel on the bluffs. The cove, calm and blue, studded with small fishing crafts. Warm, buttery sunlight melting over the ridge.</p><p>Susanna was right. He was lord of this quiet little nook of England, and there was pride in that. Spindle Cove had a claim on his honor and his heart. And for the first time in his life, Bram knew he had a true home. He could only hope she\u2019d see fit to welcome him back.</p><p>They reached the smithy in a matter of minutes. He launched himself from the saddle the moment his gelding slowed to a walk. While the horses made good use of a nearby trough of rainwater, Bram led Daniels into the small, timber-framed building. They found the forge empty of all souls, save one. Finn Bright lay stretched on a long table in the center of the room, draped with linen from the neck down. Eyes closed.</p><p>The boy was as pale as the sheet that covered him. The smells of blood and singed flesh hung in the air. For a moment, Bram feared the worst had happened, and this new day would mean the boy\u2019s death on his conscience.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll live.\u201d Dawes stood in the opposite entry, filling the entire doorway. He looked to have recently bathed. Damp hair clung to his brow, and he was still pulling down a fresh shirt. \u201cProvided he doesn\u2019t go septic,\u201d the man qualified, \u201che\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Bram sucked in a breath. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>He knew he tossed out that phrase all the time, but this time he meant it. He was really, truly thankful to God. And unsure how he\u2019d ever repay the debt.</p><p>\u201cBut there was no saving his foot, my lord. The blast had done most of the work already. I just did my best to make it clean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand. You did right.\u201d</p><p>Bram stared down at the boy\u2019s blood-drained, perspiring face. Fortunately, he looked to have been dosed with enough laudanum to take him beyond the pain. For now. When he woke, Finn would find himself in a vivid, burning hell. That much, Bram had experienced.</p><p>Clearing his throat, he introduced Daniels. \u201cHe\u2019s a surgeon and a friend of mine. He\u2019ll see to the boy from here.\u201d</p><p>Daniels threw back the linen drape from Finn\u2019s leg. Bram winced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pretty, but it ought to heal cleanly,\u201d Daniels said, assessing the stump. \u201cYou do good work, Mr. Dawes.\u201d</p><p>Dawes nodded his thanks, wiping his hands on a small towel. Bram looked past the man, to the cottage adjacent. A fair-haired woman was sleeping at the table, her head bent over an extended arm.</p><p>He walked toward Dawes, giving Daniels some space to examine the boy. \u201cIs that Miss Highwood?\u201d</p><p>Dawes shot a glance over his shoulder and exhaled roughly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is she doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, my lord? Damned if I know. But she\u2019s been here all night, and all the screaming and blood in the world couldn\u2019t persuade her to leave. Golden hair and an iron will, that one. Lord Payne\u2019s gone to borrow Keane\u2019s curricle, so he can drive her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Miss Finch? Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff.\u201d A thin, weak voice called to him. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Finn. It\u2019s me.\u201d Bram hurried back to the table and crouched at the boy\u2019s eye level. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Stupid question.</p><p>\u201cS-s-sorry,\u201d the wide-eyed lad scraped out. \u201cMy fault. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Guilt twisted in Bram\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019re not to blame, Finn. It was an accident.\u201d An accident that should have never occurred. \u201cDon\u2019t try to talk. There\u2019ll be time enough for that later.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the flask of whiskey in his breast pocket, with every intent of gifting it to Finn. The flask had nursed Bram through his own leg injury, and the youth had earned his right to drink like a man. But then he thought better of the gift, considering the absent Mr. Bright\u2019s struggles with liquor. He didn\u2019t want to send the boy down the same troubled path.</p><p>He gave Finn a warm pat on the shoulder instead. \u201cI know it\u2019s hell, but you\u2019ll come through it. You\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d Finn said through gritted teeth. \u201cHow am I to help Mum and Sally with the shop now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a hundred ways. We\u2019ll see you fitted with the best false foot possible\u2014no pirate peg leg. You\u2019ll be walking and working again in no time. Or I\u2019ll send you to school, if you like. There are plenty of ways for a man to be useful that don\u2019t involve unloading crates.\u201d Or marching into battle, he thought.</p><p>\u201cCor, school? But I couldn\u2019t accept . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguments, Finn. I\u2019m the lord, and this is my militia. I won\u2019t let it be said my wounded men don\u2019t have an excellent pension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne good thing\u2019s come of it.\u201d With a weak flash of humor, Finn glanced in the direction of his amputated foot. \u201cNo one will ever confuse me with Rufus now, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A smile warmed Bram\u2019s face. \u201cNo, they won\u2019t. And I\u2019ll tell you a secret. The ladies find a wounded soldier hopelessly romantic. They\u2019ll be buzzing after you like honeybees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose they will. Rufus may have two feet, but I\u2019m still the one what danced with Miss Charlotte. Twice.\u201d He broke off, coughing.</p><p>Bram took the cup of water Dawes offered and held it to Finn\u2019s lips, helping him lift his head to drink.</p><p>\u201cDoes my mother know?\u201d the youth asked, reclining again with a wince.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cShe was here earlier, during the surgery. But Sally and Rufus had to take her home, she was so overset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her word that you\u2019re well and asking for her,\u201d Bram said.</p><p>\u201cTell her to make certain little Daisy don\u2019t bang on my drum.\u201d The lad\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cCor. The review. It\u2019s meant to be today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can the men march if I can\u2019t drum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Bram told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll cancel the review.\u201d Nothing lost there, really. After the revelation of Sir Lewis\u2019s deceit, he knew the militia never had much purpose, aside from providing fanfare for a doomed cannon\u2019s debut.</p><p>\u201cBut the review must go on,\u201d Finn said. \u201cDon\u2019t call it off on my account. Everyone\u2019s worked so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a grimace of pain, Finn struggled up on his elbow. \u201cIf the militia\u2019s found lacking, Miss Finch said the ladies would be called home. They need this place, and my family\u2019s store needs them. We\u2019ve worked too hard to give up now, my lord. All of us . . .\u201d He slumped back to the table, overtaxed by the effort of his speech.</p><p>\u201cRest, Finn.\u201d Bram dragged a hand through his hair. Guilt consumed him. After all their hard work, he didn\u2019t know how to tell the villagers the task had been rather meaningless all along. Just an exercise in bloated pride for a fool man.</p><p>Make that two fool men, if he included himself.</p><p>From outside the forge, hurried footsteps approached.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d That was Thorne\u2019s voice, rough and low.</p><p>\u201cYes I can.\u201d A female voice, drawing closer.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, woman. I told you no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what Lord Rycliff has to say about it, shall we?\u201d</p><p>The pair entered the smithy, and Bram\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cI tried to stop her,\u201d Thorne said, throwing a gesture of disgust.</p><p>Her?</p><p>Her. Yes, of course. He recognized her easily by the port-wine birthmark at her temple. But in every other respect, Miss Kate Taylor was dressed the part of a drummer boy. With her petite height and her light, slender figure, she easily fit the militia uniform.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bram asked. He waved at the red coat and buff breeches. \u201cWhose are these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn\u2019s, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m him today. You need a drummer, and I\u2019m the only one who can stand in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor, I can\u2019t ask you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked me. I\u2019ve offered.\u201d</p><p>Thorne caught Bram\u2019s eye. The man steeled his jaw. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>For more than five years, Thorne had served under Bram\u2019s leadership. He\u2019d been not only Bram\u2019s right hand, but his right leg, when he\u2019d needed one. And never\u2014not once, in those five years of drilling, marching, digging, and fighting\u2014had Thorne so much as hesitated to obey Bram\u2019s smallest command. He\u2019d certainly never issued one of his own.</p><p>Until today.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re wasting time here,\u201d Miss Taylor said, earnestly approaching him. \u201cWe have only a few hours to prepare for the drill, and you must let me join you. Unlike the other ladies here, I have no family, no guardian. Spindle Cove is my only home, and I want to help in any way I can. I didn\u2019t do this for nothing.\u201d</p><p>With a dramatic sweep, she doffed her tall, black shako headgear to reveal her hair. Or the lack of it. The girl had clipped her chestnut-brown locks to collar length, and pinned them back to imitate a boyish crop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChrist Almighty,\u201d Thorne muttered. \u201cWhat have you done to yourself?\u201d</p><p>Miss Taylor touched a fingertip to her earlobe and bravely blinked tears from her eyes. \u201cIt will grow back. It\u2019s only hair.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s only hair.</p> <p>Bram\u2019s heart pinched in his chest. She reminded him so much of Susanna that day on the green, bravely offering her long, lovely hair if it meant keeping Finn and Rufus off the volunteer rolls. If only he\u2019d listened to her.</p><p>Where was she? He was growing desperate to see her.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff,\u201d Miss Taylor said, \u201cthere are others, too. Everyone\u2019s gathered at the Bull and Blossom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bull and Blossom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tea shop,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd tavern. Since it\u2019s both now, the Fosburys made a new sign. Anyhow, what with the goings-on at Summerfield, we thought it best to move tonight\u2019s party there. And most of the village has assembled this morning. Everyone\u2019s waiting on your command.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary,\u201d Bram said, halfheartedly.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d said Aaron Dawes. \u201cBut maybe we want to see it through anyway.\u201d</p><p>What an idea. To go forward with this militia review and grand party today, not for Sir Lewis\u2019s pride or for Bram\u2019s\u2014but for Spindle Cove\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all worked so hard, and looked so forward to today. We want to do it for ourselves, and for Finn. And for you, Lord Rycliff.\u201d Miss Taylor plucked at her sleeve. \u201cMiss Finch said you\u2019d be coming back, and we must be ready to do you proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The girl clasped her hands in delight. \u201cOh, Lord Rycliff. I just knew the two of you were in love. I knew you couldn\u2019t leave her.\u201d She bounced on her toes. \u201cThis is all going to be so very romantic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith all that cooing, no one will take you for a boy,\u201d Bram said, chuckling. Truthfully, he was trying not to bounce on his own toes with excitement. \u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone home to have a rest and a change of dress, but she promised to meet us at the castle.\u201d</p><p>Straightening his coat and running his hands over his hair, Bram looked to the other men. \u201cThen what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Hours later, Bram stood impatient at the castle gateway, scanning the path for any sign of Susanna. All morning long, folk had streamed up the ancient road, traveling by cart, on horseback, on foot\u2014some coming from ten or more miles away to watch the review. But none of them were the one woman Bram wanted to see.</p><p>\u201cMost likely she fell asleep,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cShe worked hard all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should ride down to Summerfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already stalled for time as much as I can,\u201d Colin said. \u201cIf it were just a matter of the crowd, I\u2019d say hold off. But generals and dukes aren\u2019t used to being kept waiting. And perhaps Miss Finch needs her rest.\u201d</p><p>Bram nodded his reluctant acknowledgment. The review itself wouldn\u2019t take long. If Susanna hadn\u2019t arrived by the end, he\u2019d ride over to Summerfield straightaway.</p> <p>Striding to the center of the green, he motioned for his men to fall in line. He surveyed them with no small measure of pride\u2014his cadre of willing volunteers, all fitted out in their new uniforms and assembled to serve his command. What a band they were. Shepherds, fishermen, clergymen. A smith, a baker\u2014no candlestick maker, but a boy, a young woman . . .</p><p>And a lamb. Dinner stood at his knee, tricked out in a jaunty red ribbon and bell.</p><p>Make no mistake, this was Spindle Cove.</p><p>Under festooned canopies, the visiting dignitaries and the ladies of the Queen\u2019s Ruby sat ready to observe. The assembled villagers and country folk lined the castle\u2019s perimeter. Children too short to see over the crowd had climbed atop the walls. Gaily colored banners flew from each turret.</p><p>With everyone in place, Bram mounted his horse and addressed his men. And woman. \u201cI want you all to remember, we\u2019re not alone when we take to the field. There are others counting on us to succeed. All the ladies of the Queen\u2019s Ruby. Finn. And Miss Finch. Their faith in us\u2014it\u2019s sewn into the linings of our coats, rolled into every powder cartridge. And it\u2019s in every beat of our hearts. We will not let them down.\u201d</p><p>He looked from one solemn, determined face to the other, making eye contact with every last one of his men. To Miss Taylor, he gave a smile.</p><p>\u201cVicar, say us a blessing, if you will.\u201d Bowing his head, he muttered, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need it.\u201d</p><p>Between the catastrophe yesterday and the subsequent lack of sleep, Bram wasn\u2019t sure how the men would perform. But despite his misgivings, the drill went surprisingly well. The wheel maneuvers that had given them such fits in recent weeks came off smoothly\u2014even the backward one. There was a bit of a misstep with the obliques, due to Fosbury\u2019s persistent confusion of right and left. But with the firings, they ended on a high note. Thanks to Susanna\u2019s tutelage, the men fired in swift, impressive unison\u2014by file and as a company.</p><p>As planned, they capped the display with a feu de joie. All the men lined up in a single file, loaded their muskets, and fired in quick succession\u2014much like opera dancers rippling kicks down the line. The wave of smoke and fire swept from one end of the file to the other.</p><p>When it cleared, the crowd broke into cheers and applause.</p><p>Bram looked from man to man. He could only imagine that they, like he, were quietly bursting with pride and relief. Only one thing could make this moment brighter.</p><p>\u201cBram!\u201d</p><p>And that was it. Susanna\u2019s voice. She\u2019d come. She was finally here, and she\u2019d arrived in time to witness her friends\u2019 triumph.</p><p>\u201cBram!\u201d she called again. Her voice was breathless. She sounded as excited as he felt.</p><p>He dismounted his horse and whirled on his boot heel, searching the crowd for her.</p><p>There she was, standing in a ruined archway near the gate. The previous night\u2019s trials had worn on her. She was pale, and shadows pooled under her eyes. Her hair was disheveled. Her Indian shawl drooped to the dirt. If someone had painted him this exact picture a year ago and said, Someday, you will want to kiss this woman more than you want your next breath . . . Bram would have laughed, and made some joke about artists and opium.</p><p>But today, it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cSusanna.\u201d</p><p>As he approached, she leaned against the stone arch. \u201cBram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He had to get those words out first. \u201cSo sorry. I should never have said what I did. I shouldn\u2019t have left. I was an idiot, and you did just the right thing for Finn. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. Simply stood there in the doorway, looking pale and stunned. Was a ready apology from his quarter truly that much of a shock?</p><p>Perhaps it was. He could be a stubborn fool.</p><p>He took a few more slow steps in Susanna\u2019s direction, stopping less than an arm\u2019s length from where she stood. It was killing him, not to take her in his arms. \u201cI should have come to Summerfield earlier, just to say that. But Miss Taylor said you\u2019d wanted to see this through . . .\u201d He motioned around at the festivities. \u201cEveryone\u2019s worked so hard, and . . . And they did it all for you, Susanna. It went brilliantly, and it was all for you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and pressed a hand to her side. She was silent for so long, he began to worry.</p><p>For good reason, apparently.</p><p>\u201cBram, I\u2014\u201d Her eyes went wide, and she drew a sharp, gasping breath. Where she clutched her side, her knuckles went white. \u201cBram, I feel so strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna?\u201d</p><p>It was a fortunate thing he\u2019d come within an arm\u2019s length of her. Because when she collapsed, he had only an instant to break her fall.</p><p>Twenty-eight</p><p>Susanna loathed being ill. Absolutely despised and feared this sense of being out of control of her own body. And this . . . episode, or illness, or whatever it was . . . was worse than anything she\u2019d felt in years.</p><p>The discomfort had been coming on all night, but it had worsened sharply after she\u2019d left Summerfield. At one point, she\u2019d stopped to sit by the side of the road, uncertain whether her feet could even carry her forward. But then she\u2019d heard the sounds of the review floating down to her. Drumbeats, rifles firing in unison.</p><p>Bram.</p><p>Encouraged by the sounds, she\u2019d somehow managed to gain her feet and stumble the rest of the distance up the path. But once she reached the archway, she couldn\u2019t take one more step.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. Her chest hurt, so very much. She\u2019d forgotten this kind of pain existed. Pain that seemed a tangible entity all its own. A monstrous thing, made of sharp edges and bright colors.</p><p>But Bram was there. And despite his angry words at their parting, he had managed to look at her again. With a smile and apologies, even. His arms were around her, and his soothing whispers stroked away some of her fear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, love. It\u2019s all right. Just rest and let me help.\u201d</p><p>They carried her beneath a canopy and laid her on the ground. Cool grass and springy turf crushed beneath her weight. She opened her eyes. The slanting patterns of the canopy\u2019s striped canvas both amazed and overwhelmed her.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be real. She couldn\u2019t be dying. Not now.</p><p>But perhaps she was. She heard people discussing her. That\u2019s what people did, when they thought you were dying. Discuss you, while standing right nearby. She\u2019d been through this before.</p><p>\u201cPoor Miss Finch. What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s just overtired. It was a hellish night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch, overtired? I can\u2019t believe that, not her. She\u2019s too strong.\u201d</p><p>Well, if she had to die, at least it would be here\u2014in her beloved castle, with Bram at her side, surrounded by so many people she loved. She could feel their concern, wrapping around her like warm cotton wool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a surgeon,\u201d some newcomer said. He spoke with a Northern accent. \u201cIf you\u2019d all clear out, I\u2019d like to have a look.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Not a surgeon. Bram\u2019s heat receded, and she clutched at his hand. Don\u2019t leave me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d she forced out, squeezing his hand. Every breath was pure, stabbing pain, made worse by how hard she had to fight for the torturous privilege. \u201cBy the stables, I . . . fell.\u201d Another painful gasp. \u201cMy ribs, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer ribs,\u201d Bram said. \u201cShe says it\u2019s her ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me have a look, then.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a black leather satchel being opened. The very image made her want to scream. Nothing good came out of those satchels. Only pain, and more pain.</p><p>Someone cut, then tore her bodice into two halves. She felt so exposed. The instinct to struggle seized her.</p><p>\u201cBe calm, love. Be calm.\u201d Bram stroked her hair. \u201cThis is Daniels. He\u2019s a friend of mine, and a brilliant field surgeon. He\u2019s the one who saved my leg. You can trust him. I do.\u201d</p><p>You can trust him. No, she didn\u2019t think she could. She tried to stay calm, drawing quick, shallow breaths as this Mr. Daniels listened and prodded and assessed. All the while, panic raced through her veins.</p><p>\u201cYou say you suffered some injury to your ribs, miss?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut at the time, the pain wasn\u2019t this severe.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Bram asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want my guess . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want your guess,\u201d Bram said angrily. \u201cI want the damned answer.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Daniels was unruffled by this outburst, which gave Susanna some reassurance. He and Bram truly must be close friends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am certain,\u201d said Daniels patiently, \u201cshe has broken some ribs. But broken ribs alone should not cause this sort of difficulty and pain. Not suddenly, after so many hours. But if she\u2019s been going about physical activity since the initial wound, the broken bones may have caused her some bleeding, inside. Over the hours, the blood has been gathering inside her chest with no outlet. Now it\u2019s pressing on her lungs and making it difficult for her to breathe. It\u2019s called a hemo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014thorax,\u201d Susanna finished. Hemothorax. Yes, she thought grimly. She\u2019d read about that. It made perfect sense.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said the doctor, in a tone of surprise. \u201cSo the patient is both lovely and clever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s also mine,\u201d Bram growled. \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Susanna squeezed his hand. That sort of talk was so medieval and possessive. And she loved him for it.</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Daniels cleared his throat and reached for his satchel. \u201cThe good news is, this is all too common on the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth is that good news?\u201d Bram asked.</p><p>\u201cLet me rephrase. The good news is, I\u2019ve seen this many times, and there\u2019s a simple cure. It\u2019s a newer, controversial treatment. But I\u2019ve used it in the field, with great success. All we need to do is drain the blood from her chest, and the condition will resolve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Wild with fear, she struggled to make the words. \u201cBram, no. Don\u2019t . . . don\u2019t let him bleed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bleed her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had too much of that in her youth, and it nearly did her in.\u201d He turned her wrist scars-up for the surgeon\u2019s view.</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>And then Mr. Daniels did the truly astonishing. Something none of those doctors or surgeons in her youth had ever done. He crouched at her shoulder, where she could look him in the eye. And then he talked to her, not about her. As if she had a brain of her own, and full control over her own body.</p><p>\u201cMiss Finch, if I can say it without risking a thumping from Bramwell here, you strike me as a very intelligent woman. I hope you will understand and believe me then, when I tell you this is no quack bloodletting. The pressure in your chest is unlikely to resolve on its own. If we do nothing, there is a good chance you\u2019ll die. Of course, there\u2019s always the risk of infection with such a procedure. But you\u2019re young and strong. I like your chances against a fever better than I like your chances against this.\u201d He thumped lightly on her distended chest, and it sounded strangely dull. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything without your agreement, however.\u201d</p><p>Susanna regarded him with keen appraisal. He was young, it seemed. Scarcely older than she. His hair was unruly, but his eyes were calm and intelligent. Still, on this short acquaintance, she didn\u2019t know that she could bring herself to trust any man who carried one of those horrific black satchels.</p> <p>But there was someone else. Someone she could always trust to protect her.</p><p>She looked to Bram. \u201cDo you . . . trust him . . . with my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . .\u201d She pressed his hand and sucked another painful breath through a rapidly narrowing straw. \u201cI trust you. Love you.\u201d She needed to say that, once more.</p><p>Relief washed over his face. \u201cDo it,\u201d Bram told his friend.</p><p>She could bear this. So long as it was her choice, and Bram was beside her . . . she could bear anything.</p><p>Or so she thought, until she glimpsed the silver gleam of a blade, pressed against her pale skin. The sight made her recoil in horror. Her whole body flinched.</p><p>Daniels lifted the scalpel. \u201cWhere is that blacksmith? We may have to restrain her.\u201d</p> <p>No. Please God, no. All the nightmarish memories came rushing back. The footmen, pinning her to the bed. The sharp fire of the lancet against her wrist.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bram said firmly. \u201cNo restraints. No one touches her but me.\u201d He turned her head to face him. \u201cDon\u2019t look at what he\u2019s doing. Only look at me.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, skimming her gaze over the handsome features of his face and letting herself sink into those familiar jade-green eyes.</p><p>He interlaced his fingers with hers. With the other hand, he stroked her hair. So tenderly.</p><p>\u201cNow listen to me, Susanna. Do you remember that first night we met in the cove? I can refresh your memory, if need be. You were wearing that horrid bathing costume, and I was wearing a medieval torture device.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Only he could make her smile at a time like this.</p><p>\u201cThat night, you suggested we make some promises to each other. Well, we\u2019re going to make them now. I\u2019m going to promise not to leave. And you\u2019re going to promise not to die. All right?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but no sound came out.</p><p>\u201cI promise to stay at your side,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil this is all over. And for the lifetime after that. Now, make your promise to me.\u201d His eyes glistened, and his voice was rough with emotion. \u201cPromise me, Susanna. Tell me you won\u2019t die. I can\u2019t go on without you, love.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth, and managed a tiny nod.</p><p>Then the blade pierced her. And if there\u2019d been any air left in her lungs, she would have screamed.</p><p>The pain was like fire. Burning and intense. But relief followed swiftly, like a quenching rain.</p><p>That first rush of air into her lungs . . . she was dizzied by it, turned upside-down. The world narrowed, and she felt as though she\u2019d stumbled into a deep, dark well. As she fell down and down, she heard distant voices. Bram\u2019s. The surgeon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI believe she\u2019s gone unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s a mercy.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she thought, swirling and tumbling into the darkness.</p><p>Yes, it was a mercy indeed.</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>She\u2019ll recover soon enough. If she doesn\u2019t take a fever.</p><p>Those had been Daniels\u2019s words to him, after the procedure was complete. But it could not have been so easy. A few hours later\u2014almost as soon as they\u2019d seen her settled back at Summerfield\u2014the fever had set in.</p><p>Now Bram hadn\u2019t left her side in days.</p><p>He kept an unceasing vigil at her bedside. He passed the hours tending her in small ways. Coaxing her to take spoonfuls of willow bark tea, or sponging the fevered sweat from her brow. Sometimes he talked to her. Read aloud to her from the newspaper, or told her stories of his childhood and his years on campaign. Anything that crossed his mind. Other times, he shamelessly pleaded with her, begging her to just wake up and be well.</p><p>He ate, when coaxed. The indefinite postponement of the village festivities had left Spindle Cove with a surfeit of Fosbury\u2019s cakes. There always seemed to be a tray of the pastel-iced things close at hand. Bram found himself developing a taste for them, in a wistful sort of way.</p><p>He slept, infrequently and fitfully. He prayed, with a regularity and intensity that would do a Benedictine proud.</p><p>Others came and went from the sickroom. Daniels. The housemaids. Sir Lewis Finch. Even Colin and Thorne came by. They all urged Bram to take a break now and then. Go downstairs for a proper meal, they said. Have a rest in the bedchamber they\u2019d made up down the corridor.</p><p>He refused all their well-meant suggestions. Every last one. He\u2019d made a promise not to leave her. To stay at her side, until this was done. And he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d give Susanna any excuse to drop her end of the bargain.</p><p>So long as he stayed right here, she could not die.</p><p>Sir Lewis sat with him one afternoon, occupying the chair on the other side of the bed. The old man rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cShe looks better today, I think.\u201d</p><p>Bram nodded. \u201cShe is better. We think.\u201d</p><p>That morning, as he\u2019d been adjusting the pillows beneath her head, his forearm had brushed against her cheek. Instead of scalding with fever, her skin had felt cool to his touch. He\u2019d called in Daniels to confirm it, not trusting himself after so many hours of vain hoping.</p><p>But it seemed to be true. The fever had broken. Now it only remained to be seen if she would wake from it with no ill effects. The vigil was easier now, and yet unbearable in its suspense.</p><p>\u201cSir Lewis, there\u2019s something you should know.\u201d Bram took Susanna\u2019s hand in his. It lay wonderfully cool and limp across his palm. \u201cI plan to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You plan to marry her?\u201d The old man fixed him with a watery blue stare. \u201cThat\u2019s how you ask a gentleman for his only daughter\u2019s hand? Bramwell, I would think your father had raised you better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour blessing would be welcome,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cBut no, I\u2019m not asking you for her hand. Susanna\u2019s wise enough to make her own decisions.\u201d</p><p>That was as close as he could bring himself to requesting Sir Lewis\u2019s approval. He damned well wouldn\u2019t ask the man\u2019s permission. As far as Bram was concerned, the moment Sir Lewis had lit that cannon fuse, he\u2019d surrendered all responsibility for Susanna\u2019s welfare. The old man had endangered his daughter\u2019s work, her friends, her very life\u2014and all in the name of glory.</p><p>Bram would protect her now. As her husband, if she\u2019d have him.</p><p>\u201cMy only daughter, getting married. She is all grown now, isn\u2019t she?\u201d With a trembling hand, Sir Lewis touched his sleeping daughter\u2019s hair. \u201cSeems just yesterday she was a babe in arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t yesterday,\u201d Bram said, unable to restrain himself. \u201cYesterday, she lay in this bed, burning with fever and hovering near death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. And you blame me. You think me a self-serving monster.\u201d He paused, as if waiting for Bram to argue otherwise.</p><p>Bram didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d Sir Lewis said, pointing to himself, \u201cthis self-serving monster\u2019s greatest invention will be perfected, and it will see battle. That cannon will shorten the duration of sieges. Allow troops to attack from a safer distance. It will save the lives and limbs of many English soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love my daughter.\u201d The old man\u2019s voice went hoarse. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know the sacrifices I\u2019ve made for her. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but I know the sacrifices she\u2019s made for you. And you have no idea what a remarkable person she\u2019s become. You\u2019re so absorbed in your own work, your own accomplishments. I\u2019ve no doubt you do love Susanna, Sir Lewis. But you\u2019re bollocks bad at it.\u201d</p><p>Sir Lewis paled. \u201cHow dare you speak to me that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I can speak to you any way I wish. I\u2019m the Earl of Rycliff, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have never secured you that title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in your power to take it back. I\u2019m the lord now.\u201d Bram drew a slow, deep breath, trying to calm his rage. He was furious with Sir Lewis for putting Susanna and Finn and all the others in danger. But with any good fortune, this man would soon be his father-in-law. For Susanna\u2019s sake, they would need to make peace.</p><p>\u201cMy father held you in the highest regard,\u201d Bram said. \u201cSo do I, on professional merits. You\u2019re a brilliant inventor, without question. Your creations have helped the British army prevail on many a battlefield, and as many times as I\u2019ve lifted my Finch pistol in defense, I probably owe you my life. But your daughter, Sir Lewis . . .\u201d</p><p>Bram turned his gaze to the sleeping Susanna and squeezed her hand. \u201cYour daughter puts people back together. Young ladies, no less\u2014who defy all rational formula. And she still finds time for the occasional washed-up, wounded officer. I may not owe her my life, but I owe her my heart.\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned at the corners. He blinked hard. \u201cIf you think that rifled cannon will be your greatest invention, you\u2019re a fool. Your greatest invention is right here, sleeping in this bed. Susanna is your legacy. And in your pride, you almost lost her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bram had almost lost her, too. He hadn\u2019t truly allowed himself to consider what that would mean, earlier. He\u2019d been too focused on the next spoonful of tea, the new change of wound dressing, the fresh cloth for her brow. But now that her fever had broken, and Daniels had given her excellent odds for a full recovery . . . Jesus. The possibilities swept through him like a freezing, gale-force wind. A blast strong enough to strip the earth of everything warm and green.</p><p>He\u2019d almost lost her. If this hellish ordeal had taught him one lesson, it was to never allow his pride to come between them again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Bramwell.\u201d The old man\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears. \u201cI know you\u2019re right. I can only hope she\u2019ll find it in her heart to forgive me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course she will, good as she is. But hoping for her forgiveness is not the only thing you can do, Sir Lewis. You can try to deserve it.\u201d</p><p>The bed linens rustled, and he whipped his gaze to Susanna. Her bronze lashes fluttered against her cheek.</p><p>Forget birds singing, bells ringing, brooks quaintly babbling over rocks. Choirs of angels could go hang. Her voice, even scratchy and weak, was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cBram? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>Susanna\u2019s eyes fluttered open to what seemed just another lovely dream. Bram was there, beside her. And they had a proper bed, at long last. She\u2019d had quite enough of loving him in coves and arbors.</p> <p>\u201cBram,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d He pressed a firm kiss to her hand, and several days\u2019 growth of whiskers scraped her skin.</p><p>She started to rise up on her elbow, but then some mischievous imp set the mattress spinning like a top.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to sit up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re weak yet.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, closing her eyes until the room stopped whirling.</p><p>\u201cDo you want water?\u201d He reached for a glass.</p> <p>\u201cIn a moment. First . . .\u201d With great effort, she turned her head. \u201cPapa?\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s work-roughened hands clasped hers. \u201cI\u2019m here, dear girl. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his fingers. \u201cI want you to know I love you very much, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d His voice broke. \u201cI love you too, Susanna Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d To hear those words from her father was unexpected, and unexpectedly freeing. She drew a deep breath. \u201cNow would you go down to the kitchen and ask Cook for some beef tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send Gertrude right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Papa. I\u2019d prefer for you to fetch it. I\u2019d like some time alone with Bram.\u201d</p><p>Her father sniffed and nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you for understanding.\u201d She waited until he rose from his chair, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand, and made his way to the bedchamber door. When she heard the door latch click, she turned to Bram.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear much of that conversation?\u201d His gaze was wary.</p><p>\u201cEnough of it. Oh, Bram. You were wonderful. I can\u2019t even tell you how much I wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>He clucked his tongue. \u201cTime enough for that later. For now, drink.\u201d He held a glass of water to her lips, and she took several cautious sips. \u201cAre you in terrible pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too terrible,\u201d she answered, once he lowered the glass. She tried for a smile. \u201cIt only hurts when I breathe.\u201d</p><p>His answer was a stern rebuke. \u201cDon\u2019t joke. It\u2019s not funny. I can\u2019t stand to see you in pain.\u201d</p><p>Dear, sweet man. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Truly. The pain\u2019s so much better than before. How\u2019s Finn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecovering well, Daniels tells me. He\u2019s in a great deal of pain, but it\u2019s mitigated by a great deal of female attention.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI can imagine. What day is it?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face with one hand. \u201cTuesday, I think.\u201d</p><p>Tuesday. There was something important about Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d She pushed herself up on the pillows, wincing. \u201cBram, your orders. The ship. I thought it left today.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt probably did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you didn\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t die.\u201d Finally, he smiled a little. \u201cOne kept promise deserves another.\u201d</p><p>He sat there, at her bedside, unmoving. As he likely had remained for days now. And she lay there, gazing at him in the warm light of day\u2014his hair askew, shirt rumpled, jaw unshaven, and eyes rimmed with red. Only a man could be so unkempt and manage to look more endearingly handsome than ever.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d she said with sudden horror. She reached up with one hand to investigate her hair. Just as she\u2019d feared, she found it a hopeless tangle. And after all those days of illness\u2014the blood loss, fever . . . \u201cI must look a perfect fright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mad? Susanna, you\u2019re alive and awake. You\u2019re the loveliest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her cracked lips together. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you touch me? Hold me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for lack of wanting to.\u201d He reached one hand toward her face, then hesitated for a moment\u2014before finally brushing a single fingertip down her cheek. \u201cLove, you have at least three cracked ribs and a chest wound. I\u2019m not permitted to hold you. In fact, Daniels put me under strict orders if you awoke. I\u2019m not to hold you, kiss you, touch you. I\u2019m not to make you laugh, make you cry, make you angry, or excite your emotions in any way. Which means\u201d\u2014he inched his chair closer to the head of the bed\u2014\u201cthat if we\u2019re going to talk at all right now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . we have to make this a very calm, completely dispassionate conversation.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, making her tone serious. \u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see . . .\u201d He tenderly clasped her hand. \u201cI have a question to ask Miss Finch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She adopted a formal tone. \u201cAnd what would that question be, Lord Rycliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if you, Miss Finch, with your keen eye and discerning taste, would be so good as to help me choose some fabrics for upholstery.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cUpholstery?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI think it would be a safe enough occupation for you, while you convalesce. I\u2019ll have some samples sent over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cIs that all you mean to ask of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not. If all goes well and your recovery permits, by next week perhaps you can advance to draperies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraperies.\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cBram, I know you\u2019ve been forbidden to provoke me. But did Mr. Daniels say nothing about the dangers of confusing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start again.\u201d He paused, staring down at their linked hands. \u201cI\u2019ve written to my superiors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout upholstery? Or draperies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. About my commission.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cBram, you didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t resign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he warned, squeezing her fingers. \u201cVery calm, completely dispassionate. Remember?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, pausing to draw a cautious breath.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t resign.\u201d His thumb traced a circle on the back of her hand. \u201cI accepted a promotion I was offered some time ago. I\u2019ll be assigned to the War Office, making sure the infantry regiments have the supplies they need at the front. It\u2019s not field command, but it\u2019s important work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Oh, and you\u2019ll be brilliant at it. You\u2019ve spent so much time at the front. Who knows better than you what they need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be some travel involved. But for the most part, I\u2019ll be working in Town. So I\u2019ll need a house there, I suppose. I\u2019ve never bought a house before. When you\u2019re well, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019d help me choose one. And then, I was hoping you\u2019d help me make it a proper home. You know, with upholstery. And draperies. And . . . perhaps babies, eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Babies.\u201d A helpless giggle rose in her throat. \u201cDo you plan to send over samples of those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh.\u201d He shushed her, putting a hand to her shoulder to keep her still. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d She stifled the impulse as best she could. Then, with a trembling hand, she wiped tears from her eyes.</p><p>Panic overtook his expression. \u201cBloody hell. Now you\u2019re crying. Daniels will kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. The laughter, the tears . . . they\u2019re worth any pain. I\u2019m so happy. Just miserably, painfully full of joy.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyebrows lowered, and beneath them his eyes went very grave. \u201cYou\u201d\u2014he squeezed her hand in both of his\u2014\u201cgave me the scare of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was frightened, too,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut you helped me through it. And here we are. If we can survive that, I imagine we can come through anything.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, save to give her a long, affectionate look.</p><p>Surely he loved her. He didn\u2019t even have to say it. His every action\u2014from accepting the promotion in London, to the cool cloth he now swiped over her brow\u2014told her so.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to say it. But she was growing terribly impatient to hear the words, just the same.</p><p>He snapped straight and began adjusting the bed linens around her. \u201cYou need rest. Or tea. Or something. I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re the healer. If you were me right now, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s simple. I would go inform Daniels that his patient is awake. And then I would have a proper meal and a good, long sleep. And a bath and a shave. And I would not worry about anything.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a fingertip over her nose. \u201cLittle liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the very first thing I would do? Is give my future bride a kiss.\u201d When he hesitated, she cast him her most encouraging smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve already broken all the other prohibitions. Don\u2019t go honorable on me now.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close, brushing the hair from her temple. \u201cI never could resist stealing a kiss from you. Not since that very first day.\u201d</p><p>His lips touched hers.</p><p>And just like that first kiss, it was warm and firm, and then . . . it was over. Curse him, he was a model of restraint.</p><p>\u201cBram,\u201d she whispered, unable to resist, \u201cdo you think you could love me, just a little?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGood Lord, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Susanna bit her lip, cringing inside. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear. She dropped her gaze to his lapel, assessing her options. Could she bring herself to marry him, if he didn\u2019t love her at all?</p><p>Of course she could. The alternative flashed before her eyes\u2014a future that appeared hopelessly lonely and grim. She couldn\u2019t picture it too clearly, but she sensed it would involve a great many cats and peppermints.</p><p>Never mind love. She could make do with lust, or admiration, or whatever he offered her. Even tepid affection was better than fuzzy peppermints.</p><p>He touched her cheek, drawing her gaze back up to his strong, handsome face.</p><p>\u201cNo, Susanna,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot love you just a little. If that\u2019s what you want, you must find a different man.\u201d His green eyes were breathtaking in their intensity. His thumb brushed her bottom lip. \u201cBecause I can only love you entirely. With everything I am, and everything I ever will be. Body, mind, heart, soul.\u201d</p><p>Her heart soared. \u201cOh,\u201d she finally managed. \u201cThat\u2019s better. So much better.\u201d She pulled him close for a kiss.</p><p>He held back. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, looking serious now. \u201cThink on it, love. Be certain you want this. I\u2019m offering you everything I am. And if I do say it myself, I\u2019m a lot of man to handle. I\u2019ll protect you fiercely, challenge you daily, and want you nightly\u2014at the least. You won\u2019t be able to manage me the way you manage other men.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled. \u201cOh, I think that\u2019s yet to be decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be a beast, as you\u2019re so fond of calling me. Strong as a bull, stubborn as an ox . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut handsomer than both, thank goodness.\u201d</p> <p>His eyebrows drew together in mock censure. \u201cI\u2019m being serious here. I want you to know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know well what I\u2019ve gotten into. It\u2019s love. And I\u2019ve fallen so deep in it by now, I ought to have a bathing costume.\u201d She caressed his cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be your wife.\u201d</p><p>He clasped her hand to his face, then kissed it warmly. \u201cEven though we\u2019ll reside in London, at least some of the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have followed you to the Pyrenees. London is just up the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be here often, I promise. Christmas, Easter. Every summer, of course, so you can welcome your friends. I know for you, Spindle Cove will always be home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut not for you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re my home, Susanna. My home, my heart, my dearest love. Wherever you are, that\u2019s where I belong. Always.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Six weeks later</p><p>It was good to be home.</p><p>Just returning after a week\u2019s absence from the village, Bram paused outside the red-painted door of the establishment formerly known as the Rutting Bull. Which had been formerly known as the Blushing Pansy.</p> <p>The gilt-lettered sign hanging above the door might be new, but when he threw open the door of what was now the Bull and Blossom, Bram encountered immediate proof that some things never changed.</p><p>His cousin remained a troublemaking idiot.</p><p>The entire tavern had been cleared of chairs and tables. Colin stood with his back to the door, directing men in two opposite corners of the room as they hoisted some sort of soldered frame toward the ceiling, using an elaborate network of pulleys and ropes. Bram had no idea what they were doing, but he knew it couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cHold your ropes, now,\u201d Colin ordered, motioning with both arms like an orchestra conductor. \u201cThorne, pull it a hair or two closer to your corner. Not too far! That space will get smaller once the stage curtains are hung, and we need to leave the fair Salome plenty of room for her dance of the seven veils. Can\u2019t have her skimping and only giving us six.\u201d</p><p>Bram cleared his throat.</p><p>Colin wheeled in a brisk half turn. His countenance was purposely, studiously blank.</p><p>Bram could tell his cousin meant to look innocent.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t fooled.</p> <p>\u201cSalome and her seven veils? What, precisely, is going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Colin shrugged. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, the two men strained and sweated to keep the frame immobile. He viewed their guilty faces. Scheming bastards wouldn\u2019t even meet his gaze. He looked from Thorne, to . . . \u201cKeane?\u201d</p><p>The clergyman\u2019s face flushed red.</p><p>Bram glared at his cousin. \u201cYou\u2019re dragging the vicar into debauchery now? Good God, man. Have you no shame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Shame?\u201d With a gruff noise, his cousin directed the men to secure their ropes. Then he turned back to Bram, wearing a resigned expression and scratching the back of his neck. \u201cBram, you weren\u2019t supposed to be here until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, judging by this scene, it\u2019s a bloody fortunate thing I came early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give you my word. Nothing untoward is going on here.\u201d</p><p>Fosbury walked into the room, wiping floury hands on his apron. \u201cAll finished with the cake, my lord. She\u2019s a work of art, if I do say it myself. Used almond paste for the skin tone; came out lovely. Nice, big bubbies of puffed meringue. Had a difficult time deciding whether to use pink rosettes or cinnamon drops for the nipples, though. When it comes to those, a man does have his individual tastes, you\u2014\u201d The man finally took note of Colin\u2019s frantic \u201cshut it\u201d gestures. His gaze snapped to Bram, and he gulped with recognition. \u201cOh. Lord Rycliff. You\u2019re . . . here.\u201d</p><p>Bram fixed his cousin with an accusing gaze. \u201cNothing untoward?\u201d</p><p>Colin raised his open palms. \u201cI swear it on my life. Now if you\u2019d only\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that moment, a breathless Rufus dashed into the room. \u201cLord Payne, your delivery\u2019s arrived. Where did you want the tiger?\u201d</p><p>This time, Bram didn\u2019t bother waiting for a denial. He lunged forward and grabbed Colin by the lapels. \u201cDidn\u2019t you learn your lesson after that first debacle? This is precisely why I won\u2019t give you a penny to live on elsewhere, you worthless cur. If you wreak this much havoc in quiet little Spindle Cove, the devil only knows what mischief you\u2019d be up to somewhere else.\u201d He gave his cousin a shake. \u201cJust what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanning your stag night. You dolt.\u201d</p><p>Bram froze. Then frowned. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatisfied? Now you\u2019ve ruined the surprise.\u201d Colin raised a brow. \u201cHad it not occurred to you that your men might want to give you a party? Or had you forgotten you\u2019re getting married in a matter of days?\u201d</p><p>Bram shook his head, chuckling to himself. No, he hadn\u2019t forgotten he was marrying Susanna in a matter of days. He\u2019d spent the past month thinking of little else. And having only just returned to the neighborhood after spending a week in London, he was growing damned well desperate to hold his bride.</p><p>What the hell was he doing holding Colin, then?</p><p>Bram released his cousin\u2019s lapels. \u201cVery well. I\u2019m going to back out of this room the way I came. And pretend I never saw this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Colin gave him a helpful shove to start him on his way. \u201cWelcome back. Now get out.\u201d</p><p>Bram abandoned the long, curving lane to Summerfield and decided to walk overland instead, cutting directly across the bands of farmland and gently rolling meadow.</p><p>Just a week since he\u2019d seen Susanna last. Lord, it felt like a year. How had he ever imagined he\u2019d be able to leave her behind while he went to the Peninsula?</p><p>Despite the lingering pain in his knee, he picked up his pace as he crested a sloping, grassy hill. Here his path dropped into a little green valley, traversed by a stream. He cast his eyes downward, in order to choose his steps with care.</p><p>\u201cBram!\u201d</p><p>Whomp.</p><p>Out of nowhere, something launched at him. A soft, warm missile that smelled like a garden and wore a sprigged muslin frock. He was caught off balance on his bad leg, and down they tumbled. He performed some heroic gymnastics to make certain he took the brunt of the fall, hitting the hillside with a dull oof.</p><p>She landed atop him. They tangled together on the ground, here in this small depression. The valley\u2019s low ridges walled out any distant landscape. His whole world was blue sky, green grass . . . and her.</p><p>\u201cSusanna.\u201d Grinning like a fool, he wrapped his arms around her middle and rolled a bit, so that they faced each other, lying on their sides in the tall grass. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d He skimmed a touch down her ribs. \u201cYou\u2019re not hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. More than fine.\u201d Gentle fingers smoothed the hair from his brow. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m seeing double. Two lips, two eyes . . . a thousand freckles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing a little kiss won\u2019t mend.\u201d A smile curved her sweet lips. Then those sweet lips touched his. \u201cI heard you were down in the village, and I couldn\u2019t wait to see you. Why didn\u2019t you come to Summerfield straightaway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to stop in the village first. Had some business with Colin and Thorne. And then I stopped by the forge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to see the blacksmith before coming to see me?\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand between them and waggled his fingers. \u201cHad to fetch this.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fixed on the ring stuck firmly at the second knuckle of his little finger. She gasped. \u201cGoodness.\u201d</p><p>She reached for it, but he teased her by holding the ring back. \u201cSay you\u2019re sorry for doubting me.\u201d</p><p>The iris-blue hue of her eyes was sincerity itself. \u201cI never doubted you, not for a second. I was merely impatient. Whether you go to the forge or to London or all the way to Portugal, Bram . . . I know you\u2019ll come home to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He captured her lips in a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d she said, pushing away. \u201cRing first, kisses later.\u201d</p><p>He harrumphed and muttered something about feminine priorities. He worked the ring loose from his own finger and slid it onto hers, where it rightly belonged. He loved the look of it there, snug and sparkling. \u201cI thought you might like to have a ring made here, since we\u2019ll be spending so much time in Town. This way, wherever we are, you\u2019ll always carry a little piece of Spindle Cove with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bram.\u201d She blinked furiously, as though she were holding back tears. He hoped they were happy tears.</p><p>Suddenly unsure, he pointed out the ring\u2019s features. \u201cI had him use both gold and copper in the band, you see. Because your hair has both shades. And the sapphire reminded me of your eyes. Though your eyes are far more beautiful, of course.\u201d God, this all sounded hopelessly stupid, voiced aloud. \u201cI think Dawes did quality work with it. But if you\u2019d prefer something finer, I can take you to a jeweler in Town or . . .\u201d</p><p>She shushed him. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. I adore it. I adore you.\u201d</p><p>Ring first, kisses later, she\u2019d said. He claimed his forfeit now, taking her mouth in a deep, thorough, passionate kiss. Letting her know just how much he\u2019d missed her, every minute of every hour of every day they\u2019d been apart.</p><p>Some time later, she rested her head to his chest and gave a contented sigh. \u201cDo you know what today is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday, Miss Finch.\u201d He stroked her molten bronze hair. \u201cBut you\u2019re not in the garden.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean the day of the week. I meant, the significance of this particular day.\u201d</p><p>He considered. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . three days before our wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days and two weeks before we move house to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Good Lord, what kind of devilish test was this? \u201cI know. Three days and nine months before the birth of our first child.\u201d</p><p>She laughed with surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I plan to be very industrious on our honeymoon. I hope you\u2019re well rested, because you won\u2019t be sleeping much that first week. You didn\u2019t plan on seeing any of the sights in Kent, did you?\u201d</p><p>They would be letting a country house for a blissful fortnight before moving to London. In Town, he\u2019d arranged a temporary suite of rooms in the best neighborhood\u2014just until Susanna could choose their house. He couldn\u2019t wait to take her to London, as his wife. He looked forward to showing her more of the world, and watching Susanna come into her own.</p><p>\u201cToday,\u201d she informed him, \u201cmarks exactly six weeks since my injury. I am not only rested, but officially healed. And that means . . .\u201d Her hand slid coyly down his chest, and she looked up at him through downcast lashes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be careful anymore.\u201d</p><p>Part of him leaped eagerly at her implication. He did his best to ignore it. \u201cSusanna, you know it\u2019s not a matter of how many days or weeks have passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Daniels paid a call two days ago. He says I\u2019m cleared to engage in any and all activity.\u201d One of her slender legs twined between his, and she pressed an openmouthed kiss to his ear. Her tongue skimmed the delicate ridge. \u201cGuess which activity I\u2019m most eager to resume?\u201d</p><p>Now, that invitation he was powerless to ignore.</p><p>They kissed hungrily, giving and taking in turn. He filled his hands with her, relearning her body. Cupping and shaping her every luscious curve. Her fingers did some bold exploring of their own, and he moaned his encouragement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when she reached for the closures of his breeches fall, he stayed her hand. \u201cReally,\u201d he said, struggling for breath. \u201cIt\u2019s only three more days. I can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve missed you so much. And I\u2019m tired of playing the invalid. I want to feel alive again.\u201d</p><p>A ragged sigh escaped him. How could he deny her that?</p> <p>Arching her spine, she rubbed her body against his. She found his hand where he cupped her stockinged calf and drew his touch upward, past her knee and ribbon garter. All the way up to the silk of her bared thighs and the enticing heat between them.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d She rolled her hips, pressing into his touch. \u201cAnd I need you, Bram. So very badly.\u201d</p><p>They worked quickly then, the two of them. United in purpose and urgency, pushing aside bothersome folds of buckskin and petticoat, until nothing came between them. Nothing at all. At last he slid into her, fitting himself into that tight, sweet place where he knew he belonged, forever.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she sighed, pulling him close.</p> <p>It was very good to be home.</p><p>Afterword</p><p>Regency-era medicine was a bloody business. While doctors surely had good intentions to help their patients, very little was understood about the origins and spread of disease. The preferred treatments of the day\u2014bleeding and purging\u2014had little, if any, real benefit.</p><p>Women\u2019s reproductive health presented an especially difficult puzzle, it seems. In researching Susanna\u2019s character, I read several Regency and early Victorian case histories of young women diagnosed with \u201chysteria.\u201d Their symptoms ranged from moodiness to muscle weakness, headaches to seizures. All manner of feminine complaints were attributed to irregular menstruation or some vague dysfunction of the reproductive organs. Prescribed treatments ranged from the standard bleeding and purging, to the application of pustule-inducing salves and leeches on . . . let\u2019s just say, delicate areas.</p><p>It all made me extremely grateful for my twenty-first-century doctors. But even with the advances in modern medicine, today\u2019s researchers are still striving to understand and cure diseases that affect tens of thousands of women each year. For that reason, I was honored to learn A Night to Surrender would be part of Avon\u2019s partnership with the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, an organization dedicated to raising public awareness, finding a cure, and encouraging women to be their own health advocates.
