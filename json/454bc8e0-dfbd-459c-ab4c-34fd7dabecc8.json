My mom was going to kill me if I was late for dinner again. I was expected to be at home for dinner two nights a week. The two nights that Julia and Jake came over, we\u2019d all have dinner as a family. I should\u2019ve left Black Enterprises earlier, but I had an unexpected visitor and she was smoking hot. One thing led to another, we had sex, and now I was going to be late. I parked the Range Rover and took the elevator up to the penthouse. As I walked through the elevator doors, I headed straight to the kitchen, where I heard everyone talking. Thank God, they hadn\u2019t started eating yet.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d my mom said as she walked over and kissed me on the cheek.</p><p>Something was going on. Everyone was way too happy. Julia smiled as I kissed her on the cheek and I shook Jake\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? I\u2019m sensing there\u2019s a celebration or something.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked at me and grabbed my hand. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant. You\u2019re going to be an uncle.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Congratulations!\u201d I exclaimed as I pulled her into an embrace.</p><p>\u201cThank you, little brother.\u201d</p><p>I reached over and gave Jake a light hug. \u201cCongratulations, bro. Wow. I thought you guys were going to wait a couple of years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. So did we. But it happened, and we couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d Jake smiled.</p><p>I turned to my dad, who was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cWell, looks like you\u2019re going to be a grandpa.\u201d I smiled as I hooked my arm around him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I think one grandchild is enough for now. You reek like perfume and I\u2019m assuming she was the reason you\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was working, Dad. I got the contracts ready for tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, because when I left the office three hours ago, you were almost finished.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>I walked away because I didn\u2019t need his shit. He didn\u2019t understand what I was going through and I was in no mood for a Connor Black lecture. My mom and Julia called us to the table and we all sat down and enjoyed a family dinner. I was happy for Julia and Jake; they were going to make amazing parents. She was glowing, Jake was all smiles, my parents were ecstatic, and I was happy that now there was something other than me on which Connor and Ellery could focus.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t been the model son since Hailey left. I wanted it to work, but she said that with her being in Italy, and me in New York, it wouldn\u2019t. She left to study fashion when she was accepted by one of the top schools of design and was interning with a well-known, up-and-coming designer. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her and the thing that hurt me the most was that she wasn\u2019t even willing to try and have a long distance relationship. She left without even so much as a sorry. My twenty-second birthday was the next week and we had been seeing each other for almost six years. How do you just throw the past six years of your life away? I thought we had something, and I thought that I meant something to her. The more I thought about it, the angrier I became. Well, those days were gone now. I\u2019d never let another woman do that to me. Since she left, I\u2019d partied too much, drunk too much, had sex with every woman that looked my way, and I\u2019d been labeled New York\u2019s Most Eligible Playboy. Much like my dad, women fell all over me. My mom called it the Black Curse. I\u2019d decided that many women were better than just one. No relationships, no strings, no frills, nothing. Just good sex and a sweet goodbye. When one woman left, another stepped into her place.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Collin?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>I looked at her as she stared at me with her blue eyes. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem distant. Your sister asked you a question and you didn\u2019t answer her.\u201d</p><p>The truth was that I was lost in my thoughts about Hailey that I didn\u2019t hear her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Julia. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with pursed lips. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I smiled as I finished eating.</p><p>As I pulled my phone from my pocket, I went upstairs to my room and sat down on my bed. Julia knocked lightly on the door and asked if she could come in.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d I smiled as I held out my hand to her.</p><p>She took it and sat down next to me. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, sis. I\u2019m all right.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a couple of months since Hailey left. Have you talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She made it clear that it would probably be best if we didn\u2019t because it would make things harder. What the fuck ever. I\u2019m over her, and I\u2019m moving on.\u201d</p><p>Julia put her arm around me. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re over her and there\u2019s no way you can be. It hasn\u2019t been long enough, and I know damn well that when you\u2019ve been in a relationship as long as the two of you were, it\u2019s just not that easy to get over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ve wasted the last six years of my life on a bullshit relationship. I won\u2019t ever do that again. I\u2019m exploring, going out, and having fun. I\u2019m doing what I should\u2019ve been doing the past six years instead of being tied down to one girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t mean that, Collin.\u201d</p><p>The truth was maybe I did mean it. I was still angry at her for leaving our relationship behind. I looked at my watch and saw it was time to hit the bar with Aiden. I gave Julia a kiss on the cheek and got up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cListen, I have to go now. I\u2019m meeting Aiden in about thirty minutes. Congratulations again. You and Jake are going to make really great parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Collin, and stay out of trouble,\u201d she said as she pointed at me.</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t promise.\u201d I winked as I walked out the door.</p><p>I walked into the bathroom and brushed my teeth before walking out of the penthouse. I dabbed on some more cologne and, as I walked downstairs, my mom stopped me.</p><p>\u201cCollin, where are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOut with Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can stay home at least one night? We hardly see you anymore.\u201d She pouted.</p><p>\u201cMom, come on. I\u2019m almost twenty-two. The last thing I want to do is hang with my parents when I can go out with my friends. Plus, Dad sees me every day, all day long at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I don\u2019t, and I miss my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mom,\u201d I said as I kissed her on the cheek and stepped onto the elevator. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt bad. I loved my mom so much, and I hated when she made me feel guilty, but fun was to be had and that was exactly what I was going to do; no matter what she said.</p><p>I took a cab to Club S because I knew that I\u2019d be drinking and wouldn\u2019t be able to drive. My dad was in the process of hiring a new driver. Denny had retired; my dad forced him into it because he had some health issues and it was becoming too much for him. My dad seemed to be taking his time with hiring the new driver, and I believed that it was because he couldn\u2019t see anyone else driving him or us around besides Denny.</p><p>Aiden was standing outside Club S, waiting for me, when the cab pulled up to the curb. I got out, we high-fived, and walked inside. The music was blaring and the floor was thumping. It was more crowded than usual tonight and the girls were gorgeous. I was getting hard just looking at them. I walked up to the bar and ordered my usual scotch, and Aiden ordered his whiskey. This club had become our usual hangout over the past couple of months. The girls were smoking hot and they sure knew how to have a good time. I think if my parents knew that I hung out there, they\u2019d be pissed. We sat at the table and kicked back our drinks. This pretty girl kept eyeing me from the bar. When I gave her a wink and a smile, she strutted over to our table and sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really cute.\u201d She smiled.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, babe. You\u2019re pretty cute yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I buy you a drink?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I can buy you one.\u201d</p><p>I raised my hand and signaled for Amber, our waitress, to bring us a couple of shots each. As soon as she set them in front of us, we brought our shot glasses together and then slammed them as fast as we could. After we slammed both shots, she grabbed my hand and led me to the dance floor. As I grabbed her waist, she moved her hot ass up and down my body, causing me to become instantly hard. Her dress was really short, which allowed my hands easy access to cup her bare ass. She welcomed it and threw her head back when I squeezed it. When the song changed, I led her back to the bar for some more shots, and when we approached the table, Aiden already had some hot girl sitting on his lap. The four of us drank more than we should\u2019ve and, before I knew it, we were outside the club and I had my girl\u2019s back pressed up against the side of the building.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to your place.\u201d She smiled as she nipped my bottom lip.</p> <p>I turned around and hailed us a cab that took the both of us back to the penthouse.</p><p>\u201cWe have to be really quiet. My parents are sleeping,\u201d I whispered as I carefully shut the front door.</p><p>She laughed as I picked her up and tried to carry her up the stairs. Needless to say, I stumbled and we both fell. We started to laugh, and I put my hand over her mouth as we got up and went to my bedroom, closing the door softly behind us.</p><p>\u201cCollin, get down here, NOW!\u201d my dad yelled up the stairs.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and went down to his office. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Collin.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed as I crossed my arms. I knew what this was about. It was about the hot brunette I brought home last night. \u201cDad, calm down. She\u2019s a nice girl.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cReally? What the hell is her name?\u201d</p><p>Shit, he put me on the spot. If I remembered correctly, I didn\u2019t catch her name, but if I told my dad that, he\u2019d flip, so I gave her a name. \u201cHer name is Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit! Her name is Renee. Ask me how I know, Collin. Go ahead and ask me,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know her name is Renee, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she introduced herself to me this morning when I was walking down the hall and she came out of your room, naked! Your mom is in the kitchen, ready to kill you. You\u2019ve been out of control since Hailey left and this stops today. Do you understand me? Now get your ass in the kitchen and apologize to your mom, and maybe, just maybe, when I walk back in there, you\u2019ll be alive.\u201d</p><p>My head was already killing me from last night\u2019s alcohol binge and my dad\u2019s yelling made it worse. Now, I had to go and face my mom. The last thing I wanted to do was disappoint her, but lately, that was all I seemed to do. I walked out of the office and straight into the kitchen, where my mom was sitting at the table.</p><p>\u201cSit down, now!\u201d she said with anger in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t you dare say a word until I\u2019m finished saying what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>She pointed her finger at me. Something I didn\u2019t ever remember her doing. She was pissed and she kind of scared me.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re hurting, Collin. I know how hard it\u2019s been on you since Hailey left, but you are way out of control. You go out every night. You come in during the wee hours of the morning, and you reek of alcohol. I don\u2019t appreciate naked girls coming out of your bedroom in the morning. It\u2019s rude, disrespectful, and I won\u2019t have it in my house. What the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>As I looked into her angry, but sad eyes, I hated myself for making her so mad. \u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking, and it\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right; it won\u2019t happen again. Connor, get in here,\u201d she yelled from the kitchen.</p><p>My dad walked in and looked at me. \u201cStill alive, I see.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and my head felt like it was going to explode. My mom got up from her chair and started getting the stuff out for the hangover cocktail she always made. God, I hated that shit.</p><p>\u201cConnor, don\u2019t you have something to tell Collin?\u201d she said.</p><p>My dad looked at me as he sat down in the chair. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that you\u2019re attending the meeting at the office this morning and then, after that, I have some things I need you to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, Dad. Today\u2019s my day off.\u201d</p><p>There was no way I wanted to sit in that meeting with a hangover. I didn\u2019t get much sleep last night, and all I wanted to do was go back to bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed your day off and today isn\u2019t it,\u201d he said as he got up from the chair.</p><p>My mom walked over to me and handed me a glass with the cocktail in it. \u201cHere, my darling son, drink up because you\u2019re going to need to feel a hundred percent before you go into the office.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>My dad sipped his coffee and, as he walked out of the kitchen, he turned around, looked at me, and then looked at his watch. \u201cYou have about fifteen minutes to get ready. I\u2019ll be waiting by the elevator. You better not be a minute late.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Collin,\u201d Valerie said as I walked to my dad\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Valerie. How many more days until retirement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen more days and then I\u2019ll be on my way to Arizona.\u201d She smiled.</p> <p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d I winked.</p><p>I opened the door. Sitting across from my dad\u2019s desk was a very sexy woman dressed in all black. When she turned around and looked at me, all I could picture was her bent over the desk and me taking her from behind.</p><p>\u201cCollin, I\u2019m in an interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad, but I need you to review these when you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>I sat down in the chair next to her and held out my hand. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Collin Black, and you are?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at me as she lightly shook my hand. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Briana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Briana,\u201d I said as I kissed her hand.</p><p>My dad rolled his eyes and got up from his desk. \u201cOkay, Collin, thank you for dropping these off. Now go back to your office and do some work.\u201d</p><p>I gave Briana a wink as I left and shut the door. She was hot and I could tell by the way she looked at me that she wanted me. Valerie shook her head at me as I walked by her desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe apple sure doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\u201d</p> <p>I strutted down the hall as I made my way to Julia\u2019s office. When I opened the door, she wasn\u2019t in there. I heard noises coming from her bathroom. As I walked over to the door, I knocked softly.</p><p>\u201cJulia, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I heard the toilet flush and she came walking out, wiping her mouth with a tissue. \u201cMorning sickness.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cOh. That sucks.\u201d</p><p>I sat down across from her desk as she opened her drawer and took out a mint. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Isn\u2019t today your day off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be, but Dad changed it after last night\u2019s events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI brought a girl home and she came out of my room this morning and ran into Dad in the hallway. Did I mention she was naked?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCollin! What the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Spare me the talk because I already got it from both Mom and Dad, and I\u2019m in no mood. I\u2019m hung over and I\u2019m tired. I don\u2019t understand why I have to be punished for having a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because your good times always end up disastrous.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI would\u2019ve loved to have been a fly on the wall this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeh, whatever. I\u2019m over it. I just want to get this day over with. Anyway, do you have the new plans for the gym?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have them right here,\u201d she said as she handed me the drawings.</p><p>I rolled them up, walked over to her, and gave her a kiss on the head. \u201cI hope you feel better, sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Collin.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I tucked the designs under my arm as I left her office. I tried to do a 180 when I saw my dad walking towards me.</p><p>\u201cStop right there, son.\u201d</p><p>I took in a deep breath as I slowly turned around. \u201cYes, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. After you drop off these plans at the Chicago office.\u201d He smiled. \u201cThe plane is waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha. You\u2019re funny, Dad.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, son, but this is no joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can overnight them. They\u2019ll get there by tomorrow morning,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI could. But I want them there today.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>I shook my head as I grabbed the file from him and walked away in a huff.</p><p>I was upstairs, packing a light bag when my mom knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your dad\u2019s sending you to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. He sure is.\u201d I sighed. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m not feeling well today and he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true, Collin. Do you want me to go with you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a big boy, Mom. I can go to Chicago by myself.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my little boy, no matter how old you are.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her tightly. \u201cI know I will. I love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Text me when you land and don\u2019t argue with me about it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and then I flashed her a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll do better than text you. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Just as I was about to leave, my phone rang. I pulled it from my pocket and saw it was my dad calling.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answered unwillingly.</p><p>\u201cChange of plans, Collin. You\u2019ll be flying commercial because something\u2019s wrong with the plane and the mechanic needs to look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I sound like I\u2019m kidding, son?\u201d</p><p>I stood there, shaking my head in disbelief over this whole thing. \u201cYour flight leaves in two hours. I suggest you get to the airport quickly. Your ticket is already waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>I could hear him loving every minute of this. He was going to make me pay one way or another for bringing that girl home. \u201cFine, I\u2019m leaving now. By the way, when are you hiring the new driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll talk to you later,\u201d he said as he hung up.</p><p>I grabbed my bag and headed downstairs. \u201cNow I\u2019m flying commercial because something\u2019s wrong with the plane,\u201d I said to my mom as I headed towards the elevator.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, sweetheart. Have a good flight,\u201d she said as she kissed my cheek.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and took the elevator down to the parking garage. I climbed in my Range Rover and drove to the airport. As I valet parked, I grabbed my bag from the back seat and ran to the ticket counter. My flight was leaving soon and I still had to get to my gate.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the girl behind the counter asked with a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Collin Black, and there\u2019s a ticket waiting for me for a flight to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to see some I.D., Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>She was hot and she was licking her plump lips. I stood there and stared at her mouth, imagining it wrapped around my cock. She keyed some information into the computer and handed me my ticket with a folded piece of paper. I opened it up and it was her phone number. I looked at her and smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe you can give me a call when you come back to New York,\u201d she said innocently.</p><p>\u201cI think I will.\u201d I nodded as I stared at her and started to walk away.</p><p>I checked my ticket and what the fuck! I\u2019m flying economy class! Are you fucking kidding me?</p><p>As I headed to my gate, I pulled my phone from my pocket and noticed there was a text message from my dad.</p> <p>\u201cI forgot to tell you that first class and business class were all booked up. Enjoy your flight in economy, son.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t even going to respond because he did it on purpose. Jesus, he was really making me pay. I arrived at my gate and walked up to the counter. I flashed my smile and asked the girl if there was any way to upgrade to first class. She looked at her computer and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, but first class is full and so is business class. You made it just in time. We\u2019re starting to board.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and sighed as I picked up my bag from the floor and stood in the long line with the rest of the people waiting to board the plane. I was getting so drunk tonight. I wondered if Ellie was going to be around. I found my seat and squeezed in. At least it was a window seat. This was total bullshit that I had to fly like this. Maybe I\u2019d get lucky and some hot chick would be in the seat next to me. WRONG. It was some snot nose kid who sounded like he was going to hack up a lung.</p><p>\u201cHey, can you cover your mouth when you cough?\u201d</p> <p>He looked at me with knitted eyebrows. \u201cCan you mind your own business, fucktard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mom, kid?\u201d I asked with irritation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Some seat way in the back.\u201d</p><p>He put his headphones in and blasted the music on his iPod. It was so loud, I could hear the rap over the roaring engines of the plane. I shook my head and looked out the window. When it was safe to use our phones, I pulled mine from my pocket and scrolled through my pictures. There was one I didn\u2019t delete of Hailey. It was my favorite picture of her and I just couldn\u2019t get rid of it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that? Your girlfriend?\u201d the kid asked.</p><p>I glared over at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you mind your own business?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrick,\u201d he said as he looked at his iPod.</p><p>I turned my phone to camera status and held it up. \u201cHey, kid, smile.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the kid turned his head, I snapped his picture.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, dude,\u201d he said and then started coughing.</p><p>\u201cJust a memory of my flight.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>I sent his picture to Julia with a text message.</p><p>\u201cDad made me fly commercial and this is who I\u2019m stuck with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOMG! That\u2019s hilarious. Be nice to the kid. Remember, you\u2019re going to be an uncle. I\u2019m surprised that kid is in first class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not. I\u2019m in economy because first and business class were sold out. Fuck this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLOL at dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha. I\u2019m glad you find it funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Have a safe flight. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, sis.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at the kid, who was coughing. \u201cAre you sick or something?\u201d I asked with sincerity.</p><p>He turned his head and looked at me. \u201cYeah, I have cystic fibrosis.\u201d</p><p>I knew what that was because I had to do a power point presentation on it in health class in college. \u201cDude, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pity,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Collin and I don\u2019t give pity.\u201d I smiled as I held out my hand.</p><p>He twisted his face and looked at my hand. He slowly brought his hand to mine. \u201cI\u2019m Jacob Kline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Jacob Kline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said sadly.</p><p>Now I felt sorry for this kid. I understood his rough and tough exterior. It was to hide the sadness he was feeling inside.</p><p>\u201cSo, why are you going to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see another specialist,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head and looked out the window. I felt bad for this kid and I couldn\u2019t believe his mom wasn\u2019t sitting by him. What the hell kind of parent is she?</p><p>\u201cI can switch seats with your mom if you want her to sit here,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNah. You\u2019re cool.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>For the duration of the flight, Jacob and I talked about a lot of things. I told him about Hailey and he told me all about his disease. He said he didn\u2019t have any friends because the other kids were scared of what he had. When the plane landed, I sat in my seat until Jacob\u2019s mom came over to get him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom. This is Collin. He\u2019s my new friend.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Collin. I\u2019m Diana.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>She was an older woman and she looked tired. As we walked off the plane together, I reached in my pocket and pulled out a twenty-dollar-bill and handed it to Jacob.</p><p>\u201cHere, go buy yourself a souvenir from Chicago.\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cWow! Thanks!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you, Collin, but Jacob can\u2019t accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he can. Please, just let him have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You\u2019re a very kind man.\u201d</p><p>Jacob and I high-fived, and I waved goodbye to him and Diana. As I got into my car that I arranged to have pick me up, I noticed Jacob and Diana standing around. Jacob had told me on the plane that he and his mom had no money because she had just lost her job and she was spending what little savings she had on this trip for him. I told the driver to hold on and I got out of the car. I walked over to Diana and asked her to please let me give them a ride to their hotel. She resisted at first, but after Jacob\u2019s pleading, she agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She looked down before answering me. \u201cI was just going to have the cab driver take us to a motel that was the cheapest. This trip happened so fast and at the last minute, I didn\u2019t have a chance to really find something.\u201d</p><p>There was no way Jacob could stay in a dirty motel. Not with his condition. I had an idea.</p><p>\u201cListen, before you shoot me down, let me explain. You shouldn\u2019t be staying in a not-so-clean place with Jacob\u2019s condition. I\u2019ll bring you with me to the hotel I\u2019m staying at, and I\u2019ll pay for your room for as many days as you\u2019re going to be in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Diana put her hand up and immediately got defensive. \u201cNo, absolutely not. No. I won\u2019t allow it. It\u2019s very kind of you, but you\u2019re a stranger and you don\u2019t know us and we don\u2019t know you. Plus, I could never allow it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacob had his head lying on her shoulder and he looked tired. \u201cDiana, listen. Jacob told me that you lost your job and you\u2019re using what little you have for this trip to see the specialist. I\u2019m going to introduce myself and then you\u2019ll know me.\u201d</p><p>I held out my hand. \u201cHi, Diana, I\u2019m Collin Black and I work for Black Enterprises in New York City. I\u2019m here in Chicago to deliver some plans to our Chicago office. My parents are crazy lovers, my sister and her husband are expecting their first child, and my girlfriend of six years left me to study fashion in Italy. Please let me help you out because I really like Jacob and he\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head and stared at me. You\u2019re the son of Connor Black?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Do you know my father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not personally, but I know who he is. He holds charity events every year for children with autism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. See, now you know my family and you know we like to help people. So please, Diana, let me help you and Jacob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents would be very proud of you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThank you, Collin. I promise to pay you back.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out my phone and sent a text message to Ellie.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe. I\u2019m in town. Let\u2019s do some clubbing tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time, Mr. Black. I was wondering when I\u2019d see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, babe. How\u2019s seven o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll be downtown anyway, so I\u2019ll meet you at your hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was a sexy girl and I couldn\u2019t wait to get her into bed again. My phone rang and it was my mom calling. Shit, I forgot to call her when I landed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you alive? You said you\u2019d call when you landed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom. I got distracted,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Collin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Mom. I promise to explain when I get home. Now I have to go. I just arrived at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>The driver took our bags from the trunk and handed them to us. Diana and Jacob stood in front of the Trump Hotel and wouldn\u2019t stop staring at it.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You\u2019ll love this place.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>They followed me inside and up to the desk.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Black. I have your suite ready,\u201d the hotel clerk said.</p> <p>\u201cThank you. I also need to book an additional room for my guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mr. Black. How many nights will your guests be staying with us?\u201d</p><p>I looked over at Diana. \u201cJust two nights,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019re welcome to stay longer,\u201d I spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. After we see the specialist tomorrow, we\u2019re flying back the next morning. I can\u2019t afford to stay in Chicago any longer than necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo nights,\u201d I said to the clerk.</p><p>Diana and Jacob walked over to the glass elevator and stared into it. I leaned over to the clerk and I whispered, \u201cI want you to tell them that the mini-bar in the room is free and so is room service. Just bill everything to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>I called Diana over and the clerk handed her the key. She explained to her how all room service and the mini bar were free to guests.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s free?\u201d she asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a perk of staying at the Trump.\u201d I winked.</p><p>The bellhop walked over and took their bags. Diana hugged me and, with a tear in her eye, she thanked me for all my help.</p><p>\u201cYou be brave tomorrow,\u201d I said to Jacob as we high-fived.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a piece of cake.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>They walked onto the elevator and waved as it took them up to their floor. I pulled my phone from my pocket and called my dad.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. I need you to send the plane to Chicago the day after tomorrow to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin, I bought you a round-trip ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but something happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018something happened\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you telling me that you can\u2019t even fly to Chicago without getting into some kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get into any trouble, Dad. I met someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Collin, I\u2019ve heard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, you have to let me explain. I met a kid. A sick kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked calmly.</p><p>I explained to him about Jacob, and I told him about Diana and how she lost her job.</p><p>\u201cWhat you did for them was very nice, son. I\u2019m proud of you,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. I have to go. I need to get these plans over to the office and then I\u2019m off to meet some friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Bye, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>I walked through the doors of Black Enterprises and, as always, I was warmly greeted by all the ladies. I took the elevator up to Mac\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Mr. McHottie.\u201d She smiled as I walked through the door.</p><p>\u201cYou do know that your flattery will get you some of this,\u201d I said as I grabbed my crotch.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to tell your father that you\u2019re sexually harassing me?\u201d She smiled as she kissed me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cThe sad part is, he\u2019d believe you.\u201d I pouted. \u201cHere\u2019s the plans,\u201d I said as I handed them to her.</p><p>Mac \u2013 Mackenzie \u2013 was the head manager at the Chicago office. She oversaw the entire office and made sure it ran smoothly. She was an older woman and had been working for my dad since he first built the Chicago building and she\u2019d known me since I was a baby. She was hot for her age and we liked to joke around; too bad she wasn\u2019t into guys.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I sat down in the chair across from her desk and folded my arms. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad wouldn\u2019t make you fly the all the way to Chicago unless you did something to piss him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went out, got drunk, and brought a girl home. I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve been a big deal if she hadn\u2019t walked out of my room naked and right into my dad.\u201d</p><p>Mac sat at her desk and shook her head. \u201cCollin Black. Get your head out of your ass! What\u2019s the matter with you? You just can\u2019t bring home a random girl with your parents down the hall. The least you could\u2019ve done was get a hotel room. It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t afford it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I chuckled. \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. I screwed up. It won\u2019t happen again. I really pissed my mom off and that\u2019s the last thing I wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesson learned. I understand the pain you\u2019re going through over Hailey. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there. But, screwing every woman that looks your way isn\u2019t the answer to healing your broken heart.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and sighed. \u201cI know and I don\u2019t want to talk about Hailey. She\u2019s my past and that\u2019s where she\u2019s staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but I want you to remember that everything happens for a reason. It\u2019s hard to see it now, but you will someday.\u201d She winked.</p> <p>I got up from my seat and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t dig guys. You\u2019re missing out on this.\u201d I winked as I grabbed my crotch.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here before I call your daddy.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I pointed before opening the door.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I walked out of Mac\u2019s office and down the hall to the elevators. I heard my phone beep and, when I pulled it from my pocket, I saw there was a message from Ellie.</p> <p>\u201cHey, hot stuff. I\u2019m in the lobby at your hotel. Where the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way, babe. Got held up at the office. Tell the hotel to let you in my room. I\u2019ll be there in fifteen.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I opened the door and didn\u2019t see Ellie. I walked into the bedroom of the suite and shook my head as I smiled and began to unbutton my shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time, hot stuff. I was getting lonely in this big bed by myself.\u201d She smiled as she lay there totally naked.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I\u2019m here now and I can promise you that you won\u2019t be lonely anymore,\u201d I said with a smile as I grabbed the bottle of Jack, took down my pants, and climbed on the bed.</p><p>The ringing sound of my phone was making my head hurt more than it already was. I rolled out from under Ellie\u2019s arm and grabbed my phone from my pants pocket.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you up?\u201d my dad yelled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to head to the office and pick up the plans sometime today. Mackenzie is going to have the changes made and then we\u2019ll be set to move ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cLate night last night, Collin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad. Can I call you back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, son. Call me back when you\u2019re not so hung over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBye, Dad.\u201d</p><p>I set my phone back on the nightstand. I looked over at Ellie as she lay there sound asleep. We went out last night, drank too much, and had sex all night long. I missed Hailey and there was no denying it. Every time I would go to sleep with a girl, I thought about her. That was why I never slept with a girl unless I was drunk. If I was drunk, I didn\u2019t have to think about her. If I was sober, I felt like I was cheating on her, even though she left me. I couldn\u2019t help but think about Jacob and Diana. His appointment with the specialist was today and I thought maybe it would be cool to hang out after. Ellie started to stir when I got up and pulled on my sweatpants. I walked over to the window in the living area and opened the curtains. I looked out as the sun brightened the sky. After a few moments, I walked back into the bedroom and grabbed my phone. I pulled up Hailey\u2019s name and began sending her a text message.</p><p>\u201cHey, how have you\u2014\u201d I started to type. Looking at my half-typed message, I threw my phone down on the couch and ran my hands through my hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, hot stuff?\u201d Ellie said as she wrapped her arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI just have a lot on my mind. I have some things I need to do, so I\u2019m going to take a shower and head out. You can order room service if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll just grab my stuff and go. I had fun last night. How about we do it again tonight?\u201d</p><p>I turned around and looked at her with a small smile. \u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t. I have something else to do tonight and my plane will be here early tomorrow. But, thank you for last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time you\u2019re in town, hot stuff!\u201d She smiled as she kissed me on the cheek and walked back to the bedroom.</p><p>I stepped in the shower and, when I got out, Ellie was already gone. After getting dressed, I went to Diana\u2019s room to see if they left for the specialist yet. There was no answer when I knocked so I walked down to the front desk and left a message for her and Jacob. I had the hotel bring a car around and, when I was on my way to Black Enterprises, Julia called me.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine; why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Dad a few minutes ago and he said you had a late night again and you sounded like shit. I think he\u2019s really worried about you.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about me. I\u2019m fine. So what if I like to have fun. Maybe he should try it some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that Dad sees himself in you when he was younger. You heard the rumors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I\u2019m not him, and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI promise. Now I have to go because I\u2019m at the office.\u201d</p><p>I pressed end and shook my head as I stepped out of the car. As I was walking into the building, Mac was coming out. She looped her arm around mine and turned me around.</p><p>\u201cDid you have breakfast yet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re coming with me, then. I\u2019m starving and we can go over the designs. I spoke with your dad last night.\u201d</p><p>We pulled into the restaurant, ordered breakfast, and, as soon as we started going over the plans, my phone rang. I pulled it from my pocket and it was Diana.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cCollin, it\u2019s Diana. The desk gave me your message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Diana. I was wondering if maybe you and Jacob would like to hang out this afternoon. I thought maybe we could go to the Field Museum. I think Jacob would love it. I know I did when I was his age. Actually, I still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you, Collin, but we don\u2019t want to impose on you. I know you\u2019re a very busy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not that busy and I want to. Jacob will love it. I\u2019ll be back to the hotel in a couple of hours. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Collin. We\u2019ll be here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hung up and Mac was giving me a strange look.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re seeing someone who has a kid?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, I met them on the plane.

Can we get back to going over these plans?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cWOW!\u201d Mom, look!\u201d Jacob pointed as he ran to Sue, the largest and most famous T. Rex on display.</p><p>I let them run ahead as I stayed back and smiled at how excited he was to be here. I knew he would be. My mom and dad used to bring me and Julia here all the time when we were kids. I brought Hailey here once, but she didn\u2019t like it; she said it wasn\u2019t her thing and I was kind of hurt by it because this museum was one of my favorites. I walked over to where Jacob and Diana were standing, and Jacob looked at me with a huge smile on his face. I pulled out my phone and took a picture of Sue, the T. Rex, and sent it to Julia.</p><p>\u201cSue is going to eat you up, Julia!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLol, what are you doing at the museum?\u201d</p><p>I used to say that to her every time we\u2019d come here and she\u2019d get scared and hold onto my dad for dear life. My mom used to tell me not to tease her, but I couldn\u2019t help it. It was the one thing she wasn\u2019t so sure of at the museum, so I used it to my advantage. I asked Jacob and Diana to stand in front of the T. Rex so I could get a picture of them. After I took it, I sent it to Julia.</p><p>\u201cI brought Jacob and Diana here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad told me about them. That was really nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it when I get back to New York.\u201d</p><p>As we entered the Dinosaur Hall and Jacob ran ahead to see the wooly mammoth, I asked Diana about the appointment with the specialist.</p> <p>\u201cHow did the appointment go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as always. There\u2019s nothing really new they can do for him. The doctor gave me a script for a new antibiotic for when Jacob gets another lung infection and he\u2019s going to discuss other optional treatments with his regular doctor in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Diana. I wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet, Collin, thank you. But, Jacob and I will be fine. I\u2019ve been a single parent now for about five years, ever since his dad died in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>God, I didn\u2019t know if I could hear any more. Diana reminded me of my mom. She was strong and she seemed like a fighter. Jacob looked back at us and took both our hands as he led us over to another dinosaur display. After we left Dinosaur Hall, we stopped and grabbed some sandwiches at the Field Bistro. I could tell Jacob was getting tired and he started to cough.</p><p>\u201cMaybe after a couple more displays, we should get going,\u201d Diana said to Jacob as she ran her hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cMom, no, and stop with the hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe your mom\u2019s right, bro. You\u2019re looking kind of tired,\u201d I said.</p> <p>He began coughing. \u201cOkay, maybe I am ready to leave now.\u201d He coughed some more.</p><p>Diana took hold of his hand and we walked out of the museum. My car was waiting for us at the curb. When we got back to the hotel, Diana thanked me and said that she was going to take Jacob up to the room and let him rest while she took a shower. I told her to order room service for the night and meet me at the restaurant in the hotel for breakfast in the morning. Jacob and I high-fived and Diana smiled.</p><p>As I took the elevator up, I pulled my phone from my pocket and decided to send a text message to Ellie.</p><p>\u201cHey, sexy. I need you tonight. How about we get drunk and have wild sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good, hot stuff. Let\u2019s meet at Stingray\u2019s around eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you wear something sexy for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do,\u201d she replied.</p><p>As soon as I stepped into the room, I took off my clothes and got in the shower. I had a few hours before I had to meet Ellie, so after I showered, I took a nap. I dreamt of Hailey. We were at the beach in the Hamptons, playing volleyball and eating burgers. When I awoke, I was sweating. Fuck, I thought to myself as I sat on the edge of the bed with my face in my hands. I got up and got dressed. This was nothing that a lot of alcohol and a hot sexy woman couldn\u2019t fix. As I was fixing my hair in the mirror, Ellie sent me a naked picture of herself. I smiled as I looked at her perfectly round tits. I couldn\u2019t wait to get those babies in my mouth. I was getting hard and I felt the need to jack off to her picture. But then I decided that I could wait until later when I could have her all to myself. I sent her a text message back.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to fuck you deep and hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking forward to it. I have some toys for us to play with.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. When I read that, my cock, which had just started to go limp, shot straight up again. As I smiled and set my phone down, there was a knock on the door. I walked over and opened it.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, son. Going somewhere?\u201d he asked as he made his way into the room.</p><p>\u201cUmm, actually, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll join you,\u201d he said as he set his bag on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing what you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flew all the way to Chicago to see what I was up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he replied as he nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cDad, come on.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as he sat down in the chair. \u201cListen, your mom was worried about you. So, to please her, I told her I\u2019d fly out here and check up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she was so worried, then why didn\u2019t she come herself?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause she had plans with Peyton that she couldn\u2019t cancel. Think of it this way; we\u2019ll have some father-son bonding time.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>I grabbed my phone and sent Ellie a text message.</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe. I have to cancel our plans. My dad just showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring your sexy daddy with you. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. We\u2019ll hook up the next time I\u2019m back in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, hot stuff, but I\u2019ll miss you tonight. I was really looking forward to trying out those toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, babe.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and set my phone down.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You just canceled your plans with either Sarah, Tru, Bella, Ellie, or Riley.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cocked my head and knitted my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell, which lovely girl was it, son?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEllie.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Not his warm, loving smile. His \u201cI know her type\u201d smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to cancel on my account, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, I did. I\u2019m starving. Can we go to dinner?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as he got up and walked out of the room. We went to Joe\u2019s Seafood, one of our favorite restaurants that we usually ate at when we were in Chicago. As we sat down, my dad and I both ordered a scotch while looking over the menu. He leaned back in his chair and shot me that look. The look of him trying to figure me out and I was in no mood for a lecture. I smiled at him as the waitress brought our drinks and took our dinner order. I pulled out my phone and sent a text message to Julia.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Dad is here in Chicago and we\u2019re having dinner right now instead of me clubbing it up with Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLOL. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s there. That way, I know you\u2019ll stay out of trouble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, sis. I appreciate your support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your father/son bonding time, little brother.\u201d</p><p>I sighed as I put my phone away and looked at my dad.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>I opened my eyes and couldn\u2019t believe how bad my neck was killing me. My dad took my bed and told me that I could sleep on the pullout, since he was the one paying for the room. I went to go to the bathroom and he was in the shower. Shit. I grabbed my phone from the table to check my messages. There was a text message from my mom.</p><p>\u201cI hope you had a fun night with your dad. I wish I could\u2019ve come with him, but with Peyton, I couldn\u2019t cancel. I know he felt bad for making you go there to drop off the plans and he was worried about you. I\u2019ll see you later, sweetheart. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>I stood there and stared at the message. So, he was the one that was worried, not my mom. He lied to me, but I knew there was no way he\u2019d admit it. He walked out of the bathroom and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well, son?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I gave him a smile because I knew how much he loved me and Julia. \u201cYeah, Dad. I slept great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. How about some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Diana and Jacob downstairs for breakfast. Please join us. Also, I cancelled their flight home and had the desk refund their ticket. They\u2019ll be traveling home with us on our plane, if that\u2019s okay? It\u2019s sort of what I already had planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s okay, and I can\u2019t wait to meet both of them.\u201d</p><p>He went in the bedroom to get dressed and I stepped into the shower. When we went downstairs to the restaurant, Diana and Jacob were already sitting down. When they saw us walking towards the table, Diana stood up and shook my father\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Black.\u201d She smiled.</p> <p>\u201cThe pleasure is all mine, Diana. This must be Jacob,\u201d he said as he placed his hand on Jacob\u2019s head.</p><p>We sat down and ordered breakfast. Diana was in a panic and said that her flight was cancelled and they were on standby for another flight out of Chicago.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be on standby. You\u2019ll fly home on my private plane.\u201d My dad smiled.</p><p>\u201cMr. Black, I couldn\u2019t. Collin has already done so much for Jacob and me. Really, we can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You\u2019re flying home with us on my plane.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at Diana. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with him. He wins every time. Except when my mom is involved, then she wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try to deny it, Dad,\u201d I interrupted and he chuckled.</p><p>The four of us had a great breakfast and when I glanced at my watch, I noticed it was time to check out. As the bellhop went to our rooms and collected our bags, my dad had his car waiting for us at the curb.</p><p>The four of us stepped onto the plane and Jacob was in awe over it.</p><p>\u201cWOW! This is so cool!\u201d he exclaimed, then began to cough.</p><p>My dad looked at me and then at Jacob. \u201cPick any seat you want to sit in and, as soon as we\u2019re up in the air, Collin will show you where the video games are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have video games on your plane? How awesome! Mom, did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure did, sweetie.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>We all took our seats and, as soon as we were up in the air, my dad and Diana unbuckled their seatbelts and sat down at the round table, while I showed Jacob the video games.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you used to work, Diana?\u201d my dad asked.</p><p>\u201cRogers Media Corp. I was the administrative secretary to Glenn Williams, the Vice President.\u201d</p><p>After setting up the video game system for Jacob, I walked over and joined them at the table. My dad leaned back in his chair and brought his hand up to his chin.</p><p>\u201cI had heard they were going under a while back,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it happened so fast. One day, I went to work and they let everyone go except a few people.\u201d</p><p>Jacob began coughing as he played his game and my dad kept looking at him. \u201cWhat part of New York are you from?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cBrooklyn,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband and I moved there right after we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear about your husband. Collin told me he passed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Black,\u201d she said as she looked down.</p><p>\u201cMy secretary, Valerie, is retiring and I\u2019m currently interviewing for her position. So far, I haven\u2019t been impressed with anyone until now. How would you like to come work at Black Enterprises as my secretary? You\u2019ll get fully paid health benefits and a very good salary. I can guarantee you\u2019ll be making double of what you did at Rogers Media Corp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Black, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m very sure. Come by the office tomorrow morning around nine and I\u2019ll have Valerie show you around.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, Mr. Black, I can\u2019t even begin to thank you enough!\u201d she said as she stood up and hugged my dad. \u201cYou have no idea how much this means.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my dad as Diana walked over to tell Jacob. \u201cThanks, Dad. You\u2019re pretty awesome.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo, son, thank you. You\u2019re the one who found her and helped her. If you wouldn\u2019t have, I still wouldn\u2019t have a secretary.\u201d He winked.</p><p>As soon as the elevator doors opened, I threw my bags on the floor. My mom came from the direction of the kitchen with her arms out to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWelcome home, Collin. How was your trip?\u201d she asked as she hugged me.</p><p>\u201cIt was fine, Mom. It\u2019s good to be back home.\u201d</p><p>She walked over to my dad and gave him a passionate kiss; a long kiss that wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cUgh, will you two knock it off already or take it upstairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me, son; we are right now.\u201d My dad winked.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and grabbed my bags and went to my room. I heard my mom giggling behind me. I threw my bag on the bed and pulled out my phone, noticing a text message from Aiden.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, are you back in town yet? We have some serious partying to do tonight at Tina Brian\u2019s house. Everyone is going to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I just got back. What time is the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Score. That party was exactly what I needed. Tina was a good friend. We occasionally hooked up and enjoyed each other\u2019s company. She wasn\u2019t my type, though. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she was a very nice and sexy girl, but there wasn\u2019t that spark there that Hailey and I had. A spark that I never thought would go away. I sat down on my bed and pulled out a picture of me and Hailey that I hid in my nightstand. Memories of our greatest times together flooded my mind and hurt me like hell. I picked up my phone and pulled up her name. Fuck it! I sent her a text message.</p><p>\u201cHi, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Collin. I\u2019m good. How are you?\u201d</p><p>I wished I could tell her that I was good too, but I couldn\u2019t lie to her.</p><p>\u201cNot good, Hailey. I miss you like hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with that again. You need to move on, Collin.\u201d</p><p>Move on? Was she fucking serious?</p><p>\u201cHave you moved on, Hailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have. I\u2019m sorry if it hurts you, but I\u2019ve met someone.\u201d</p><p>My stomach felt sick when I read that and my heart began to ache something fierce.</p><p>\u201cGood for you. I won\u2019t ever bother you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I believe that we weren\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>How could she be such a heartless bitch? It was like one morning she woke up a completely different person. I didn\u2019t even know who she was anymore. She was not the girl I fell in love with all those years ago. I didn\u2019t respond to her last message. If she believed we weren\u2019t meant to be and she found someone else, then so be it. I wouldn\u2019t lie and say that I wasn\u2019t completely devastated, because I was \u2013 all over again. Her words hurt me more than I ever imagined they would. If she wanted me to move on, then that was what I would do, but I could promise you that I would never allow myself to hurt like that again.</p> <p>I put my hand on the doorknob and, as I turned it and opened the door, I was startled when I saw Julia standing there.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back.\u201d She smiled as she hugged me.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Julia, you scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but you\u2019re the one who opened the door. I was just getting ready to knock. Where are Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think?\u201d I said as I walked out of my room, shut the door, and looked down the hall.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said as she followed me down the stairs.</p><p>I went into the kitchen and Julia sat down at the table. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling okay. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great, Julia!\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. That\u2019s not going to work on me.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes as I poured some juice for us in a glass and sat down across from her. I slid the glass across the table. \u201cJuice?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Now tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is going on, Julia. Why do you keep insisting something is?\u201d</p><p>She put her elbows on the table as she slid the glass of juice back to me. \u201cBecause, I know you and I know the look on your face when something happens. You can\u2019t fool me.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cFine. I sent a text to Hailey and she told me to move on and that she\u2019s met someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Collin, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about what?\u201d my dad asked as he strolled into the kitchen with a big smile on his face.</p><p>I looked at Julia and discreetly shook my head. \u201cOh, nothing, Dad. I was just telling him that I was sorry about Jacob\u2019s illness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. It\u2019s a terrible thing. It\u2019s good to see you, princess.\u201d He smiled as he kissed her head. \u201cAre you two almost ready to go to dinner?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him in confusion. \u201cDinner? I have plans tonight, Dad,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTell that to your mother, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d my mom asked as she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cCollin has something he\u2019d like to tell you.\u201d My dad smiled as he raised his eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Damn it. I could never say no when it came to her. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, Mom. I was just telling Dad that I can\u2019t wait for all of us to go and have a nice dinner. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good. I was afraid you had already had plans for tonight.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do, but not until later. Is Jake coming with us?\u201d I asked Julia.</p><p>\u201cNo, he had to go help his dad with something at the dealership.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my watch. \u201cGreat, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m starving.\u201d I smiled, trying to hurry them up so I could go the party after. I didn\u2019t want to be too late.</p><p>\u201cAre you in some sort of a hurry, son?\u201d my dad smirked.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I\u2019m just really hungry.\u201d I smiled as we walked onto the elevator.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>I kissed Julia and my mom goodbye before leaving the restaurant. Since my dad brought the Range Rover, I had to take a cab to Tina\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time, man.\u201d Aiden smiled as we high-fived.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I had to have dinner with my family. You know how my parents are about family dinners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I sure do. Come on; let\u2019s get our drink on and party!\u201d he screeched.</p><p>We walked inside and straight to the kitchen, where Tina and a few of our friends were gathered around the table doing lemon drops.</p><p>\u201cCollin, get your sweet ass over here and do some shots with us!\u201d Tina exclaimed.</p><p>I needed to forget about Hailey once and for all. Okay, I probably wouldn\u2019t forget about her for good, but at least for tonight, I would after I got rip-roaring drunk. I picked up a lemon drop and held it up.</p><p>\u201cFuck relationships!\u201d I said as I threw the shot down the back of my throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, and here\u2019s to fucking a lot of different women!\u201d Aiden smiled as he picked up another shot.</p><p>As I stood at the table drinking one shot after another, I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and Yasmin stood there and started at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you called me or answered any of my text messages?\u201d she asked with an attitude.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I call you?\u201d I replied.</p> <p>She grabbed my wrist and led me out to the backyard to a spot where it was quiet. \u201cWhat do you mean, Collin? After we had sex, you said it was the best you ever had and that you really liked me.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I was totally wasted that night. I sighed as I looked into her green eyes. \u201cYasmin, sex with you was great, and I think you\u2019re a really sweet girl, but it was only about the sex. You knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know that!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI don\u2019t do one-night stands, you bastard! You told me how beautiful I was and I thought I meant something to you,\u201d she said as tears started to stream down her face.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to stand here and listen to her whine. I needed a beer, and as I began to walk away, she grabbed my arm. \u201cFuck you, Collin Black! You\u2019re nothing but a cold-hearted, emotionless bastard, and I hope you get what you deserve. I really thought you were different from the other guys.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her as she cried. Yeah, I felt bad, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Yasmin, but you thought wrong,\u201d I said as I shook my head and walked away. I went back inside the house as I left her sobbing outside. I grabbed a beer from the cooler and downed it as fast as I could.</p> <p>\u201cWhoa, bro, slow down,\u201d my friend Brett said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d I said as I finished the bottle and grabbed another one.</p><p>I looked at my watch and saw that it was one in the morning. Shit. I had to be at the office by seven for a meeting. The party was still going strong and Aiden was up in one of the bedrooms with some chick. I found Brett and asked him if he could call me a cab so I could get home. He laughed and led me to his car.</p><p>\u201cForget the cab, Collin. I can drive you home. I\u2019m the designated driver for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>I had Brett drop me off in the parking garage so I could take the elevator right up to the penthouse. I stood there and felt sick to my stomach as the elevator went up. Ugh. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to make it. I drank way too much. As the doors opened, I tried to make it up to my room, but stumbled up the stairs and fell. I didn\u2019t care. I just needed to lie down and that was exactly what I did. I passed out at the top of the stairs and slept in the hallway.</p> <p>I felt jabs in my side and when I carefully opened my eyes, I saw my dad staring down at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Collin!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>I put my hand on my forehead and closed my eyes. \u201cDad, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your sorry ass up right now! You reek of alcohol and you need to be at the office in an hour. Go get in the shower and clean yourself up. I don\u2019t have time to deal with you right now. This isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said as he stepped over me and walked downstairs.</p><p>I lay there, my head pounding and vibrating like a train racing down the tracks. I didn\u2019t want to get up and go to the office. I wanted the comfort of my bed for the rest of the day. Suddenly, I felt someone grab my arm.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Collin. Get up,\u201d my mom said as she helped me. She took me into the bathroom and set me down on the toilet. She started the shower and lifted my shirt over my head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom, stop. I can get undressed myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, and your cocktail will be waiting for you when you get out and come downstairs. You better hurry up because your dad is pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I look at you and I don\u2019t even know who you are anymore,\u201d she said with disappointment as she left the bathroom and shut the door.</p><p>I carefully got up and stepped into the shower, letting the hot water stream down my body. I washed up and then got dressed. I walked downstairs and to the kitchen where my dad was sitting at the table and my mom was standing by the counter, holding that shit cocktail I\u2019d come to drink on a regular basis.</p><p>\u201cDrink it now!\u201d she said in a stern voice.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018Mom\u2019 me, young man. You go sit down at the table and don\u2019t say one word. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head and sat down. My dad just glared at me from the opposite side. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this later and you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Dad\u2019 me. Finish your drink and get your ass down to the parking garage. We have a meeting to get to,\u201d he said as he shook his head and got up from his chair.</p><p>After I managed to choke down the cocktail, I put on my shoes and kissed my mom goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always sorry, Collin, and sorry just isn\u2019t cutting it anymore.\u201d</p><p>I stepped into the elevator and looked down as the doors shut.</p><p>Once again, I held my composure in the meeting. Julia kept staring at me from across the table and all I could see was disappointment from her too. It seemed like I couldn\u2019t make anyone happy anymore. Once the meeting was over, my dad told me to follow him to his office. He told me to have a seat and then looked at his watch.</p><p>\u201cDiana will be here soon, so I\u2019m going to make this quick. I think you are one of the smartest people I know, and you have an excellent business sense. You need to get your damn head out of your ass and stop acting like a spoiled rich kid, because make no mistake about it, I will fire you from this company and completely cut you off. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head as I got up from the chair and started to walk away. I put my hands in my pockets and stopped before I reached the door. \u201cHailey told me yesterday that I need to move on and that she\u2019s seeing someone else. Just imagine what it would be like if Mom said that to you.\u201d I slowly opened the door and went to my office. I sat down at my desk, turned my chair around, and stared out the window at the busy city. My head was still pounding, so I opened my desk drawer and took out the bottle of ibuprofen. As I was about to pop some in my mouth, Julia walked in.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey. If you came to lecture me again, don\u2019t bother. Dad just threatened to fire me and cut me off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d never do that to you, Collin,\u201d Julia said as she sat down.</p><p>\u201cA long time ago, I would have thought the same thing. But now, I\u2019m not so sure anymore,\u201d I said as I looked down.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to get some help and talk to someone about Hailey. Go see a shrink.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cYeah, right. I\u2019m not going to see a shrink. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine when you\u2019re drinking. Don\u2019t you see, Collin, alcohol is a band aid, and without it, you won\u2019t stop thinking about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Julia. No one understands what it\u2019s like to walk in my shoes right now. Maybe I\u2019m crazy. Who the fuck knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was your first love and first loves are hard to get over. But you can\u2019t drink your troubles away. Mom and Dad always taught us to deal with our problems head on and find a solution. Alcohol is not the solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk like I\u2019m an alcoholic. I\u2019m not an alcoholic, Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were. I\u2019m just worried about you heading down the wrong path.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed as I got up from my chair and grabbed a bottle of water from the mini fridge. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be fine. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forget your birthday is in a couple of days?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t forgotten and Mom and Dad haven\u2019t mentioned it either.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she got up from the chair. \u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re throwing you a surprise party. Don\u2019t you dare tell them that you know. Jake and I are taking you out to dinner and then back to the penthouse. The only reason I\u2019m telling you is because you\u2019ll go off and make plans and you\u2019ll ruin it for Mom and Dad. So I\u2019m giving you notice right now.\u201d</p><p>I walked over and hugged her. \u201cThank you for letting me know. I would\u2019ve made plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you would\u2019ve.\u201d She smiled.</p> <p>I placed my hand on her stomach and felt the small bump she had. \u201cHow\u2019s my niece or nephew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, and I need to go shop for maternity clothes. I can\u2019t squeeze into my regular clothes anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Mom is really excited to take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. We\u2019re going tomorrow,\u201d she said as she opened the door. \u201cI love you, little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, big sister.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Connor</p><p>I sat at my desk, thinking about Collin and what the hell I was going to do with him. I picked up my phone from the desk and called Denny.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Denny. How are you, friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me; I\u2019m doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoying retirement?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSomewhat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if I can stop by later? I need to talk to you about Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll be here all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>I could always count on Denny to give me the right advice. After all, he always put his two cents in when it came to Ellery.</p><p>I met with Diana and she accepted the position I offered her as my secretary. Valerie spent the day with her and showed her the ropes. I finished up some paperwork and stopped by Collin\u2019s office to see what he was doing and to let him know that I was leaving the building for the day. When I walked in his office, he was standing and staring out the window with his hands in his pocket. He reminded me so much of me at his age.</p><p>\u201cSon,\u201d I said as I walked in.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have somewhere I need to be, so I\u2019m leaving for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll either catch a cab or get a ride home with Julia. You know, you really need to hire someone to replace Denny,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know I do. I\u2019ll see you later at home.\u201d</p><p>I walked out of the building and climbed into the Range Rover and headed to Denny\u2019s house. When I arrived, he was sitting in the backyard. I walked back and gave him a hug. I hadn\u2019t seen him in about a month and I really missed him.</p><p>\u201cSit down and talk to me about Connor Jr.,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sighed as I sat down and took the scotch he already had waiting for me. \u201cWhy are you calling my son that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. I told you that your past would come back to bite you in the ass one day.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cHis heart is broken and he\u2019s partying too much. God knows how many women he\u2019s had sex with already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThe boy has your genes, Connor. Put yourself in his shoes because you\u2019ve been there. You\u2019ve walked in his shoes already. Your heart was broken because you thought you were responsible for Amanda\u2019s death. His heart is broken because the love of his life, or so he thinks she is, left him and left the country. His defenses are up now, just like yours were. He\u2019s killing the pain with booze and sex, just like you did. The difference is, you can help him now. Your father wasn\u2019t there for you and I tried to be the best I could. But, you\u2019ve been there and you can talk sense into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. He won\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know the feeling.\u201d He smiled as he held his glass up to mine. \u201cI think you need to come clean with your son and tell him about the list of rules you had in place for your women.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him in horror. \u201cThere is no way in hell I\u2019d share that with my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep outside your perfect box, Connor. Collin is hurting something awful. He\u2019s doing the same thing you did. You need to make him see that it\u2019s wrong, and if he continues walking that line, he\u2019ll regret it. You were a miserable bastard until the day you met Ellery. You need to tell him about Ashlyn and what she did to you and your family. You never know, he could run across a psycho bitch like that himself if he keeps up his ways.\u201d</p><p>I threw back my drink. \u201cI\u2019ve already thought about that. The difference is I was more responsible at his age where work was concerned. I threatened to fire him and cut him off today if he didn\u2019t straighten up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that really a wise move? Just be there for him, Connor. What does Ellery say about all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s upset and she\u2019s worried about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Black, and he comes from an outstanding and loving family. He\u2019ll be okay. But he will need your guidance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, old man.

Maybe I\u2019ll even have a few words with him.\u201d He winked.</p><p>I got up from my chair, gave him a light hug goodbye, and drove home.</p><p>I was in the kitchen having coffee when Collin came downstairs.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Collin,\u201d Ellery said as she kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mom. Dad,\u201d he said as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need to go upstairs and change your clothes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you and I are going to play golf today.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at me strangely. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to the office. We\u2019re going to skip work today and spend some father/son time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said in shock. \u201cOkay. Does Julia know?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDoes Julia know what?\u201d she said when she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHello, princess.\u201d I smiled as she walked over and kissed me.</p><p>\u201cDad and I aren\u2019t going to the office today. We\u2019re going to play golf instead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood for you!\u201d She smiled. \u201cMom and I are going maternity clothes shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like the Black family is playing hooky today.\u201d Ellery laughed.</p><p>I got up from my chair and wrapped my arms around her. Even after all these years, her scent still drove me crazy. I brought my lips closer to her ear as I whispered, \u201cWe can play hooky together later. All night, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello! Children in the room!\u201d Julia yelled.</p><p>Ellery and I laughed and kissed each other goodbye for the day. Collin and I climbed into the Range Rover and headed to breakfast before tearing up the golf course.</p><p>\u201cI love the omelets here,\u201d Collin said as he took a bite.</p><p>\u201cThis was always your favorite place to eat breakfast.\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>Collin looked at me as he took a sip of his coffee. \u201cOkay, Dad. Confess. Yesterday, you were about ready to fire me and cut me off and today, you\u2019re taking me to breakfast and golfing. What\u2019s up? Are you going to lecture me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>I sat there and listened to my father spill about his past. His women, his stalker, and the reason he was the way he was. I was blown away when he told me about his rules. It was hard for me to hear. I could see why I reminded him of himself. He saw almost the same behaviors in me that he once had. I felt sorry for him. I felt sorry that I had pushed him far enough that he had to relive his past. I told him that I was okay and not to worry. He could tell I wasn\u2019t and said that he\u2019d worry, no matter what.</p><p>\u201cOne day, son, you\u2019re going to meet the love of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to break this to you, but no, you haven\u2019t. Hailey wasn\u2019t the love of your life and you\u2019ll finally understand when you meet that special person.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter what he said. Hailey was the love of my life and nobody could tell me otherwise. They weren\u2019t inside my heart and they weren\u2019t inside my head. Nobody had any clue as to how much I loved that girl and still did. After breakfast, we golfed for most of the day. It was great to spend the day with my dad. But no matter how much time I spent with someone else, Hailey was always still front and center in my mind.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about your birthday,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom and I have to attend a charity function that we can\u2019t get out of. So we\u2019re going to take you out the day after.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself because if I hadn\u2019t already known, I\u2019d actually believe him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia and Jake are taking you to dinner, so don\u2019t make any plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>He gave me a strange look and continued to golf. We finished up our game and then headed home where we took my mom, Julia, and Jake to dinner. After dinner, I came home and spent the rest of the evening with my mom and dad. That made my mom smile and it felt good to make her happy.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, my darling baby boy,\u201d my mom said as she walked into my room and kissed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI made you all your favorite breakfast foods. So get dressed and come downstairs.\u201d</p><p>I reached over and grabbed my phone from the nightstand with the hope that Hailey had at least wished me a happy birthday. Disappointment washed over me as I scrolled through all my text messages and not one of them was from her. I climbed out of bed, showered, and dressed before heading down to eat the wonderful breakfast my mom prepared for me. I put on my fake smile as I entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMom, it smells great in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Sit down and I\u2019ll bring you your plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, son.\u201d My dad smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>My mom set down a plate of eggs and French toast and then took her seat next to me. \u201cI feel so bad that we won\u2019t be able to take you out tonight.\u201d She pouted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, Mom. We can do it another night. It\u2019s not that big a deal. I\u2019m a big boy now.\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you\u2019ll be with Julia and Jake tonight.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I thought to myself. As much as I loved my family, the only person I wanted to spend my birthday with wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>I spent the rest of the day at the office, catching up on work that I\u2019d been slacking on over the past few weeks. I decided that maybe it was time for me to throw myself into my work because this was going to be my company one day and I wanted to be just as successful as my dad, plus I wanted to make him proud of me.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, bro.\u201d Jake smiled as we shook hands.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said as I sat down at the table.</p><p>The three of us had a great dinner and I couldn\u2019t wait to get home and really start drinking at my party. If there was a night that I needed to get drunk, tonight was it. The whole day had passed and not one word from Hailey. Once again, she had managed to break my heart and I let her. When dinner was over, I climbed in Julia\u2019s and Jake\u2019s Range Rover and they took me back to the penthouse.</p><p>\u201cNow remember to act surprised,\u201d she warned me.</p><p>The elevator doors opened and, suddenly, the lights went on and everyone yelled \u201cSurprise.\u201d A wide grin graced my face as I took a step back and pretended to be in shock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOMG! I can\u2019t believe you did this.\u201d I smiled at my mom and dad.</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised, sweetheart?\u201d my mom asked with a big smile.</p><p>\u201cSurprised isn\u2019t the word for it, Mom. Wow. Thank you both so much.\u201d</p><p>After my mom and dad hugged me and my mom gave me twenty-two birthday kisses, Peyton walked up to me and held out her arms.</p> <p>\u201cHappy birthday, Collin,\u201d she said as she kissed both my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peyton. Where\u2019s Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way. He got held up with a patient. I don\u2019t think I need to ask how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>I took in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m hanging in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for Hailey\u2019s behavior, but I want you to know that my feelings for you will never change. I love you very much and nothing my daughter does will change that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you too, Peyton. Thank you.\u201d I smiled. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m in need of a scotch.\u201d</p><p>I walked away and to the bar where the bartender poured me a scotch. As I took a sip, I heard a voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re having a happy birthday, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Denny, it\u2019s good to see you. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, son. But let\u2019s not talk about me. The question of the evening is how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile because I felt a lecture coming on. I remembered growing up and listening to him lecture my dad all the time. He had a certain tone in his voice that he used right before the lecture. He wasn\u2019t looking well and I knew my dad was overly worried about him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me and let\u2019s go sit down,\u201d he said as he put his arm around me and led me to the couch where no one was sitting. \u201cYour dad is worried about you and, frankly, so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Uncle Denny. I\u2019m fine. There\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because you\u2019re boozing it up and having sex with women all over the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Denny, keep it down,\u201d I said as I looked around.</p><p>He chuckled loudly. \u201cYou sure are your father\u2019s son. One day, my boy. One day, she\u2019ll sweep you off your feet. And trust me, it won\u2019t be Hailey. She was never \u2018the one\u2019 anyway and someday, you\u2019ll finally realize that. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go talk to your mom.\u201d</p><p>He got up and left me sitting there, speechless. I could guarantee I had the same look on my face that my dad always did.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Collin. It\u2019s time to blow out your birthday candles.\u201d My mom smiled she led me into the kitchen.</p> <p>Everyone gathered around, sang \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d and clapped as I blew out twenty-two glowing candles.</p><p>\u201cDid you make a wish, son?\u201d my dad asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I was celebrating my birthday on the outside, but on the inside, I was a broken man with a void so deep that any emotion or feeling would get lost and never be found. After I cut the first piece of cake, I handed the knife to my mom and walked over to the bar to fill up on scotch for the night. I just needed to feel numb this last time. Tomorrow would be different. But for tonight, I needed to forget.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Three Months Later...</p><p>After my birthday and some serious thought, I decided to tone it down a bit. When I say that, I meant that I was more careful about what I was doing. I didn\u2019t get as drunk on weeknights anymore because I was solely focused on Black Enterprises and my job. But I sure as hell made up for it on the weekends. I partied starting at six o\u2019clock Friday night until eight p.m. Sunday. I went to clubs, friends\u2019 parties, and had a lot of sex. I hated to admit that I also broke some hearts. These women knew it was for one night only, so it wasn\u2019t my fault or problem if they couldn\u2019t understand that. As far as my parents were concerned, I was starting to turn my life around and becoming a more responsible adult. But I couldn\u2019t fool Julia. She knew me all too well and there were some nights I spent down in her and Jake\u2019s apartment because I didn\u2019t want my parents to see how drunk I was. Overall, I was having fun. I was finally starting to get over Hailey because the more women I slept with and then left afterwards was working for me. I had the best of both worlds, an amazing job and many women at my side any time I snapped my fingers. I didn\u2019t need to be tied down in a relationship. My heart was healing and, for the first time since Hailey left, I felt good. My new motto in life: No tied-down relationships make for a happy man.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Diana. Is he in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is, Collin.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI sent a text to Jacob last night and he didn\u2019t text me back. Is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He had a friend over last night and they were playing video games. He probably just forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad the little guy is making new friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s really helped since I was able to put him in that private school. Thanks to you and your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d I winked.</p><p>I opened the door and saw my dad turned around in his chair, staring out the window.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He turned around and looked at me. \u201cYeah, son. Everything\u2019s fine. I was just thinking about Denny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean you\u2019ve hired a new driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, son, I have. You know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d I asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ve hired Ralph from the transportation department.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. \u201cYou mean Ralphie?\u201d</p><p>My dad gave me a stern look. \u201cYes, and don\u2019t call him that. He\u2019s a very good employee and has been for many years. I think he\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cIf you say so. He\u2019s no Denny, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will never be another Denny,\u201d my dad said as he turned back around and stared out the window.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Daddy. Good morning, little brother,\u201d Julia said as she walked into the office.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, sis. Wow. You look bigger than yesterday!\u201d</p><p>She lightly jabbed me in the shoulder. \u201cJake and I are going for the ultrasound today and want to know if you and Mom want to come with us?\u201d</p><p>My dad\u2019s eyes, which were just filled with sadness a few moments ago, lit up when Julia asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would love to go with you, princess.

You and Mom can meet us at the doctor\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll have Ralph swing by the penthouse to pick up your mom.\u201d</p><p>I started laughing again and Julia couldn\u2019t help but laugh as well.</p> <p>\u201cYou two kids are terrible people. I hope you know that,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>I got up from my chair and kissed Julia\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. I have a meeting to attend and some files to go over before I start my weekend. You better call me and tell me if I\u2019m getting a niece or nephew.\u201d I pointed at her as I walked out of the office.</p><p>As I was finishing up the last of the paperwork that needed to be reviewed, my phone rang. It was Julia.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to have a nephew!\u201d Julia said with excitement.</p> <p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s great news, Julia. Congratulations. Mom and Dad must be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. Dad got all teary-eyed and Mom burst into tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet they did. That\u2019s awesome. I can\u2019t wait to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to dinner now. Do you want to meet us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ve got plans for tonight. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Stay out of trouble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that.\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>I shut down my computer, grabbed my briefcase, and headed out of the building to start my weekend. I was heading to the beach house and Aiden and I were going to check out a new club that had just opened up close by. I didn\u2019t have to worry about my parents showing up this weekend because they were heading to Chicago tomorrow.</p><p>As I pulled into the driveway, Aiden was sitting in his car, waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time, man,\u201d he said as he got out and high-fived me.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I had to finish up some work at the office before I headed out and then I got stuck in a shitload of traffic.\u201d</p><p>I inserted the key into the lock and opened the door. I took my bags straight up to my room while Aiden planted himself on the couch and waited for me.</p><p>\u201cDude, I have to shower first. Order us a pizza. I\u2019m starving,\u201d I yelled down the stairs.</p><p>After I showered and put on some clothes, I walked downstairs. \u201cDid you order it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. It should be here in a few minutes,\u201d Aiden replied.</p><p>A few moments later, there was a knock on the door. I grabbed my wallet and was caught off guard by a beautiful girl when I opened the door. A big smile splayed across her face when she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your pizza. That\u2019ll be twenty dollars, please,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>I pulled out thirty and handed it to her. \u201cHere, keep the extra ten for your tip.\u201d I winked.</p><p>She bit down on her bottom lip as she thanked me. She began to walk away and then stopped and turned around. \u201cI normally don\u2019t do things like this, but would you like to go out later?\u201d</p><p>Damn! I hadn\u2019t been here an hour yet and already I had a date! \u201cSure. My friend Aiden and I are going to that new club that just opened up over on Northpoint. We\u2019ll be there around nine if you want to meet us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun. I\u2019ll ask my friends if they want to go. Can I have your number and I\u2019ll text you when we get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, hand me your phone.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I punched my number under her contacts and hit save. \u201cBy the way, what\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAlexis. And you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later, Collin.\u201d She smiled as she walked her fine body back to her car.</p><p>I shut the door and took the pizza in the kitchen. \u201cSmooth. Very smooth, bro. I didn\u2019t see her. Was she hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah, she was hot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be careful, man. Tina told me the other day that a few of her friends said that you\u2019re a douchebag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would they say that?\u201d I asked as I grabbed the paper plates and set them on the table.</p><p>\u201cTwo of her friends you slept with are upset with you because you never called them back.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAnd? They shouldn\u2019t be surprised. They know me and how I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust saying, bro.\u201d He smiled. \u201cLove them and leave them. The Collin Black way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave them, yes. Love them, no,\u201d I said.</p><p>After we ate our pizza, we sat on the couch, watched some of the hockey game, drank a few beers, and then headed to the club.</p><p>\u201cHey, I thought we\u2019d never find you in here. This place is packed,\u201d Alexis said.</p><p>\u201cHey. Thanks for coming.\u201d I smiled as I lightly hugged her.</p><p>She looked smoking hot in her short, tight, white skirt, black tank top, and black high heels. I introduced her to Aiden and she introduced me to two of her friends. We hung out, drank a lot, and danced. Alexis could move. I wondered how she would look dancing on a pole. I was getting hard just thinking about it. Her firm legs wrapped tightly around the pole as she slid around it.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d I said as I grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the club.</p><p>There was a long hallway where the restrooms were and, at the end, there was a door on the left with a sign that said \u201cstorage.\u201d I turned the knob and, surprisingly, the door opened. I led her inside and shut the door. There was a dim light that hung overhead.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing in here?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get you alone. I\u2019ve been watching your hot body all night.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me. My hands traveled to her enormous breasts, and, as I squeezed them firmly, her hand made its way down the front of my pants.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I moaned as I broke our kiss and my tongue traveled down her neck.</p><p>I lifted her shirt over her head and unclasped her bra, feeling her bare tits in my hands.</p><p>\u201cOMG. I\u2019m going to come already,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moaned as I kneaded her tits.</p><p>I took one hand and cupped her pussy from underneath her skirt.</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t touch me down there. I only want you to touch my tits.\u201d</p><p>I moved my hand back up to her breasts as she stroked my hard cock up and down firmly. I really needed to fuck her and she wasn\u2019t going to allow me yet. I took down my pants as she continued stroking me. My lips wrapped themselves around her hardened nipple and, as I lightly sucked them, she let out a loud moan and tightened her body. She came. I couldn\u2019t believe she came like that. I looked up at her and she smiled at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to suck you off now.

I\u2019m not ready for that yet. But I\u2019ll suck your cock until you come. That\u2019s what I always do to guys and they don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>This girl was weird and I was losing my hard-on faster than the speed of light. \u201cYou know what? Just forget it. I\u2019ve lost the mood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m positive,\u201d I said with a frown.</p><p>I needed to get out of there quickly. I pulled up my pants, buttoned them, opened the door, and quickly walked down the hallway back to the bar. Alexis followed quickly behind me. When I reached the bar, Aiden held up his hand to high-five me. I shot him a look as I sat down at the bar.</p><p>\u201cBro, what\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t you score?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. That chick is weird. I need a drink.\u201d</p> <p>I held up my hand to get the bartender\u2019s attention and then ordered a double scotch. Aiden was eyeing some girl over in the corner and finally got up the nerve to go talk to her. As I downed my scotch, I heard Alexis from behind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go, Collin. We\u2019re hitting another club. One we\u2019re more familiar with. Do you want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good right here. Have fun.\u201d I smiled and secretly wished that she\u2019d get the hell away from me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks again for....well, you know.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I gave her a fake smile back and she and her friends disappeared. I rolled my eyes as I ordered another scotch. A while later, Aiden came up to me and told me that he was taking the girl he\u2019d met home and that he could drop me off at the beach house first. I told him that I wasn\u2019t ready to leave and that I\u2019d catch a cab home. I wasn\u2019t anywhere near drunk enough to leave.</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>Amelia</p><p>It was a beautiful night for a walk on the beach. I needed to think and clear my head, and walking along the water always helped. It was dark out, but the way the moonlight glistened over the ocean water was magical. I looked around at some of the boxes stacked in the kitchen and my eyes filled with tears. It was an exhausting day and I needed to relax. If that was even possible anymore. I walked out the patio door and hit the warm sand. The light breeze that swept across my face felt calming, and as I took in a deep breath of the salt water air, I began to relax. The water swept across my feet as I held up my dress so the bottom didn\u2019t get wet. The water was my life at one time, and now, it was just a distant memory that filled my heart with sadness and despair.</p><p>As I walked, I couldn\u2019t stop looking up at the stars in the sky. Orion shined brightly. My star gazing came to an end when I tripped over something and fell to the ground. After I realized what I\u2019d done, I looked at the man I\u2019d tripped over. He was lying face down in the sand.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. Are you okay? I didn\u2019t see you. It was completely my fault.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer me, so I poked him. \u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move and I started to panic. I inched my way closer to him and rolled him on his back. His faced glowed in the moonlight and I couldn\u2019t help but stare at him. I leaned closer and put my ear to his mouth to make sure he was breathing. His breath reeked of alcohol and that was when I knew he was passed out. I got up, brushed the sand off my dress, and started walking away. Could I just leave him there like that? I pondered with the thought of trying to wake him up and asking him where he lived. Oh well, if he drank that much that he passed out in the sand, then that was where he belonged. I began walking back in the direction I came and stopped when I heard him moan. I turned around and stared at him lying there, in the sand, drunk and helpless. I walked back over to him and shook him by the shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you need to wake up now!\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at me. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he slurred.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who tripped over you. You\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t break anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, my fucking head. The beach is spinning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what you get for drinking so much. Are you from around here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He turned his head and then pointed up to the house that wasn\u2019t too far from where we were at.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your house? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>He nodded his head as he tried to sit up, but then fell back down. \u201cCome on; let\u2019s get you home,\u201d I said as I tried to pick him up. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re going to have to help me. Get on your knees and I\u2019ll grab your arms to help you up.\u201d</p><p>He did what I asked and I carefully helped him up. He stumbled and almost knocked both of us over. But I held on tight. I put my arm around his waist and his arm around my neck.</p><p>\u201cJust take slow small steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t just leave you all night on the sand.\u201d</p><p>He kept stumbling and complaining that he felt sick. I told him that he better not throw up or I\u2019d drop him and he could spend the night outside. When we made it up to the patio, I opened the door and helped him inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go now. You\u2019ll be safe here in your house.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from me and gave me a small wave before he tripped up the steps and lay there. I rolled my eyes as I walked over to him and helped him climb up the stairs one by one. When we reached the top of the stairs, I asked him which room was his. He pointed straight ahead. I helped him to his bedroom and made sure he lay down on the bed. He yawned, and when I went to walk away, he grabbed hold of my hand. I turned around and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I lightly smiled as I put my hand on top of his. \u201cI bet you say that to all the girls.\u201d</p><p>I walked out of the room and felt the hand he grabbed. It felt like he was still holding it. I could still feel his soft fingers wrapped around my hand. Before leaving, I stopped in the family room and looked at the numerous pictures that were displayed all over the room. His mom was beautiful and his dad was extremely handsome. Now I could see where he got his good looks from. His sister was beautiful as well. Looking at what a beautiful family they were tore my heart to pieces. Tears began to swell in my eyes as I headed back to my house as fast as I could.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I moaned as I rolled over and tried to open my eyes. I lay there on top of the comforter, fully dressed, wondering how the hell I got here. As I moved my hand across the bed, I felt something. Sand. How the hell did sand get in here? Shit, I hated when I drank so much that I couldn\u2019t remember. I dragged myself out the bed and down the stairs to make a cup of coffee. I looked at the clock and it was noon. I popped a k-cup in the Keurig, grabbed a mug from the cupboard, and hit the brew button. I kept shaking my head because I kept smelling the scent of roses. I looked around the kitchen, trying to figure out where it was coming from, but there weren\u2019t any roses to be found. I grabbed hold of my shirt and held it up to my nose. Sure enough, it was on me. What the hell happened last night? I took my cup, went upstairs, and took a shower. When I was finished, I picked up my shirt from the floor and sniffed it one more time before throwing it in my bag. The smell was nice. It was the scent that a woman would wear. Maybe some kind of perfume or lotion. Who was I with? I sighed as I made another cup of coffee and took it outside and down to the beach, where I stood and watched the waves crash against the shore. I took my phone from my pocket and looked at the date. Today was Hailey\u2019s birthday. I wasn\u2019t going to let it bother me and I wasn\u2019t going to send her a text message either. She\u2019d moved on, I\u2019d moved on, and after everything that happened, we couldn\u2019t be friends. As I stared at my phone, I heard a voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGlad to see that you won\u2019t be tripping anyone today.\u201d She smiled as she jogged by.</p><p>She kept going and I didn\u2019t understand what she meant. \u201cExcuse me?

This girl that smelled like roses intrigued me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you all right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>I kicked the sand with my foot as I looked down in embarrassment. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have one wicked hangover. You were passed out cold. I was surprised I even managed to get you in the house and up the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me to my bed?\u201d I asked in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cI did. I didn\u2019t think you should spend the night on the beach. Anyway, I have to go. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re up and feeling better.\u201d She smiled as she turned and started jogging away.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cDo you live around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorner house, on the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name? Or should I just call you the girl who tripped over me?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Amelia.\u201d She laughed lightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Collin.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Collin, aka, the guy who tripped me on the beach.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled as she jogged down the beach. Wow, I thought to myself. What a great girl.</p> <p>My phone began to buzz in my hand. I looked at it and there was a text message from Aiden.</p><p>\u201cBro, I met the most fantastic girl. Going out with her tonight, if you want to tag along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, have fun. I think I\u2019m going to stay in tonight.\u201d</p><p>I walked back up to the beach house and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Amelia. Her smile and her scent stayed with me and I thought about her for the rest of the day. I needed to pick up a few things from the store, so I hopped into the Range Rover and drove to the local market.</p><p>My phone buzzed with a text message from Aiden.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come out with us tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I texted back.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t paying attention and ran into the cart that was in front of me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said as I looked up and saw Amelia staring at me.</p><p>\u201cFirst you trip me on the beach and now you practically run me over with your cart in the grocery store,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d I began to laugh. \u201cI was texting my friend and I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t see me. You had your eyes focused on your phone and not what\u2019s straight ahead of you. If you\u2019re going to text while pushing the cart, at least stop and text.\u201d</p><p>She liked to go on little rants. She made me smile and no one had done that in a very long time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I ran into you, literally.\u201d I chuckled. \u201cI want to thank you for thinking enough of me to not let me spend the night on the beach. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for spending the night on the beach, under the stars. Just not passed out drunk. I was hoping that you\u2019d have dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and her eyes diverted down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cBecause I just can\u2019t,\u201d she said as she began pushing her cart down the aisle.</p><p>I grabbed my cart and caught up with her. \u201cOh, I see; your husband or boyfriend wouldn\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a husband or boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Whew, I thought to myself. She\u2019s single. That\u2019s good. \u201cThen why can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She stopped her basket and turned and looked at me. \u201cLook, Collin, you seem like a really nice guy, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she\u2019s not interested. That\u2019s impossible. \u201cOkay, so you\u2019re not interested. I\u2019m not interested either. All I want to do is thank you for helping me into the house last night and to apologize to you for hitting you with my cart.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why women think that when a guy asks them to dinner, they automatically think we\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, men usually are,\u201d she said with a twisted face.</p><p>\u201cWell, not me. I think you\u2019re a nice girl and all I want to do is thank you. What\u2019s the big deal with that? Am I trying to have sex with you? No way. Do I want a relationship with you? No way. Would I like to show my gratitude as a new friend? Yes way.\u201d</p><p>She stood there and stared at me while she chewed on her bottom lip. She was trying to figure me out.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019ll have dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you. How about I cook for you at my house? I\u2019m really not up for going out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me because I\u2019m not up for going out either. Maybe I can help you cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll cook for you. Remember, it\u2019s my thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She smiled. \u201cHow about I bring dessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like that.\u201d I smiled back. \u201cDo you eat meat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I eat meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m going to cook us some steaks. Do you have any food allergies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh. At the rate I\u2019m going with you, I would probably cook something that you\u2019re allergic to and I\u2019d send you into anaphylactic shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not allergic to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll finish up shopping and see you at my place around seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then, Collin.\u201d</p><p>We smiled at each other as our carts went the opposite way. I smiled all the way through the store. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I made sure I had everything, right down to a couple bottles of wine. I set the table for two and threw the steaks in the pan. As I put the final touches on the salad, the doorbell rang. I looked at the clock and it was seven already. As I walked to the door, my heart began to race.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said almost without breathing.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said. She held a covered plate and a bag in her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d I said as I grabbed the bag.</p> <p>\u201cDessert. I brought brownie sundaes. I hope you like chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love chocolate. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the kitchen and set the plate of brownies on the counter. I put the gallon of ice cream in the freezer and the caramel sauce on the counter.</p><p>\u201cIt smells delicious in here,\u201d Amelia said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m making us pan-seared tenderloin steak with a sauce, steamed broccoli, baked potato, and a Caesar salad. But first, we\u2019re going to start with marinated shrimp scampi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhere did you learn to cook like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nanny, Mason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a nanny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, and he was the best. He was an amazing cook and taught me and my sister everything he knew. Now, do you like red wine or white wine? Because I have Pinot or Merlot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPinot is fine.\u201d</p><p>She looked so beautiful. She wore a cute white sundress that made her tan glisten and she wore her long, blonde hair straight. She stood about five foot nine with a petite frame. I found myself staring at her more than I should have. I poured the wine into our glasses and told her to step out onto the patio.</p> <p>\u201cI thought we could eat out here, since it\u2019s a beautiful night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a beautiful night.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>She sat down with her wine and I brought out the shrimp scampi.</p><p>\u201cThat looks great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Wait until you taste it.\u201d I winked.</p><p>I stared at her blue eyes as I took a sip of my wine. I was feeling overwhelmed by her; a feeling I hadn\u2019t had in a very long time. Actually, I wasn\u2019t really sure I\u2019d ever felt like that. She took a bite of the shrimp and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWow, Collin. This is amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as I nodded my head.</p> <p>I got up from my seat and walked into the house to get the rest of our dinner. I was nervous that she wasn\u2019t going to like it and then think I was a total idiot. Maybe I should\u2019ve just taken her out to dinner.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it again. Wow! This food is amazing. You have to be a chef. You\u2019re a chef, right?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a chef, but I do like to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man after my own heart.\u201d She smiled as she put her hand over her heart.</p><p>I held up my glass and motioned for Amelia to do the same. \u201cThank you, Amelia, for being so kind to me last night, and also, please accept my apology for running you over with my cart today.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as we brought our glasses together. \u201cThank you for this wonderful dinner and I accept your apology for tripping me and running into me.\u201d</p><p>I winked at her and we continued to eat our dinner. There was an aura about her that made me happy when I was with her. After we finished with our meal, we both went into the kitchen and made brownie sundaes. I was startled when I heard the front door open. I looked up and gasped when I saw my mom and dad walking into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOh, excuse us, son. We didn\u2019t know you were having company tonight.\u201d My dad smiled.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad, what are you doing here? I thought you were in Chicago?\u201d I asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cWe decided to go next weekend instead,\u201d my mom said. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Ellery Black, Collin\u2019s mom.\u201d She smiled as she held out her hand to Amelia.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Amelia.\u201d She smiled back as she shook my mom\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Connor, Collin\u2019s dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, I\u2019m sorry if we interrupted something,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have called first,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, we thought you\u2019d be out for the night. You actually surprised us.\u201d</p><p>I turned to Amelia. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had no idea that they\u2019d be coming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine. I would give anything to have my parents walk in right now.\u201d</p><p>I picked up on a sadness in her voice when she said that. I didn\u2019t want to ask her any questions about it since my parents were here and she\u2019d probably tell me that it was none of my business.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s grab a blanket and have our sundaes down on the beach,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Amelia smiled.</p><p>\u201cCollin, we\u2019re really sorry. We can leave. Right, Connor?\u201d my mom said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Mom. We\u2019re going down to the beach.\u201d</p><p>My dad handed me the blanket, and Amelia and I grabbed our sundaes and took them down to the beach. As I spread the blanket on the sand, she handed me my sundae and we sat down, facing the ocean. The water was calm and the light breeze was soothing.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me your last name,\u201d I said as I looked over and gave Amelia a small smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to until I heard your last name. You\u2019re going to laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is it Black?\u201d I asked jokingly.</p><p>She set down her sundae and stuck out her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Mr. Collin Black. I\u2019m Amelia Jean Gray.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head and smiled as I shook her hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Miss Gray.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as we both laughed. \u201cI told you that you were going to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now that I got your last name, tell me something else about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to tell. My name is Amelia, and I think that\u2019s all you need to know. When people start telling things about each other, a bond forms, and that\u2019s something I\u2019m not interested in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not even interested in being friends?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFriends? I don\u2019t have any friends. I gave up on any friendships I had a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Something was going on with this girl. She was broken and she had the same sadness about her that I once had, or maybe still had.</p><p>\u201cYou just did it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d she asked as she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cTold me something about yourself and didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, then, maybe I need to stop talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You can do whatever you want, but I\u2019m going to tell you about me.\u201d</p><p>She let out a light laugh and gave me a strange look. \u201cAnd what makes you think that I want to know anything about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you do or don\u2019t. I\u2019m going to tell you anyway.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI live in New York City and I work for my dad at Black Enterprises. He\u2019s grooming me to take over his company when he retires. I have a sister whom I adore and she\u2019s going to have a baby; a boy, in fact. I graduated from Columbia with a degree in business and I have a lot of friends. Friends who I count on for support when things aren\u2019t going right in my life. I party too much; something that I\u2019m changing, and at those parties, I tend to drink too much. But you already knew that when you tripped over me last night.\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you telling me all this? And for the record, you tripped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You should\u2019ve been paying attention to where you were walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking up at the stars because I love them and they soothe me. You shouldn\u2019t have drank so much that you passed out on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9, Amelia. Touch\u00e9.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She looked away, but with a smile. I was responsible for her smile and I felt good about that. I bumped my shoulder against hers and she bumped me back. \u201cFine, Mr. Black. Come to my house tomorrow morning at nine o\u2019clock and bring me coffee and breakfast. We can sit and talk some more. I\u2019m leaving the day after tomorrow,\u201d she said as she got up and began walking towards her house.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you leaving to?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d she yelled back.</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York.\u201d</p><p>I watched her walk up the beach. I didn\u2019t want her to leave, but I\u2019d have to settle for seeing her tomorrow morning. I got up, picked up the blanket and the sundae cups, and headed back up to the house. Now I\u2019d have to explain to my parents who she was and how I met her. If I lied about it, they\u2019ll eventually find out, so I better just tell them the truth.</p><p>\u201cBack already?\u201d my dad asked as I walked in the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Amelia had to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she live around here?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>\u201cDown the street. Corner house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Nobody\u2019s been living in that house for the last two years. The people who owned it bought it, moved some stuff in, and then they hadn\u2019t been back. Are you sure that\u2019s where she lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell us how the two of you met and when?\u201d My mom smiled.</p><p>And there it was. I knew it wouldn\u2019t take long. \u201cDo you really want to know the truth, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want the truth, Collin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpill it. Now!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFine, but you can\u2019t get mad at me,\u201d I said as I raised my hands. \u201cAiden and I went to a new club last night. I drank too much, passed out on the beach, and Amelia found me and brought me in the house and up to bed. Okay, she didn\u2019t find me; she tripped over me and then, today, at the grocery store, I hit her, by accident, with my cart. So I invited her to dinner as a thank you and an apology.\u201d</p><p>My mom looked at my dad and smiled. \u201cI already love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about that story that sounds familiar.\u201d My dad smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo you like her?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s a nice girl. She isn\u2019t interested in relationships or friendships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, sounds familiar,\u201d my dad said as he raised his eyebrow at my mom.</p><p>She smiled at him and that was enough for him to lean over and kiss her. A kiss that turned into a make-out session.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed. I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d I said as I rolled my eyes and went up to my room.</p><p>The next morning, I was up bright and early. I didn\u2019t get much sleep because I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Amelia all night. Damn it. What the hell is going on? I walked downstairs and saw my dad sitting outside on the patio, drinking coffee.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Dad. You\u2019re up early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, son. I\u2019m always up early. Your mom is still sleeping. I think I wore her out last night.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cDad, seriously. I really think you say this stuff on purpose,\u201d I said as I sat down.</p><p>He chuckled before taking a sip of his coffee. \u201cYou really like Amelia, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I could tell the moment we walked in last night that you were different, and then when you came back from the beach, you seemed really happy. I haven\u2019t seen that look from you in a very long time.\u201d</p><p>I stared straight ahead as I contemplated whether or not to tell him how I was feeling. \u201cThere\u2019s something about her, Dad. Something that affects me in a really good way.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at me and smiled. \u201cI know that feeling. You do whatever it takes to get her if you really like her. If you need my help, just ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. But I don\u2019t think stalking her will accomplish much.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey, it worked for me.\u201d He winked.</p><p>I got up from the chair and put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cI have to go and grab breakfast and coffee for her. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun, son.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>I drove up the driveway and threw the Range Rover in park. I grabbed the large brown bag and the two coffees I bought at the caf\u00e9 about a mile away. Before I even made it to the porch, Amelia opened the door. God, she looked amazing and my heart started to beat a little faster.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on time.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always on time.\u201d I smiled back as I handed her the brown bag.</p><p>When I walked into her house, I was shocked by all the boxes that sat around; sealed and marked. There was no furniture downstairs except for the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s like an obstacle course in here. Don\u2019t mind the mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to ask her what was going on, but I was afraid she\u2019d tell me off. I set our coffees down on the table and sat in the chair while she opened the bag. She looked at me and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou got a lot of stuff in this bag.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou failed to mention what kind of breakfast foods you liked, so I had to guess.

Then she pulled out the Styrofoam containers that had the quiche slices in them.</p><p>\u201cI like everything in here. You did good, Black.\u201d She opened a drawer and pulled out paper plates and plastic silverware. \u201cI only have paper and plastic. I hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. So, I take it you\u2019re moving,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what gave you that idea.\u201d She winked.</p><p>Oh man, she was getting me hard and this needed to stop. \u201cYou said last night that you would give anything to have your parents walk in. Are your parents no longer around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gives you the right to ask that? I barely know you and you have no right!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>I put my hand up. \u201cWhoa, Amelia. I\u2019m sorry. You told me to come over and we could sit and talk. Listen, you obviously changed your mind, so I\u2019m just going to go and you can go about your business. I\u2019m sorry that I was just trying to get to know you a little better,\u201d I said as I got up from my chair and walked to the front door.</p><p>\u201cWait. Collin, I\u2019m sorry. You don\u2019t understand. Please stay,\u201d she said as she walked up behind me.</p> <p>I took in a deep breath. There was a desperation in her voice when she asked me to stay. I turned around and looked into her sad blue eyes. I desperately wanted to grab her and hold her tight.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d she said as she clasped her head. \u201cMy parents owned this house. They were killed two years ago in a boating accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d I whispered as I walked closer to her.</p><p>She put her hands up and stopped me. \u201cDon\u2019t. I don\u2019t want your pity,\u201d she said as she walked back to the table and sat down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I had no idea. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said as I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cSit down and finish your coffee and breakfast. I\u2019m sorry for being so rude. I don\u2019t like to talk about it and I\u2019ve closed myself off since the accident. I gave up my friends and I pretty much stay secluded in my apartment, except when I go to classes.\u201d</p> <p>I sat back down and grabbed a bagel. \u201cClasses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI attend NYU and I live in an apartment on campus. I\u2019m going into my last year and it\u2019s been really hard for me to focus.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzed in my pocket. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said as I pulled it out and saw a text message from Julia.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about this lovely girl you met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance yet. We just met. Let me guess, Dad told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he said you seemed to really like her. I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited yet. I\u2019ll talk to you later. I\u2019m with her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I can\u2019t wait to hear all about her. Love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove you too, sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, that was my sister, Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. Never apologize for taking a moment to talk with your family.\u201d</p><p>As I took a bite of the bagel that I was holding in my hand, I contemplated what to say to her next. \u201cListen, Amelia, I\u2019m going to be totally honest with you. I don\u2019t know what to say because I don\u2019t want to upset you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and gently put her hand on my arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I make you feel that way.\u201d</p><p>Her touch sent chills throughout my body. It was the way her soft fingers touched my skin. I found myself staring at her lips. I pictured myself kissing her and I wondered what it would be like. The one rule I always followed was the no kissing rule. The women I slept with never touched my lips. To me, kissing was special and passionate and it wasn\u2019t to be shared with just anyone. I\u2019d watched my mom and dad kiss a million times growing up and it was always full of passion. It symbolized their love for one another. Hailey was the only girl I\u2019d ever kissed, and ever since we broke up, my lips hadn\u2019t touched another woman\u2019s. But as I sat there and stared at Amelia, I felt this overwhelming urge to kiss her. I wanted to feel how soft her lips felt against mine.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I snapped out of my daydream and smiled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just staring at me. Why?\u201d</p><p>Shit. She noticed and I had to come up with something fast. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to be figured out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very forward, Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re very closed off, Miss Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave up on life after the accident. Everyone and everything that I ever loved was taken from me. Not only my parents, but my sister and my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I looked down because I didn\u2019t want her to see the hurt that I felt for her in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of moving on when you\u2019re alone and you have nobody to share anything with? Like I said, I gave up all my friends. Or should I say, they gave up on me. They could only take so much of my constant crying and refusal to leave my apartment before they left me. I don\u2019t blame them, though. I\u2019m not a good person to be around.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I needed to touch her, and I needed to comfort her. I reached across the table and grabbed her hand. Her eyes widened as she looked at me, but she didn\u2019t pull back.</p><p>\u201cYou are a good person, and I won\u2019t sit here and let you wallow in self-pity. Come on, I\u2019m taking you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Amelia,\u201d I said as I pulled her from the table. \u201cYou said you\u2019re leaving tomorrow. We have all day today and you\u2019re going to have fun with me, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. You\u2019re being bossy and I don\u2019t like it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are, and you\u2019re being stubborn and I don\u2019t like it!\u201d I replied.</p><p>She stood there for a moment and stared at me. \u201cI have too much to do,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI promise to help you with everything once we get back.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cFine. Let me go get my purse and then we can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Amelia. You might want to change into more casual clothes. A dress isn\u2019t appropriate for what I\u2019m planning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, okay. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>As she was upstairs changing, I looked around the first floor. It seemed that she had everything packed and ready to go. I walked over to a desk that sat in the corner of the living room. It was an antique and my mom would love it. I picked up a picture of her and a guy. I assumed it was her boyfriend. They looked really happy, like Hailey and I once did. Such a tragedy and such loss for someone so young. I had a feeling that she would tell me more in time. I set the picture down and walked back to the foyer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>I drove us to Deep Hollow Ranch to go horseback riding. My mom and dad took me and Julia there when we were kids. I hadn\u2019t been there in a few years because Hailey didn\u2019t like horseback riding. I wanted to share this with Amelia and I hoped that she would enjoy it.</p><p>\u201cA ranch?\u201d she asked as we pulled up the dirt road.</p><p>\u201cI hope you like horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love horses, but I\u2019ve never been on one.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at her when she said that. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been horseback riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I spent my life in and on the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, today\u2019s your lucky day because you\u2019re going horseback riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you one favor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be okay if I rode with you instead of my own horse? I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I was going to suggest that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she opened the door and got out. I watched her as she took in a deep breath of fresh air. I looked straight ahead as Murray walked towards us.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well. Collin Black. I haven\u2019t seen you in years, buddy,\u201d he said as we lightly hugged.</p><p>\u201cMurray. Good to see you, friend. This is Amelia.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Amelia,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou riding the horses today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sure are. But only one horse. Amelia\u2019s never been horseback riding, so she\u2019s going to ride with me first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFollow me to the stable. I\u2019ll set you up with Majestic. She\u2019ll be perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>We followed him to the stable and he took Majestic from her stall. Murray saddled her up and I climbed on first. Amelia looked a little nervous as she stared at the horse.</p><p>\u201cCome here, sweetheart,\u201d Murray said. \u201cMake friends with her first if it\u2019ll make you feel better. Talk to her and pet her. You\u2019ll feel more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Amelia walked to the front of Majestic and started petting her. She ran her hand down her mane and said hi to her. I looked down at her and smiled as she looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think so.\u201d</p><p>She put her foot in the stirrup as I helped her onto the horse. She sat behind me and I told her to hold on. The minute she wrapped her arms around me, a feeling overtook me that I\u2019d never felt before. I couldn\u2019t describe it.</p><p>We rode along the shoreline of the white sanded beach. It was breathtaking and I missed this. I was happy to be able to share this with Amelia.</p><p>\u201cCollin, this is beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve really missed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop coming here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy ex-girlfriend hated horseback riding and she would never come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe really missed out.\u201d</p><p>The smile never left my face as the light wind swept across us as we rode down the beach. I took it slow and easy with Majestic because I didn\u2019t want to frighten Amelia. After about an hour, I thought Amelia would like to take over.</p><p>\u201cHow about we switch spots and you take over?\u201d I said as I stopped the horse.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked with excitement.</p><p>I got off the horse and told Amelia to scoot up. She had a smile on her face that I\u2019d never forget. Her blue eyes were full of light and happiness. It was the first time since we met that I saw her like this. I climbed back on behind her and told her to grab hold of the reins. I told her what to do and then I placed my hands on her hips. She looked back at me and smiled as Majestic started walking.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThis is amazing. I love horseback riding. Thank you, Collin. Thank you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re enjoying it and you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>We rode for about another hour. I grabbed the reins and I told her to hold on.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Majestic!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>The horse began to gallop and I yelled, \u201cWoohoo!\u201d Amelia held onto my arms tightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. This is great.\u201d She smiled as she turned her head and looked at me.</p><p>We rode back to the ranch. As I climbed off, I grabbed Amelia\u2019s hand and helped her down.</p><p>\u201cWell, what did you think?\u201d Murray asked as he walked up to us.</p><p>\u201cI loved it!\u201d Amelia replied.</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s what I like to hear.\u201d</p><p>I shook Murray\u2019s hand and he told me not to be a stranger. He also told me to send my mom and dad over to the ranch for a visit. We walked back to the car and the clouds started to roll in.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s going to rain,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the restaurant before it starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRestaurant?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I am.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cGood. Me too. I\u2019m taking you to my favorite place.\u201d</p><p>We were seated at a quiet little corner table at Nick and Toni\u2019s. As Amelia looked over the menu, she asked me what was good.</p><p>\u201cThey have the best chicken here with the best roasted garlic potatoes I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI love chicken, so I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>The waitress brought us each a glass of wine and took our order. I looked at Amelia as I held my glass up to her.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to an amazing and fun day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing is right.\u201d She smiled as she brought her glass up to mine.</p><p>\u201cCan I have your phone number?\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>She looked at me while she bit down on her bottom lip. \u201cAre you going to call me sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning on it, but only if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a moment and she just looked at me from across the table. \u201cYeah, I would like you to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hearing her say that made me the happiest person in the world. I took out my phone and programmed her number as she rattled it off to me. I pushed dial and her phone rang. She pulled it from her small purse and looked at me with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cHi. Now you have my number in case you ever want to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Our food was brought to the table and we both hung up our phones. Amelia enjoyed the chicken and the white chocolate panna cotta that I ordered us for dessert. We finished, and the minute we stepped outside, it started to pour. We ran to the car and I stood there, feeling my pockets for my keys. They weren\u2019t in there.</p><p>\u201cCollin, we\u2019re getting soaked,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cI left my keys on the table.\u201d</p><p>I ran around to the other side of the Range Rover, grabbed her hand, and told her to stand under the overhang while I ran inside. The hostess was kind enough to have my keys waiting for me the second I walked in. I walked back out and smiled at Amelia as I took her hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to try this again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI sure am.\u201d</p><p>We ran to the Range Rover and the rain was coming down harder than before. I quickly opened the door for her and she climbed in. I got in on my side, shut the door, and we both started laughing at each other. We were soaked. My hair was dripping and my jeans were sticking to me. I didn\u2019t have a towel in the car, but I grabbed a sweatshirt from the back seat and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cHere, dry yourself with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin your sweatshirt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s only water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said as she took the sweatshirt from my hand and wiped my face with it and then set it down.</p> <p>Her bare hand touched the side of my face as she looked into my eyes. I softly smiled as I placed my hand on hers and leaned in closer, our lips almost touching. My damn phone rang. I sighed as I apologized to her and pulled it from my pocket. It was Hailey. Why the fuck was she calling me? I hit ignore and looked at Amelia.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Wrong number,\u201d I said as I started the Range Rover and pulled out of Nick and Toni\u2019s.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Hailey\u2019s phone call as I drove Amelia back to her place.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Collin, for a wonderful day. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to run home and change out of these wet clothes and then I\u2019m coming back to help you like I promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Did you think I was lying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But you just seemed really distracted after your phone rang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Everything\u2019s good and I\u2019ll be back real soon.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you in a while.\u201d</p><p>I watched her run to the door as the rain continued to fall. I pulled out of her driveway and drove down the street to my house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soaked!\u201d my mom said as I walked in.</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m home to change clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hurry up and go change. I don\u2019t want you catching a cold,\u201d my mom said. \u201cThen come back down. I want to hear all about Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom. I don\u2019t have time. I\u2019m helping her with her things. I\u2019ll tell you both about it later. Dad, are you and Mom going back to the city tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you better be as well. You have to be in the office in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d I said as I ran up the stairs and changed out of my wet clothes.</p><p>Once I was dry, I ran back down the stairs and told my mom and dad what Murray from the ranch had said. They both smiled and said they might head up there later. I kissed my mom on the cheek and drove back to Amelia\u2019s house. When I opened the door, she was walking down the stairs, carrying a large box.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait for me?\u201d I asked as I took the box from her.</p><p>\u201cIt was the only one left upstairs, so I figured I\u2019d just bring it down.\u201d</p><p>I set the box on the floor in the hallway against all the others. \u201cWhat are you doing with all these boxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe realtor is calling Goodwill to come and take them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in any of them that you want?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I went through everything before I packed it all up. I really need this house to sell. I\u2019m running out of money quickly. When my parents died, there wasn\u2019t a will or trust or anything, so all of this, and all of their accounts went into probate. By time my father\u2019s debt was paid off, this house was all that was left. Apparently, my parents were in some financial trouble. Anyway, this house is going up for sale tomorrow morning and now I just have to wait for someone to buy it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cReal estate can be tricky. If you get an offer, have either me or my dad look it over. I don\u2019t want you getting screwed,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. But I won\u2019t get screwed. I have a very good agent.\u201d</p><p>I walked over and clasped her shoulders. \u201cJust be smart.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and cocked her head, narrowing her eyebrows. \u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m not smart?\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant. I think you\u2019re very smart, but there are a lot of people out in the world that like to take advantage of others. Now, tell me what needs to be done still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Nothing,\u201d she said as she turned away from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018nothing\u2019? You said earlier that you had way too much to do and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want to go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I was just saying that because I was trying to get out of going out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said as I frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Collin. But I\u2019m glad I chose to go because I had a really good time.\u201d</p><p>My frown turned into a smile when Amelia said she\u2019d had a good time. I looked out the window and noticed the rain had stopped and the sun was shining.</p><p>\u201cHey, would you like to go and grab some coffee? We can walk to the Starbucks that\u2019s around the corner. The rain stopped and the sun is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said as she put on her shoes and we walked out the door.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>We took our coffees from the counter and sat down at a table in the corner. The past couple of days had been the happiest I\u2019d had in a long time. I really liked Amelia and I wished we had more time to spend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou never told me what you\u2019re studying at NYU,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m studying to be a nurse.

Nursing is a good field to get into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad always said that I\u2019d make a great nurse. I remember when I was a little girl, I\u2019d ask him if he could pretend that he broke his arm or cut himself just so I could bandage him up. I\u2019ve always been interested in taking care of and helping people.\u201d</p> <p>She was starting to open up to me and I really enjoyed it. The softness in her voice was sweet and she had a gentle way about her. The feelings that I had fought for so long were starting to emerge and that only meant one thing: heartache. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the kiss we almost shared in the car earlier in the day. I kept replaying that moment in my head and if Hailey wouldn\u2019t have called, it would\u2019ve happened. Damn her.</p><p>\u201cSo you go back to New York tomorrow?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I start classes the day after tomorrow. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I have to be at the office tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, something hit me. \u201cI didn\u2019t see your car. How did you get here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI took the bus,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can drive with me back to the city tomorrow morning.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, really. There\u2019s no need for you to waste your money on bus fare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Collin. I owe you one.\u201d She smiled gently at me.</p><p>We finished our coffee and took a walk back to her house. I didn\u2019t want to go, but I also didn\u2019t want to overstay my welcome. \u201cWell, I guess I better get back to my house. I\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow morning around seven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I turned around and walked out the door. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You too,\u201d she said.</p><p>I climbed into the Range Rover and drove back to my house. My mom and dad weren\u2019t home, so I assumed they probably headed to the ranch to visit Murray. I pulled out my phone and noticed there was a text message from Hailey.</p><p>\u201cHey. I tried to call you, but you didn\u2019t answer. I was just wondering how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Why all of a sudden did she care? Every time I had called her, she blew me off or told me to move on. I set my phone down on the counter without responding to her. The last thing I needed was her stirring things up inside me. I was moving on with my life. A life without her in it and that was exactly how I wanted it. I lay down on my bed and scrolled through my pictures. When Amelia and I went horseback riding, I took a picture of us on Majestic. I smiled when I saw her smile. She had a pretty smile. It sort of reminded me of my mom\u2019s. I decided to call Julia.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis. How are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Collin. The question is how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m in trouble,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat now? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went and met a girl and I think I\u2019m seriously falling for her.\u201d</p><p>I heard her laugh. \u201cHow is that being in trouble? I think it\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t want to go through that again, Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Collin. It\u2019s time for you to move on and apparently, you have. This girl obviously has something special if you like her. Just go with it. If it was meant to be, it will be. Love will find its way to you. It can\u2019t be helped and it can\u2019t be stopped. Now stop being a baby and let things happen naturally.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at her last comment. \u201cI have to go. I think I hear Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the office tomorrow, little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Julia.\u201d</p><p>The truth was that I didn\u2019t want to think about Amelia anymore. I closed my eyes and decided to take a nap.</p><p>I awoke to the sound of my phone beeping. I looked at the clock and realized that I\u2019d been asleep for over two hours. I picked up my phone and there was a text message from Amelia.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s Amelia. I\u2019m going to take a walk on the beach and thought maybe if you weren\u2019t doing anything, you\u2019d like to join me. I\u2019ll walk past your house. If you want to join me, be on the beach. Just not where I can trip over you. Don\u2019t reply back.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at her message. I wondered why she didn\u2019t want me to reply back. I thought that was strange. I got up, fixed my hair, and went down to the beach. I couldn\u2019t believe she actually asked me to join her on her walk. It didn\u2019t matter. I was happy that she did. I sat in the sand and watched the waves lap against the shore as I waited for Amelia. I turned my head and smiled when I saw her in the distance. My heart picked up its pace and, for some reason, nerves started to set in. As she walked closer to me, I got up and met her. She had a beautiful smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you got my text,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou told me not to reply.\u201d</p><p>She laughed lightly and we both walked along the shoreline. \u201cThanks for joining me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for asking.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>As we were walking, she looked down at the sand. I so badly wanted to hold her hand, but I didn\u2019t want to cross any lines. The sun had already set and darkness was starting to settle upon the water. She talked to me a little bit about NYU and I told her about my experiences at Columbia.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea. Why don\u2019t we go back to my house and build a bonfire. We can roast marshmallows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we make s\u2019mores?\u201d she asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou bet. I\u2019ll have to see if we have the stuff, but I\u2019m pretty sure we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not, we can run to the store and buy them,\u201d she said.</p><p>We walked back to the house and into the kitchen to look for the chocolate bars, graham crackers, and marshmallows. We didn\u2019t have any graham crackers. Shit.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d I said as I pulled out my phone.</p><p>\u201cAre you on your way home to the beach house or the city?\u201d I texted my mom.</p><p>\u201cThe beach house. We\u2019ll be home in about five minutes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you and Dad stop at the store and pick up a box of graham crackers? Amelia and I want to make s\u2019mores, but we don\u2019t have any crackers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we will, sweetheart. How fun!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I sure hoped she didn\u2019t think she was joining us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem solved. My parents are on their way home and they\u2019re stopping at the store to pick up the graham crackers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents seem really amazing.\u201d Amelia smiled.</p><p>\u201cThey are. You\u2019ll really like them. While we\u2019re waiting, let\u2019s go get that bonfire started.\u201d</p> <p>We walked back down to the beach where my dad had put in a fire pit years ago. Memories of Hailey and me sitting by the bonfire began to flood my mind. The only difference was, this time, I didn\u2019t care and it didn\u2019t bother me. Once I got the fire going, I ran into the house and got the skewers and the marshmallows. I handed Amelia one and we both put them over the fire.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done this in years.\u201d She smiled as she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun and it\u2019s nice to share it with someone.\u201d</p><p>I decided that I was going to ask about the picture I saw of her and her boyfriend. I needed to know her story and I hoped that I wasn\u2019t crossing the line.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was at your house earlier, I saw a picture on the table of you and a guy. Was that your boyfriend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t talk about him,\u201d she said as she looked away.</p><p>\u201cOur situations are different with the ones we lost, but my girlfriend of six years left me to study fashion in Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally different situations, Collin. You can\u2019t even compare the two,\u201d she said as she went to get up.</p><p>I took hold of her wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. I just asked a question. A simple yes or no would have been fine.\u201d</p><p>She sat back down and stared at me before speaking. \u201cYes, he was my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the accident, Amelia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she said.</p><p>We sat there in silence for a few minutes until I heard my mom and dad walking towards us.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, son. One box of graham crackers. Hello, Amelia. It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d My dad smiled.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. and Mrs. Black. It\u2019s good to see you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call us Connor and Ellery,\u201d my mom spoke.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to join us?\u201d Amelia asked.</p><p>Oh my God, I couldn\u2019t believe she just invited my parents to sit down. I looked at them and gave them the look.</p><p>\u201cAs much as we\u2019d love to, Amelia, Ellery and I are heading back to the city now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. We thought it was best to head back tonight. Don\u2019t forget to lock up when you leave in the morning. I can expect you in the office around eight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be late. I\u2019ve offered to drive Amelia back to NYU so she doesn\u2019t have to take the bus. We\u2019re leaving at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, okay then. I\u2019ll see you when you get there. Come straight to my office because we have to go over the proposal for the new building for Tricho Enterprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Dad, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you attend NYU?\u201d my mom asked with a smile as she sat down.</p><p>My dad lightly grabbed her arm and helped her up. \u201cCome on, baby; leave them alone. You can talk to Amelia another time. I really want to get on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Fine, Connor,\u201d she said with irritation. \u201cIt was nice to see you again, Amelia. You\u2019ll have to have dinner with us at the penthouse sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ellery, and it was good to see you too.\u201d</p><p>My dad winked at me as he and Mom turned around and headed back to the house. I could tell I upset Amelia by asking about her boyfriend. That wasn\u2019t my intention. I just wished she\u2019d open up to me. I decided to tell her about Hailey. I didn\u2019t know if it was such a good idea, but I was willing to take the chance. I put two marshmallows on my skewer and held it over the fire.</p><p>\u201cMy ex-girlfriend, Hailey, and I had known each other since we were babies. My mom and her mom are best friends. We started dating each other when we were around sixteen and things became pretty serious. We both graduated from Columbia and she was offered an internship in Italy to study fashion. I was cool with that because I believed that our love was strong enough to withstand the long-distance relationship. She didn\u2019t. She came to me one day before she left and told me that we weren\u2019t meant to be and that long distance relationships don\u2019t work. She said she was sorry, but it was time for her to move on and focus on her studies. She left two days earlier than planned and without as much as a goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really shitty of her to do that to you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was really shitty. Wasn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve been devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. I resorted to partying almost every night. I drank way too much alcohol and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped what I was about to say because I didn\u2019t want Amelia thinking poorly of me.</p><p>\u201cYou slept with a lot of women, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I looked down in shame and I lightly nodded my head. She put her hand on mine. I was shocked, but I welcomed it.</p><p>\u201cEverybody handles their broken heart in their own way. It sounds like you tried to forget it, and I just shut everyone out of my life because I didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes we have to talk about the things that hurt us most in order to find some sense of peace.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and smiled at me. \u201cI don\u2019t like that you said that, but I know you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I handed her two graham crackers and some chocolate. \u201cYour marshmallows are done.\u201d</p><p>She made her s\u2019more and she bit down into it. Some chocolate got on her cheek. I leaned over and took my thumb and wiped it away. She instantly brought her hand up to mine.</p><p>\u201cSorry. You had some chocolate there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I removed my hand and told her that I\u2019d be right back. I went into the house, grabbed a few napkins, a couple of glasses, and a bottle of wine. When I went back down to the beach, Amelia had gotten up and was leaving.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Collin. I have to go. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia, wait!\u201d I exclaimed as I set down the glasses and wine.</p><p>She kept walking and I caught with her. I stood in front of her and lightly took hold of her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do? What did I say? Please don\u2019t go yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say or do anything, Collin. I just can\u2019t do this with you. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said as she pushed me aside and continued walking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn it, Amelia! I deserve an explanation!\u201d</p><p>She stopped walking and stood there for a second. Suddenly, she turned around. \u201cYou want an explanation? Fine, I\u2019ll give you an explanation. I\u2019ve known you now for two days. Only two days and I already feel guilty for spending time with you and having fun. I feel guilty because I should have been the one who died in that accident. Not my parents, not my sister, and certainly not Billy,\u201d she yelled. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve to have fun or be happy!\u201d</p><p>My heart broke listening to her yell that across the beach. I slowly walked towards her, not knowing what she\u2019d do. But she didn\u2019t do anything but stand there. I approached her with caution and looked into her sad blue eyes and placed my hands gently on each side of her face.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to be happy. Don\u2019t ever think you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what happened, but I do know that the accident wasn\u2019t your fault. We can\u2019t control fate, Amelia. You survived for a reason. Don\u2019t ever forget that,\u201d I said as I pulled her into a warm embrace.</p> <p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have died, Collin. They just shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d she began to cry.</p><p>I held her tightly as I felt sorry for her. I could feel her pain and ache as she cried into my chest. As she began to stop crying, she looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. Never apologize for the way you feel,\u201d I said.</p><p>We stood there and stared into each other\u2019s eyes. I wanted to fucking kiss her so bad, but not under these circumstances. I pulled away. It was the only thing I could do or else I would have kissed her and potentially could\u2019ve ruined what little we had at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cCan we go back to making s\u2019mores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we order a pizza?\u201d she said with a half-smile.</p><p>I chuckled as I placed my forehead on hers. \u201cYeah. Pizza sounds like a great idea.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around her and she laid her head on my shoulder as we walked up to the house. I pulled out the pizza menu and, after we both decided on what we wanted, I placed the order and we waited for it to be delivered.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>The alarm went off and I jumped into the shower. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Amelia and last night. We enjoyed our pizza and had a great conversation about music. It turned out that we shared the same taste. Once I showered, I got dressed, grabbed my bag, locked up the house, and headed to Amelia\u2019s. When I pulled in her driveway, she was standing on the porch with her bags.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cGood morning. Look at you looking all handsome in a business suit.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I grabbed her bags and set them with mine in the back seat. I opened the door for her and she climbed in.</p><p>\u201cReady to head back to the city?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I would like to stay here forever. I love it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I said as I touched her hand.</p><p>She turned and looked at me with a smile. I could get used to seeing that smile every morning.</p><p>\u201cI think we need some Starbucks before we head back. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you just read my mind, Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>I pulled into the drive thru and ordered us coffee and two muffins. All the way to the city, we sang some of my favorite songs and had a lengthy conversation about politics. That was a subject we must never talk about again.</p><p>\u201cMy apartment is at 75 Third Ave. in the Third Avenue North building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not too far from Black Enterprises.\u201d</p><p>We reached her building and I got out and grabbed her bags.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Collin. I can get them. Thank you for me driving back. I appreciate it,\u201d she said as she kissed me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome and it was my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around,\u201d she spoke.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger,\u201d I said as I got into the Range Rover and clasped the steering wheel.</p><p>I felt sick to my stomach as I watched her walk into the building. What if this was the end for us? What if the Hamptons was just a dream and, now that we were back to reality, the dream was gone. I pulled out into traffic and drove to the office. I took the elevator up to my dad\u2019s office, but stopped to say hi to Diana first.</p><p>\u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing! How\u2019s Jacob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a little setback. But he\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m coming over to play some Xbox tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll like that very much.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYour dad is waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I opened the door and, when I walked in, he was on the phone. He motioned for me to sit down. I walked over to the coffee pot and poured a cup of coffee before taking a seat in the chair.</p><p>\u201cHow was your ride back?\u201d he asked as he hung up from his call.</p><p>\u201cIt was great. How was yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and change the subject, son. I can tell you\u2019re smitten with this girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmitten? Really, Dad? Did you just say \u2018smitten\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin, you know what I mean,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>\u201cI do like Amelia. She\u2019s a great girl, but she\u2019s very complicated and that bothers me.\u201d</p><p>My dad leaned back in his chair. \u201cComplicated how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer parents, sister, and boyfriend were all killed in a boating accident two years ago. She confided in me last night that she should\u2019ve have been the one killed, not them. She\u2019s really closed herself off to the world and I can tell she\u2019s scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d he said. \u201cHailey left a bad mark on you and that\u2019s why your behavior has been less than acceptable. But, as someone who understands, I can see where you\u2019re coming from. If you truly like her and want to be with her, make it happen. I did, and believe me, son, I was more fucked up than you. I\u2019ve learned to let go of fear and let things happen the way they\u2019re supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad, for your wisdom. Now, let\u2019s go over that proposal. I have a lot of work to do today.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me as he pulled out the file from his drawer and we spent the next hour going over business.</p><p>\u201cSpill, little brother,\u201d Julia said as she walked in my office.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look bigger than the last time I saw you.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about how fat I\u2019m getting. I\u2019m here to talk about your little romantic weekend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWant to see a picture of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!

You have sex with any woman that looks at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot her. She\u2019s different. I haven\u2019t even kissed her yet.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWow. You must really like this girl a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. More than I want to admit. I completely forgot to tell you, Hailey called me and then sent me a text message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What did she want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell knows?\u201d I said as I got up from my desk. \u201cShe wanted to know how I was. As if she even cares.\u201d</p><p>Julia got up from the chair and clasped my shoulders. \u201cListen, follow your heart. Don\u2019t look back at the past.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her as she walked out of my office. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Amelia and the worst part was, I think I missed her. Oh boy, what the hell was I going to do? I walked back to my dad\u2019s office and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, son?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI need you to buy a house.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me from his paperwork and just stared. \u201cYou need me to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, listen. The beach house was Amelia\u2019s parents\u2019 and she needs it to sell because she\u2019s almost out of money. I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s going to take too long to sell. Could you just buy it and then put it back on the market?\u201d</p><p>My dad gave me the look that he used to when I was child. I used to call it the \u201cexplanation\u201d look. He had the same facial expression right before he would begin to explain things to me.</p> <p>\u201cCollin, my son, listen. I know you want to help this girl out. I don\u2019t blame you. But there comes a point when you have to realize that you can\u2019t save everybody. I just can\u2019t go and buy her house because she needs the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You have a shitload of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point, son. Okay, I\u2019ll make you a deal. If the house doesn\u2019t sell in three months, I\u2019ll buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months is too long, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens if things don\u2019t work out and you\u2019re not with her in three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Three months,\u201d I said.</p><p>A couple of days passed and I didn\u2019t hear anything from Amelia. I didn\u2019t call her or text her because I was afraid that she\u2019d reject me now that we were back in New York. The fact that she didn\u2019t call or text me gave me a real insecure feeling. I dropped by Jacob\u2019s house and we played some Xbox. He was coughing more than usual. Diana said that the doctor had changed his medication and it wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cSo, you gotta girl yet?\u201d Jacob asked.</p><p>\u201cThere may be someone I\u2019m interested in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in serious or just a casual fling?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when he said that. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I just met her, but she\u2019s not the casual fling type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Have you gone out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of times in the Hamptons. I haven\u2019t talked to her since we got back to the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I hope things work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. My mom likes some guy. I met him. I don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he makes your mom happy, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want him around.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the anger in Jacob\u2019s voice when he talked about it. I suspected he didn\u2019t like the guy because he wasn\u2019t his dad. When we finished our game, he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI think you should call her and ask her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, dude. Call her. She might surprise you,\u201d he said as he began to cough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. How old are you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it. Are you a scaredy cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you\u2019re a chicken,\u201d he said as he walked around the room making chicken noises and flapping his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou little shit. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen call her. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I will!\u201d I said as I pulled my phone from my pocket.</p><p>I dialed her number and Jacob sat on the bed.</p><p>\u201cHi, Collin,\u201d she answered.</p><p>God, it was so good to hear her voice. \u201cHi, Amelia. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Hey, would you like to go out to dinner tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019d love to. But I can\u2019t be out too late, I have a lot of studying to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re home early. How about I pick you up around six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix sounds great. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jacob as he sat on the bed, holding his thumb up in the air. \u201cThanks, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>After I left Jacob\u2019s house, I went straight home. My mom was in the living room, working on one of her paintings, and my dad was sitting on the couch with his laptop when I walked in.</p><p>\u201cHi, Collin. Did you and Jacob have fun?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>I walked over to her and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYeah, we had fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d my dad asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t all that great tonight. Diana said the doctor changed his meds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I wish there was something more we could do for him,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cOn another note, I called Amelia and we\u2019re having dinner tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good, you can bring her to family dinner.\u201d My mom smiled.</p><p>\u201cUm. I forgot that was tomorrow night.

I expect you and Amelia to be here,\u201d she said as she got up and left the room.</p><p>I turned and looked at my dad, who was sitting there with a big smile on his face. \u201cYou have to listen to your mother. Don\u2019t disappoint her, son,\u201d he said as he looked at his laptop screen.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and went up to my room. I pulled my phone from my pocket and sent Amelia a text message.</p><p>\u201cWe have to have dinner at my house tomorrow night. I forgot it\u2019s family dinner night and my mom is making me be here. She told me she wants you to come. I\u2019m sorry and I would completely understand if you changed your mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need to apologize. I think family dinner is great. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still picking you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be ready and waiting.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 17</p><p>The limo pulled up to the curb of the Third Avenue Building North. I sent Amelia a text message to let her know I had arrived. I looked at Ralph as he just sat there.</p><p>\u201cRalph, you need to get out and open the door for Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Black,\u201d he said as he jumped out of the limo.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and sighed. I think my dad made a mistake when he hired Ralphie. As I looked out the window, I could see Amelia walking down the stairs. Ralphie opened the limo door and she climbed inside and sat down next to me. She looked beautiful in her black and pink floral sundress. The way she wore her hair was different from what I was used to seeing. Instead of wearing it straight, she had soft waves going through it. Shit. I was starting to get hard just looking at her, not to mention that she smelled like roses again.</p><p>\u201cYou look great.\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. So do you.\u201d</p><p>We talked a bit about her classes as Ralph drove us back to the penthouse. We took the elevator up and I could tell she was impressed. As soon as the doors opened and we stepped into the foyer, Julia came sprinting from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Julia, Collin\u2019s sister. You must be Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. It\u2019s nice to meet you. Congratulations on your baby.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled and put her hands on her stomach. \u201cThank you. Did Collin tell you it\u2019s a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. That\u2019s so exciting.\u201d</p><p>Julia hooked her arm around Amelia\u2019s and led her to the kitchen. As I followed behind, I couldn\u2019t help but take in the amazing aroma that filled the penthouse. When I approached the kitchen, I walked up to my mom and kissed her on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt smells great in here, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, sweetie.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I turned around and found that my dad, Jake, and Julia were all talking to Amelia. Just as I was going over to join the discussion, I heard Denny approaching the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSmells excellent in here, Ellery!\u201d he said rather loudly.</p><p>I walked over to him and gave him a light hug. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to be here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was feeling a little better, so I decided to come over and hassle your old man.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI heard that, Denny.\u201d My dad smiled as they shook hands.</p><p>I walked over and asked Amelia to come and meet Denny. \u201cDenny, this is my friend, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Denny looked her up and down and then smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Amelia,\u201d he said as he lightly kissed her hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Denny. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you as well. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to them. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Amelia and I both laughed at the same time. My mom announced that it was time for dinner and she wanted everyone seated in the dining room. Denny took my arm and pulled me aside.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stunning, son. She reminds me of your mother all those years ago. She\u2019s a keeper and I have no doubt that she\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s way too early for that, Uncle Denny.\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cFunny, your father said the same thing.\u201d He winked.</p><p>I patted him on the back and we all took our seats at the table. After we finished with dinner, we ate the tasty fruit flans my mom had bought from the bakery, and then Amelia and I got up and sat down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re having a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Your family is wonderful. You\u2019re very lucky to have them in your life. Never once take them for granted,\u201d she said with sadness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Amelia. This must be hard for you.\u201d</p><p>She turned towards me and placed her hand on mine. \u201cIt is a little bit because it makes me miss my own family. But, it feels good to be a part of something, even if it is only for a couple of hours. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see your bedroom,\u201d she said.</p><p>I looked at her in confusion. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that you can tell a lot about a person by the way their bedroom is decorated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know that. But you\u2019re more than welcome to analyze it if you want.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She smiled back as we got up from the couch and I led her up to my bedroom. She opened the door and, when we stepped inside, she looked all around. She walked over to my bed and ran her hand across it. Then she walked over to the windows, looked out them, turned to my dresser, and then looked at the pictures hanging on my wall.</p><p>\u201cYou are driven and you enjoy the thrill of a chase. You know what you want, and you know how to get it. This room also tells me that you\u2019re sensual and sexy. You love sex and you seek it out whenever you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that is not true,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cSex just happens to find me.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She shot me a small smile and shook her head. \u201cYour greatest strength is also your greatest weakness: Your craving for physical pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, who have you been talking to?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and bit her bottom lip, then she looked down at the floor. I began to walk towards her slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you could have guessed all that just by looking at my bedroom.\u201d I smiled as I approached her and started to tickle her. I wouldn\u2019t stop until she confessed. She fell back on the bed and I fell on top of her, still tickling her until she gave up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI googled you and I asked around campus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d I smiled as I continued to tickle her. I stopped tickling her and stared into her blue eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask me?\u201d I whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause then you\u2019d know I was interested,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>We both shared a moment, and I wanted nothing more than to brush my lips against hers. I could tell by the look in her eyes that she wanted me too. I ran the back of my hand across her cheek as I inched my lips closer to hers. Before I knew it, her soft lips were touching mine. I kissed her softly and then looked at her to make sure she was okay with it. She smiled at me and that was my cue to keep going. I brought my lips to hers once again and, this time, I felt them part, inviting my tongue into her mouth. Our lips moved together in sync and I could feel her smiling from underneath. I broke the kiss before it went any further and stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think we should stop. You need to go and study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>I got up, took hold of her hand, and helped her from the bed. \u201cCan I see you again?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI would like that very much.\u201d</p><p>I leaned in and kissed her softly again. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Ralphie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not Ralphie. Just me and you,\u201d I said.</p> <p>We walked downstairs and Amelia said goodbye to my parents and Julia and Jake. We hopped into the Range Rover and I drove her back to her apartment.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I want to, I don\u2019t want to interfere with your studying. So go and get some studying done and promise me you\u2019ll go out with me tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise that I\u2019ll go out with you tomorrow night.\u201d She smiled as she tilted her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd I promise my parents won\u2019t be there.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Black,\u201d Amelia said as she reached up and brushed her lips against mine.</p> <p>\u201cGood night, Miss Gray,\u201d I responded as our lips locked one last time for the night.</p><p>As I walked up the stairs to my room, my mom came from her bedroom and stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you come in.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThank you for bringing Amelia to dinner tonight. She\u2019s a lovely girl, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she is. Isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>She followed me to my room as I set my phone and wallet on my dresser. \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, Mom. What is it?\u201d I replied as I pulled off my shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re reminding me a lot of your dad in his younger years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Ellery, you\u2019re making me sound like I\u2019m an old geezer.\u201d My dad smiled as he stood in the doorway.</p> <p>I looked at my dad and laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not a geezer yet, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, I love you, but I\u2019m trying to have a conversation with our son. Go back to bed and I\u2019ll be in there shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting anxiously, Elle.\u201d He winked.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and threw a pillow at him. \u201cDad, stop!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as he threw the pillow back at me and headed to his room.</p><p>\u201cMom, is there a point to this conversation?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, there is. You have the same qualities as your father and the same amazing heart. Any woman would be a fool not to have you in her life. It takes a very special person to stand by someone through the thick and thin of things. I just want you to remember that I\u2019m here for you when you need to talk. Your father and I have been through so much during our years together and if he wasn\u2019t the man he is, he never would have forgiven me and stuck by me the way he has. Even broken people can be fixed and there\u2019s no need to be frightened about trying to heal them.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her in confusion. Where the hell was this coming from? Could she see that I had some fears about Amelia? That I felt she was too closed off and burdened with the death of her family and boyfriend that it would cause problems in a relationship? She was my mom and nobody knew me better than she did.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d I smiled as I kissed her on the cheek. \u201cDad\u2019s waiting for you. Please do me a favor and keep it down.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as she hugged me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that we do this to you. Goodnight, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Mom.\u201d</p><p>I climbed into bed and as soon as I set my phone on my nightstand, it buzzed with a text message from Julia.</p><p>\u201cI really like Amelia. I think the two of you are super cute together and I don\u2019t want you to do anything to fuck it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like her too. She\u2019s different, Julia. I feel things I never have before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, little brother. I can see it in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need to come up there and smack you?\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise that. Mom and Dad are getting it on down the hall. I really need to move out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha. Better you than me! Put your earplugs in. Night.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I set down my phone and pulled the sheet on top of me. As I placed my hands behind my head, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Amelia. I couldn\u2019t wait to see her tomorrow. She was starting to consume my every thought and I prayed to God that I consumed hers.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Before I picked up Amelia at her apartment, I stopped and picked up Chinese carryout and a bottle of wine for us. She thought we were going to eat it in her apartment, but I had another plan. It was a beautiful evening and it needed to be spent enjoying it. I walked up to her door and knocked. She opened it with a big smile on her face and invited me in.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smiled as I placed my hands on her hips and lightly kissed her.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>I looked around the small place she called home and was quite impressed at how cozy it seemed. \u201cYou never mentioned a roommate. Do you not have one?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI used to have one when I lived in another building. But after the accident, I moved here and I just wanted to be alone. So, to answer your question, no, I don\u2019t have a roommate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your apartment is nice. I like it.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s okay. Did you bring the food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. But I left it in the car. I decided that we\u2019re going to eat it somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you have a plan.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI do. So if you\u2019ll come with me, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d I said as I stuck out my arm.</p><p>It took us less than five minutes to get to Central Park. I parked the Range Rover and looked over at Amelia as she smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cCentral Park?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYep. Central Park. This is one of my favorite places to be.\u201d</p><p>We got out of the Range Rover and I grabbed the basket from the back seat. I handed Amelia the blanket and I grabbed her hand as we walked through Central Park.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me why Central Park is one of your favorite places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mom\u2019s favorite place to escape, and it\u2019s a place where Julia and I spent a lot of time. When we were kids, my mom would bring us here while she painted one of her pictures. Our nanny, Mason, used to bring us here to play and our family would have big picnics in the park. It sort of became like a second home to us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s really special, Collin.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think I kind of got a little sappy.\u201d</p><p>Amelia playfully smacked me on the arm. \u201cYou did not. Did you bring any paper plates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFor the Chinese food.\u201d</p> <p>A playful grin spread across my face. \u201cWe don\u2019t need plates. We\u2019ll eat out of the cartons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s barbaric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s fun and we can share.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a piece of sweet and sour chicken with my chopsticks and brought it up to her mouth. \u201cBe careful; it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>She carefully blew on it first before putting it in her mouth. God, she was so sexy and my mind was picturing very inappropriate things. We talked and laughed and Amelia told me how nervous she was to start her clinicals. After we finished eating, we put the cartons back in the basket and I poured us another glass of wine. By this time, darkness had settled in and the stars were shining brightly above us. She lay back on the blanket and patted the ground for me to do the same. We stretched out and looked up at the sky.</p><p>\u201cDo you see the man in the moon?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I see him. He looks happy tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy tonight,\u201d she said as she turned her head and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I smiled as I reached over and took her hand, interlacing our fingers together.</p><p>We lay there in silence for a moment, and then Amelia started to point out some of the constellations. We laughed as I pointed to what I thought was the Little Dipper, but I was wrong. Then, suddenly, her voice became quiet.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s life was sailing. It was his passion. He began teaching me how to sail when I was just three years old. My older sister, Alana, never really got into it, but I did. My favorite part of the boat was the sail. I was so fascinated by how that piece of material, powered by the wind, made the boat sail. Like this is your place of peace, mine was the open water. My family would sail for days on end. One time, my dad took an entire month off work and we took the boat out and sailed on the open water. A whole month,\u201d she said as she looked at me. \u201cI loved it. My mom and sister said it was way too long and they were anxious to get home. I could have stayed on that boat forever.\u201d</p><p>I tightened my fingers around hers and watched her as she slowly closed her eyes. \u201cMy family and I raced in the boat races in California. It was the one thing my dad looked forward to every year. Two years ago was the first time Billy went with us. They were calling for storms that day, but according to the radar, the storms wouldn\u2019t be in our area until the races were over. We set sail and my dad had a plan. He was determined to win that race. I stood by his side the whole time. I was his second in command and his execution was always flawless. We were going strong and everyone was having a good time. We were blowing by the other boats and suddenly, out of nowhere, clouds darkened the sky and the waves picked up. My dad yelled at me to go sit down and hold on tight. My mom started to panic and he yelled at her to stop and to hold on as tight as she could. I\u2019ll never forget looking at him and seeing the fear in his eyes. All I could hear were the screams of the other people on the other boats. The winds were high and the waves hit the boat, throwing a rush of water from the bow over all of us. My dad was losing control and the boat was tipping. I\u2019d never been so scared in my life. Billy shouted my name and begged me to come to him. But I couldn\u2019t. My dad made a sharp turn towards an island in the distance and other boats went the opposite way. I kept telling him to turn around because there were no beaches near the islands. When I looked through the binoculars, all I saw were rugged, rocky shores. I knew if we hit those rocks, there was no turning back.\u201d</p><p>I lay there and watched as tears fell down her face. \u201cAmelia, you don\u2019t have to say another word.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t listen. She kept on telling me about that horrific day that changed her life forever.</p> <p>\u201cI pulled on my dad\u2019s arm and begged him to try to turn around. He jerked his arm and his elbow hit me in the face, knocking me down. Billy yelled and I tried to get up, but I couldn\u2019t. Billy stood up and he let go of the edge of the boat. That was when another wave crashed over the boat and knocked him off and into the water. I screamed and tried to crawl across the deck. I remember the rain being so heavy that it hurt my eyes. My mom and sister were holding each other, screaming and crying as I tried to get to the edge of the boat to try to look for Billy.\u201d</p><p>Amelia brought her hand to her face and wiped away the tears. I reached over and wiped a single one that she\u2019d missed.</p><p>\u201cAs the boat got closer to the island, it was headed straight for a large rock. The last words I heard my dad say were, \u2018I love you.\u2019 The boat crashed into the rock, flipping it over and throwing us all into the water. I\u2019ll never forget trying to swim to the surface and being tangled in the seaweed that almost killed me.\u201d</p><p>I ran my finger along the scar that extended down her arm. I noticed it on the beach the day after she had helped me, but I never wanted to ask about it and she never volunteered to tell me. I suspected now it was from the accident.</p><p>\u201cThe scar on my arm is from slicing it on a rock when the boat crashed and I was thrown into the water. I finally managed to make my way out from under the boat and to the top of the water. I began screaming for my family, but they weren\u2019t anywhere to be seen. I dove back under, but I couldn\u2019t see anything. The water was cloudy and the seaweed was thick. Suddenly, I heard a helicopter up above. I swam to the surface and began screaming and waving my arms. Blood was gushing from my cut and the water was turning red around me. The next thing I remembered was waking up in a hospital bed and my aunt was sitting beside me, crying.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and looked at me as another tear fell from the corner of her eye. \u201cYou\u2019re the first person that I ever told about the accident in detail.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wiped her tear and then put my arm around her, pulling her into me. \u201cWords can\u2019t even describe how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore the accident, I had planned to race myself the following year. But now, I\u2019m scared to death of the water and I can only look at it from a distance.\u201d</p><p>My grip around her tightened. She looked up at me with such sadness in her eyes that it took everything I had not to cry with her. My lips softly brushed against hers, a soft-spoken kiss that instantly turned passionate. My desire for her became stronger and, before I knew it, my hands were all over her, feeling every curve her body had to offer. She broke our kiss and pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Collin. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, Amelia. I crossed the line.\u201d</p><p>We both sat up and she looked at me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no need to apologize. Things just got a little hot and heavy and I\u2019m not ready for that. To be honest, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d she said as she turned away from me. \u201cIn fact, please just take me home. I never should\u2019ve done this.\u201d</p><p>I was stunned by her words. \u201cDone what, Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease just take me home. I want to go home.\u201d She began to cry.</p><p>\u201cWhy? So you can sit there all alone and shut out the world like you\u2019ve done for the past two years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt is my business because I really like you and I don\u2019t want to see you hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>She got up from the ground and slowly walked away. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to tell me when I can stop hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. If that\u2019s what you want, then fine.\u201d I got up, grabbed the blanket and the basket, and headed to the Range Rover. Amelia followed behind. I threw everything in the back and we drove in silence. When we reached her building, she got out of the vehicle, slammed the door, and went inside.</p><p>I pulled away from the curb with a tight grip on the steering wheel. As I turned the corner, I pulled over. She had opened up to me and this was just the beginning. Her tragedy was reborn when she told me about it, which sent her into fear again. I kept playing my mom\u2019s words over and over again. \u201cEven broken people can be fixed.\u201d Amelia wasn\u2019t the only one who was broken. I was too, but in a different way. We needed each other. I got out of the Range Rover and walked to her building. Someone was coming out the door, so I held it for them and walked right up to the second floor. I knocked hesitantly, not knowing what was in store for me for the rest of the night.</p><p>Chapter 19</p> <p>The door flew open and she sighed. \u201cSomehow, I knew you\u2019d come up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right!\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue and I don\u2019t want to leave tonight being angry. I don\u2019t want to do anything except be with you. I\u2019m happy holding you in my arms, because right now, I think that\u2019s where you belong.\u201d</p><p>People were opening up their doors and looking out into the hallway. Amelia grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me into her apartment. \u201cGet in here. You\u2019re making a scene.\u201d</p><p>I took her hands in mine. She tried to pull away, but my grip on them tightened. \u201cLook at me, Amelia,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for earlier. I don\u2019t want to hurt you and I don\u2019t want you to be scared of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of you, Collin. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what?\u201d</p><p>She took in a deep breath and looked into my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just scared of life.\u201d</p><p>I pulled her into me and held her. \u201cMe too, Amelia. Me too. But I think we\u2019re more scared of the unexpected.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI live every day in fear that something bad is going to happen because I\u2019ve experienced how your life can change in a split second.\u201d She pulled back and left my arms. \u201cSince you\u2019re here, can I offer you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. Amelia,\u201d I said as I ran my hands through my hair. \u201cHave you ever talked to a doctor about how you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t talked to anybody. Like I told you earlier, you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve told in detail about the accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell me?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and then diverted her eyes to the ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Collin. It just felt right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, Amelia. It felt right. Just like it feels right being with you.\u201d</p><p>Just as I said that, my phone starting ringing. I pulled it from my pocket and saw that it was Hailey. I hit ignore and put it back in my pocket. I sat down on the couch and asked her to sit with me. I held out my arms and she sat on my lap.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to spend time together, then we have to take things slow,\u201d she said as she laid her head on my chest. \u201cI really do like you, Collin. Even though you tripped me and then ran me over with your cart.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cFor the last time, I didn\u2019t run you over.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at me with a smile and I softly kissed her lips. There was no place else I wanted to be. I was content holding her in my arms. But, I was bothered by the fact that Hailey kept calling me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you came home last night,\u201d my dad said as he strolled into the kitchen and poured some coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhere else would I go?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a perplexed look as he sipped the coffee from his cup. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be staying at Amelia\u2019s, since you went out last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. We talked and we\u2019re taking things slow. Very slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, son. That\u2019s the way things should happen. It\u2019s not good to rush into anything. Take your time and get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really messed up, Dad. I mean, in a bad way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked as he set down his cup.</p><p>\u201cShe told me about the boating accident last night and it nearly killed me. What she experienced was horrific. I seriously don\u2019t know if I could ever recover from something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds to me like she hasn\u2019t, and if it\u2019s as bad as you say it was, and you really like her, then maybe you can help her. Poor girl probably never had any support after the accident.\u201d</p><p>I sat there, lightly shaking my head, debating whether or not to tell him that Hailey had been calling me. \u201cHailey called me last night while I was with Amelia and it wasn\u2019t the first time.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his phone and raised one eyebrow at me. \u201cWhat do you mean, it wasn\u2019t the first time? What does she want?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.

In fact, when I\u2019m with Amelia, I feel things that I never felt before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I know that feeling.\u201d He smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI know you do, Dad. Mom is your soul mate and the one and only and when you met her, she completely changed your life...blah blah blah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin!\u201d my mom exclaimed as she entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom. Dad, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve heard it a million times and I love you both very much, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what, son?\u201d my dad asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said as I got up from the chair. \u201cI\u2019m going to drive myself into the office today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Ralph is downstairs,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, no thanks, Dad. I\u2019ll just drive myself. Love you, Mom,\u201d I said as I kissed her on the cheek.</p><p>The more I thought about Hailey calling me, the more curious I became. I climbed into the Range Rover and hit her number on my phone. If I was going to be with Amelia, this thing with Hailey was going to have to be put to rest.</p><p>\u201cHey, Collin. I\u2019ve been trying to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw. What do you want, Hailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Why do you keep calling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to see what you\u2019ve been up to. I thought maybe we could Skype one night.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know where the hell all this was coming from, but she sounded different.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hailey, but don\u2019t you have a boyfriend? I don\u2019t think he\u2019d appreciate you skyping with your ex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings didn\u2019t work out between us.\u201d</p><p>That was quick, I thought to myself.</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to be flying back to New York in a couple of weeks and I may be staying there permanently.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. What the hell happened in Italy that\u2019s making her want to come back to New York? I didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice. I\u2019m sure your mom and dad will be very happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Hailey, are you there? Hello?\u201d Click.</p><p>There was no way I was answering that question, so I did what I had to in order to cut her off. As I walked up to my office, I sent Amelia a text message. She was the one I needed to be thinking about, not Hailey.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, beautiful. I know you start your clinicals today, but I was hoping I could pick you up from the hospital and we could grab some dinner together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning. I would really like that. I get off at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll pick you up in front. Have a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Collin. Have a good day yourself.\u201d</p><p>Just reading her words made me smile. Everything about her made me smile. Even when I thought about her, I smiled. I worked my ass off all day and held an important meeting that even impressed my dad. I stayed at the office until it was time to pick up Amelia so I could get some much needed work done.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>I pulled up to the hospital entrance just as Amelia was walking out the doors. She climbed in and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smiled back. \u201cHow was your first day of clinicals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was interesting and harder than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>I reached over, grabbed her hand, and brought it up to my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make an amazing nurse. Don\u2019t ever forget that.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, leaned over, and put her head on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked as I pulled away from the hospital.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just happy today is over with and I get to see you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as my lips touched her forehead. I was just as happy to see her. We both were in the mood for pizza, so we drove to Pizzapopolous. When we walked in, I saw Julia and Jake sitting at a table. Julia looked up and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she said as she got up from her chair.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis. It looks like we wanted the same thing for dinner. Hi, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Collin, Amelia. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cSit down and join us,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>I looked at Amelia and she smiled. \u201cOkay, we will,\u201d I said as I pulled out the chair for Amelia.</p><p>We had a great dinner with Julia and Jake. They left before we did because Julia was tired and feeling uncomfortable. I got up from my seat and kissed her goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see both of you at the office tomorrow.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I sat back down and grabbed Amelia\u2019s hand. \u201cThat was nice, having dinner with my sister and brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was. I really like them. In fact, I really like your whole family. Everyone is so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re okay.\u201d I smiled. \u201cHave you heard anything about the house yet?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said as she looked down at the table. \u201cThe realtor called me today and said that three people looked at it, but said it was out of their price range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of their price range? It\u2019s the fucking Hamptons. What do they expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wish I could keep it. Even though we only lived in it a very short time, it was a place that was special to my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your house here in New York that you grew up in?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She looked at me in confusion. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a house in New York. I grew up in Palisades Park, New Jersey. I thought I told you that.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I guess it never came up because we always talked about the Hamptons and NYU. I just assumed you grew up in New York.\u201d</p><p>As we sat and talked, my phone buzzed. I pulled it from my pocket. There was a text message from my mom.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart. The whole family is going to the beach house this weekend to celebrate Jake\u2019s birthday. So, don\u2019t make plans and bring Amelia. We\u2019d love to have her.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Amelia and smiled. \u201cMy mom said that the whole family is going to the beach house this weekend and she wants you to come. We\u2019re celebrating Jake\u2019s birthday. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a moment and then said okay. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou bet it will be! It\u2019s always fun when I\u2019m around.\u201d I winked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sent a message back to my mom.</p><p>\u201cSounds great, and Amelia is looking forward to coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>We finished our dinner and I drove Amelia home.

I smiled all the way back to the Range Rover.</p><p>Over the next few days, Amelia and I saw each other after she finished her clinicals. I would pick her up and we\u2019d grab carryout from somewhere and take it back to her place. I would bring my laptop and do some work while she sat and did her homework. I even helped her study for a big quiz she had coming up. She wanted to make sure she finished all her studying before we left for the beach house. I could tell that she was getting closer to me and letting me in more. We talked about our childhoods and how we grew up. We shared family stories and she even talked a little bit about Billy.</p><p>We were both sitting on the couch. I had my laptop on my lap and she was sitting next to me with her nose in her textbook. When she closed it, she looked at me and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m all finished. Now I\u2019ll have a clear mind for the weekend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I said as I set my laptop to the side and pulled her into me. I softly kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Is anyone else coming besides your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think just Peyton and Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they the parents of your ex-girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it will be uncomfortable having your girlfriend there while they\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, I smiled. We had never talked about girlfriend/boyfriend status before. \u201cNah, it\u2019ll be fine. Peyton and Henry are really cool.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzed on the table. Amelia sat up and reached over to grab it. There was a text message from Jacob.</p> <p>\u201cGuess what. Your dad invited me and my mom to the beach house. How cool is that, dude?\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I replied, \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, buddy. I can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so cool. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming up tomorrow or Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom said we can\u2019t leave until Saturday because I have a doctor\u2019s appointment tomorrow after she gets off work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You see your doctor first. That\u2019s more important. See ya Saturday, little buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Jacob. My dad invited him and Diana to the beach house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I can\u2019t wait to finally meet them.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I stared into her eyes and placed my hand on her cheek. \u201cSo, you\u2019re my girlfriend?\u201d I asked with a smile.</p><p>She bit down on her bottom lip before answering me. \u201cSo, you\u2019re my boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled as I kissed her. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m your girlfriend.\u201d She smiled as she wrapped her arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s official.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s official,\u201d she said.</p><p>I wanted nothing more than to make love to her at that moment, but I knew she wasn\u2019t ready yet and I was more than willing to wait until she was.</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re leaving in the morning and you don\u2019t have classes or clinicals, why don\u2019t you spend the night at the penthouse and we can leave together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Your mom and dad wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you better ask first.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrow at her. \u201cSeriously? You want me to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re your parents and it\u2019s their penthouse. So, out of respect, it would be best to ask them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said as I sent a text message to my mom.</p><p>\u201cCan Amelia spend the night in the guest room since we\u2019re leaving in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea. She\u2019s more than welcome to spend the night here.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her and showed her my phone. \u201cSee, I told you they wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me and got up to pack her bag for the weekend. \u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it will only take me a minute. Oh, can you grab my charger out of the desk drawer?\u201d</p><p>I got up from the couch and, when I opened the drawer, there was a picture of her, her dad, and her sister in front of T-Rex Sue. I pulled it out and, as I was looking at it, she walked up behind me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Sue,\u201d she said over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said as I pulled out my phone and brought up the picture that I took at the Field Museum.</p><p>\u201cHey, you have a picture of Sue too!\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of my most favorite museums,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMine too. My dad took us there about four years ago for the first time and I loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you back there and we can get a picture of us in front of her.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI would love that,\u201d she said as she kissed my lips.</p><p>She was becoming more and more perfect to me and she was fitting perfectly into my world. I loved sharing the museum with Diana and Jacob, but to share it with someone I was falling in love with would be even more amazing. I pushed a few strands of hair behind her ear and placed my finger under her chin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as true as that may be, you\u2019re perfect to me.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Our lips met once again and, this time, it was more than a small kiss. It was comforting and passionate. I inched her backwards until she was leaning against the wall. I placed my hand above her head while our lips moved together in sync. I kept my other hand firmly planted on her hip so it didn\u2019t wander where it wanted to go. My tongue left her mouth and, as it softly explored her neck, she let out a moan that sent me over the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have to stop,\u201d I said with bated breath.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I sighed as I moved away from her and she looked at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You have nothing to be sorry for. I\u2019ll wait for you for as long as it takes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to have sex with you, Collin. I do. But I just feel like it\u2019s not the right time.\u201d</p><p>I slightly smiled at her and placed my hands on each side of her face. \u201cWe\u2019ll both know when the right time comes and it will be amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt that it will be amazing. Just being with you makes me feel like that.\u201d</p><p>I placed my forehead on hers and we kissed one last time before heading to the penthouse.</p><p>We stepped off the elevator and my mom came walking down the stairs with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Amelia. Welcome to our penthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. She\u2019s been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Collin. But she\u2019s never stayed the night,\u201d she said as she shot me a look and grabbed Amelia\u2019s bag from me. \u201cI\u2019ll show her where the guest room is and you go talk to your dad. He\u2019s in the living room.\u201d</p><p>Amelia looked at me and smiled as she followed my mom upstairs. I walked into the living room. My dad was sitting on the couch with his laptop.</p><p>\u201cHi, son. How was your evening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was good, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are things going with you and Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are good. I really like her.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI think you should know that Hailey flew back to New York today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I talked to her, she told me she was. We sort of got disconnected when she asked if I was happy that she was coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve pulled that a few times myself. It\u2019s so unfortunate when that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight? I learned from the best.\u201d I smiled at him.</p><p>Just as he was about to say something else about Hailey, my mom and Amelia walked into the room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>\u201cJust going over a few business things,\u201d my dad replied.</p><p>I got up and led Amelia to the kitchen. \u201cAre you hungry? Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Collin.\u201d She smiled as she wrapped her arms around me. \u201cYour mom is amazing. She told me that if I ever needed to talk about anything, to come to her. She\u2019s such a warm and caring person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she is. She had a really rough childhood and both her parents died when she was young. She\u2019s been through a lot, so she understands,\u201d I said as I tucked her hair behind her ear and softly kissed her lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late and we need to be up early in the morning. Maybe we should head upstairs,\u201d she said.</p><p>I led her upstairs and kissed her goodnight. I walked across the hall and back to my room. I got undressed, put on my black pajama bottoms, and headed to the bathroom to brush my teeth. The door was closed, so I knocked.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, are you in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was going to brush my teeth,\u201d she said as she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cMe too. May I join you?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your bathroom, silly.\u201d She laughed. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my toothbrush and stood in front of the sink next to her. I could see her eyeing me up and down as I was trying to avoid looking at how sexy she looked in her little shorts and tank top. I could feel myself starting to get hard. Oh God, not now. Once I was finished brushing, I rinsed off my toothbrush and put it away. I turned and looked at her as she brushed her beautiful blonde hair.</p><p>\u201cOkay, goodnight,\u201d I said as I tried to get out of there as fast as I could.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said.</p><p>I turned around and looked at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that maybe you should give me one more kiss goodnight.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her with a small smile as I placed my hands on her hips. \u201cYour wish is my command,\u201d I said as I leaned in closer and kissed her.</p><p>She brought up her hands to my bare chest and softly stroked it as our lips enjoyed each other. It was torture as far as I was concerned because I wanted to be inside her so badly. I broke our soft kiss and we stared into each other\u2019s eyes as I lifted her up and sat her on the counter. She took my hand and placed it underneath her tank top, up to her bare breast. I softly caressed her breast as I took her erect nipple between my fingers. She let out a soft moan and I immediately removed my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said as I took her face in my hands and kissed her lips. \u201cNot here. Not in my bathroom, and certainly not in my house with my parents down the hall. Wrap your legs around me.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She did as I asked and I lifted her from the counter and carried to her bed. I laid her down and kissed her forehead. \u201cGet some sleep,\u201d I said. As I got up from the bed, she grabbed my hand. I turned around and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I forget about everything bad that\u2019s happened in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>I walked back to my room and climbed into bed. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her and how, if I wouldn\u2019t have stopped it, we could\u2019ve had sex for the first time in my bathroom, with my parents down the hall. I couldn\u2019t let that happen. With Amelia, things were different as far as sex was concerned. She wasn\u2019t going to be a fly-by-night, wham-bam, thank-you-ma\u2019am type of fuck. I was going to make sure that it would be magical and something she\u2019d never forget. She deserved that and much more. I closed my eyes with the image of me making love to her in my mind and suddenly, I was awoken by her softly calling my name.</p><p>\u201cCollin, are you awake?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes and all I saw was her silhouette standing next to my bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a nightmare about the accident,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I said as I patted the other side of the bed and rolled over.</p><p>She climbed under the covers and into my arms. Her face was wet with tears and she was shaking. \u201cShh. You\u2019re okay. I\u2019m here,\u201d I said as I kissed her head. I lay there with her, sheltering her from the nightmare that brought her into my arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 21</p><p>I awoke and I was alone. I got up, walked to Amelia\u2019s room, and lightly tapped on the door. When I didn\u2019t get a response, I opened it. She wasn\u2019t in there. I walked downstairs and found her in the kitchen with my mom, making breakfast.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Collin,\u201d my mom said as she walked over and kissed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>Amelia smiled at me as I walked over and softly kissed her on the lips. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d She smiled back at me.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be down in a minute. He was getting dressed, which is something you should already be doing, mister,\u201d my mom said as she pointed at me with a spatula.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a quick shower right now. I\u2019ll be back in fifteen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake it ten and hurry up. Breakfast is almost ready.\u201d</p><p>I dashed back up the stairs and hit the shower. As I was coming out of the bathroom, my dad was walking down the hall.</p><p>\u201cMorning, son,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Dad. You better hurry up and get down there for breakfast before Mom yells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already got an earful when you were in the shower. Maybe if someone would\u2019ve just gotten out of bed instead of\u2014\u201d</p><p>I covered my ears. \u201cLa la la.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled and walked downstairs. I followed behind a few minutes later and sat at the table for the pancake and fruit breakfast my mom and Amelia made for us before heading to the beach house.</p><p>Amelia and I climbed into my Range Rover while my mom and dad got into theirs. My dad suggested that we all drive together, but I liked to drive myself. You never know if and when you need to leave early. Amelia reached over and took hold of my hand. I looked over at her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance to thank you for letting me sleep in your bed last night. I\u2019m really sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize and you\u2019re welcome. Believe me when I say it was my pleasure. Do you always have nightmares about the accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I do.\u201d</p><p>I brought her hand up to my mouth and pressed it against my lips. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can to prevent you from having them.\u201d</p><p>We arrived at the beach house and I pulled up beside my dad. I grabbed my and Amelia\u2019s bags and headed upstairs to my room.</p><p>\u201cJulia and Jake will be staying across the hall in her room and you can stay in the guest room next to mine. It used to be my mom and dad\u2019s room until my dad added an addition with bedrooms to the back of the house. It got to be really annoying when they would constantly have sex and I could hear them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour mom and dad are so cool and so in love.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, sometimes they have a problem keeping their hands off each other, especially in front of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>I took her bags to the room next door and set them on the bed. \u201cJake and Julia should be here soon.\u201d</p><p>We walked downstairs. My mom and dad were in the kitchen, kissing. I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSee, told you. Excuse me, parents. We have company and she\u2019s not yet accustomed to your open sexual behavior, so could you please tone it down and not embarrass your son in front of his girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>They both stood there and looked at me. \u201cDidn\u2019t you warn Amelia about us?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. But still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I think it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Amelia smiled.</p><p>\u201cSee, son. She doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d My dad chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell them that?\u201d</p><p>She giggled as I grabbed her hand and led her down to the beach. I ran into the water until it was up to my knees, and when I turned around, I saw Amelia standing at the shoreline.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I said as I held out my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She stared straight ahead at the water and then it hit me. The accident. The things she experienced in the water. She was scared. She was too scared to go in the water. I walked back up to the shore and wrapped my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We can go another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go in the water anymore, Collin. Not since the accident and that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to stay.\u201d</p><p>Just as I was about to say something, I heard Julia yell my name.</p><p>\u201cCollin, Amelia!\u201d She waved from the house.</p><p>\u201cCome on; let\u2019s go see Julia and Jake.\u201d I smiled as I took her hand.</p><p>We ran up to the house and I shook Jake\u2019s hand and hugged my sister. \u201cWhoa,\u201d I said as I placed my hand on her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s getting impossible to hug you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed as she playfully hit me on my arm. She took Amelia inside and I stayed outside with Jake. A few moments later, my dad came walking out with a couple of beers. He handed one to me and then one to Jake.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d I smiled as I sat down at the table.</p><p>\u201cI saw you and Amelia down by the water,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t go in. The shoreline is as far as she\u2019ll go. She said doesn\u2019t go in the water anymore and that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to stay.\u201d</p><p>My dad looked at me and sighed. \u201cWell, I can understand that, considering what happened to her, but is it going to pose a problem when we go out on the boat this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dad. I\u2019ll have to ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel really bad for her,\u201d Jake said as he set down his beer.</p><p>\u201cMe too, bro.\u201d</p><p>The women came outside and Amelia sat down on my lap. She smiled as I kissed her cheek. I held my beer up to her lips and asked her if she wanted a sip. She nodded her head and I slightly tipped the bottle. She looked damn sexy drinking beer from a bottle. I was nervous to ask her about going on the boat. If she wouldn\u2019t go in the water, I was certain that she wouldn\u2019t go on a boat.</p><p>Julia, Jake, my mom, and my dad all went into town to do some shopping. They asked us to come along, but I just wanted to stay back and relax with Amelia. Plus, it gave me the chance to talk to her about going on the boat. We walked hand in hand down to the beach and sat in the sand.</p><p>\u201cMy family is going out on the boat tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said as she looked down.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t get on another boat.\u201d</p><p>I noticed that she started to shake. \u201cAmelia, relax. You don\u2019t have to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just stay back at the house and wait for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your family.

Come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this was a mistake coming here this weekend.\u201d</p><p>I quickly got up and walked over to her. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you and your family like to do the things I can\u2019t and it\u2019s not fair to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the things you won\u2019t.

This is who I am, and nothing, especially you, is going to change that.

She was upset and I could see the terror in her eyes when I mentioned the boat. I put my hands in my pockets and walked back to the house. I grabbed a beer from the fridge and sat outside. I wanted to go comfort her, but I could tell she wanted to be alone and I was going to respect that. Her fears were understandable, but she couldn\u2019t stop living life because of the accident and I needed to make her see that. Maybe I was crossing the line, but I cared about her more than I ever cared about anyone in my life and I wasn\u2019t about to sit back and watch her stop living.</p><p>A while later, as I was sitting outside, Julia came and sat down next to me. \u201cWhere\u2019s Amelia?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lying down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay? Did something happen between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and looked down at my beer bottle. \u201cShe\u2019s too afraid to go in the water and she won\u2019t go on the boat. I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>Julia placed her hand on mine. \u201cYou\u2019re going to support her decisions. She\u2019s obviously traumatized by what happened and she should be. I know I would be after experiencing something like that. You haven\u2019t walked in her shoes, little brother, so it\u2019s hard to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Julia. I do understand. I want to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand as an outsider. You weren\u2019t there. You didn\u2019t see what she did and you certainly didn\u2019t go through what she did. I get that you want to help her, but pushing her to do something she\u2019s not ready for is only going to push her away from you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say anything. I got up from my chair and kissed Julia on the cheek. \u201cThanks for the talk. I\u2019m going to go check on her.\u201d</p><p>I quietly opened the door and poked my head in. She turned around and looked at me. I walked in the room and climbed in next to her, wrapping my arms around her and pulling her into me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Amelia,\u201d I said as I kissed her head.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m the one with the issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have issues, baby. Some more than others, but in the end, everyone has issues. But issues can be worked on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please not talk about this now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>My phone started buzzing. When I reached in my pocket and pulled it out, I noticed a text message from Aiden.</p><p>\u201cBro, I\u2019m in the Hamptons. You here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m at the beach house with Amelia and my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. Let\u2019s hit the club tonight.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that wasn\u2019t such a bad idea, since Amelia wouldn\u2019t go on the boat. I asked her if she wanted to go and she said yes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you there around eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019m bringing Sonya. I can\u2019t wait for you to meet her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Amelia and I walked out from our rooms at the same time. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw her. She looked so sexy, I had to put my hand in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look amazing.\u201d I smiled as I looked her up and down.</p><p>Her short black skirt complemented her long legs and her silvery spaghetti-strap top clung to her hourglass shape. She wore the sides of her hair pinned up with curls cascading down her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said as she walked to me and ran her hand down my silk shirt. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I kissed her and we headed downstairs. My family had already taken the boat out, so I grabbed my keys, locked up, and then we drove to the club.</p><p>\u201cDude!\u201d Aiden smiled as he walked up to us right outside the club.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro,\u201d I said as we high-fived. \u201cThis is Amelia. Amelia, this is my best friend, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and lightly kissed it. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sonya?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe got into an argument and she left. No big deal. There\u2019s plenty of ass in there to look at.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look. \u201cAiden, not in front of my girl.\u201d</p><p>Amelia laughed and told me it was okay. She hooked her arm in mine and Aiden\u2019s and we walked into the club. Aiden turned and mouthed to me, \u201cOH..MY..GOD..YOU..LUCKY..DOG.\u201d</p><p>We grabbed a table in the corner and Aiden went to the bar and got us a few drinks. He set down Amelia\u2019s glass of wine and handed me my scotch.</p><p>\u201cDude, remember the last time we were here with that pizza delivery girl and you got her off and then she said she was a virgin and not ready for sex? That was classic!\u201d He laughed.</p><p>I closed my eyes at the idiocy of my so-called friend. Amelia looked at me and raised her eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThat was the night I met you.\u201d I smiled as I took her hand and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Amelia. My bad,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>He always had a habit of saying the wrong things at the wrong time. Now I was embarrassed and I could tell Amelia was less than pleased. A waitress came over to our table and asked if we needed anything. Amelia held up her glass of wine and ordered another. I ordered another scotch and Dumbass ordered us two rounds of lemon shots. After we downed them, I looked at Amelia.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d I smiled as I held out my hand.</p><p>She smiled, put her hand in mine, and we went to the dance floor. She downed her glass of wine pretty fast after the shots and I could tell she was feeling it. She was all over the dance floor. I grasped her hips with my hands and brought her close to me. She began moving her body up and down mine, causing some excitement. I took in a deep breath as I bit my bottom lip to distract me from my hard-on. She turned to me and wrapped her arms around my neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you may have had a little too much to drink.\u201d I smiled as I kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly enough, as far as I\u2019m concerned. Come on; let\u2019s go do some more shots!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>We went back to the table. Aiden was talking to some chick. She was a redhead, which was totally not his type and she was hanging all over him.</p><p>\u201cBro and Amelia, I would like you to meet, Amberlyn. Amberlyn, this is my best bud, Collin and his girl, Amelia.\u201d</p> <p>We said hi and Amelia turned to Aiden. \u201cMore shots?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, little lady!\u201d he yelled as the two of them high-fived.</p><p>\u201cYou two go ahead. I\u2019m not having any. I have to drive back to the beach house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin, seriously? You never let that stop you before.\u201d</p><p>I kicked Aiden under the table. \u201cI said, not for me.\u201d</p> <p>Aiden held up his hand and signaled for the waitress to bring the shots over. I ordered a bottle of beer and sat and watched the three of them get wasted.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get you into bed,\u201d I said as I picked up Amelia from the passenger\u2019s seat.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around me and looked at me with a smile. \u201cYou are so fucking hot. I can imagine how hot you are in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Let\u2019s not talk about this now. You need to sleep this off.\u201d</p><p>Her lips smashed into mine as I was carrying her up the stairs and she started laughing.</p><p>\u201cShh, everyone is sleeping.\u201d</p> <p>When I sat her on the bed, she grabbed hold of my shirt, fell back, and pulled me on top of her.</p><p>\u201cI need you to fuck me right now,\u201d she said as she kissed me.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it. I want you. I need to feel you inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk and I won\u2019t sleep with you while you\u2019re drunk. Not our first time anyway.\u201d I got up off of her and pulled back the sheets. As I took off her shoes, she told me that she was going to be sick. I helped her up and into the bathroom. She leaned over the toilet and started vomiting. I kneeled down next to her and softly rubbed her back. Once she was finished, she leaned up against the wall while I wet a wash cloth. I lifted her chin with my finger and wiped the mascara stains around her eyes and then wiped her mouth. I smiled as I kissed the tip of her nose before helping her up.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said as I laid her down in bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of cute when you\u2019re drunk,\u201d I said as I pulled the covers up and kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning, baby.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and, as I walked out of her room, I heard noises in the kitchen. I walked downstairs and saw my dad getting a bottle of water from the fridge.</p> <p>\u201cHey, son. Did you just get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been home a while. I was upstairs with Amelia. She had way too much to drink and she got sick.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBeen there, done that. I\u2019ll tell your mom to have the cocktail ready for her in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter her than me.\u201d I smiled. \u201cNight, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, son.\u201d</p><p>I climbed into bed and heard a light knock on the door. \u201cCollin,\u201d I heard Julia whisper. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just on my way downstairs for something to eat and I thought I heard you. Did you just get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone in this house ever sleep?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>She walked over and sat down on the edge of the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to sleep these days and so uncomfortable. I can\u2019t help it if your nephew is hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, you\u2019re hungry.\u201d I winked at her.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m curious. Have you and Amelia had\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Julia, we haven\u2019t,\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>She smiled and patted my arm. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. You aren\u2019t rushing into anything. Good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s killing me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you\u2019ll be happy you waited,\u201d she said as she got up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know I\u2019ll be and so will she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, big sister.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, I got out of bed, checked on Amelia, and went downstairs for breakfast. The kitchen smelled of bacon and eggs, two of Jake\u2019s favorite breakfast foods.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, man.\u201d I smiled as we fist pumped.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Collin. Where\u2019s Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still asleep,\u201d I replied as I poured a glass of orange juice.</p><p>My mom said, \u201cI\u2019m making her cocktail right now. Your dad told me about last night.\u201d</p><p>My dad walked in the kitchen with his arm around Amelia. \u201cEllery, someone needs that drink now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming right up, babe.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Amelia and tried so hard not to laugh, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I walked over to her and wrapped my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a hot mess.\u201d</p><p>She smacked me on the chest. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you go, sweetie. Drink up.\u201d</p><p>I took the glass from my mom and handed it to Amelia. She sniffed it and then looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mom\u2019s famous hangover cocktail. I\u2019m not going to lie to you and tell you it tastes amazing because, truthfully, it sucks. But I promise you that you will feel better quickly.\u201d</p><p>My dad took his coffee and sat down at the table. \u201cI\u2019m officially welcoming you to the family, Amelia. When you get to drink one of those, you\u2019re in.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Amelia. It\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? That tastes like shit,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Amelia sat down at the table and started to sip it. I pursed my lips together and could feel her agony. \u201cYou have to chug it. Pretend it\u2019s a shot or something. You can\u2019t sip it. You have to chug it. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with fear in her eyes and then threw back the drink. She drank it all and, as she set the glass on the table, she made the cutest face of disgust.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. I know it\u2019s awful, but it really does work,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cRemember one thing, Amelia,\u201d my dad said. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re hung over in front of Ellery, you will always have to drink that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, that\u2019s not true,\u201d my mom said.</p><p>\u201cReally, Elle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom, really?\u201d Jake, Julia, and I said at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amelia started to laugh and ate some dry toast. The rest of us enjoyed a great breakfast before we had to get ready for Jake\u2019s party.</p><p>I heard a knock at the door and I knew it was Jacob and Diana. I jumped up from my chair and answered it.</p><p>\u201cHey, little man!\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey, Collin.\u201d</p> <p>I kissed Diana on the cheek as Amelia came walking into the foyer.</p><p>\u201cDiana, Jacob, I would like you to meet my girlfriend, Amelia. Amelia; Jacob and Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to finally meet the two of you. Collin talks about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Amelia.\u201d Diana smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a great catch here. Collin is an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d go that far, Diana.\u201d My dad laughed as he walked in.</p> <p>It was good to see Jacob again. It had been a while. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked as I messed up his hair.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, dude, and I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine enough to maybe do some surfing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSURFING? Are you serious?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure am. That\u2019s if it\u2019s okay with your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please. Please can I go? Please,\u201d he begged.</p> <p>Diana looked at me with uncertainty. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana, please trust me on this.\u201d I smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s in good hands and Jake will be out there with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but be very careful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYES!\u201d Jacob exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get our bathing suits on and we\u2019ll head down to the beach.\u201d Amelia looked at me and smiled. \u201cCome with us? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be more than happy to watch you from the sand.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and kissed her on her forehead. While Jacob and I went upstairs and changed into our bathing suits, Amelia grabbed a blanket, a few towels, and headed down to the beach.</p><p>\u201cCome on, bro! Let\u2019s get the surfboards from the garage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe careful out there, Collin. You know how I worry,\u201d my mom said.</p><p>\u201cYep. Don\u2019t worry, Mom. We\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said as we raced through the kitchen.</p><p>I took the surfboards from the wall in the garage and Jacob and I took them down to the beach. When we got there, Jake was already in the water and Julia was sitting on the blanket, talking to Amelia.</p><p>\u201cThe waves are looking good today,\u201d I yelled out to Jake.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re awesome, dude. Hurry up and get out here.\u201d</p><p>I knelt down in front of Jacob and put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cListen to me, buddy. I want you to breathe in the ocean air, really take it in. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s hit the water.\u201d</p><p>I gave Jacob a few tips and, before too long, he was up on the surfboard. He fell a few times, but so did Jake and I. Overall, he wasn\u2019t bad. He took it slow and listened to everything I said. He was happy to be out in the water. Julia called for Jake and told him they had to get back up to the house and get changed for the party. Jacob and I stayed in the water a little longer.</p><p>\u201cCome on, buddy. We need to get back to shore. Jake\u2019s party is going to be starting soon.\u201d</p><p>We paddled our way back land and, as soon as we emerged from the water, Amelia ran over, handed Jacob a towel, and took the surfboard from him. She walked over to me and kissed my cold lips.</p><p>\u201cYou looked great out there.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby. Jacob did pretty well and I think he had a good time.\u201d</p><p>The three of us sat down on the blanket and dried off for a few minutes before heading up to the house. \u201cYou feeling okay, bro?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI feel great. Better than I ever have.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>I placed my hand on his head. \u201cThat\u2019s great, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Amelia took my hand and held it tight. She looked at me before leaning over to give me a kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI think you\u2019re the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Diana walked towards Jacob and he got up and ran to her. \u201cMom, it was so much fun. I can\u2019t wait to do it again and guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, sweetie?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI feel great. I don\u2019t feel like I normally do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Jacob. Now let\u2019s go get you out of this wet bathing suit and into some dry clothes. We\u2019ll see you up at the house, Collin.\u201d</p><p>Amelia turned and brushed her lips against mine. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat the salt water would help open up Jacob\u2019s airways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a little research here and there. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a big deal. A very big deal,\u201d she whispered as she once again kissed me and we both fell back into the sand.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>The guests had started to arrive and the party was under way. My mom had a huge spread of food catered and enough alcohol to quench the thirst of an army. Family and friends were in attendance and, finally, my grandparents arrived. I introduced them to Amelia after my grandmother lectured me about how they don\u2019t see me much. Denny wasn\u2019t able to make it because he wasn\u2019t feeling well again, which had my dad really concerned. As Amelia and I filled our plates with food, I heard a voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Collin.\u201d</p><p>I froze for a moment because of her voice. I took in a deep breath and turned around.</p><p>\u201cHailey. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my parents told me they were coming, I just sort of tagged along. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at Amelia as she glared at Hailey. \u201cHailey, this is my girlfriend, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend? I didn\u2019t know you were seeing anyone,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of things you don\u2019t know, Hailey. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, we\u2019re going to go eat.\u201d</p><p>I took Amelia\u2019s hand and led her outside to the table where Jacob and Diana were sitting. I noticed my mom and dad staring at us from the corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice. You didn\u2019t tell me that your ex-girlfriend was going to be here,\u201d Amelia said with a slight attitude.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know she was coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she was in Italy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYour ex-girlfriend is here? Not cool, Collin,\u201d Jacob chimed in.</p><p>I shot him a look and he smiled. I could tell how upset Amelia was by the look in her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you know she was back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just found out a couple of days ago.

Hey, by the way, my ex is back in town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, something like that. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have been caught off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. Let\u2019s just eat,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>Now I was angry. I was angry at Hailey for showing up at my family\u2019s party. Who the hell did she think she was after all this time? Not only did she piss me off, but she upset Amelia, and I was afraid that her being here was going to cause an argument. As I looked across the patio, I saw her talking to Julia. Peyton walked over to me and gave me a hug from behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Collin. I told her not to come, but she wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d she whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Peyton. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p> <p>She gave me a squeeze and walked over to where my mom and dad were. I looked at Hailey and noticed she had a different look about her. Not physically, but emotionally. She looked unsure and sad. After everyone ate, we sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Jake and had cake. I tried to get Amelia to have some, but she wouldn\u2019t. The happiness she displayed earlier was gone and now she was in a somber state.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you think we can have that talk now?\u201d Hailey asked as she walked up to me.</p><p>I looked over at Amelia. \u201cGo ahead. Go talk and get it over with so we can go on with our evening,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, do you want to go inside and play some X-box?\u201d Jacob asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, Jacob. I\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>Before Amelia walked away, she gave me a kiss and told me that she\u2019d be waiting for me. I didn\u2019t want to talk to Hailey, but I didn\u2019t have a choice.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s make this quick, Hailey. What do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we at least go somewhere quiet? Like down to the beach?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and sighed. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>We walked down to the beach and Hailey sat down in the sand. I sat down next to her and asked her what she needed to talk about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she said as she looked down.</p><p>My heart stopped for a split second and I didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cWow. Do your parents know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. I don\u2019t know how to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the father? Does he know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he knows and he wasn\u2019t happy. When I refused to get an abortion, he broke up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice guy,\u201d I said.</p><p>She reached over and placed her hand on mine. I immediately pulled my hand away from her. \u201cListen, Hailey. I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through, but I have a girlfriend who I care for very deeply and she\u2019s the priority in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Collin. I\u2019m so sorry for hurting you.\u201d She began to cry.</p><p>I stood up and, when I started to walk away, I stopped and turned to her. \u201cSorry isn\u2019t going to cut it this time, Hailey. You made your choice the minute you got on that plane.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and walked back to the house. I grabbed a beer from the fridge and told Amelia to meet me up in my room when she and Jacob finished their game. I went upstairs and sat on my bed with my back up against the headboard. As I took a drink of my beer, Amelia walked in and climbed on the bed next to me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cSupposedly, the guy she was with wasn\u2019t happy about the baby and he wanted her to get an abortion. When she refused, he kicked her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible. How could someone be so cruel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s not my problem,\u201d I said as I threw back my beer.</p><p>She put her arm across my chest and snuggled close to me. I put my arm around her and gripped her shoulder firmly. Everything felt right with her. I was happy and no one was going to ruin that for me.</p><p>I woke up holding Amelia in my arms. We both fell asleep last night after we talked about Hailey. I carefully moved my arm and quietly rolled out of bed so I didn\u2019t wake her. I stood there and stared at her as I pulled the sheet over her. I was falling in love with this girl and I wanted to tell her so badly, but I was scared. I walked downstairs and made a pot of coffee. As soon as the coffee was done brewing, Julia walked in.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Julia. You look bigger than you did yesterday.\u201d I smiled as I poured her a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cThanks, and I feel it too. Did Hailey tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about. It has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you at all that she\u2019s pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would it? She dumped me and told me to move on. So I did. I don\u2019t have feelings for her at all. I\u2019m happy with Amelia. She\u2019s the girl I want. Hailey will have to deal with this baby on her own. It\u2019s not my fault she got knocked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Tell me how you really feel.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI just did and I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to bring my girlfriend some coffee.\u201d</p><p>I made Amelia\u2019s coffee exactly how she liked it: one part cream and one part sugar. I walked back up to the bedroom and, when I opened the door, she was lying there, staring at me. I smiled as I set the cups down on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cMorning, beautiful.\u201d I smiled as I leaned over and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cMorning, handsome. I can\u2019t believe we both fell asleep last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought you some coffee.\u201d</p><p>She sat up and I handed her the cup. \u201cThank you.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I climbed back on the bed and she leaned her head on my shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the city. I love it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I do too. But, you have school tomorrow and clinicals, and I have work. We don\u2019t have to go back until later, so we\u2019ll do whatever you want to do today. It\u2019s your choice,\u201d I said as I kissed her head.</p><p>\u201cI want to go horseback riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. That day we went was amazing and I would love to do it again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen horseback riding it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to take a quick shower,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll meet you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>She kissed my lips and then got up from the bed. I grabbed her hand and pulled her back. She laughed as she fell on the bed. I leaned into her and kissed her again. This time, it was deep and passionate and I didn\u2019t want to let her go. I broke our kiss and she smiled at me.</p> <p>\u201cI just felt the need to do that.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to do that anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise. Now go get in the shower.\u201d</p><p>She got up and I lightly smacked her perfect ass. She giggled as she left the room.</p><p>When I went back downstairs, my mom and dad were sitting at the table with their heads down. I looked around the kitchen. My mom had started to take out the ingredients for her hangover cocktail. Oh my God; this was perfect.</p> <p>\u201cGOOD MORNING, PARENTS!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Collin. Shut up!\u201d my mom said as she put up her hand.</p><p>\u201cSon, be respectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you drink too much last night?\u201d I whispered in my mom\u2019s ear. \u201cAre you hung over?\u201d I whispered in my dad\u2019s ear.</p><p>Julia walked into the kitchen and I brought my finger to my lips, motioning for her to be quiet.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you out, dear parents, and make you something to help ease your pain.\u201d</p> <p>Julia silently laughed as she helped me put the ingredients in the blender. I turned it on full speed and both my mom and dad jumped.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Collin!\u201d my dad exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>I poured the drink in two glasses and handed them to my parents. They just sat there and stared at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and drink it.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Julia sat down at the table next to them. \u201cI sure hope your grandson never sees you like this. What would he think?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, Connor,\u201d my mom said as she held up her glass.</p><p>They both drank it as Amelia walked into the kitchen. She had the look of fear in her eyes when she saw the blender. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t need one of those.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, baby. It\u2019s for them.\u201d I chuckled as I pointed to my parents.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d she said.</p><p>My parents, Julia and Jake, and Diana and Jacob all left early to head back to the city. My dad wanted to get back and check on Denny. I told them that Amelia and I wouldn\u2019t be heading back until later this evening because we were going to spend the day horseback riding and then relaxing on the beach. Amelia had an amazing smile on her face the entire time we were horseback riding.</p><p>\u201cI love this so much,\u201d she said as we rode along the shore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s relaxing. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure is.\u201d</p><p>I extended my hand out to her and she took it. We rode our horses next to each other and held hands the rest of the ride. Words couldn\u2019t describe what I felt. When we finished with the horses, we drove back to the beach house and got in our bathing suits. I had to bit my bottom lip when I saw Amelia in her string bikini. Fuck, I was getting hard just looking at her. We went down to the beach and lay down on the blanket. I reached over and grabbed her hand while we both relaxed in the sun. I had an idea.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said as I turned my head and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cStand up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d God, I was scared to do what I was going to do, but I felt it had to be done.</p><p>We both stood up. I bent down, placed my arm under her legs, and picked her up. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d I asked seriously.</p><p>She became quiet and looked at me. The smile had left her face and it was almost as if she knew what I was going to do.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Collin. Please,\u201d she said as her eyes began to tear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you one more time. Do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do trust you. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, Amelia,\u201d I said as I began walking towards the water.</p><p>Her grip tightened around my neck. \u201cDon\u2019t, Collin. Please, I\u2019m begging you. If you care at all about me, you won\u2019t do this. PLEASE!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cI do care about you and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d I said as I walked into the water.</p><p>I could feel her heart racing faster than the speed of light and the tears started to pour from her eyes. \u201cPlease take me back.\u201d</p><p>I reached the point with her where the water was above my waist. She was crying and I felt like a fucking monster. But I knew in the end that this was what she needed to live her life again.</p><p>\u201cYou loved the water. You told me it was your life and you can\u2019t let one accident destroy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard. I fucking hate you for doing this to me,\u201d she cried as I put her down in the water.</p><p>Her eyes were closed tight and she was shaking. Not because the water was cold, but because of fear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you and I won\u2019t let you go. I promise. Please, baby, relax.\u201d</p><p>I was holding her as tight as she was holding onto me. \u201cI hate you,\u201d she said with her eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Feel it, Amelia. Feel the water, the waves; everything you once loved about it. I know you\u2019re scared, but open your eyes. It\u2019s beautiful out here, baby, and I want to share it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>My heart broke for her, but this was the only way to get her back into the water, a place where she used to feel safe and at peace. She needed to understand that it could still be that way.</p><p>\u201cYou can hate me all you want. But you need to do this. I\u2019m doing this because I love you, Amelia, and I want you to get better.\u201d</p><p>I said it. I told her that I loved her and I meant it. She became still as she had her arms wrapped tightly around my neck. She took her hand and placed it in the water, moving it slowly back and forth. I let out a deep breath because she had finally calmed down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said.</p><p>She lifted her head from my shoulder and looked at me as the tears still streamed down her face. I gently wiped them away as I smiled at her and then kissed her softly on the lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, is it?\u201d I asked as my eyes began to water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She brought her hand up to my face and softly ran it down my cheek. \u201cYou said you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t made love yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to make love to you to know that I\u2019m in love with you, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? You\u2019re not trying to convince yourself because Hailey\u2019s back, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I was falling in love with you after our first date. Hailey has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good then, because I love you too.\u201d She smiled as she hugged me.</p><p>I closed my eyes and smiled because she loved me like I loved her. I broke our embrace and kissed her as the waves danced around us.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go back to the shore?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI want to be here with you in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel safe with you,\u201d she said as she splashed water at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s how you want to play?\u201d I chuckled as I splashed her in the face.</p><p>She let out a playful scream and splashed me back. Then she really surprised me when she started to swim away from me.</p><p>\u201cGet back here!\u201d I said as I swam after her. God, she was fast.</p><p>She slowed down and I was able to catch up to her. I grabbed her from behind and we both went under the water. When we both came back up, she laughed. I was loving this side of her; this side that she had hidden away from everyone for the past two years.</p><p>Her laughter stopped and she placed her hands on each side of my face. \u201cThank you. Thank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>We went back to the beach house to change out of our bathing suits because we needed to get back to the city. I went to my room to change and Amelia went to hers. As I grabbed a pair of shorts from the drawer, I heard Amelia call my name from her room. When I opened the door, she was standing in the middle of the room, holding a sheet around her. I tilted my head and smiled as did she. She never looked sexier than she did at that moment. Her blonde hair was still wet and it was starting to dry in waves. The silhouette of her perfectly shaped body was visible under the sheet that clung to her. I walked over to her and stroked her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so sure of anything in my life. I\u2019m a little nervous because I\u2019ve only ever had sex with Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be nervous with me, baby. I will be everything you need.\u201d</p><p>Our lips locked passionately as my hand cupped the nape of her neck. This was it. The moment I\u2019d been waiting for since the first day I laid eyes on her. I was going to explore every inch of her body, not only with my hands, but with my tongue as well. Making love to her was going to be slow and gentle because that was what she deserved. She was going to get my full attention to her needs and I was going to make sure that it was something she would never forget.</p> <p>She let go of the sheet and let it drop to the floor. I broke our kiss and stared at her beautiful naked body. She was more perfect than I had thought and I didn\u2019t think that was possible. Her blue eyes stared into mine as she took my hand and placed it on her breast. I was so hard and my cock was throbbing for her. I walked her back to the bed, where she lay flat on her back with her legs hanging over the bed. I smiled as I took down my shorts and my lips covered her supple breast. She moaned as my teeth lightly tugged on her hard nipple and then my tongue licked it to soothe the sting. My hand gripped her other breast, kneading it and getting her more excited, before it traveled down her torso and stopped when my fingers touched her clit. She moaned and threw her head back as my fingers rubbed her in tiny circles. I lifted my mouth from her breast and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure you are completely satisfied and I\u2019m going to take my time. I can promise you this won\u2019t be rushed. You deserve every bit of pleasure I have to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I said as my lips explored her other breast.</p><p>I moved my fingers down and felt the wetness that emerged from her. I let out a moan as I plunged my finger inside her and felt how tight she was.</p><p>\u201cI want to make you come like this,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I inserted another finger inside her and, as I moved them in and out, her hips moved up and down with the same motion. Her moans became louder, arousing me more. I planted my thumb firmly on her clit and rubbed it until she couldn\u2019t take anymore and I sent her body to orgasm. She tightened her legs and her body shook as she threw back her head and her voice reached a high-pitched shout. I immediately went down on her and tasted every bit of pleasure that poured from her. She ran her fingers through my hair and then held my head.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she kept saying over and over.</p><p>I stood up and took down my underwear. She smiled as she looked at my full package and licked her lips as she sat up on the bed. She wrapped her lips around my cock and began sucking. She caught me off guard, but I wasn\u2019t going to complain. I fisted her hair as I stood there and watched her move her head up and down. Her mouth felt incredible wrapped around me and I could only imagine what her pussy felt like when it was wrapped tightly around me. I stopped her because I needed to be inside her. I reached over to grab a condom and she grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m on the pill. I have been for years.\u201d</p><p>She lay back down on the bed and I hovered over her, pushing my cock between her legs. \u201cIf at any time it hurts you, I will stop. Just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin, I love how gentle you\u2019re being, but for the love of God, just fuck me already.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I chuckled as I kissed her lips and then stared into her beautiful eyes while I pushed myself inside her. I wanted to take it slow so I didn\u2019t hurt her. I wanted to ease my way in, but she had another plan. She placed her hands firmly on my ass and pushed me down so I would be deep inside her. As soon as she did that, I let out a loud moan.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, you feel incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>I thrust in and out of her slowly at first, but then I picked up the pace when she wrapped her legs around my waist and I fell deeper inside her. My lips met hers and our tongues danced together as I was on the verge of an orgasm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come, Amelia. Can you come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYES!\u201d she screamed as her body tightened. I felt her coming and one last deep thrust was all it took before I spilled myself inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Our hearts were racing and our breathing was shallow. I collapsed on top of her and held her tight. I never wanted to let go. Once our breathing returned to normal and our heart rates slowed, I sat up and pushed her hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She softly stroked my face with her finger. \u201cThat was the best sex I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I didn\u2019t know I could feel certain things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI aim to please.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou are fantastic in bed, Mr. Black. I have no words for what I felt. You sent me to places I\u2019ve never been.\u201d</p><p>I leaned in and kissed her one last time before we had to get dressed and head back to the city.</p><p>Over the next month, Amelia and I spent as much time together as we could. Actually, we saw each other every single day. I spent the night most nights, but it was difficult with her bed being so small. She wouldn\u2019t spend the night at the penthouse because of my parents. The whole respect issue kept coming up. I really needed to get my own place. It was family dinner night, so I picked up Amelia and we went to the penthouse. As we were having dinner, her phone rang. She excused herself and picked it up from the counter. She answered it and suddenly became excited.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked as she hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cMy parents\u2019 house in the Hamptons sold. The buyer paid cash and I\u2019m meeting the realtor tomorrow to collect the money.\u201d</p><p>I got up from my chair and hugged her. \u201cThat\u2019s great news, baby. I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. It couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Now I can pay off my student loans and still have enough money to live on until I start getting paid for being a nurse.\u201d</p><p>Everyone congratulated her and we sat down to finish our dinner. As the women were cleaning up, I walked over to the bar and poured myself a scotch. My dad and Jake walked in shortly after.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to pour you one?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, Collin,\u201d Jake replied.</p><p>\u201cSure. Do you have a second to talk?\u201d my dad asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been itching to get a place of your own and, if you think it\u2019s cool, I would like to buy you the apartment that\u2019s for sale on the same floor as Julia and Jake.\u201d</p><p>I swear my heart stopped. \u201cDad, are you serious?\u201d I asked as I handed him his scotch.</p><p>\u201cYour mom and I talked and we think it would be good for you to have a place of your own. You\u2019ve exceeded my expectations at Black Enterprises and you\u2019re doing extremely well. I\u2019m really proud of you, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I don\u2019t know what to say. Thank you,\u201d I said as I hugged him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome and now, with you gone, that means your mom and I can fuck all over this place as many times as we want without the worry of anyone coming home.\u201d</p><p>I hurried and covered my ears. \u201cDAD!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as he raised his eyebrow and gave me a smile. My mom, Julia, and Amelia walked in the room and my mom looked at me and smiled. I walked over and pulled her into a warm embrace.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Mom. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, my sweet boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Amelia asked.</p><p>I turned to her and placed my hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m getting a place of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne floor down. By Julia and Jake.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she pressed her lips against mine. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI better get you home. It\u2019s getting late.\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It is getting late.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cGetting late? It\u2019s only eight thirty,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>I shot him a look and he then knew exactly what I meant. \u201cOh, you\u2019re right; it is getting late. You better get going. I\u2019ll contact the realtor tomorrow and we\u2019ll go look at the apartment downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Amelia and I said goodbye to everyone and I told my mom that I\u2019d be back home tonight. She was happy about that because she wanted to make me breakfast in the morning.</p><p>We climbed into my Range Rover and I drove Amelia back to her apartment. As soon as we reached her door, she unlocked it, turned around, grabbed me by my shirt, and pulled me inside, smashing her lips against mine with force. My hands instantly gravitated to the bottom of her shirt as she broke our kiss and lifted up her arms.</p><p>\u201cGod, I need to fuck you up against the wall,\u201d I said as I looked around. \u201cShit, baby, there\u2019s no open wall space.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI promise you amazing wall sex the minute you move into your new place.\u201d She smiled as she nipped my bottom lip and unbuttoned my pants.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that promise.\u201d I unhooked her bra and threw it on the floor. She pulled down my pants and took hold of my hard cock in her hand, stroking it up and down, sending me into oblivion.</p><p>\u201cNot just wall sex either,\u201d she said between kisses. \u201cKitchen sex, counter sex, bathroom sex, floor sex. Just fucking sex all over the place.\u201d</p><p>That was it. I needed to be inside her immediately after all that sex talk. I ripped her panties from her and pushed her back on the bed. As I plunged two fingers inside her to make sure she was ready, she moaned.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me from behind,\u201d she said as she pushed my fingers out of her and rolled over.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby. I\u2019m dying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get moving, Mr. Black. I want you now!\u201d</p><p>I pushed inside her and we both gasped. I moved in and out at a rapid pace, bringing both of us to orgasm at the same time. I pushed and pumped every last drop inside her and then collapsed on top of her, softly kissing her neck with the smallest kisses and holding her breasts in my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, baby. Just fucking amazing. I love you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Collin.\u201d</p><p>I rolled off of her and onto the other side of her small bed. As much as I loved being with her at her place, it was way too small for two people. We both lay there and I wrapped my arm around her. She placed her hand on me and began to stroke my chest.</p><p>\u201cThat is so nice of your dad to buy you your own place. I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has his motives.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as my mom and dad love having me at home, it\u2019s cramping their sex life because I\u2019m always catching them starting to do things in places other than their bedroom and I yell at them. Plus, my dad thinks I\u2019m old enough and responsible to be on my own. Not to mention the fact that I\u2019m always complaining about how small your place is.\u201d I smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, it kind of sucks here, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Anywhere with you is perfect. Except when I can\u2019t fuck you against the wall.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. I moved my arm and leaned over, licking her breast before sucking her now hardened nipple. \u201cOkay, baby. I should go. You have to be up early and so do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay,\u201d she pouted.</p> <p>\u201cI want to stay, but I told my mom I\u2019d be home tonight. Soon, we won\u2019t have to say goodbye like this. You can spend the night at my place and I\u2019ll drive you to school and to your clinicals in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d She smiled as she kissed me goodbye.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Amelia and I stayed up and talked on the phone until two in the morning. The next morning, before getting out of bed, I grabbed my phone from my nightstand and saw a text message from Hailey.</p><p>\u201cHi, Collin. I was wondering if we could talk. I told my parents last night and they are really upset and I need to talk to someone.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed. I didn\u2019t know if it was such a good idea. The fact that she hurt me really bad wasn\u2019t even a factor anymore. I was over it and everything happens for a reason. We did grow up together and had known each other since birth. So I guessed listening to her would be okay.</p><p>\u201cI guess. I\u2019ll text you later when I\u2019m available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>I took a shower, got dressed, ran down the stairs, and followed the amazing scent of French toast and coffee.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mom.\u201d I smiled as I walked over and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Dad,\u201d I said as I poured a cup of coffee.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a great mood today, son,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because things are good.\u201d</p><p>I sat down at the table and my mom set down a plate of French toast in front of me.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to Hailey?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeyton and Henry are really worried about her. All she\u2019s been doing lately is staying locked in her room. Did something happen in Italy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she got knocked up,\u201d I blurted out as I took a bite of my French toast.</p><p>\u201cWHAT!\u201d my mom exclaimed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Aunt Peyton didn\u2019t call you. She told them last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d my dad said as he took a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cPeyton did call me last night, but I didn\u2019t answer because your father and I were in the middle of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSTOP! Can\u2019t you just say that you were busy? Do you always have to be so detailed?\u201d</p><p>I looked at my dad as he sat there laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Dad. How would the both of you like it if I brought Amelia here and had wild sex and were so loud, you could hear us in any room of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin, that\u2019s not cool,\u201d my mom said.</p><p>\u201cEXACTLY! Now you get how I feel. I don\u2019t like the thought of my parents having sex. That\u2019s just...just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, son. We get it. We\u2019ll try to be more careful with what we say,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been saying that for years,\u201d I said as I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to call Peyton. Now I feel horrible.\u201d My mom kissed me on the head and walked upstairs.</p><p>My dad got up from his seat and put his plate in the dishwasher. \u201cRalph is driving me to the office today. Are you joining me or are you driving yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you at the office,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cHave fun with Ralphie.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>My dad stopped and turned around. \u201cHe is a bit strange.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I got up from my chair and grabbed my keys from the kitchen counter.</p><p>As I pulled into the parking garage of Black Enterprises, my phone rang. I pulled it from my pocket and it was my girl calling.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning. How was your breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great! I wish you were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy clinicals were cancelled for today, so my friend Gina and I are going to the library for the day to study for our exams that are coming up. Plus, I have a research paper that\u2019s due tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, babe. Have a good day and I\u2019ll see you later. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I got to my office, my secretary, Blythe stopped me. \u201cMr. Black, your father wants to see you in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just saw him thirty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and went back to typing on her computer. I stepped into my office, set my briefcase down, grabbed a cup of coffee, and headed across the hall to his office.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Diana. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Collin. I\u2019m good. After you meet with your father, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Let me go see what the old man wants.\u201d I winked.</p><p>I opened the door. He had just hung up the phone. \u201cCome in and have a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, son. We just landed the Firman deal.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck! Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m dead serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen? I basically told Mr. Firman to fuck off after all the shit he tried to pull with the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he liked you and your \u2018I don\u2019t give a shit if you don\u2019t go with us\u2019 attitude.\u201d</p><p>I sat there as my dad smiled at me. I knew how proud he was and it made me happy. Black Enterprises was going to be my company one day and I was going to make sure it stayed strong and successful, just like my dad did when he took it over from my grandfather.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting a huge bonus, son. I\u2019m taking you to lunch later and we\u2019re going to celebrate.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d I smiled as I shook his hand.</p><p>I walked out of his office and stopped at Diana\u2019s desk. \u201cI heard the good news. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. What did you want to talk about? Is Jacob okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had his doctor appointment yesterday and I told him how much better Jacob was doing after you took him surfing. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t last once we got back to the city. The doctor told me that the ocean water would definitely help Jacob because of the high content of saline in it. You knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips and gave a small smile. \u201cI was hoping it would work. I had been doing some research and I came across several articles that stated it\u2019s the natural way of helping patients with cystic fibrosis. I hate to tell you this, Diana, but I think you need to move to the ocean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, right, Collin.

Go back to your office. I have work to finish for your father before he fires me.\u201d She winked.</p><p>I placed my hand on her shoulder and smiled at her before I walked away. As I walked down the hall, she called my name. I turned around and looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I nodded my head, put my hands in my pockets, and went back to my office.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to your sometimes lousy attitude.\u201d My dad smiled as he held up his scotch.</p><p>I brought my glass to his. \u201cThanks, Dad. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called your mom to come and join us, but she\u2019s with Peyton. I wonder how that\u2019s going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh shit. I forgot about Hailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHailey sent me a text message this morning, asking if she could talk to me because Peyton and Henry were really upset about her being pregnant and I told her I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on it. Why? It\u2019s only a quick talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, if I\u2019ve learned anything at all in life, it\u2019s NEVER keep anything from the woman you love. Even if it\u2019s the smallest insignificant thing. You really need to trust me on that one.\u201d</p> <p>His phone rang and, as he answered it, I pulled out mine and sent a text message to Amelia.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too. I hope your day is going good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best day ever. Well, except when I first laid eyes on you. I\u2019ll tell you all about it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLol. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>My dad hung up from his call and smiled. \u201cThe realtor is on her way to the apartment now. I told her we\u2019d meet her there in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat; let\u2019s go,\u201d I said as I reached in my pocket and pulled out my keys.</p><p>We drove to the building and, when we stepped off the elevator, my heart started racing when I saw the realtor. Shit. I thought to myself. She turned and looked at us as she unlocked the door across from Julia\u2019s and Jake\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>\u201cHello there, Mr. Black. What a small world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I said as my dad and I stepped inside the apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou know my son?\u201d my dad asked.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. We just closed the deal on the house in the Hamptons.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>My dad grabbed the back of my neck. \u201cIs that so?\u201d he said as he looked at me.</p><p>I wiggled out of his grip and smiled at Macy, the realtor. \u201cLet\u2019s see this great apartment, shall we?\u201d</p><p>She showed us around and I fell in love with it. I could see myself making this my home. A home for me and Amelia someday.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, son?\u201d my dad asked.</p><p>\u201cI love it, Dad. Plus, you and mom are right upstairs, so if you ever need me, I can be up in a flash. I love the fact that it\u2019s so close to family. Julia and Jake are right across the hall. I need to be close to my family.\u201d I tried to sugarcoat it so he wouldn\u2019t yell at me about the beach house once we were alone.</p><p>My dad looked at me and rolled his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it. I can write you a check right now so my son can have the keys. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s dying to move in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant. Let me run downstairs and grab the paperwork from my car and we can settle this today.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she walked out of the apartment, my dad walked up and smacked me on the back of the head.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch, Dad. Stop with the hands. Okay, I bought Amelia\u2019s parents\u2019 house in the Hamptons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you when you asked me to buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But please listen to me. That house means everything to her and she was sad when it sold, but she needed the money so bad. I want to make it our home someday. Like you did for Mom.\u201d</p><p>My dad sighed and walked over to the window. \u201cShe\u2019s the one for you. Isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, she is. She\u2019s my entire world now. I thought I was in love with Hailey when we were together, but I wasn\u2019t. Yeah, I loved her; don\u2019t get me wrong. But I didn\u2019t know what actual love was until I met Amelia. I feel things for her that I never felt for Hailey. I have new emotions, new feelings; things I can\u2019t explain. I want to protect her and shield her from all the bad in the world. I want to help her get better and I want to spend my life with her. Dad, I can actually envision a future with her and kids. I know it seems weird to you and you\u2019re thinking it\u2019s too soon, but she\u2019s the love of my life and I\u2019ll do anything to make her happy. And if buying the house where she had one last good memory of her family before they were torn away from her makes her happy, then damn right I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d</p><p>The realtor walked back into the apartment with all the necessary paperwork and my dad signed it and wrote a check. She handed over the keys to me and smiled all the way out the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not weird,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think what you said or think is weird because I would have done the same thing for your mom. I\u2019ve dedicated my entire life to making her happy, whatever the cost may be. I know that feeling and I get it, son. I\u2019m proud of you. You bought your first property.\u201d He smiled as he put his arm around me. \u201cNow we can work on the payment plan for this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I thought you were buying this for me, like you did for Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the difference is Julia didn\u2019t already buy a house.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cDad, come on.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as he hooked his arm around my neck and we took the elevator up to the penthouse.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>\u201cEllery, where are you?\u201d my dad yelled through the penthouse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Connor,\u201d she said as she came down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAsk your son what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean besides closing a huge deal for Black Enterprises?\u201d She smiled as she walked over and kissed my cheek. \u201cCongratulations, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ellery, besides that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, Collin?\u201d</p><p>I took in a deep breath before I answered her. \u201cI bought Amelia\u2019s parents\u2019 beach house in the Hamptons.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh. Is that what you wanted me to know so badly, Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad was mad,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat house meant a lot to Amelia. We talked about it not too long ago when I asked her how things were going. She told me that she was really sad that she had to sell it because she wanted it to be a place where she could go and feel close to her family every summer. You are so much like your father, Collin. I see more and more of him in you every day.\u201d She smiled as she brought her hand up to my face. \u201cGood for you! Are you going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. I want to wait until I see how things go with us. Plus, I don\u2019t want her to be mad at me for doing it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll think you are the most incredible and giving person on the face of this earth.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks again, Mom. Excuse me. I need to get something to drink,\u201d I said as I walked to the kitchen. I heard my mom raise her voice at my dad and I stood out of sight and listened to their conversation.</p><p>\u201cAs for you, Mister. How the hell could you be mad at your son for doing exactly what you would have done? You should be very proud of him, Connor. You are an amazing father and you taught your son well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am proud of him, Elle. He\u2019s an incredible man. I just wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish he would have asked your opinion first, right? You weren\u2019t mad at him for buying that house. You were hurt because your son made a responsible adult purchase on his own. Connor, you\u2019re scared that Collin doesn\u2019t need you any more, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, something like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t stopped to think about my dad\u2019s feelings. He was afraid of letting me go like he was with Julia. Damn, I wished I would have talked to him about it first. I didn\u2019t realize he would feel not needed. As soon as they were finished talking, I walked out to the foyer.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. I\u2019m sorry about not talking to you before buying the house. I know that I probably should have consulted you first, but I really wanted to do something on my own. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, son,\u201d he said as he hugged me. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. You\u2019re an adult and you can do whatever you want. Just know that I\u2019m always here for you, no matter what, and I always will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNow go on and get out of here. Your mom and I have some things to do.\u201d He winked.</p> <p>I shook my head and rolled my eyes. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I fully intend to,\u201d he said as he walked up the stairs.</p><p>I made Amelia close her eyes as I put the key in the lock. I opened the door and took her hand and led her inside.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you can open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! This is amazing,\u201d she said as she looked around the apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you like it.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She walked through the living room and into the kitchen. I thought she was going to have a heart attack when she saw the dining area and the five large windows that made up one wall.</p><p>\u201cOh, the romantic dinners we can have here.\u201d She smiled.</p> <p>I walked over to her and wrapped my arms around her waist. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she said as she leaned her head back and I kissed her lips.</p><p>\u201cLook around. What do you see?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She escaped from my arms and walked through the apartment, looking up and down and all around. \u201cHmm...I see nothing but a lot of wall space.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Do you know what that means?\u201d I asked as I unbuttoned my pants.</p><p>She turned around and looked at me as she bit down on her bottom lip with a wide smile across her face. \u201cLots and lots of wall sex!\u201d she said as she lifted off her shirt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Lots of wall sex, and I think we should start now.\u201d I smiled as I threw my shirt on the floor and took down my pants.</p><p>She stood in the middle of the empty room, stepping out of her jeans while unhooking her bra and slowing inching backwards until she was up against the wall.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I said as I walked towards her.</p><p>I was already as hard as a rock and I hadn\u2019t even touched her yet. I took down my underwear as soon as I reached her. I stepped out of them and kicked them to the side as I firmly planted my hands against the wall on each side of her head. I teased her with my lips, kissing her slowly and softly. She wasted no time stroking me up and down slowly, driving me insane. My hand traveled down to her wet pussy and I cupped it before slipping my fingers inside.</p><p>\u201cAh, baby, you\u2019re so wet already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm. Only for you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI need to taste you first,\u201d I moaned as I knelt down and planted my mouth against her, tasting her pleasure.</p><p>She grabbed my hair and began thrusting her hips back and forth. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m going to come already!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cDo it, baby. I want to hear you and I want to feel you,\u201d I said as my tongue flicked in and out of her rapidly.</p><p>Her body tightened and swelled against my mouth, releasing the orgasm that I brought her to. \u201cOh God. Oh God,\u201d she kept yelling.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, baby?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said with bated breath.</p><p>I placed my cock inside her and pushed into her with force. She wrapped her legs around me, which caused me to go deeper inside her.</p><p>\u201cAH!\u201d I moaned from the pleasure I felt.</p><p>I held her up by her perfect ass and pounded in and out of her. Her tits were shaking all over the place as she begged me to suck them. I slowed down and took her in my mouth, biting and licking her hard nipples like she commanded.</p><p>\u201cFaster, Collin. Faster. I\u2019m going to come again!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>I held her up with one hand this time as I pressed my other hand against the wall. I thrust in and out of her as fast as I could, building up for my release. Her moans grew with each thrust and, just as her legs tightened around me, I could feel her come pouring onto me as I released myself deep inside her. Our hearts were racing and we were both out of breath. Once I pushed every last milky drop inside of her, I buried my face into her neck. She brought up her hand to my head and softly stroked my hair.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Amelia. More than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d I lifted my head and softly kissed her on the lips. \u201cLet\u2019s go furniture shopping, shall we?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI would love to.\u201d She smiled back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were at the furniture store when my phone rang. I pulled it out of my pocket. It was Hailey calling. I sighed as Amelia looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she calling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because I blew her off today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe sent me a text this morning and asked me if we could talk because she told her parents about the baby and they were really upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she has to talk to you about it?\u201d Amelia asked with a little bit of an attitude.</p><p>\u201cBaby, listen. Don\u2019t you worry about Hailey. You know I love you. I\u2019m just trying to be nice, I guess. Which I\u2019m not sure if I should be.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to get the wrong impression, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if she does, I\u2019ll set her straight. No big deal. Now come on; help me pick out a bed.\u201d I winked.</p> <p>I bought all the furniture I needed. It was fun shopping with Amelia. She and I had the same taste in furniture. We picked up Thai food on the way back to my apartment and we set a blanket on the floor as we ate with chopsticks out of the carton, talking and laughing about life.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and call Hailey back. Meet with her tomorrow and let her talk. I\u2019m okay with it,\u201d Amelia said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because I don\u2019t have to if it\u2019s going to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t upset me. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my phone and dialed Hailey\u2019s number. She answered on the second ring and we arranged to meet at Starbucks tomorrow morning around ten. I looked at Amelia and smiled. \u201cCan you stay here for a second? I have to run across the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She giggled.</p> <p>I got up and stepped across the hall to Julia\u2019s apartment. I softly knocked and Jake answered the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, neighbor. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a couple extra blankets I can borrow for a couple nights? I don\u2019t want to go upstairs and be interrogated by the parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHAHA!\u201d Jake laughed. \u201cSure, we have extra blankets. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>Julia came walking from the bedroom and smiled when she saw me. Oh my God, did she look huge in her nightgown. But I didn\u2019t dare say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, handsome?\u201d she asked as she kissed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYour little brother is spending the night at his new pad and he asked to borrow a couple of blankets. I\u2019m thinking he may be having a sleepover.\u201d Jake smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Is that true?\u201d Julia asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Amelia is spending the night,\u201d I said as I took the blankets from Jake.</p><p>\u201cHave fun!\u201d Julia said as I opened the door.</p><p>I turned around and smiled at her. \u201cTo quote Dad, I fully intend to.\u201d</p><p>Julia covered her ears. \u201cStop that! And you better wash those blankets before you give them back!\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I shut the door, walked over to my place, laid down the blankets in the bedroom, and made sweet love to my girl again.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>I looked at my watch. It was ten fifteen. I sat there with my cup of coffee and looked out the window to see if I could see Hailey walking down the street. I pulled out my phone and sent her a text message.</p><p>\u201cHey, where are you? I have to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>I sat and waited for another ten minutes and there was no Hailey and no reply text message. I sighed as I got up from the table and my phone began to ring. I thought it was strange that Amelia was calling me during her clinicals.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin, I\u2019m doing clinicals in the Labor and Delivery unit and Hailey is here. I saw her, and her mom asked me to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lost the baby. I really think you should come to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby. I\u2019m on my way. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>Oh, man. I couldn\u2019t believe she lost the baby. I drove to the hospital and went up to the Labor and Delivery unit. The nurse at the desk told me which room Hailey was in and, when I went there, Peyton and Henry were in the room with her.</p><p>\u201cHi, Collin. You\u2019re so sweet for coming,\u201d Peyton said as she hugged me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Collin. Thanks, man,\u201d Henry said as he walked over and shook my hand.</p><p>They both left the room and I walked over to the side of Hailey\u2019s bed and sat down in the chair. She wouldn\u2019t look at me. She just stared at the blank wall.</p><p>\u201cHey, Hailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she whispered as she wiped a tear that fell from her eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Why are you here?\u201d she asked as she turned and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYour mom asked me to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just fucking great. I\u2019m asking you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you here. You\u2019re the last person I want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Hailey? Because yesterday, you wanted to talk,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat was then, this is now, and now I don\u2019t want to see you. I needed you when I came back and you turned your back on me.\u201d</p><p>I was getting angrier by the minute. I couldn\u2019t yell at her because she had just lost the baby and she was emotional. I got up from the chair and placed my hand on hers.</p><p>\u201cI hope you feel better, Hailey.\u201d I walked out of the room and saw Amelia down the hall. I walked over to her and grabbed her hand.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy, so I\u2019ll see you later. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Are you all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine, baby,\u201d I said as I kissed her forehead and went to the office.</p><p>A couple of weeks had passed and Amelia and I spent them going out with friends and organizing all the things my mom bought me for my apartment. I sent Ralph to pick up Amelia from the hospital because I was making dinner for her. I heard the door open and, instantly, I smiled. I wiped my hands on the kitchen towel and walked to the foyer.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby,\u201d I said as I kissed her. \u201cDid you have a nice ride home with Ralphie?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then let out a giggle. \u201cBe nice. It smells wonderful in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. How was your day?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was good. How was yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better now that you\u2019re here.\u201d I smiled as I gripped her hips and kissed her.</p><p>There was a knock at the door and Amelia looked at me. \u201cAre you expecting someone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said as I walked over to the door and opened it.

I\u2019m in the middle of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart. You two talk. I\u2019ll go over and see Julia. Hi, Hailey,\u201d Amelia said as she walked across the hall.</p> <p>I shut the door and sighed. \u201cWhat do you want, Hailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for what I said at the hospital. It was rude and I was out of line.\u201d</p><p>I stood there, nodding my head. \u201cOkay. Apology accepted. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d I said as I walked towards the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI still love you, Collin, and I want you to give us another chance!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>I stopped dead in my tracks. \u201cWhat? I have a girlfriend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what. Break up with her. I know you still love me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe I was standing there, listening to what she was saying. She didn\u2019t have a clue what she did to me. I turned around and glared at her.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break the news to you, Hailey, but I don\u2019t love you. To be honest, I never really did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck can you say that after six years of being in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was young. Neither one of us knew what love really was, and I\u2019m pretty sure you still don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you do?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I do know because the girl I\u2019m madly in love with is across the hall right now. Hailey, if you truly loved me, you wouldn\u2019t have done what you did. You couldn\u2019t have so easily walked away. But you did and you broke my heart. You told me numerous times that we weren\u2019t meant to be and that I needed to move on. So I did. Now you come back to New York and you think we can pick up where we left off? Did you honestly think that I would be waiting for you after what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I made a mistake. Please forgive me,\u201d she cried.</p><p>By this time, the tears were flowing from her uncontrollably and I felt bad. But there was nothing I could do for her.</p><p>\u201cThe only mistake you made was thinking that you could have me back. You\u2019ll find someone, Hailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have found someone, Collin. You. I want you back in my life. I want to hold you and kiss you and make love to you,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She walked up to me and smashed her mouth against mine. I pushed her away and looked at her tear-filled eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me that you didn\u2019t feel something,\u201d she said.</p> <p>I stood there as I was about to break her heart one last time. \u201cNo, Hailey. I felt nothing. It\u2019s been over between us for a long time. Now, please leave so I can finish cooking dinner.\u201d</p><p>She ran to the door of my apartment and flung it open before running down the hallway, crying her eyes out. I stood there with my head down, feeling bad for hurting her, even though I shouldn\u2019t have felt that way. Amelia walked into the apartment and wrapped her arms around me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she will be,\u201d I said as I kissed her head. \u201cCome on; let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>A couple of days later, we got word from the nurse my dad had hired that Denny had passed away from a massive heart attack. I\u2019ve never seen my dad take anything so hard in his life. When he received the call, I was there in his office, and watched as a tear fell from his eye. My mom wasn\u2019t handling it very well either and, as much as Julia and I loved Denny, we felt like we needed to be strong for our parents. We all suffered a huge loss, but it was my parents that were hit the hardest. We were all meeting at the penthouse because Denny\u2019s lawyer, which was also my father\u2019s, was coming over to read a few things that Denny had left. He was instructed to read the letters one day after his death.</p><p>Before heading up to the penthouse, I showered. As I stepped out, I wrapped a towel around my waist and sat at the end of the bed. Amelia was in the room, changing her clothes.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, sweetheart?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I finally broke down and let go. I kept my head lowered as I shook it back and forth and the tears started to pour from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCollin,\u201d she said as she sat down next to me and hugged me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arm around hers and gripped it tightly as I buried my head into her shoulder and cried. She gently rubbed my back and told me that everything was going to be all right. I was thankful that she was there because I needed her more now than ever. Once I composed myself, I got dressed and we headed up to the penthouse. Julia and Jake were walking out of their apartment when we were and Julia\u2019s eyes were red and swollen. I kissed her and put my arm around her.</p><p>When we stepped off the elevator, we gathered in the dining room and sat down at the table.</p><p>\u201cThank you all for being here tonight and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. The letter that I have in my hand is from Denny, which he wrote approximately a month ago. Are you ready for me to read it?</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d my dad said as he looked down.</p><p>The lawyer cleared his throat and unfolded the white piece of paper. His glasses sat far down on the bridge of his nose as he looked at the paper and began to read from it.</p><p>\u201cHello family. If you\u2019re sitting around the dining room table listening to this, then that means one thing: I\u2019ve finally kicked the bucket. Connor, make sure your scotch is a double as you\u2019re listening to me because you always needed a double during my lectures. Now, I want you all to listen very carefully to what I\u2019m about to say. This is my funeral and I\u2019m the host. I want you all to dry the tears because there will be no crying at my funeral. So, I\u2019m going to give you all a moment to compose yourselves so we can get on with this.\u201d</p><p>We all just sat there and looked at each other. The lawyer told us to take five minutes to talk and to get anything we needed before moving on. My dad got up, walked into the living room, and straight over to the bar. I followed behind him.</p><p>\u201cYour mom wants a glass of red wine. Could you please get her a glass and I\u2019ll pour you a scotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Dad. Make it a double,\u201d I said with a small smile.</p><p>I walked to the kitchen and poured a glass of wine for my mom and Amelia. I grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge for Julia and walked back to the dining room.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, Mom,\u201d I said as I set down the glass in front of her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart,\u201d she replied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat down and handed Amelia her wine and Julia her water. The lawyer entered the room and took his seat, where he continued to read from the white paper.</p><p>\u201cNow that everyone has gotten what they needed, we can move on. Connor, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re cussing me out about now and went and got your double scotch. But anyway, here are my wishes. Once you have my body cremated, I want you to spread my ashes across the Pacific Ocean. Thank you, Connor and Ellery, for taking care of me all these years. Words can never express how much I love you both. Julia and Collin, watching you grow up was the best part of my life and watching Connor struggle trying to be the perfect father was the highlight. Connor, you did well and I hope that I had a hand in helping you make the right decisions in your life. Jake, you and Julia are going to make wonderful parents and any child of yours is going to be blessed and incredibly lucky. Ellery, you were always a daughter to me and we\u2019ve been through a lot together over the years. In fact, you and Connor exhausted me more times than I want to remember with all of your stubbornness. But it was a part of my life that I would never change. If he gets out of line, slap him around a few times and tell him it\u2019s from me.\u201d</p><p>We all let out a soft laugh and my dad smiled.</p><p>\u201cCollin, a true chip off the old block. You are definitely your father\u2019s son and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of you, just like I was of him. Watching you grow into a man has been a great journey for me and I\u2019m proud to have considered you my grandson. Julia, you\u2019re a beautiful young woman and I wish I could have stayed around to see that baby boy of yours, but the gods have called me home. You\u2019re just like your mom and watching you grow up and defy your dad the way you did was priceless. I am proud to have considered you my granddaughter. Connor, I have a separate letter for you to read alone because I don\u2019t need you getting all sappy on me. You can call me a fool, but these are my wishes. Black Family, you have given me more out of life than I can ever thank you for. I love you all very much, so don\u2019t go getting used to the idea that I\u2019m gone. I\u2019ll always be around, watching over all of you. Did you hear that, Connor? You aren\u2019t getting rid of me just yet. Now go get another drink, eat, and celebrate, Black Family. Peace to you all. Love, Denny.\u201d</p> <p>The lawyer reached in his briefcase and handed my dad a sealed envelope. My dad took it and put it in his suit pocket. We all got up from the table and hugged one another. I watched as my mom hugged my dad tightly. I put my arm around Amelia as we walked into the kitchen and Julia and I started to set out the food. My mom and dad walked in and hugged us one last time before we sat down to eat and talk about life with Denny.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>A week later, as I was sitting in my office, Julia walked in and handed me a file to sign off on. She sat down and she looked really uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m just ready to get this child out of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI bet.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>I looked over the papers and signed them. As I handed the folder to Julia, she stood up and then doubled over, holding her stomach. I jumped up from my chair and ran over to her.</p><p>\u201cJulia, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked as I lightly took hold of her arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, just a cramp. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d she said as she stood up.</p> <p>I let go of her arm and, as she began to walk out of my office, she doubled over again.</p><p>\u201cCollin, I think I\u2019m in labor,\u201d she said as she sat down on the floor of my office.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! You can\u2019t be. You\u2019re not due for another month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to your nephew.\u201d</p><p>I started to panic. This couldn\u2019t be happening right now. \u201cI\u2019ll call Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s across town in a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Julia. I\u2019ll call Dad.\u201d</p><p>I picked up my phone from the desk and dialed my dad. No answer. I called my mom. No answer. Julia let out another yell and I ran over to her.</p> <p>\u201cNo one is answering. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to the hospital!\u201d she yelled. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. Because if you do, then I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Okay, let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll get you there,\u201d I said as I helped her up.</p><p>I held on to her as we waited for the elevator. She had another contraction and everyone gathered around to see what was going on because she wasn\u2019t exactly quiet about it.</p><p>\u201cEveryone get back to work. I\u2019m taking Julia to the hospital. She\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened and we stepped inside. Once we got to the parking garage, I helped her into the Range Rover. I got in and, as I was pulling out, my dad called.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia is in labor. We\u2019re on our way to the hospital. You need to get a hold of Jake. Julia said he\u2019s in a meeting across town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. Okay. Your mom and I will get Jake and we\u2019ll meet you there. You tell Julia not to have that baby until we get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad said not to have the baby until they get there,\u201d I said as I looked at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. I\u2019ll try my best!\u201d she said with irritation.</p><p>Amelia wasn\u2019t doing clinicals today and I knew she was in class, but I sent her a text anyway as soon as I stopped at a red light.</p><p>\u201cOn my way to the hospital with Julia. She\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! I\u2019ll meet you there as soon as my class ends. How exciting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOH GOD IT HURTS!\u201d Julia screamed.</p><p>I reached over and grabbed her hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO IT WON\u201dT BE OKAY!\u201d she yelled at me.</p><p>I drove as fast as I could in New York midday traffic. To be honest, I was surprised we didn\u2019t get into an accident. I was swerving in and out of traffic and running basically every red light. Julia was in a lot of pain and my main focus was getting her to the hospital before her water broke in my Range Rover. My phone rang and it was Jake.</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cCollin, Julia isn\u2019t answering her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she left it at the office. Here; talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Julia seemed to calm down a little when she heard Jake\u2019s voice. Then, suddenly she screamed.</p><p>\u201cYOU BETTER GET YOUR ASS TO THE HOSPITAL IN TIME, JAKE JENSEN!\u201d</p><p>She threw the phone at me and I picked it up from my lap. \u201cDude, she\u2019s in a lot of pain. She really doesn\u2019t mean to be mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYES I DO!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>We finally arrived at the hospital and I grabbed a wheelchair and helped her into it. I wheeled her into the Emergency Room and the nurse immediately took us up to the Labor and Delivery Unit. She handed me paperwork to fill out and called me Mr. Jensen.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not her husband. I\u2019m her brother. Her husband, Jake, is on his way.\u201d</p><p>The nurse apologized and made me leave the room while Julia changed into the hospital gown. As soon as it was safe, I walked back in and walked over to Julia. I grabbed her hand, kissed it, and sat down in the chair next to her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early, Collin. I\u2019m scared. What if something\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, nothing\u2019s wrong with him. He\u2019s just an impatient little guy and he wants to come out and see the world.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>The nurse hooked Julia up to the fetal monitor and said that everything sounded great. She had a few more contractions that nearly broke my hand. The doctor came in and I left the room so he could examine her. When I walked back in, Julia had a big smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cI can have an epidural. The doctor is ordering it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Julia. You\u2019ll be pain free soon,\u201d I said as I dialed my dad. He didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>A few moments later, the anesthesiologist walked in with the epidural for Julia. Another contraction had come and, as I was holding her and helping her through it, she dug her nails so far into my arm that I started to bleed. I just bit down on my lip and didn\u2019t make a sound. Once her contraction was over, the anesthesiologist gave her the epidural. I had to look away because the needle was making me sick. God, it was a good thing she didn\u2019t see that. She lay back down and began to be comfortable. After the anesthesiologist left the room, my mom, dad, and Jake came busting through the door. All three of them ran to her side. Jake wouldn\u2019t stop kissing her and my mom instantly ran to the bathroom and wet a washcloth for her. My dad looked at me and smiled. He walked over put his arm around me and led me out into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cThank you, son, for taking care of your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Dad. She\u2019s lucky I was there.\u201d</p><p>He looked at my arm and saw the nail marks and the tiny bit of blood that emerged from them.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? It looks like she got you pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I smiled. \u201cShe just scared me a bit. God, all that yelling and shit. It was like she was possessed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. I remember your mother in labor with both of you. Trying times, son. Trying times.\u201d</p><p>We walked back into the room and my mom hugged me. \u201cThank God you were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a million, bro. I owe you big time,\u201d Jake said as he hugged me.</p><p>I pulled him over to the side and showed him my arm. \u201cYeah, you do.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cOuch. Sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>I kissed Julia on the head and told her I was going to see if Amelia was here yet. She smiled at me, and before I walked out the door, she called my name.</p><p>\u201cHey, Collin.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and turned around. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, sis.\u201d</p><p>I met Amelia in the lobby and we stopped at the coffee bar before heading back up to see Julia.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your arm?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>I sent a text message to my dad, asking if he, my mom, or Jake wanted anything. He texted me back saying that he and my mom were on their way down. I bought Amelia and me some coffee and we sat down, waiting for my parents.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to be an uncle soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d go into labor this soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said that the baby is fine and seems to be ready to make his appearance into the world.\u201d I smiled. \u201cDo you want kids?\u201d I asked out of the clear blue.</p><p>She laid her head on my shoulder. \u201cYeah. I love kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked as she lifted her head and looked at me. \u201cAre you worried that I\u2019m going to say five or six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you really don\u2019t want that many, do you?\u201d I asked with nervousness.</p><p>She laughed as my parents walked up to us and she never did answer my question. As much as I loved and wanted children, I thought two was perfect.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to be a grandma!\u201d my mom said with excitement as she hugged Amelia.</p><p>\u201cDo I dare ask what you were doing in the middle of the afternoon and why you weren\u2019t at the office?\u201d I said to my dad.</p><p>He looked at me and smiled. \u201cDo you really want to know the answer to that?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes because I already knew. I looked at him and my mom and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \u201cYour father came home because he left some papers on his desk that he needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. No details, please. I already got my answer.\u201d</p><p>All of our phones beeped at the same time and, when we looked at them, there was a text message from Jake.</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S TIME!\u201d</p><p>My mom and dad jumped up from their chairs and ran to the elevators. I took Amelia\u2019s hand and we waited in the waiting room while my mom and dad stayed with Julia. She told them that she wanted both of them in the room to witness the birth of their first grandchild.</p><p>\u201cYou never answered my question,\u201d I said as I kissed Amelia\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat question?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe one about how many kids you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re nervous?\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Mr. Black. I think two children are perfect. But if a third happened unexpectedly, that would be okay too.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I leaned over and kissed her cheek. She was on the same page as I was regarding kids and I couldn\u2019t be happier.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019ve made you happy with my answer.\u201d She smiled as she gently squeezed my hand. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have and I love you just as much.\u201d</p><p>We waited patiently and, after about an hour, my dad came out of Julia\u2019s room with the biggest smile on his face that I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cHe has arrived.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and hugged my dad. He was so happy. We followed him into the room and I stopped in the doorway and stared at my big sister holding her brand new baby. I couldn\u2019t help the tears that filled my eyes as she looked at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on in and meet your nephew, Brayden Connor Jensen.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my dad and he had tears in his eyes. I walked over to Julia and she handed me the baby. I was a nervous wreck to hold him because he was small. For as big as Julia was, I expected him to be bigger. But I didn\u2019t dare say anything.</p><p>\u201cBrayden, I want you to meet your Uncle Collin. He\u2019s going to be the best uncle in the world and spoil you rotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, little dude. You are so loved already,\u201d I said as I rubbed his tiny hand.</p> <p>Julia reached her hand over and touched my arm. \u201cThank you for taking care of me until Jake got here. I\u2019m sorry about your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, sis, and you\u2019re welcome.\u201d I winked.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>I opened my eyes and took in the scent of roses that I loved so much on Amelia. She was wrapped up in my arms and snuggled tightly against my chest. I felt weighted down by the fact that I never told her about the beach house. Now that winter was settling in, the house was closed up until I decided to open it up next summer. She stirred in my arms and let out a big yawn as she opened her beautiful blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, baby.\u201d I smiled as I kissed her head.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, considering we had three rigorous workouts last night, I\u2019d say I am.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cAh, what amazing workouts those were too.\u201d</p><p>She kissed my chest and got out of bed. She looked sexy as hell in her silk black nightie that I bought for her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make us some coffee. Stay right there and don\u2019t move.\u201d She pointed.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d I saluted.</p><p>I smiled as I put my hands behind my head and thought about last night. My phone rang; my dad was calling.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, son. I wanted to let you know that Diana called in today because Jacob is in the hospital. Why don\u2019t you take the morning off and go visit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you this afternoon.\u201d Click.</p><p>Amelia walked back in the room and handed me a cup of coffee. \u201cDid I hear you talking to someone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. That was my dad. Jacob is back in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. That\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I drop you off at the hospital, I\u2019m going to stay and visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, sweetie,\u201d she said as she leaned over and kissed me. \u201cJacob will be thrilled to see you.\u201d</p><p>We both took a shower and got ready to leave. I pulled into the parking lot, parked the Range Rover, and walked with Amelia into the hospital.</p><p>\u201cBye, baby. Have a good day,\u201d I said as I kissed her.</p><p>\u201cBye, sweetheart. Let me know how Jacob\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>She went right and I went left. I took the elevator up to the pediatric floor and one of the nurses showed me to Jacob\u2019s room. When I walked in, he was lying in the bed, hooked up to a breathing mask, and Diana was sitting next to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro.\u201d I smiled from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHi, Collin. What are you doing here?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cMy dad called me and told me that Jacob was here and I wanted to check in and make sure he\u2019s doing okay,\u201d I said as I walked over to him and placed my hand on his arm.</p><p>He gave me a thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cThat is very sweet of you and I know Jacob is thrilled you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He gave another thumbs up. He couldn\u2019t talk because he was in the middle of getting a treatment. I felt bad for him and it really hurt me to see him lying there like that. It was something he\u2019d dealt with his whole life, but it was new to me and I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever get used to it.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy. As soon as you get out of here, I\u2019m going to come over and spend the day with you. We can do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>I told Diana to go and take a break and get some breakfast. She\u2019d been by his side the entire night and I could see that she was exhausted. She took me up on my offer, knowing that I\u2019d be there with Jacob. Sitting on the table next to his bed was the book Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I picked it up and looked at it.</p><p>\u201cWas your mom reading this to you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded his head. I opened to the page that was saved with a bookmark and looked it over.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to read it to you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. I smiled and began reading where Diana had left off.</p><p>I\u2019d spent half the day with Jacob. It was time for me to get to the office because I had a meeting to attend. I kissed Diana on the cheek as she said goodbye to me, and I ran my hand through Jacob\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cYou better call me when you get out of here. Got it?\u201d I pointed at him.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>As I stepped into the board room, my dad was already sitting down, going over the notes for the meeting.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jacob doing?\u201d he asked as he looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dad. It was terrible seeing him like that. We need to talk after the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, son.\u201d</p><p>Once the meeting was over, I followed my dad into his office. I walked over to the refrigerator and grabbed a bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cSit down. What did you want to talk about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think you should rent the house in California to Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this ever since I took Jacob surfing at the beach house. He was so much better there. You even mentioned it to me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have water-related programs for children with cystic fibrosis and I think the quality of life would be so much better for both him and Diana.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and cocked his head. \u201cCollin, you want me to move my secretary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know she\u2019s good here, but she can be just as good in California. I know Reese just quit the art gallery to stay home and raise her baby. You can give that job to Diana. She\u2019s a smart woman and I know she can do it. It\u2019s close to the house and Jacob can meet other kids in the programs there that are like him. I just think California would be a better place for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, I know you want to help them, but you just can\u2019t tell someone they have to move across the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Jacob is everything to her and she\u2019d do whatever she could to make him better. Plus, Mason is close by since they moved back there and he could kind of act as a big brother to him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Collin.

Also, I want our company to start hosting charity events for cystic fibrosis. After all these years, you never branched out from the autism charities.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair with his hands behind his head. \u201cNow that is a great idea. I\u2019ll have Barb get started on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give some serious thought to your proposal and get back with you in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said as I got up from my chair.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, have you told Amelia yet about the house you purchased?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, Dad. I will, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>I told him not to worry when it was constantly a worry on my mind. As I walked out of the building into the freezing cold, my phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart. I\u2019m having family dinner tonight and I expect you and Amelia to be here. I know it\u2019s last minute, but I just decided it. Julia, Jake, and the baby will be here. So if you have plans, cancel them, and I\u2019ll see you around six.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have plans, but even if I did, I would have no choice but to cancel them because what my mom says goes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there, Mom. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you too, my sweet boy.\u201d</p><p>As I was walking down the street to Starbucks, I passed the flower shop. I stopped and decided to buy Amelia some roses. It was no special occasion. I just wanted to let her know in another way that I loved her. While I was looking at the beautiful assortment of roses, my phone buzzed with a text message from Amelia.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe. Clinicals ended early and I need to stop by the campus library and pick up a book. I\u2019m going to catch a cab with Cheri and then I\u2019ll take one to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Amelia. You and Cheri stay at the hospital. I\u2019ll send Ralph over to pick you both up and then take you where you need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. I\u2019ll see you later. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, babe. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>I immediately called Ralph and had him pick up the girls. I told the sales clerk that I wanted two dozen red roses. As she was getting them together, I heard a voice behind me.</p> <p>\u201cFancy seeing you in here.\u201d</p><p>I turned around. \u201cHi, Hailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuying flowers for your girlfriend?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I am. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason. I just saw you standing here when I was walking by and thought I\u2019d drop in and say hi.\u201d</p><p>The clerk handed me the roses with a smile and I gave her my credit card. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve said hi and now it\u2019s time to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for Paris in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. You always liked Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe I\u2019ll meet some hot French dude who will sweep me off my feet with his incredible French accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you do, Hailey. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to get going. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>I began to walk away and stopped when I heard her next words.</p><p>\u201cTell me one more thing. Does she make you happier than I ever did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She does,\u201d I said as I closed my eyes and lowered my head.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy. See ya around sometime, Collin,\u201d she said as she placed her hand on my back and then walked away.</p><p>My phone started to ring and, when I pulled it from my pocket, I noticed it was my dad calling.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDown the street at the flower shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Do me a favor and pick up some roses for your mom and then you can drive me home since you sent Ralph on an errand.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. I forgot he didn\u2019t drive to the office himself. \u201cOkay, Dad. What color roses for Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe creative and get a mix of colors. I\u2019ll meet you in the parking garage.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and walked back up to the counter. The clerk smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I need two dozen roses in a variety of colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Mr. Black. This wouldn\u2019t happen to be for your mom, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She made up a bouquet of colorful roses and handed them to me. I left the store still thinking about the question Hailey asked me and the sadness in her voice when I answered her. My phone rang. It was my dad again.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cPick up some pink roses for your sister.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and sighed. \u201cOkay, Dad.\u201d</p><p>I walked back into the flower shop and the woman smiled at me again.</p><p>\u201cI need two dozen pink roses, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSister?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad always bought her pink roses. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She handed me the roses and, before I left the store, I dialed my dad.</p><p>\u201cHello, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I leave the flower shop, is there anyone else you want flowers for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just your mom and Julia. I\u2019m assuming you went there to buy Amelia flowers, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re all set. Hurry up and get back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d I said as I hung up.</p><p>I stepped into the apartment and Amelia came from the direction of the kitchen. The corners of her mouth curved up when she saw the roses I was holding.</p><p>\u201cAre those for me?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo. Some girl at the office gave them to me.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face was priceless. She stood there and narrowed her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s new. Anyway, she told me she loved me and then gave me these. Aren\u2019t they pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you that she loved you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Isn\u2019t that weird? I was totally flattered and she was really hot. But I guess if you want the flowers, you can have them.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNO THANKS!\u201d she said in a huff and walked away.</p><p>Okay, maybe I took that a little too far. Now I needed to make things right. \u201cOf course these are for you, baby. I was just teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, Collin. In fact, I\u2019m just going to stay at my place tonight.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. What the fuck had I done? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAmelia, I was teasing. Please, baby. We have dinner with my parents tonight. They\u2019re expecting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can tell your parents about the girl at the office!\u201d she spat.</p><p>She was looking around the apartment for her shoes. \u201cAmelia, please. These are for you. I\u2019m sorry I teased you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I don\u2019t think you were teasing and I just really need to be alone right now, Collin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? How are you getting back to your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cab like every other New Yorker,\u201d she said as she opened the door.</p><p>I walked up behind her and slammed it shut. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and looked at me. \u201cAre you hurting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Really bad right now.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cGood. That\u2019ll teach you to fuck with me, Mr. Black.\u201d She laughed and ducked under my arm.</p><p>\u201cAMELIA!\u201d I exclaimed as I started chasing her around the apartment.</p><p>She laughed as she ran through the kitchen. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wait until I catch you. You\u2019re going to be punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if it involves you holding my wrists above my head and a wall.\u201d</p><p>I stopped dead center in the middle of the apartment. She stopped and turned around.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Really.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cNow or after we get back from my parents\u2019 house?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She twisted her face and looked around. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d I said as I unbuttoned my pants.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, you\u2019re hot,\u201d I said breathlessly as I pulled out of her.</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you get me all wound up?\u201d She smiled.</p> <p>I let go of her wrists and gently kissed each one. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did. But it hurt so good, babe.\u201d She winked.</p><p>I kissed the tip of her nose and looked at the clock that hung on the wall.</p><p>\u201cSHIT! It\u2019s six fifteen. My mom is going to kill me,\u201d I said as I ran and grabbed my pants.</p><p>I picked up Amelia\u2019s clothes off the floor and threw them at her. \u201cHurry up and get dressed. We were supposed to be there fifteen minutes ago. The one thing my mom hates is when people are late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin. Calm down.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh no. This is no laughing matter.\u201d I said as my phone rang. I picked it up from the table and it was my mom. \u201cSee. I told you,\u201d I said as I showed her the phone.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Amelia said as she ran and grabbed her shoes.</p><p>We ran out the door and up the stairs to the penthouse. There was no time to wait for an elevator. I opened the door and as soon as we walked in, my mom came scurrying from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer when I called you?\u201d she asked as she pointed at me and then hugged Amelia.</p><p>\u201cWe were almost here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo sit down. Dinner is almost ready.\u201d</p><p>We walked into the dining room and my dad smirked at me. I walked over to Julia and gave her a kiss on her cheek. I bent down and took the little hand of my nephew.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brayden.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>As soon as dinner was finished, I took Brayden from Julia and walked into the living room. My dad was already sitting down with his after dinner scotch in hand.</p><p>\u201cYour shirt is buttoned wrong. Is that the reason you were late? Amelia must have really liked those roses.\u201d He winked.</p><p>A wide grin spread across my face. \u201cShe loved them and that is the reason I was late. I lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d He smiled as he held up his glass.</p><p>Brayden started crying and I tried to rock him back and forth. It wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cDad. Help me. Why\u2019s he crying?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s hungry. Here, let me take him for a moment.\u201d He got up and took him from my arms. Holding Brayden made my dad happy. He just hadn\u2019t been quite the same since Denny passed away. My mom and I had a conversation about it and she said that all my dad needed was time. I walked over to the fireplace where Denny\u2019s ashes sat in an urn.</p><p>\u201cDad, when are you spreading his ashes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could all go next month. Brayden will be a little over two months old and Amelia will be on semester break from school, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s set. We\u2019ll go right after Christmas and spend a couple of weeks there. It will give me time to arrange things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings for Jacob and Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave it some more thought after you left and I think you\u2019re right. It would be the best thing for them. But only if Diana wants to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her and Jacob to California with us. That way, she can spend a couple of weeks there and get the feel for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already planned on it, son.\u201d</p><p>I walked over and gave him a light hug, being extra careful not to squish Brayden. \u201cI know I don\u2019t say it enough, but I love you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201d Julia asked.</p><p>\u201cJust having a father/son chat,\u201d my dad replied.</p><p>Amelia and my mom walked in the room and my mom took Brayden from my dad.</p><p>\u201cI have an announcement to make,\u201d my dad said as everyone quieted down. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re going to fly to California for a couple of weeks, as a family, and spread Denny\u2019s ashes right after Christmas. That way, we can spend the holiday in New York and then spend New Year\u2019s in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the company, Dad?\u201d Julia asked.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, princess. The company will be fine without us for a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>Amelia looked at me and smiled. I couldn\u2019t have been happier to take her to California with me. The only thing that worried me were the horrific memories of what had happened there.</p><p>Amelia and I walked hand in hand down the streets of New York, looking at all the Christmas lights and decorations that lit up the city. She was in an exceptionally good mood because her classes had ended and she completed her first round of clinicals. I wanted this Christmas to be special for her and one she\u2019d never forget. She told me that she had spent the past two Christmases alone. My heart broke when I heard that because no one should spend the holidays alone. We stopped at Starbucks before meeting my family over at FAO Schwarz. Julia and Jake wanted to take Brayden to see Santa Claus and do some shopping. She wanted it to be a family affair and then my dad wanted all of us to go see the tree at Rockefeller Center. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis coffee tastes exceptionally good right now,\u201d Amelia said.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m freezing and it feels good to have something hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can warm you up and inject you with some hot liquids if you\u2019d like.\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you up on that offer when we get back to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove in with me,\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Amelia. I want you to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already practically live there,\u201d she said.</p> <p>I grabbed her hand from across the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. I want all your stuff there. Your clothes, your makeup, all your girly things. I want it all to invade my bathroom and closet space. I want you in my bed twenty-four-seven and I want to know that there isn\u2019t any other place for you to go. I want my home to be your home, our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, that\u2019s so sweet,\u201d some girl sitting at the table next to us said. Amelia looked at her and laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever say things like that to me?\u201d the girl said as she reached across the table and smacked the guy she was with.</p><p>He looked over at me. \u201cDude, thanks a lot.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled as I squeezed Amelia\u2019s hand. Her beautiful blue eyes, which put me in a trance every time I looked into them, stared at me.</p><p>\u201cYes. I will move in with you and the only reason why is because you give amazing sex!\u201d She winked.</p><p>The girl at the table next to us reached over and once again smacked her boyfriend.</p> <p>I stood up with the biggest smile on my face and wrapped my arms around Amelia. \u201cI love you so much, baby. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>I hooked my arm around her and we walked out of Starbucks. All the way down to FAO Schwarz, I kept kissing her cheek and pulling her into me. We stepped inside and I saw Julia and Jake by the stuffed animals.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis,\u201d I yelled.</p><p>She smiled as she held up her arm and waved us over. I bent down and gave Brayden a kiss as he lay asleep in his stroller. \u201cHe\u2019s such a good boy,\u201d I said to Julia and Jake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you think that. I\u2019ll be calling you tonight when he\u2019s up screaming his head off at three in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no thanks.\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>My mom and dad walked up behind us and my mom kissed my cheek and then looked at me strangely.</p> <p>\u201cYou have that look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe same look your father gets when he\u2019s really happy about something. What\u2019s going on?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I looked at my dad and he rolled his eyes. \u201cWell, I do have some news that I\u2019m really excited about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me Amelia\u2019s not pregnant,\u201d my dad said with seriousness.</p><p>\u201cNO, Dad! I\u2019ve asked Amelia to officially move in with me and she said yes!\u201d</p><p>I watched as my dad let out a sigh of relief. \u201cCongratulations, son. Congratulations, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Jake and Julia said.</p><p>My mom stood there and stared at me with tears in her eyes. \u201cMom. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m happy for the both of you. It\u2019s just my little boy is a man now and you\u2019ve moved out and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Mom,\u201d I said as I hugged her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ellery. Let\u2019s take our grandson to see Santa,\u201d my dad said as he put his arm around her.</p><p>As Julia pushed the stroller and we followed behind, I saw the Big Piano. \u201cJulia, look!\u201d</p><p>She stopped and smiled when she saw it. \u201cRemember when we used to play that as kids?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCome on; let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>The two of us stepped on the piano. \u201cDo you remember what we used to play?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d she said as she stepped on a note.</p><p>My mom stood in front of us and took a video with her phone. My dad stood next to her with a wide smile across his face. When we finished our song, Julia and I pulled Jake and Amelia in with us and we goofed around, playing all kinds of tunes.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, children, but there\u2019s a baby here who wants to see Santa and the line is getting longer by the minute,\u201d my mom said.</p><p>We laughed and stepped off the piano. When Julia set Brayden in Santa\u2019s arms, he screamed and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. As soon as they took his picture, I called Amelia and my family up and we all had our picture taken together with Santa.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, baby.\u201d I smiled as I rolled on top of her and kissed her lips.</p><p>\u201cMhmm... Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I rolled off of her and reached under the bed where I stored one of her Christmas gifts.</p><p>\u201cI would like you to open this now.\u201d I smiled as I handed her the small velvet box.</p><p>\u201cCollin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d</p><p>She slowly tipped the lid up and stared at the ring that sat inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a promise ring. I hope you like it.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes as she took it out of the box. \u201cI absolutely love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the inscription.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise forever with you,\u201d she read.</p><p>A tear fell down her cheek. I took the ring from her and held her left hand. \u201cWould you wear it on your left hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s no other finger that I\u2019d want to wear it on,\u201d she cried.</p><p>I placed the ring on the finger of her left hand and brought it up to my lips as I softly kissed it. \u201cThis ring is my promise to you. A promise of a future together and a promise of me being with only you. This ring also is my promise to marry you some day because I can\u2019t see spending my life without you. With this ring, I promise you forever and always and my forever love.\u201d</p><p>I held on to her hand as she cried and wrapped her arm around me, pulling me down on top of her. \u201cYou have changed my entire life, Collin. I was in a really bad place and, somehow, you were the only one that brought me back from it. I promise you that I\u2019ll never take off this ring. You have my love forever.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as my mouth crashed into hers and we made love for the next hour. Of course, we were late getting upstairs to celebrate Christmas with my family, but when we walked in and my mom saw Amelia wearing the ring, she smiled and kissed me.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>We were on the plane headed to California and Jacob was in his glory with the new X-box games I had bought him for Christmas. He and Jake played on the plane while Julia and I had a conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Amelia and California,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to her about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and she hasn\u2019t mentioned it either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Collin. You\u2019ll be there with her and for her if she starts to freak out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been on a boat yet and I\u2019m a little scared about how she\u2019s going to react when we get ready to spread Denny\u2019s ashes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lot stronger now than she was when you first met her. I\u2019ve seen an incredible change in her. Give her some credit; she\u2019ll be just fine. And if not, you\u2019ll know how to help her.\u201d</p><p>I looked across the plane at my parents fussing over Brayden. \u201cLook at them,\u201d I said. \u201cThey are so happy to have Brayden around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Julia laughed. \u201cMom said she\u2019s babysitting full-time when I go back to work. I can\u2019t wait to see Mason and Landon again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they\u2019re excited to us. I talked to Mason about Jacob and he said if things work out with them moving to Cali, then he\u2019ll be more than happy to visit with him.\u201d</p> <p>Amelia walked over and sat down with us. \u201cYou should see Jake and Jacob playing that game. They\u2019re crazy good at it.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>I put my arm around her and kissed her head. \u201cI love you, baby,\u201d I said as worry consumed me the closer we got to California.</p><p>Mason and Landon had a car waiting for us at the airport. As soon as we stepped off the plane, Mason yelled, \u201cOh my God, give me that baby!\u201d</p><p>Julia handed Brayden over to him and the rest of us didn\u2019t exist. \u201cWhat about me, Uncle Mason? I was your baby, remember?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cPfft, Collin. You\u2019re a man now. I\u2019ll shower you and the princess when I\u2019m done with this little prince.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Landon hugged us all and I introduced him to Amelia, Diana, and Jacob. We all got into the limo and drove to the house. The housekeeper, Louise, a short woman with short black hair, took care of the house when no one was staying there. I\u2019d known her since I was little. We usually traveled to California three to four times a year to check on the art gallery and to visit friends. It was mostly when Julia and I were on break from school. The last time I was here was right before Hailey and I broke up.</p> <p>\u201cMy babies,\u201d Louise said as we walked up the driveway.</p><p>\u201cHi, Louise.\u201d I smiled as I hugged her.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this? This isn\u2019t Hailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Louise. Hailey and I haven\u2019t been together in almost a year. This is Amelia and she\u2019s the love of my life.\u201d</p><p>Louise held out her arms to Amelia. \u201cIf you make him happy, then welcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Amelia smiled.</p><p>We went inside the house and I started to take our bags up to our room.</p><p>\u201cAhem,\u201d Julia said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked as I stopped on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAre you two sharing a room?\u201d She smiled. \u201cBecause I do believe that when Jake and I went to Aspen with the family for Thanksgiving, Daddy wouldn\u2019t allow us to share a room because we weren\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Julia? Because I remember that you were only eighteen years old. Wait a minute. I seem to remember Jake sneaking into your room every night after Mom and Dad went to bed. So you did share a room.\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cJULIA ROSE!\u201d my dad said rather loudly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Collin!\u201d she yelled as she chased me up the stairs.</p><p>I heard my mom laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>Julia tried to tackle me on the bed and then I heard Brayden crying. \u201cYour baby is crying. Shouldn\u2019t you go and see what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you back, little brother. When you least expect it.\u201d She smiled as she walked out of the room.</p><p>I sat down on the bed, trying to catch my breath, and Amelia lay down on her back next to me. \u201cYou and Julia have such an awesome relationship. It reminds me of the relationship I had with my sister. God, do I miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, baby,\u201d I said as I leaned over and kissed her. \u201cCome on; let\u2019s go downstairs and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d I grabbed her hand and helped her up from the bed.</p><p>She went into the kitchen with the other women and I stepped outside in the back. I looked straight ahead at the water and watched a boat go by. We were set to spread Denny\u2019s ashes in a few days and I had an idea that would possibly help Amelia feel more comfortable on the boat. I\u2019d put my plan in motion tomorrow. Tonight, I just wanted to spend every minute I could with my girl and my family.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Amelia asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d I said as I drove down the road.</p><p>I feared the reaction I was going to get when we arrived at our destination. I didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do. I pulled into the parking lot and she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here at the marina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to show you something,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing here is boats.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her and, when she looked at me, I saw the fear in her eyes. Not only did I see fear, I swore I saw a touch of hate. I parked the car and, when I opened the door to get out, Amelia said, \u201cI\u2019m not getting out of this car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia, please, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d she spat as she folded her arms.</p><p>\u201cFine. Then you can sit in the car. But I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>I got out and shut the door behind me. I began walking towards the dock of the marina, hoping she\u2019d change her mind. She didn\u2019t. I sat down on one of the docks that was close to the parking lot. Maybe this was a mistake. Or maybe not. Even if it was her decision never to get on a boat again, decisions are made to be changed. I sat there for two hours and thought about Amelia and how maybe I was the one being unfair. What it came down to was that I needed to respect her choice. It was her choice not to get on a boat. I couldn\u2019t force her to do something that she was so against. Even though taking her in the water worked the first time, this was different. I took in a deep breath and began to get up, when I heard a voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to show me?\u201d</p><p>I stood up and stared at her before I took hold of her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s over this way,\u201d I said.</p><p>I led her to the sailboat that I had rented for the day and she stood on dock and stared at it. \u201cYou told me how much you once loved boats and how you felt at peace on the open water. I want to give that back to you, Amelia. I don\u2019t want you to fear anything anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t say a word, but her hand tightened around mine. We stepped up onto the boat and she immediately went and sat down, gripping the side of the boat as tightly as she could. I stood there and watched as her legs began to shake.</p><p>What the fuck did I do? What was I thinking?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby,\u201d I said as I kneeled down in front of her and placed my hands on her knees. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for this to be so hard on you. Let\u2019s go. I\u2019m taking you back to the house,\u201d I said as I held out my hand.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI made the decision to come out here and I will stay. I spent the last two hours thinking, and I\u2019m not turning back now. I can\u2019t. I have to do this. You\u2019re right. I can\u2019t live my life in fear anymore. You\u2019ve taught me to enjoy life again. You\u2019ve given me hope and security and love. The least I can do is try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, babe,\u201d I said as I wrapped my arms around her and held her tight. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing woman, but I don\u2019t want you to make yourself sick over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to sail?\u201d she asked with a whisper.</p><p>\u201cMe? Of course I know how to sail. I\u2019m the master at sailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen undock this boat and let\u2019s go. You need to do it now before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d I said as I kissed her on the lips and got ready to set sail.</p> <p>I was having a hard time getting the boat to the appropriate speed.</p><p>\u201cCollin, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, baby. Just relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wind is coming from the other side. You have to change the direction of the boat,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, babe. Just hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she huffed as she got up from her seat. \u201cI thought you said you knew how to sail?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d she said as I stepped out of the way and she took over.</p><p>Mission accomplished. I smiled to myself.</p><p>I stood behind her and wrapped my arms around her as she sailed the boat out into the open ocean. The light wind swept across our faces and the ocean air was as refreshing as ever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful out here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt sure is, baby. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. But, I can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember how it used to feel before the accident.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to. But it\u2019s hard, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you\u2019re doing great. Tiny steps, baby. Tiny steps.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head around and looked at me with a small smile. I leaned down and kissed her soft lips, and we continued to sail for the next couple of hours. I never once let go of her. Whether I was holding onto her waist or just holding her hand, I wanted her to feel safe.</p><p>We docked the boat and, as soon as we stepped off, Amelia grabbed me and wrapped her arms around me as tightly as she could.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. That\u2019s all,\u201d she said.</p><p>I closed my eyes as I kissed the top of her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. You were the one who made the choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA choice I never would have made if you didn\u2019t give me that little push.\u201d</p><p>I broke our embrace and kissed her lips. \u201cI love you, and I just want you to be at peace with your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am because of you.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>\u201cIs everyone ready?\u201d my dad asked.</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d Julia smiled as she held Brayden.</p><p>Today was the day that we were going to spread Denny\u2019s ashes across the Pacific. I held on tightly to Amelia\u2019s hand as we stepped onto the yacht.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d My dad smiled as he put his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She smiled at both me and my dad.</p><p>It was the perfect day. The sky was bright blue and the sun was shining brightly. Up on deck was a spread of cheese, crackers, an assortment of fruit, and bottles of wine and champagne.</p><p>\u201cOkay; everyone listen up,\u201d my dad announced. \u201cI want to thank everyone for being here today. This is exactly what Denny wanted and, even though I wasn\u2019t very pleased at first, I\u2019m happy to do this. It has brought us all together and Denny was a huge part of this family. So I want everyone to eat, drink, and enjoy the ride. As soon as we get out far enough, we\u2019ll spread his ashes over the water, as he wished.\u201d</p><p>My mom walked over and sat down next me as I watched Amelia stand next to Jacob. The two of them leaned against the rails and looked at the ocean water.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGet Amelia to overcome her fear of boats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took her to the marina and prayed that she\u2019d sail with me. It took a couple of hours for her to come around, but she finally did, and I helped her through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful girl, and I\u2019m so happy you found her.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cShe found me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like I found your father. I guess your bad behaviors had their rewards. You sure are your father\u2019s son and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of you. He told me about the cystic fibrosis charity you want the company to start running. I think it\u2019s a wonderful idea and what you\u2019ve already done for Diana and Jacob is really heartwarming. You\u2019re an amazing man, Collin, and you\u2019re my sweet boy.\u201d She smiled as she brought her hand up to my cheek with tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMom, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. You and Julia have made me and your father so proud.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around her and kissed her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s because we have the best mom and dad in the world.\u201d</p><p>My dad announced that it was time to scatter the ashes and for everyone to gather around. He first made sure we all had drinks in our hands. Amelia walked over to me and put her arm around my waist. We all stood and watched as my dad took the lid off the urn and let Denny\u2019s ashes go.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, my friend. May you be at peace and have an eternity filled with happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Denny,\u201d I said as I held up my glass.</p><p>\u201cTo Denny,\u201d everyone followed.</p><p>Once the ashes were scattered and my dad dried his tears, he walked up to me and Julia and wrapped his arms around both of us. \u201cI love you two very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you too, Dad,\u201d Julia and I both said at the same time.</p><p>He patted us on our backs and smiled. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to go rescue my grandson from Mason.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stroked her hair as she lay in my arms, sound asleep. I watched her chest slowly move up and down with each breath. The fact that I still hadn\u2019t told her about the beach house was haunting me. I couldn\u2019t wait until the summer to tell her. I had to tell her as soon as we got back to New York. She opened her eyes and then closed them again as the corners of her mouth curved up. Her hand, which lay on my chest, moved down my torso and down the front of my underwear. She lightly took hold of my erection and opened one eye while she smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hard.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI always am when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s put that hard-on to good use, shall we?\u201d she asked as she climbed out from under my arms and got on top of me.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my kind of girl.\u201d I smiled as I took her breast in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re my kind of guy,\u201d she said as she slowly placed my cock inside her.</p><p>I thrust my hips as my teeth tugged on her erect nipple. She sat up, taking my entire length inside her as she let out a soft moan. Her hips moved back and forth as she rode me slowly. I threw my head back at the intense pleasure she was giving me. She was dripping wet and I could feel it running down my balls.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d she whispered as she continued to move.</p> <p>I reached up and grasped her breasts with my hands and kneaded them, paying special attention to her hard nipples, which my fingers liked to play with. Her hips started to move faster and I could feel her swelling around me.</p><p>\u201cDo it, baby. Come all over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin. Collin. Oh my God,\u201d she whispered as her body tightened and she released herself, forcing me to spill inside her.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I moaned and I thrust my hips up and stayed buried deep inside her.</p><p>She collapsed on top of me and buried her face into my neck. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what a good morning it is.\u201d I smiled as I kissed her head.</p> <p>Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. \u201cBreakfast is ready, you two,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad. We\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Amelia rolled off of me and started laughing. \u201cWhat if he would have walked in and saw me lying on top of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we would\u2019ve given him a show.\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cCollin, that\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. Did I ever tell you about the time he walked in on Julia having sex for the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead serious. Ask her about it some time. I thought he was going to murder her. Come on; we better get dressed and get downstairs before someone comes up here and breaks down the door.\u201d</p> <p>Louise made us an amazing breakfast, as always. I took my plate and joined my mom, dad, and Amelia outside on the patio. I looked down towards the beach and saw Jacob in the water with Mason.</p><p>\u201cSon, I want you to join me today when I talk to Diana. We\u2019re also going to take her to the art gallery. There\u2019s a house down the beach for sale. It\u2019s smaller. They don\u2019t need this big of a house for the two of them. I have the house on hold, and if Diana decides she wants to move here, then I\u2019ll rent it out to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad. Just let me know when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with her last night down on the beach and she told me how beautiful it was here and that she really liked it. So, we\u2019ll see. I called Joel at the art gallery and told him our plan. He said he\u2019s excited to meet Diana and he\u2019ll help in any way he can. Your mother and I had dinner last night with Ian and Rory and they said that they\u2019d also keep an eye on her and Jacob if she decided to move here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. It sounds like you have everything covered.\u201d</p><p>My mom and dad both got up from their seats. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re finished eating, we\u2019ll talk with her. Amelia can spend the day with your mom and Julia. They\u2019re going shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love to shop.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThey have the cutest little shops here. I can\u2019t wait to show you them and you don\u2019t have to worry about bringing any money because our shopping trip is on Connor today. Isn\u2019t it, sweetheart?\u201d She smiled as she ran her hand down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess it is. Feel free to buy whatever you like,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>They walked into the house and I leaned over and smiled at Amelia. \u201cMake sure you buy a lot and if you see anything you think I\u2019d like, buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin, stop that.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, and trust me, my mom will make you buy something.\u201d</p><p>We finished our breakfast and took our plates inside. I gave Louise a kiss on the cheek and thanked her for the great meal. Amelia went upstairs to change into a sundress to go shopping in, and I decided to go down to the beach to see Jacob and Mason. When I walked down, I saw a young girl talking to Jacob. I walked over to Mason, who was standing a few feet away from them.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mason. Who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. We were getting out of the water and she just came walking up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute. She\u2019s a cute kid.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, the girl left and Jacob walked over to where Mason and I were standing.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro. Who was that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Lexi and she lives in a house way down the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she hitting on you?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, Collin.\u201d He smiled back. \u201cShe has cystic fibrosis too,\u201d he said as we started walking towards the house.</p><p>\u201cReally? How did that come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe started coughing a little and it sounded like mine, so I told her that I cough like that sometimes, and she told me.\u201d</p><p>I could tell that Jacob was happy because he finally met someone that was like him. As we walked in the house, the women were getting ready to leave to go shopping and my dad had arranged for Jake and Mason to spend the day with Jacob. I gave Amelia a hug and kiss goodbye.</p><p>\u201cRemember, my dad\u2019s buying. Shop. Shop. Shop.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and playfully smacked me on the chest. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to talk about, Connor?\u201d Diana asked as we went and sat outside.</p><p>\u201cCollin, why don\u2019t you start?\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cYou two have me very nervous,\u201d Diana spoke.</p><p>I reached over and grabbed her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, Diana. I just don\u2019t know how to say this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you firing me?\u201d she asked with a look of fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, no!\u201d I said. I cleared my throat and took in a deep breath. \u201cI think you and Jacob need to move to California.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYeah, right. I can\u2019t move,\u201d she said as she looked at my dad.</p><p>\u201cYou saw how much better Jacob was at the beach house in the Hamptons and you see the difference in him since we got here to California. I think this would be the best place for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you to think that, Collin, and believe me, I would love to move here for Jacob, but it\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if my dad and I made it possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d she asked in confusion.</p><p>My dad took over. \u201cDiana, I have a house that\u2019s just down the beach that I am renting out and I want to rent it to you. I think it would make an incredible home for you and Jacob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Connor, what about my job?\u201d</p> <p>My dad looked away because he didn\u2019t want to lose her as his secretary. \u201cI have another job here for you. You\u2019d be making a little more money and you\u2019d still have all the same health benefits. But instead of working in an office setting, you\u2019d be working at my art gallery. It\u2019s only a twenty-minute drive from here.\u201d</p><p>Tears started to fill her eyes. \u201cI...I...I can\u2019t. You\u2019ve done way too much for me already and there\u2019s no way I could accept anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have programs here, Diana. Programs that work with kids and cystic fibrosis. It\u2019s way better here than in New York. Jacob loves the water. He loves the beach; you\u2019ve seen how happy it makes him, and today, he met a little girl who also has cystic fibrosis. Her name is Lexi and she lives in a house somewhere along the beach,\u201d I said.</p><p>The tears that filled her eyes began to stream down her face. My dad looked at me and shook his head. He placed his hand on her arm. \u201cNo tears, Diana. If you want to move here, we\u2019ll make it happen for you and Jacob. But the decision is completely yours. Would you like to go look at the house? Then, after, we\u2019ll take you to the art gallery.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head and my dad handed her a tissue. \u201cGreat; let\u2019s go see the house.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>We spent the rest of the afternoon looking at the house and then at the art gallery. My dad introduced Diana to Joel and they hit it off right away. I nudged my dad and he told me to knock it off. Diana seemed to love the house and the art gallery. I was almost positive she was going to move here.</p> <p>\u201cTake some time and think about it,\u201d my dad said to her. \u201cTalk to Jacob and see what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, Connor and Collin. I don\u2019t know what I ever did to deserve the two of you in my life. You are the most incredibly giving people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, stop.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>We drove back to the house and Diana told Jacob that just the two of them were going out for pizza because she had something she needed to talk to him about.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>We flew back to New York, back to the snow and cold. I wanted to stay longer in California, but there was business to be done and everyone had to get back to work or school. Amelia still had another week left before her classes and clinicals started up again. Diana had a long talk with Jacob and they both decided that they were going to move to California. On one hand, I was really happy because Jacob would be doing better, but on the other hand, I was sad because I was going to miss them both terribly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Amelia said as she sat down next to me on the couch.</p><p>\u201cNothing much. I was just thinking about how weird it\u2019s going to be not to see Jacob all the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. But you said yourself it\u2019s in his best interest to move to California. Plus, think of how happy he\u2019ll be and how much better he\u2019ll feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I said as I pulled her on to my lap. \u201cHave I told you today that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think you have. You better tell me.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Miss Gray, and tomorrow, we\u2019re going somewhere. Just me and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mr. Black. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out tomorrow, baby. Now, enough talk. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>She gave me her amazing smile and brushed her lips against mine. As our kiss became passionate and I practically had her shirt off, there was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cCollin, it\u2019s Julia. I tried to call you, but you didn\u2019t answer your phone.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Amelia and she laughed. I got up, adjusted myself, and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Julia. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you watch Brayden for a while? Jake and I need to run some errands and we\u2019d get done quicker if Brayden wasn\u2019t with us.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her as she held him in her arms. I knew my sister and I knew her well.</p><p>\u201cYou and Jake want to have sex with no baby in the house.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at Brayden. \u201cNo. Why would you say something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know when you lie, Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d she said sternly as she walked into my apartment. \u201cJake and I want some time alone because every time we start to make love, our sweet son starts to scream. I can\u2019t have an orgasm with my son screaming! I need to make love to my husband without any interruptions. Is that so much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, TMI!\u201d I said. I took my nephew from her arms and kissed her on the cheek. \u201cGo and spend some time with your husband. In fact, have sex a few times and don\u2019t worry about Brayden. Where are Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went out to dinner with Peyton and Henry. Thank you, Collin. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You know I\u2019m always here for you.\u201d</p><p>She set the diaper bag on the table, kissed Brayden goodbye, and headed back to her apartment. I stood in the middle of the room and looked at Amelia, who was smiling on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so sexy, holding him. I know you\u2019re going to be an amazing dad someday.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to the couch and sat down. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to make an amazing mom.\u201d</p><p>I leaned in to kiss her and Brayden started to cry. We both laughed and now I sort of saw what Julia was talking about.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d Amelia asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see when we get there.\u201d I smiled as I tapped her on the nose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We climbed into the Range Rover and headed towards the Hamptons. Worry consumed me because I didn\u2019t know how Amelia was going to react when I told her that I was the one who bought the house. A part of me said that she\u2019d be thrilled, while the other part said she was going to be pissed.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to The Hamptons?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t lie to her. \u201cYes,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s the middle of winter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but there\u2019s something there I want you to see.\u201d</p><p>We pulled onto the street of the beach house and I pulled into the driveway.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me, baby,\u201d I said as I took her hand and unlocked the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have a key to my old house?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is my house now. Our house. I\u2019m the one who bought it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why would you do that? Do you know how long ago that was and you\u2019ve been keeping it from me?\u201d she said in a raised voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m sorry. I wanted it to be the right time to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the right time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But what I do know is that I couldn\u2019t keep it from you anymore.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with daggers and shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you. Why would you buy this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I know how much it means to you. You said yourself that you didn\u2019t want to sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want you to buy it. Fuck, Collin. That really pisses me off! And then the fact that you kept it from me all these months.\u201d</p><p>She was mad. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen her this angry before. \u201cAmelia, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you keep something like that from me? If you could so easily hide that, then it makes me wonder what else you haven\u2019t told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. I\u2019ve never kept anything from you except this,\u201d I said as I raised my voice.</p><p>\u201cI want to leave right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just got here.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door and got in the Range Rover. I sighed and shook my head as I locked the front door and climbed in next to her. I reached over and grabbed her hand. She pulled away.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, please. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a small purchase. This was huge and it\u2019s just not something a boyfriend does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does if he has money,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo you think that because you have money, you can just do whatever the hell you want? I\u2019m so mad at you, Collin. Please, just don\u2019t say another word to me and take me home. I just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>I started the car and tore out of the driveway. There was complete silence the entire ride home. When we entered the apartment, Amelia went to the bedroom and took her bag from the closet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stay with Cheri for a couple of days at her apartment. I just can\u2019t stay here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia, please. Don\u2019t do this. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. For fuck\u2019s sake, I did this for you!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cI need to think. I need time alone. God, Collin. I can\u2019t believe you did that,\u201d she said as she walked out the door.</p><p>I paced back and forth throughout the apartment, trying to make rhyme or reason out of all of this. I went to my cabinet and grabbed a bottle of whiskey. I took a glass from the cupboard and sat down on the couch. I looked at the glass before I poured some whiskey and set it down on the table. Fuck the glass. I drank it straight from the bottle. I drank almost the whole bottle and I was trashed off my ass. I got up from the couch and fell onto the floor. The room was spinning and, when I closed my eyes, it was worse. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door and I heard my dad call my name.</p><p>\u201cCollin. What the hell is going on? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>The door was unlocked, and when I didn\u2019t answer him, he walked in and saw me lying on the floor. \u201cSon, what happened? Where\u2019s Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, you reek of whiskey.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his phone and I heard him talking to Jake.</p><p>\u201cJake, I need you to come across the hall and help me get Collin up to the penthouse. He\u2019s drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m not going to the penthouse,\u201d I slurred as I tried to get up, but managed to fall over.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. I don\u2019t want you alone when you\u2019re like this. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Jake walked in and came over to me. \u201cGo around to the other side and I\u2019ll grab this arm,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, you okay?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cShe packed a bag and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we got into a fight,\u201d I slurred as they picked me up and helped me up to the penthouse.</p><p>When we walked through the door, my dad called for my mom.</p><p>\u201cShit, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. What happened?\u201d she asked as she hurried to me.</p><p>\u201cYour son and his girlfriend must have gotten into an argument because she packed a bag and left and he drank a whole bottle of whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the whole thing,\u201d I slurred.</p><p>\u201cOh, Collin. Get him upstairs to his room,\u201d my mom said.</p><p>My dad and Jake set me down on my bed. My mom followed behind and lifted my shirt over my head.</p><p>\u201cOn your side, mister,\u201d she said.</p><p>I closed my eyes and all I could see was Amelia\u2019s face, along with the pain and hurt that splayed across it when she found out I was the one who bought the house. I needed to sleep to forget.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>I woke up, and when I looked at the clock, it was five thirty a.m. My head was pounding, so I decided to take a shower. After standing under the stream of hot water for almost twenty minutes, I stepped out and pulled on a pair of sweat pants I found in my drawer. I went downstairs, started the coffee, and gathered the ingredients for the cocktail. My parents were still asleep, so I tried to be as quiet as possible. I ran up the stairs to find my phone. It was lying on the floor in my pants pocket. I pulled it out, and before I looked at it, I prayed that there was a text message or call from Amelia. There wasn\u2019t. I went back to the kitchen and finished making my cocktail. A few moments later, my parents walked in.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me finish that for you. Go sit down, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d my dad asked as he poured some coffee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot real good,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about what happened between you and Amelia?\u201d</p><p>My mom set the cocktail down in front of me and I chugged it down to get it over with. \u201cI took her to the Hamptons yesterday, to the house. I told her that I bought it and she got pissed. She got really pissed and I don\u2019t understand why,\u201d I said as I put my head down on the table.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you kept something from her that you shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d my mom said.</p> <p>\u201cI told you, son, that you should\u2019ve told her about the house,\u201d my dad chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI remember someone doing the exact same thing. Not once, not twice, but at least three times, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Elle, and you know I regret each and every one of those times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I fucked up. What else is new? What am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>My mom walked over and kissed me on the head. \u201cAlcohol doesn\u2019t solve your problems. It only creates more. So the first thing you\u2019re going to do is lay off the booze. The second thing, find a way to make things right. You\u2019re your father\u2019s son. You can do it.\u201d</p> <p>She walked out of the kitchen and my dad sat across the table and looked at me. \u201cGive her time. She needs to think. You need to think. Don\u2019t call. Don\u2019t text. Just give her time. When she\u2019s ready, she\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done, Dad. I miss her like crazy already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, son. Trust me. Maybe send her a small text and tell her that you love her and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s the little things, you know? She\u2019ll forgive you. She loves you and love conquers all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. I\u2019m going to go into the office now. Do you want to drive with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ralph is driving me in. I have a meeting across town this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p> <p>I sat in my office, trying to concentrate on the work that needed to be done. I threw my pen across the desk and pulled out my phone.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>No response. I sighed and decided to go to the gym. I always kept a bag in my office for those spur-of-the-moment workouts. I walked into the gym and went straight to our private locker room to change into my swimming trunks. I grabbed a towel and headed to the pool. When I opened the door and walked in, I was shocked to see Julia, my mom, and Brayden in the water.</p><p>\u201cCollin, what are you doing here?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>\u201cI needed to work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your father know you\u2019re not at the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, cut me some slack. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I jumped in and swam over to Julia and Brayden. I took him from her arms and held him in the water.</p> <p>\u201cFirst swimming lesson?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Never too young to learn. How are you? Mom told me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a mess, as usual. Nothing new there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that. Amelia loves you and she\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s so upset. I thought I was doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s pissed off because you kept it from her and didn\u2019t talk to her about it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted it to be a surprise. She deserves surprises in her life.\u201d</p><p>Brayden started to fuss and I handed him back to Julia.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not Hailey, Collin. I know what you\u2019re thinking and I know you\u2019re scared. This is your first fight, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d I said as I looked down.</p><p>\u201cFirst fights are always the hardest. Don\u2019t worry; she\u2019ll be back in your arms before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Julia. I\u2019m going to do some laps now. I don\u2019t want to be gone too long because Dad will get pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Brayden is starting to prune. I better get him out of the water.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d I asked her as she got out of the pool.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. That\u2019s strange, that she just left like that.\u201d</p><p>Ellery</p><p>I hated seeing my son in pain again. It was bad enough what he went through after Hailey left him, and I didn\u2019t want to see him like that again. I quietly got out of the pool while Collin and Julia were talking and went to the locker room to call Amelia.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cHi, Amelia. It\u2019s Ellery. Would you like to have a late lunch with me? Say around two thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Ellery. Sure. I would like that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s meet at Aureole\u2019s. I\u2019ll call and make reservations for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>I went back to the pool and saw Julia and Brayden watching Collin do laps around the pool.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished swimming, Julia?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Brayden was turning into a prune. Where did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to make a phone call.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t call Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, and we\u2019re meeting for lunch at two thirty. Don\u2019t you mention this to your brother or your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Good luck. But I don\u2019t think you should get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want my son hurting and I would do the same for you.\u201d I smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go get this little guy back in his clothes. Bye, Collin. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Mom, Julia. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>Amelia and I arrived at the restaurant at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart,\u201d I said as I hugged her.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>We walked in the restaurant and were promptly seated. I looked at Amelia and could see the sadness in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCollin told you what happened?\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cHe did. After Connor and Jake found him completely inebriated and on the floor of his apartment. They brought him up to the penthouse to sleep it off.\u201d</p><p>She looked down as she played with her spoon. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have drunk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he shouldn\u2019t have, but he didn\u2019t want to hurt anymore. I understand you being mad at him for not telling you about the house. I really do. Sometimes, people think they\u2019re doing the right thing when they\u2019re not. He should\u2019ve talked to you about it first. Unfortunately, he gets that from his dad. Well, and maybe me too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first met Connor, I kept a huge secret from him and, when he found out, he left me. Actually, he left me in Michigan, alone in a hotel room, and made me fly back to New York by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I hurt him on such a deep level that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see him again. What I did was unforgiveable. But Connor loved me so much that he forgave me eventually. My point is that people make mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that, Ellery, but he can\u2019t think he can just buy my parents\u2019 house because I needed the money. I felt like such a charity case, and then, for him not to tell me. That right there proves he knew what he was doing wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I know the feeling. But you\u2019re not a charity case. He wanted you to have that house to hold on to the memory of your family. He wanted to give you a piece of them. Don\u2019t you think he would have just given you some money? He knew you needed it, but he didn\u2019t offer to give you any while the house was up for sale, did he?\u201d</p><p>Amelia shook her head. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, my son is a very giving person. He\u2019s the spitting image of his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed that.\u201d She smiled.</p> <p>I took hold of her hand from across the table. \u201cRunning away doesn\u2019t solve anything. Trust me. I\u2019m not defending him, but I think you need to hear him out and he needs to hear you out. He loves you, Amelia. I\u2019ve never seen him so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sweetie. You know I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>The day seemed to drag on forever. I stared out the window of my office and thought about Amelia. She never responded to my text message from earlier. I really fucked things up and I missed her like crazy. My heart was hurting, and every time I thought about her, it broke just a little more. Since she was constantly on my mind, there wasn\u2019t going to be a heart left in me at all. I needed to get out of New York for a couple of days, so I called the airlines, booked a flight to Chicago, and went home and packed a bag for the weekend. I didn\u2019t want to ask my dad to use the plane. It was less complicated just to book a commercial flight.</p><p>I boarded the plane and took my seat in coach. I didn\u2019t care because first class and business class were booked up and I just wanted to get on this plane out of New York. A few moments later, an older woman took the seat next to me.</p> <p>\u201cHello. My, you are a handsome young man.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cHi, and thank you.\u201d I smiled back and then turned my attention to the window. As I was watching some of the other planes take off, I heard a familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. Why can\u2019t I get this to fit up here?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head and saw Amelia trying to stuff her bag in the overhead compartment.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d I said.</p><p>She looked at me and shock overtook her face. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked with an attitude.</p><p>\u201cFlying to Chicago. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t fucking believe this. Amelia took her seat next to the lady who sat next to me and looked the opposite way. I stared out the window as the plane took off from the runway and into the sky. As soon as I could use my phone, I pulled it from my pocket and sent Amelia a text message.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you going to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>I saw her look at her phone and then type a message back.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer a question with a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Amelia,\u201d I said as I looked over at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swear at me,\u201d she growled.</p><p>The poor lady who was sitting between us looked at us in confusion. \u201cWould you like to switch seats?\u201d she asked Amelia.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Amelia looked over at me. \u201cWhy are you in coach anyway? Shouldn\u2019t you be on your dad\u2019s plane or at least in first class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst class was booked and I didn\u2019t ask to use the plane. I just wanted to get out of New York as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>The lady next to me got up and went to the restroom. Amelia sat there, looking straight ahead while I looked out the window. When the lady came back, she stood in the middle of the aisle.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, young lady, but you need to move over because I\u2019m having bathroom issues and it would be more convenient for me to sit on the end seat instead of having to climb over you.\u201d</p><p>Amelia looked at her and narrowed her eyes. She sighed and sat in the seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my dear,\u201d the lady said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re on this plane,\u201d Amelia said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny how fate works?\u201d The old lady smiled.</p><p>Amelia put her earphones in and I laid my head against the window and closed my eyes. Suddenly, the plane dropped and began shaking. Amelia grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cPut on your seatbelt,\u201d I said to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to let go,\u201d she said with fear in her eyes.</p><p>I reached over and buckled her seatbelt and then mine. The captain came on and apologized that we were experiencing some turbulence and would be for a little while longer. It was a bit unsettling, but with the amount of flying that I did, I was used to it. I wanted to bring her on my lap and hold her tight and tell her that everything was going to be okay. I looked over at the lady sitting next to Amelia and asked her if she was okay. She smiled and nodded her head. The turbulence had settled and Amelia let go of my arm. She put her earphones back in and acted like nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to do that,\u201d I said as I took her earphones out of her ears.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to hold on to me for dear life because you\u2019re scared and then ignore me. You know what? Forget I said anything. I\u2019m sorry. You go on with your business and I\u2019ll go on with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, mister. You started this and we\u2019re going to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore. Go back to listening to your music,\u201d I snapped. \u201cAnd for the record, I did nothing wrong but love you. Maybe more than I should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me feel like a charity case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I do that?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBy buying my parents\u2019 house because I needed the money. You couldn\u2019t just let someone else buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought that house for us to have someday. I wanted you to hold on to something of them. Even though they didn\u2019t have the house very long, it meant something to them, which means it meant something to you, and I couldn\u2019t let that go. So, I\u2019m sorry if you felt like a charity case because that wasn\u2019t my intention. My intention was to keep a part of your family alive for you and the money was a bonus. Now, I\u2019m done talking about this with you because you obviously can\u2019t understand where I\u2019m coming from,\u201d I said as I turned and faced the window.</p><p>\u201cHe bought you a house and you\u2019re mad at him?\u201d the lady asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Amelia said.</p> <p>\u201cI see nothing complicated about a man who loves a woman enough to buy something that meant the world to her.\u201d</p><p>Go lady... go lady...go lady, I kept chanting to myself.</p><p>The plane landed and Amelia and I grabbed our bags and exited the plane. We walked side by side through the airport.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHoliday Inn Express,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Why?\u201d</p><p>She laughed lightly. \u201cBecause it was cheap. Where are you staying: The Trump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI would like it if you came with me.\u201d</p><p>It was a longshot asking her, but I took it anyway. I didn\u2019t want her in this city alone. It wasn\u2019t safe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to The Trump before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a first time for everything, and I would love for your first time to be with me.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She looked at me as tears formed in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for acting like such a bitch. I\u2019m sorry for saying some awful things to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not telling you about the house when I bought it.\u201d</p><p>We reached the outside of the airport and my driver was standing outside the limo.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Black. It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood evening, Tom. Thanks for picking me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, sir.\u201d</p><p>We climbed in the back of the limo and Tom shut the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere to, Mr. Black?\u201d</p><p>I looked over at Amelia and she smiled at me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to The Trump, Tom.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I took my hand and lightly caressed her cheek before my lips fell upon hers.</p><p>After having the most mind-blowing makeup sex, Amelia and I lay back in the tub and turned on the jets. There was nothing like the feeling of her soft, wet skin pressed against mine. I wrapped my arms around her as her back pressed into my chest and her perfect small ass fit nicely between my legs. She softly ran her finger up and down my arm as I held her against me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you find it strange that we both decided to come to Chicago and we were on the same flight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But like the old lady said: fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had lunch with your mom today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she called and asked me to. We had a nice little chat about you and how much you are like your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. She keeps saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad is an amazing man and you should be proud to be like him. Anyway, I wanted to get away for a couple days and get myself together before I called you and begged you to take me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d I whispered as I kissed her neck. \u201cYou won\u2019t ever have to beg me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom told me about your drinking binge last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she did,\u201d I said as I nipped her neck.</p><p>Amelia giggled. \u201cWhy did you come to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sitting in my office, looking out the window, and thinking about you, when I thought of our little chat about the Field Museum and T-Rex Sue. That\u2019s when I decided, at the last minute, to hop on a plane and come to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were going to go to the Field Museum without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou beast! How dare you? You promised me we could go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia, are you going to tell me that you weren\u2019t going to go there yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d I smiled as I splashed her with water.</p><p>She turned her body around so she was facing me and wrapped her legs around my waist. \u201cI love you so much. I was so stupid for getting mad at you about the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, and I love you too.\u201d I smiled as I pushed a strand of her hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay. You\u2019re the most loving and generous man I\u2019ve ever met, and you love me. How could I be mad at you for that? A part of me feels guilty about the house because my mom and dad should be the ones enjoying it, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia, you need to stop with that. You survived. You need to accept that and try to live the rest of your life as fully as possible. With me in it, of course.\u201d I winked.</p><p>She placed her hands on each side of my face and rubbed her nose against mine. \u201cI missed you last night and I don\u2019t ever want to sleep apart again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too and, trust me, we won\u2019t. We need to make a promise to each other right now that we\u2019ll never ever go to bed angry. If we get into an argument or a fight, then we need to work it out first. Deal?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d She smiled as she kissed my lips.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>Amelia and I had the best time in Chicago. We visited the Field Museum, and we had someone take a beautiful picture of us in front of T-Rex Sue. I took her to my mom and dad\u2019s art gallery, showed her Black Enterprises, and introduced her to Mac.</p><p>\u201cMac, what are you doing here? It\u2019s Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Collin. I was just about to ask you the same thing. Why the hell are you in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac, this is my girlfriend, Amelia. Amelia, this is Mackenzie. She runs this office for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Amelia.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI was just catching up on some work. I\u2019m going on vacation next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, nice. Are you going with anyone I know?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Carla and I are going to the Bahamas.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her with a twisted face. \u201cCarla, as in Carla from design?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe one and only.\u201d Mac smiled.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, she hasn\u2019t really told anyone yet. So, let\u2019s keep our little vacation under wraps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Okay. My lips are sealed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, it was great seeing you, sweetheart,\u201d she said as she kissed my cheek. \u201cAnd it was great to meet you, Amelia. You\u2019ve changed my boy here. I can tell already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a great trip,\u201d I said as we headed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cShe seems really nice,\u201d Amelia said.</p><p>\u201cShe is. She\u2019s one of the best in the company.\u201d</p><p>We went to dinner that night and, as soon as we got back to the hotel, I ordered a bottle of champagne and we drank and had sex all night long.</p> <p>My dad sent the plane to Chicago for us and we went back to New York. Amelia\u2019s break was over and she went back to her classes and clinicals the next day. As soon as we got home, my mom and dad came down to see us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy the two of you worked things out,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cMe too, Dad. Me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow weird was it that you were both going to Chicago at the same time and on the same flight? The universe works in mysterious ways. I\u2019ve learned that over the years. By the way, I\u2019m starting to interview people tomorrow for Diana\u2019s position and I want you to sit in on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a great judge of character and I want your opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Dad. I\u2019ll be there early tomorrow right after I drop Amelia off at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery, are you ready to go home? I believe you have a promise to keep.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>She looked at him and bit down on her bottom lip. \u201cYou\u2019re right, sexy. I do. I hope you can handle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Out. You two can take your little sex talk out of my apartment. I don\u2019t want to hear about you two handling each other.\u201d</p><p>My parents both laughed and kissed me and Amelia good bye. I rolled my eyes and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI absolutely love your parents.\u201d She smiled as she put her arm around me.</p><p>\u201cAs crazy as they can be, I do too.\u201d</p><p>My mom and dad threw a going-away party for Diana at the Waldorf Astoria. The entire company was invited and I think just about everyone showed. They were all a bunch of suck-ups to my dad, so it didn\u2019t surprise me. We mixed and mingled and I could tell Diana was a little upset.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked as I walked up to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just going to miss you all. It\u2019s a little scary starting somewhere new.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around her and gave her a light squeeze. \u201cI know, but think of how much better you and Jacob will be. And it\u2019s not like you won\u2019t know anyone there. You have Mason and Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I\u2019ve been talking to Joel almost every day, either on the phone or Skype.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her strangely. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s a great and interesting guy. We have a lot in common.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so shocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He is a great guy and his wife passed away a couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about her and my husband.\u201d</p><p>I got the feeling that she and Joel might have started something or would start something when she got to California.</p><p>The next afternoon, I picked Amelia up from her classes and we headed to the airport to say goodbye to Diana and Jacob. I\u2019d been dreading this day since she agreed to move to California. My mom and dad were already there and so were Julia and Jake. I walked up to Jacob and knelt down in front of him as I placed my hands on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy. I want you listen to me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, Collin. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to have the best life in California. Really take in that ocean air. I\u2019ll be coming out to visit you quite a bit and to check up on you. This is a new start for you and your mom and you\u2019re going to need to be there to help her out. Mason will be around a lot and I just know you\u2019re going to do great,\u201d I said as my eyes instantly filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Collin.\u201d</p><p>I pulled him into an embrace. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you too. We\u2019ll keep in touch almost every day through phone calls and text, and whenever you want, we can Skype.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said as a tear fell from his eye.</p><p>I gave him one last squeeze and then patted him on the head. \u201cGo on. Get out of here and go meet some hot California girls.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He smiled and held up his fist. I bumped mine against his and stood up and said goodbye to Diana with a hug and a kiss.</p><p>\u201cStay in touch and enjoy California. Amelia and I will be out soon to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Collin. I will never forget what you\u2019ve done for us. This isn\u2019t goodbye. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>They walked to the plane and, before Jacob got on, he stopped and waved at me. Amelia put her arm around my waist and laid her head on my shoulder as we both waved goodbye.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>Two Months Later</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you ready? The plane is waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m sorry. I had trouble deciding what to bring,\u201d she said.</p><p>I had to go to Vegas for a business meeting and we decided to make a long weekend of it. Amelia had never been to Vegas and she was really excited to go.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever gambled?\u201d I asked her as we sat on the plane.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I can\u2019t wait to.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cIf you have any addictions, gambling could become a problem. So you better be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I do have one addiction: you.\u201d She growled as she kissed me.</p><p>She had me hard and we were going to be landing in about ten minutes. \u201cYou\u2019re a very bad girl, Miss Gray, and as soon as we get to the hotel, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to punish you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise to punish me hard.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Amelia. You\u2019re killing me,\u201d I said as I kissed the side of her head and buckled my seatbelt.</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>We arrived at The Bellagio Hotel and I had to get ready for my business meeting. As I was in the bathroom, Amelia threw herself onto the king-sized bed.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to punish me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. After my meeting. I promise you I won\u2019t be gone long. The meeting should only take an hour. I\u2019ve booked a massage and facial for you down at the spa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was sweet. Thank you,\u201d she said as she walked up behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, baby. My meeting is here in the hotel. If you get done with your spa appointment before my meeting is over, come back up to the room and, when I get back, we\u2019ll go and do some gambling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good, babe,\u201d she said as she kissed my back.</p><p>I put on my suit coat and I walked Amelia down to the spa.</p> <p>\u201cThis is where we part ways. I\u2019ll see you soon. Enjoy the spa, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Enjoy your meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I won\u2019t.\u201d I smiled as I kissed her and headed to the board room.</p><p>My meeting ran a little longer than I planned, but I signed the deal for the company and my dad was going to be extremely happy. I walked over to the spa to see if Amelia was done and saw her walking out the door.</p><p>\u201cPerfect timing. How was your massage?\u201d I asked as I gave her a kiss.</p> <p>\u201cExhilarating, relaxing, amazing.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cMaybe before we leave Vegas, we can get a couple\u2019s massage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said as she laid her head on my shoulder and looped her arm around mine.</p><p>We spent our first night at the black jack table and I taught Amelia how to play. She was either very lucky or she was bullshitting me about not knowing how to play. She cleaned up and she cleaned up well. I was more in love with her than ever, and playing against her and watching how excited she got when she won was an amazing feeling. I reached over and stroked her blonde hair and asked her if she was ready to go back to the room.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, baby? I think we have some celebrating to do.\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m ready.\u201d She smiled.</p> <p>I took her hand and we entered the elevator. Once we hit the tenth floor, I pushed the stop button.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I turned to her and placed my hands on her thighs. My fingers slid their way up to the edge of her panties and pushed them to the side. I slipped my fingers inside her, feeling how excited she already was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you a little something before we go to the room. Judging by how wet you are, I think you want it.\u201d</p><p>I pushed her against the elevator wall and she brought her knee up. \u201cCollin, you\u2019re so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how much you want me to make you come right now,\u201d I whispered as my tongue stroked her neck.</p><p>\u201cI want you to,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to make me come now and then multiple times in the room.\u201d</p><p>I took down the strap of her dress, exposing her bare breast as my fingers moved in and out of her at a rapid pace. She tried to contain her moans, but let loose once my mouth surrounded her breast. My thumb rested on her clit as she swelled against my fingers. I knew that a few short strokes on her clit would have her coming in no time.</p><p>\u201cCome, baby. Show me how good I make you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please don\u2019t stop,\u201d she begged.</p><p>I moved my fingers in circles and hit her g-spot. She let out a howl and her body tightened against me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d she said with bated breath as her orgasm came to full force.</p><p>I smiled as I looked at her and pulled up the strap to her dress. I then kissed her on the lips and pushed the button to go up to our room. The elevator door opened and there was a group of people standing in front of it.</p><p>\u201cAre you two okay?\u201d a gentleman asked. \u201cThe elevator was stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re great.\u201d I smiled as I took Amelia\u2019s hand and we went to our room.</p><p>Needless to say, we were up all night and barely slept.</p><p>I rolled over and opened my eyes when I heard my phone buzz. I picked it up from the nightstand and saw a text message from my dad.</p><p>\u201cMorning, son. Congratulations on closing the deal. We\u2019ll celebrate when you get back to New York. I hope you and Amelia are having a great time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. We\u2019re having a blast. Amelia loves Vegas and she cleaned up last night at the black jack table. See you in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>I rolled over and looked at how peacefully Amelia was sleeping. I got out of bed, put on some clothes, and went downstairs to the reception desk. When I came back to the room, Amelia rolled over and looked at me as I stood in the doorway with red roses.</p><p>\u201cMorning, baby.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown to the flower shop to get you these,\u201d I said as I handed her the roses.</p><p>She brought them up to her nose and smelled them. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. Thank you,\u201d she said as she reached up and kissed me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Our breakfast will be here soon. I ordered you your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate chip pancakes?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYep. Chocolate chip pancakes,\u201d I said as I kissed her nose.</p><p>While she was in the shower, room service was delivered and set up at the table for us.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, breakfast is here,\u201d I said as I walked in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a sec. Don\u2019t start without me.\u201d</p><p>I sat down at the table and waited for Amelia to join me. A few moments later, she came out in her silk robe and sat down across from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>She lifted off the silver lid from her plate and stared at her pancakes. She put her hand over her mouth and looked up at me with tears in her eyes.</p><p>I got up from my seat and took the five-carat diamond ring that sat on the stack of pancakes. I got down on one knee and took her hand.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, I want to spend the rest of my life with you. You have given me the best gift in life; true love. I fell in love with you from the moment I saw you walking past the beach house that morning after you saved me. My world was crumbling down before I met you, and then you came along and changed my life. There is nothing that I wouldn\u2019t do for you or give you. I want to build a future with you. I want you to be the mother of my children and I want to do nothing but grow old with you. I love you so much that sometimes it hurts. I can\u2019t stand to be away from you and, when I see you at the end of the day, my whole world lights up again.\u201d</p><p>I placed my finger on her promise ring. \u201cI gave you this ring as a promise of my love and a promise to marry you. Now, I\u2019m fulfilling that promise by giving you this ring and asking you to be my wife forever and always. Let\u2019s get married, baby. Let\u2019s do it here in Vegas. I don\u2019t want to wait a year to plan the perfect wedding. I want you now as my wife, Mrs. Amelia Black. What do you say, baby? Will you marry me today?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tears fell from her eyes as she stared into mine. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you. Yes. Yes, I will marry you today!\u201d she said with excitement.</p><p>I removed her promise ring from her left hand and placed it on her right. I slid the diamond ring on her finger and kissed it. We both stood up and I swung her around, holding her tight and kissing her nonstop.</p><p>\u201cYou have made me the happiest man alive!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve made me the happiest girl in the world. I love you so much, Collin Black, and I can\u2019t wait to marry you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you too, Amelia. I have everything all arranged already.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me when I put her down and smiled. \u201cWhat if I would have said no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the chance I took. But somehow, I knew you\u2019d say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to wear? I need a ring for you! Flowers? My hair, makeup! Oh my God, I\u2019m starting to panic.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cAmelia. Calm down. I\u2019ve arranged all that. There\u2019s a jewelry shop in the lobby; we can go pick out my ring. I have two women catering to you today. They will be helping you pick a dress and they\u2019ll be doing your hair and makeup.\u201d</p> <p>She took in a deep breath. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re truly amazing. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told a few times.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>We sat down at the table and ate our breakfast. \u201cCollin, I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents are going to be so upset. Not to mention Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we get back to New York, I\u2019ll let my mom plan a reception for all of our family and friends. She\u2019ll love it. Listen, Amelia, I don\u2019t want to wait. Once we get back to New York, you have your classes, your clinicals, and you\u2019ll be graduating in a few months. There won\u2019t be any time to plan a wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right and I don\u2019t want to wait either,\u201d she said as she got up, sat down on my lap, and wrapped her arms around my neck. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be your wife, Mr. Black,\u201d she said as her lips brushed against mine.</p><p>Amelia and I were married at the Chapel of the Flowers. It was a beautiful ceremony and I paid top dollar to make sure everything was perfect. I wore a black tuxedo and she wore a white, tea-length dress with beads that glistened when she walked down the aisle. She wore her beautiful blonde hair up in cascading curls and carried a bouquet of pink and white roses. She was the most beautiful bride in the world and I was captivated by her every single day. The ceremony was perfect and a few tears were shed by both of us. I vowed to love her, cherish her, and devote my life to her forever. We shared our first kiss as husband and wife and walked up the aisle hand in hand. We exited the chapel and stood in front of the long, white limo that was waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Mrs. Black.\u201d</p><p>I love you, Mr. Black.</p><p>We kissed one more time and climbed into the limo. We celebrated with a beautiful dinner, dancing, and a lot of lovemaking as husband and wife. She was my eternity and my savior. There was no place or no one else I wanted to be with. She took my breath away every single minute of the day and she made me happy. My life was now complete with her by my side as my wife and I was going to build an incredible family and future with her. We lay wrapped up in each other\u2019s arms after a fulfilled night of sex and champagne. My eyes flew open as the sun shined brightly through the crack in the curtains. We were flying back to New York today and panic started to settle in as one thought came to my mind: SHIT. How am I going to tell my parents that we got married in Vegas?</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
