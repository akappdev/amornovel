Tonight we\u2019re meeting at this field party, and I fully expect we\u2019ll make out behind a hay bale or something.</p> <p>Drew is lounging on my bed, reading Cosmo. \u201cSo I signed you up to be manager for my baseball team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Careful not to mess up my polish, I mute the TV and sit up to face him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand the idea of you holed up in your room while I\u2019m playing ball this spring. You should come to practice tomorrow morning.\u201d He smells a perfume ad, cringes and sticks his tongue out.</p><p>My heart pounds faster than light speed. I hate baseball. I know, I know. That means I\u2019m not a true American. It probably means I\u2019m not human. But I gave up foam fingers, peanuts, and the Atlanta Braves when my mom announced she\u2019s a lesbian and ran off with her friend who was more than just a friend. A year ago January, she divorced my dad, and I divorced her dreams of me playing softball for Hundred Oaks.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I say, examining my nails.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Parker!\u201d He thumbs through the magazine. \u201cPlease?\u201d he whines.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s involved?\u201d I try to act nonchalant, but Drew looks up with a knowing smile. He\u2019s lived down the street from me my whole life\u2014I\u2019ll do anything for him.</p><p>\u201cTaking stats and helping with equipment.\u201d</p><p>Taking stats is way easy. I could do it in my sleep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a cinch,\u201d Drew says, reading my mind. He shows me a cartoon couple using a dining room table for Kama Sutra maximum effect. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says. \u201cIs that move physically possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it out with Amy and let me know.\u201d</p> <p>He glances at me sideways, then turns the magazine vertical and studies it closely. \u201cI\u2019m flexible, but not that flexible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine needing a hip replacement at seventeen? You could get a cane with flames painted on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe one with skulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPirate ships!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject...So there\u2019ll be plenty of guys for you on the team.\u201d He snorggles. That\u2019s our special word for snorting and giggling. It\u2019ll be in Webster\u2019s any day now.</p><p>I have to admit I love the way cute guys look in baseball uniforms. Plus, I\u2019d get to spend more time with Drew. Lately, his idea of fun has been going to Jiffy Burger with Corndog and Sam Henry and acting like they\u2019re the characters from Seinfeld, talking about nothing. Drew invites me along sometimes when they need an Elaine, because I\u2019m really good at punching Corndog (George Costanza) and yelling \u201cGet out!\u201d and Drew says I dance worse than the real Elaine. But it\u2019s been getting kinda old. How many times can those guys debate who has better fries: Sonic or Jiffy Burger?</p><p>And what else do I have to do this semester? It\u2019s February, I\u2019ve got a 4.0, and classes don\u2019t matter at this point\u2014the only way Vanderbilt could revoke my early admission would be if I went on the news and advocated for Tennessee to secede from the union.</p><p>On the other hand, this could be a lot of work. I\u2019d probably end up doing hard stuff like lugging water coolers around and washing dirty jockstraps or something.</p> <p>On the other hand, I don\u2019t want to be lonely.</p><p>Jockstraps it is.</p><p>When I was five, Mom discovered a recipe for homemade edible Play-Doh. We loved cooking together, especially fancy stuff like foie gras grilled cheese. We sat at the kitchen table, which was covered by the previous week\u2019s comics, and mixed flour and sugar and peanut butter together and rolled it into shapes. I had dinosaur cookie cutters, so I made a Play-Doh T-Rex. Mom made a triceratops. I bit its head off, and she joked, \u201cMy little praying mantis.\u201d We giggled and giggled and gorged ourselves on that Play-Doh. The next day we went to church and Mom and I kneeled at the altar. As I prayed, I didn\u2019t ask you for anything. I only thanked you for giving me Mom.</p><p>Written on February 12 before the party at Morton\u2019s field. Burned using a candle.</p><p>On Saturday morning, Drew and I arrive at the baseball field behind Hundred Oaks High\u2014aka the only place I dread more than Chuck E. Cheese (I worked there last summer and almost died because I had to wear a Crusty the Cat costume).</p><p>We step out of his red VW bug into the sun, and the crisp wind bites my face. I pull my arms up inside my fleece and begin the trek across the parking lot to meet the players, who are warming up by doing throwing exercises and sprints. I stare at the most popular guys at our school.</p><p>Popular-schmopular\u2014any cute guy will do. Last Sunday after church? I hung out with this guy Aaron on the swings at the playground, listening to him talk about how much his school sucks (he goes to Woodbury High) and how Nirvana really is the best band ever. I disagree\u2014I\u2019m into modern stuff like Paramore and the All-American Rejects, but I couldn\u2019t get a word in because he kept talking and talking and talking. Before he drove home with his parents, I let him kiss me beside the turtle sandbox thing, so people will know I like boys.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d Coach Burns calls, beckoning us.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear me,\u201d I croon to Drew. \u201cYour coach is older than baseball itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he coached my grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s been saying he\u2019ll retire after this year. Would you rather retire or work your whole life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d retire tomorrow if I could, and I haven\u2019t even started working yet,\u201d I reply. \u201cWhen you retire, would you rather spend time playing golf or bingo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGolf. I love the outfits. Golf or polo?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean water polo or horse polo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross. I like animals much more than speedos.\u201d</p><p>Drew introduces me to the coach, who starts explaining my responsibilities. How I\u2019ll be the official statistician because I make straight As in calc. (Coach did his homework.) How I should always have the coolers filled with ice water before practices start, and how I should make sure the buckets by the pitching machines are loaded with balls. Drew snorggles at the mention of balls. Perv. I elbow him.</p><p>\u201cYou should always be thirty minutes early for practice.\u201d The coach clears his throat, and his lined face goes a bit pink. He glances at Drew, then back to me. \u201cAnd if you decide to date or mess around with anyone on the team, you can\u2019t be a manager anymore, okay?\u201d</p><p>What? Kissing players is reason numero uno I\u2019m willing to sit around watching these guys belch and adjust their crotches and spit in the dugout.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask, scrunching my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cThe girl who managed the team last year, uh, well, we had some incidents on the bus and in the locker room.\u201d He coughs. \u201cI\u2019m sure that won\u2019t happen with you.\u201d</p><p>Does he think I\u2019m incapable of getting guys? I kissed Matt Higgins behind a barn last night. Trust me, I\u2019m capable of getting a guy.</p><p>I smooth my curve-enhancing blue fleece. I\u2019m wearing leather boots over skinny jeans. It\u2019s not sporty attire, but I once read this book called The Rules that said guys like girls who always look ready to go on a date, so I even wear lip gloss when jogging. The only thing I never bother fixing is my tangled waist-length brown hair. It may sound gross, but my hair looks good tangly\u2014guys love it.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, Coach,\u201d I say.</p><p>Coach tells Drew to warm up, so he runs off, his cleats clacking on the asphalt. \u201cYou should meet my new assistant coach and our new captain. Don\u2019t take orders from any guys except the captain, understand?\u201d</p><p>I nod, and Coach Burns calls out, \u201cHoffman! Whitfield! Get over here!\u201d</p><p>Corndog, aka Will Whitfield, swings at a pitch, drops his bat, then jogs over. He must truly love baseball to smile in 40-degree February weather. He tosses away his batting helmet and runs his fingers through the brown waves of his hair before pulling his cap from the back pocket of his baseball pants.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, giving me a bright grin, showing off the dimple in his right cheek.</p><p>Yeah, yeah. I know you\u2019re hot, Corndog. I fight the urge to roll my eyes. Thanks to all the years he\u2019s spent baling hay on his dad\u2019s farm, Corndog has gone from not to hot, from scrawny to sinewy, from geek to god, and now has to beat girls off with a stick. Not that he ever dates. Not that I\u2019d ever hook up with him. He nearly became valedictorian instead of me.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d he whispers, putting his hat on. \u201cYou and Higgins, eh?\u201d</p><p>I pull my knit cap down over my ears and tell myself to ignore the queasiness. I didn\u2019t enjoy kissing Matt Higgins very much. He kept trying to go up my shirt. \u201cIt was a one-night thing.\u201d</p><p>Corndog removes a batting glove. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always, for you?\u201d He laughs, but it\u2019s not a nice laugh, and gives me a hard stare. \u201cYou keep screwing with my friends.\u201d</p><p>I rub my neck. What he\u2019s saying isn\u2019t a lie. I do kiss guys a lot.</p><p>And I\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019m not interested in snuggling or talking on the phone late at night, falling asleep talking to a boy I\u2019m in love with. I do want a boyfriend. But I haven\u2019t met any guys worth the risk of being ditched.</p><p>\u201cJust do me a favor,\u201d Corndog whispers. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with Bates.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. I\u2019ve never had that kind of spark with Drew. We had our diapers changed together. Besides, he\u2019s been dating this sweet girl, Amy Countryman, for like half his life. She enjoys knitting and cooks him breakfast for dinner. But truth be told, I\u2019m not entirely sure Drew likes only girls.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Drew,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Corndog nods.</p><p>\u201cWould you two like to join us sometime today?\u201d Coach Burns says, motioning toward the field. \u201cI want Parker to meet the new coach.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when a baseball rolls up to my boots.</p><p>\u201cSorry! Foul ball,\u201d Sam calls from home plate, clutching his bat.</p><p>I scoop up the ball, wind my arm, and hurl it from the parking lot and over the fence to shortstop.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d a voice says. \u201cShe\u2019s got a hell of an arm.\u201d</p><p>I turn slowly, and that\u2019s when I first see him.</p><p>His tan face is thin with stubble and a strong jaw. He\u2019s a couple inches taller than my 5'7\". He\u2019s wearing gray baseball pants, an oversized black sweatshirt cut off at the elbows, and a frayed beige ball cap. Dark curls sneak out from under the brim. His big brown eyes meet mine and my breath sputters.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Beautiful Boy says, stretching out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Brian Hoffman, the new assistant coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker Shelton.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I shake his hand and squeak out my name. Names, names. Brian &amp; Parker sounds like a law firm. Parker &amp; Brian sounds like a pharmaceutical company. His calloused palm feels rough against mine. I picture him touching my hair.</p><p>\u201cDo you play softball?\u201d Coach Hoffman asks me, smiling. He raises an eyebrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still shaking his hand. Longest Handshake of All Time. Maybe we can shake hands until practice is over and then I\u2019ll ask if he wants to hang out.</p><p>Wait. This guy\u2019s a coach. How old is he? Twenty-one? Twenty-two?</p> <p>I release his hand and wipe my tingling palm on my jeans. Corndog\u2019s shaking his head at me. Coach Hoffman beckons for us to follow him onto the field. My pulse races as I cross the fresh chalk of the first base line. This is the first time I\u2019ve stepped foot on a diamond in a year.</p><p>We meet the team at home plate, where Coach Hoffman tells them I\u2019m the new manager. The guys crowd around me, saying stupid things like \u201cParker Shelton, woooo!\u201d and \u201cI love you, Parker!\u201d and \u201cParker Shelton, I want to have all your babies!\u201d and I shove my hands in the pockets of my fleece, glancing between the guys and the ground. Normally I\u2019d be grinning, but I don\u2019t want Bri\u2014I mean, Coach Hoffman seeing me act desperate.</p><p>Coach Burns takes this moment to tell the guys to keep their hands off me or risk getting suspended for two games. Then he leads the pitchers to the outfield for long toss.</p><p>\u201cCoach Burns must really be pissed about last year,\u201d Paul Briggs says under his breath to Sam, but loud enough for me to hear. Paul plays catcher, and his weight rivals that of an orca whale. He gestures at me. \u201cSucks we won\u2019t be getting hot managerial play. Everyone knows she puts out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, man,\u201d Sam says, slapping Paul with a glove.</p> <p>Corndog glares at Paul. \u201cApologize now.\u201d</p><p>Paul shrugs. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass,\u201d Coach Hoffman tells Paul, grabbing him by a sleeve. \u201cFive laps.\u201d</p><p>Paul throws him a look of hatred but takes off ambling around the field. Paul\u2019s not even capable of jogging.</p><p>I toe the ground, wishing someone would squash me into the red clay.</p><p>Coach Hoffman steps closer, his face turning rosy. Freckles dot his nose. His lips are chapped. Does he bite them?</p> <p>He whispers, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal,\u201d I say, folding my arms across my chest. I want to tell him that I don\u2019t technically put out. I\u2019m still a virgin. Honestly, I still have problems using tampons. They just don\u2019t work for me. I even studied this diagram in Seventeen that gave tips on how to get them in, but I can\u2019t figure out the logistics. And sometimes trying to figure it out makes blood rush to my head and I feel like I might pass out and I can only imagine Dad finding me in the bathroom, unconscious next to the toilet, pants-less with a tampon in my hand.</p><p>As if I\u2019d ever ask my mother for tampon tips.</p><p>Coach Hoffman directs the JV guys to the batting cages and sends the varsity onto the field, to scrimmage. He adjusts his beige cap, looking at me. \u201cLet\u2019s go over how to take stats, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sounds great.\u201d Not that I need help with stats. I\u2019m so good, I bet the Braves would hire me. But he doesn\u2019t have to know that.</p><p>Coach Hoffman goes on, \u201cI\u2019ll need you to take stats at practices too. I\u2019m in charge of the lineup, so accurate stats are crucial to my decision-making process.\u201d</p><p>His decision-making process? Crazy mature.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Coach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCoach?\u201d He lets out a ripple of laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to kids calling me coach or mister.\u201d</p><p>He thinks of us as kids? \u201cHow old are you, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d My voice shakes.</p><p>He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-three. Just finished up my master\u2019s in phys ed at Georgia Tech.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s a complete adult. He\u2019s six\u2014one, two, three, four, five, six\u2014years older than me. \u201cWhat class are you teaching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGym, but I\u2019m not sure what my schedule is yet.\u201d He pulls his cap off and puts it back on. He chomps on his gum. \u201cThey hired me to take over the baseball team for Coach Burns when he retires next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>Coach Hoffman nods. \u201cI\u2019m in training this season.\u201d</p><p>As far as coaching goes, working at Hundred Oaks in Franklin is an impressive job to have. Our Raiders usually make it to the district tournament, if not further.</p><p>\u201cYou must know your baseball,\u201d I say.</p><p>He gives me a long serious look. I see his Adam\u2019s apple shift as he swallows. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you play?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d His face goes hard.</p><p>\u201cThey must call you Cryptic Coach Hoffman.\u201d We haven\u2019t taken one step away from home plate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna get used to being called coach. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>I laugh lightly. \u201cHow about a nickname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d He raises his eyebrows.</p><p>I stuff my frozen hands in my armpits. \u201cThe Hoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that David Hasselhoff\u2019s nickname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re equating me with that movie star guy who gets trashed and videotapes himself drunk and eating cheeseburgers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in high school they called me Shooter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you a deer hunter or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh, you don\u2019t want to know what it means.\u201d The side of his mouth quirks up.</p><p>I rock back and forth on my heels. \u201cI like the Hoff way better.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna call me the Hoff, I\u2019m gonna give you a nickname too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble. I\u2019ll call you Trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>We start laughing.</p><p>\u201cGod, this is the silliest conversation I\u2019ve had in ages,\u201d he says with a smile.</p><p>Yeah, probably because you\u2019re an adult and I\u2019m a child, and how could an adult possibly have a normal mature conversation with a girl? I gaze down at the red clay beneath my boots, then look up into his brown eyes and sneak a glimpse at the loose curls peeking out from under his hat. Are they soft?</p><p>I say, \u201cFine, you can call me Trouble. And I\u2019m still gonna call you the Hoff.\u201d</p><p>His face contorts into this blend of pain and amusement. \u201cCall me Brian,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to be called coach or mister. I\u2019m not ancient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian.\u201d I like the way it sounds coming off my tongue. Full and deep. His mouth slides into a smile, and I catch him quickly scanning my body.</p><p>He leads me over to the dugout, picking up a stick along the way. We sit down. He hands me a pencil and the stats book, which looks like a large, floppy sketchpad. Boxes of tiny field grids fill the inside pages. I bring the stats book to my nose and inhale the smoky gray paper.</p><p>Brian laughs softly and uses the stick to clean clay out of his cleats. \u201cYou must really like baseball. Smelling the stats book and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmelling books is a habit Dad got me started on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are worse habits.\u201d Brian shows me his fingernails. He\u2019s bitten them down to the quick. How personal. It\u2019s not like I openly show people my super-long second toes.</p><p>\u201cYou ever taken stats before?\u201d he asks. I like his voice. Low, Southern, manly.</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d I say, tracing my palm. \u201cDad is a big Braves fan.\u201d Was a big Braves fan.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He goes back to picking wet clay and grass out of his cleat. \u201cWhat\u2019s your team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraves, I guess.\u201d I want to keep talking to him. I can do this. I can talk about baseball again. When my family was still together, we loved heading down to Atlanta on weekends to catch games, especially when they played the Phillies and the Mets.</p><p>Mom played softball in high school, and then went on to play shortstop for the University of Tennessee. Before she ditched us, I played softball too. I loved it. But last January, when she left and moved to Knoxville with Theresa, our family was embarrassed to the nth degree. Everyone at church gave us funny looks on Sundays during Coffee Time in the Fellowship Hall, which is a fancy way of saying we eat stale donuts in the church basement. I don\u2019t even know why we kept going to church.</p><p>\u201cBut why would we want to hang out with those jerks who judge us because of something Mom did?\u201d I had cried to Dad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a phase. They\u2019ll forget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not negotiating this,\u201d he replied, studying the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to atone for Mom\u2019s sins?\u201d my older brother asked.</p><p>\u201cBecoming a lesbian is a sin?\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. People at church think so.\u201d Ryan sucked on his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cDoes it actually say that in the Bible? Thou shalt not become a lesbian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dad said with a sigh, his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cThen why are we going to church?\u201d I blurted. Phase or not, how the congregation turned on us didn\u2019t seem forgivable.</p><p>\u201cWe trust in prayer,\u201d Dad replied. His father believes in prayer. So did his grandfather.</p><p>Church means dressing up on Sunday mornings and forgoing French toast at the kitchen table for stale powdered donuts. It means listening to Brother John saying \u201cYour body is a temple\u201d and \u201cTrue love waits,\u201d and then we all would say we\u2019ll wait until we get married to have sex. Or at least until college.</p><p>Some people at church thought I might turn out like my mom. A lesbian. A sinner. I overheard the youth pastor whispering that to the choir director. Brother John told Mrs. James that they would always love me, but he and his wife had to protect their daughter, Laura (my former best friend), from making similarly bad choices. I went home and hid all my pictures of Mom and cried and cried.</p><p>But that made me feel worse, because I knew Mom adored me, and no matter how hard she had tried to hide it, we could tell she was depressed. Before she left Dad, sometimes I came home from school and found she\u2019d been crying.</p><p>I used to love church, but I turned away from it like they turned on me. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. After Tate Gillam\u2019s dad got caught doing his secretary, my own dad told me not to hang around Tate and his sister Rachel anymore.</p><p>When I confronted Laura about what her dad had said, that I might turn out like my mom\u2014a lesbian, a sinner\u2014we got into a huge fight because I said her father wasn\u2019t being a good Christian toward me. Laura asked, \u201cWhat do you know about being a Christian? You knew I liked Jack Hulsey. When you turned him down to the Winter Wonderland formal, you could\u2019ve put in a good word for me. But you only care about yourself and proving you\u2019re better than me.\u201d</p><p>So untrue.</p><p>Our frustrations had been building up for a long time anyhow, so she didn\u2019t take it well when I called her a jealous bitch. The words popped out and I wanted to take them back, but I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Then Laura spread a rumor around school, saying I\u2019m just like my mom. A butch softball player who probably likes girls.</p><p>Apparently \u201clove thy neighbor\u201d changes to \u201cjudge thy neighbor\u201d if your family doesn\u2019t follow the church playbook. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where did you go, God?</p><p>That night after Laura spread the rumors, I started dieting. I went from 140 pounds of muscle down to 110 pounds of skin and bone and hotness. I look good. I don\u2019t look butch. All the guys know I look good. They know I want them and that I love kissing and sometimes rounding a couple bases (I never go further than second). But that\u2019s as close as they\u2019re getting. Emotionally or otherwise.</p><p>\u201cHello? Earth to Parker.\u201d Brian snaps his fingers in my face.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>I hear a crack: the ball connecting with a bat. Foul ball. Drew stands at second base, pounding a fist into his glove. Corndog mans third, hunched over on his knees, focused on the batter. Brian smacks bubblegum that smells like heaven.</p><p>After Mom left, we stopped watching the Braves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about baseball,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d A grin sneaks on his face. \u201cI love this game.\u201d</p> <p>Lee Miller pops up to center field. Sam catches the fly, then lobs the ball to shortstop.</p><p>Brian asks, \u201cWhy\u2019d you want to be our manager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew wanted me to.\u201d I gesture toward second base, where I can see him standing on tiptoes, trying to see what I\u2019m up to. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you a senior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go to college?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVanderbilt?\u201d I don\u2019t tell him I\u2019ve already been accepted early decision.</p><p>He whistles. \u201cGood school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother Ryan goes there. He still lives at home with us, though.\u201d Vanderbilt\u2019s only about 20 minutes away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close with your family?\u201d Brian asks.</p><p>\u201cSorta close with my dad and Ryan.\u201d I peek over at him. \u201cHow about you? Do you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>Brian watches a cloud passing overhead. \u201cA little sister. Anna...What about your mom?\u201d</p><p>I blush. \u201cUm, she doesn\u2019t live here anymore.\u201d</p><p>He finds my eyes, but doesn\u2019t press further. \u201cAnna doesn\u2019t live here anymore either. She moved to Florida.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you miss her?\u201d Because I miss Mom and the way things were before the divorce so much...all I want is for everyone in my family to be whole again. For us to be whole together.</p><p>Brian chews his gum. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary thing to wake up and realize the people you need most aren\u2019t nearby anymore...But you keep moving.\u201d</p><p>He elbows me, and yeah, he\u2019s much older, but I don\u2019t feel so alone right now. I like that he understands the importance of family. I like that sitting here beside him is so easy.</p><p>He tutors me in taking baseball stats, showing me how to draw a thick line from home plate to first base to denote a single. He scratches out the little \u201c1B\u201d next to the thick line. He says that if the ball hits a runner, I have to write BHR across the little field. A double means drawing two dark lines, and if a pitcher hits a batter, I\u2019m supposed to write HBP real big. If a batter hits a homer, I draw four dark lines from base to base to base to home plate, then I denote how many runs get batted in by writing the number of runs and circling it. A bunt is BT.</p><p>\u201cI thought BT meant bacon and tomato,\u201d I say, and Brian chuckles softly at my stupid joke. Generous of him. I lean so close to watch as he fills out the scorecard, I can feel his breath, warm against my cheek. This is the first time in a long while that an adult has paid a lot of attention to me. Paid attention, and treated me like an equal.</p><p>\u201cSo, any questions?\u201d Brian asks, snapping the stats book shut. He grabs a glove from a cubby under the bench.</p><p>\u201cYeah, when are practices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, except for when we have games, which are usually on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarn,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cHow come? Are you on yearbook staff or in the play or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have WNYG on Wednesdays and I was hoping I could get out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWNYG?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWednesday Night Youth Group at church. Brother John thinks calling it WNYG makes it sound sexy.\u201d</p><p>Brian snorts. He puts the glove on his left hand and starts breaking it in with his other fist.</p><p>I keep blabbering, \u201cDad makes me go to church, but I can\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d Why am I being so honest with this guy?</p><p>\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForrest Sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>He bites at a hangnail. \u201cHuh. That\u2019s where my parents go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery Sunday.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen him there. And over five hundred people are in the congregation, so I have no idea who his parents are. \u201cBut you don\u2019t go?\u201d</p><p>He stops biting his nail and goes back to pounding his glove. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my thing either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you mean you don\u2019t love eating stale powdered donuts during Coffee Time in the Fellowship Hall?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles.</p><p>\u201cHoffman!\u201d Coach Burns calls from over by third base. \u201cYou teaching her the history of baseball or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe better go,\u201d Brian says, standing and adjusting his beige cap. He gives me a nervous smile. I hope he\u2019ll put out a hand, to help me stand up, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Disappointment should be my middle name.</p><p>\u201cDisappointment\u201d can\u2019t begin to describe how it felt losing Laura and Allie. Sure, you may have shown me that Laura\u2019s not the best friend I\u2019ve ever had, which is probably better in the long run, but I still feel the loss. No more Saturday nights at the drive-in. No more impromptu fashion shows in Allie\u2019s mom\u2019s walk-in closet. No more roasting marshmallows over a stove burner.</p><p>Written after practice on February 13. Burned.</p><p>I sit Indian style up against the fence beside the third base line, taking stats. I have to admit I\u2019m enjoying it.</p><p>Corndog steps up to the plate and taps his bat on the ground three times before getting into his stance. He watches the first pitch smack into the catcher\u2019s mitt.</p><p>\u201cStrike one,\u201d Coach Burns says.</p><p>\u201cThat was high, Coach!\u201d Corndog yells.</p><p>\u201cHigh my ass!\u201d Sam yells from center field. \u201cI\u2019m a billion feet away and I could tell that was a strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your face, Henry!\u201d Corndog calls.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if they\u2019ll let me retire tomorrow,\u201d Coach Burns replies.</p><p>On the next pitch, Corndog sends the ball over the right field wall. He whoops as he rounds the bases. \u201cYo, Parker! You wrote that down, right?\u201d he calls out as he rounds third. He points at me before crossing home plate, shoving his fists toward the sky, doing the Rocky pose.</p><p>Does he have to be so perfect at everything? Everyone\u2019s been saying he applied to big-time schools like Harvard. I mark his homer, filling in the diamond with pencil.</p><p>\u201cParker Shelton? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>I glance up to find a clearly pregnant Coach Lynn standing before me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d I reply, deadpan, turning my focus to stats. Drew is the next batter up; I write down his name.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s our new manager.\u201d</p><p>I jerk my head up. Brian\u2019s hovering beside my former softball coach.</p><p>\u201cManager?\u201d Coach Lynn exclaims. \u201cYou told me you\u2019d rather burn in hell than have anything to do with softball ever again. You\u2019re willing to manage, but you won\u2019t play for me?\u201d She touches her swollen stomach, looking upset. She must be six months along by now.</p><p>Brian furrows his eyebrows at me. He tucks his hands in the pockets of his sweatshirt and chomps his gum.</p><p>I twirl my pencil.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Coach Lynn presses.</p><p>I shrug. I\u2019ve got nothing to say to her.</p><p>\u201cYou threw away your chance to play in college, Parker. You\u2019re about to graduate. I know you love softball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe played for you?\u201d Brian asks.</p><p>\u201cShe was on my varsity squad her freshman and sophomore years. Could\u2019ve been the best third baseman Hundred Oaks has ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVarsity? As a freshman?\u201d Brian blurts.</p><p>I lick my lips and glance at his face, then clear my throat. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to pay attention to practice.\u201d I watch as Drew scoops at a low pitch and misses it. \u201cStats are very important to Coach Hoffman\u2019s decision-making process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecision-making process,\u201d Coach Lynn repeats.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Brian says. The look on his face shocks me. His dark eyes are questioning, pissed. Wary. He crosses his arms and heads out to center field, to talk to Sam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to have you on the team,\u201d Coach Lynn says, rubbing her belly. \u201cJust say the word. You don\u2019t have to manage the boys\u2019 team if you want to be around the game again.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never told Coach Lynn why I quit after the first practice last season. Softball was something Mom and I shared, and simply slipping a glove on my hand reminded me of how she left. It hurt like hell, but I thought I could handle playing again. But after everything went down with Laura, it sent me over the edge, and I quit. Coach Lynn\u2019s tried, unsuccessfully, to get me back. But she doesn\u2019t know how it felt, how my own team made fun of me. What happens in the locker room stays in the locker room.</p><p>\u201cOur practice starts right after the boys are done,\u201d Coach Lynn says. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you there.\u201d She waddles off toward the left field equipment shed, where I see my former teammates gathering. That\u2019s when Laura and Allie James pass by the fence. Laura has broad shoulders and blonde hair and is much shorter than me or Allie, who\u2019s a tall, bony first baseman.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they let her be manager,\u201d Laura says loudly. \u201cIt can\u2019t be good for the team\u2019s image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I got to spend time with all those boys,\u201d Allie replies quietly, sounding wistful. They sashay toward the equipment shed.</p><p>Laura was the worst after Mom left, after I screamed that her dad was being a jerk and not a very good Christian. She was captain junior year and said, \u201cDon\u2019t stare at the other girls in the locker room. I won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d Why would I want to follow a leader like that?</p><p>Some other girls on the team taunted me too, asking questions like, \u201cHow do lesbians have sex anyway?\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re not gay, right? \u2019Cause that would just be weird.\u201d</p><p>Allie took a step back and bit her lip. She looked sympathetic, but ultimately kept hanging out with Laura because her mom worried I\u2019d be a bad influence on her daughter. I never bothered to reach out to Allie after that. I mean, why? So my heart could be broken again?</p><p>Still, watching my team pull bats and catching equipment and helmets out of the shed nearly brings me to tears. I don\u2019t need them, I tell myself. I\u2019ve got Drew. The person who didn\u2019t judge me.</p><p>Brian comes back over, squats beside me, and studies my scorekeeping. \u201cDid you already know how to take stats?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumble, fumbling with my pencil.</p><p>His brow wrinkles. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate it when people waste my time.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019s gone.</p><p>stalkerish tendencies aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, right?</p> <p>51 days until i turn 18</p><p>Practice ends, and after pouring the water onto the grass and storing the coolers in the shed, I go meet Drew in the parking lot. He\u2019s standing with Sam, who\u2019s gesturing wildly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why Dr. Salter has to approve our prom theme this year,\u201d Sam exclaims. \u201cHow was I supposed to know that when I suggested a pajama party prom last year a bunch of guys would show up only in their underwear?\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s cracking up. \u201cUm, you wore snakeskin boxers that sparkle, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFancy, weren\u2019t they?\u201d Sam laughs. \u201cI wear the cutest underpants.\u201d</p> <p>I preferred Chase Neal\u2019s puppy dog boxers. I really like animals.</p><p>\u201cSo if we win the Prom Decisional, what theme will we suggest?\u201d Drew asks Sam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking we should tell Dr. Salter we want an Ancient Rome theme. We can all show up in togas!\u201d</p><p>I smile, tucking my hands in my pockets. Sam\u2019s nice and funny, but I don\u2019t know him like I know Drew. I usually keep to myself when he hangs out with his friends. And that\u2019s fine. I prefer to keep most people at bay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not on the softball team,\u201d Sam says to me. \u201cIt\u2019d be a lot harder to beat y\u2019all if you were playing.\u201d</p><p>Every April, the Hundred Oaks softball team plays the baseball team, and whoever wins gets to pick the prom theme. The softball team won my freshman and sophomore years, but lost junior year. A lot of the guys were glad I didn\u2019t play. They got their Underpants Prom, after all.</p> <p>Prom is on May first, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going. Aside from all the wild underwear, last year wasn\u2019t much fun considering Drew and Amy were suctioned together at the mouth the entire time, and my date, He Who Shall Not Be Named (okay, okay\u2014it was Charlie McIntosh), kept trying to feel me up in the middle of the gym. Gross. Anyway, I wouldn\u2019t mind going to prom this year if I thought it would be a good time with a guy I really like and trust. A man like Lord Devereaux, the hero in this romance novel I\u2019m reading right now. He\u2019s a pioneer of women\u2019s rights and gives loans to poor people, all while lusting after Princess Penelope.</p><p>God only knows why, but Corndog rides a lawnmower up to me. He pats the seat behind his butt. \u201cYour chariot awaits, Parker.\u201d</p><p>I avoid his eyes and check my phone. I\u2019m supposed to go shopping with Drew this afternoon and don\u2019t have time for another Corndog lecture about how I screw over his friends. As if I don\u2019t feel bad enough about my life already.</p><p>\u201cDude, why are you riding a lawnmower?\u201d Sam asks.</p><p>\u201cDad caught me drinking again and took away my truck,\u201d Corndog pouts.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Sam says, folding his arms across his chest, laughing. \u201cYou never party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Corndog replies, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019ve been way bored since grades don\u2019t matter anymore and I wanted to see how long it\u2019d take me to get here riding this thing. I\u2019ve been tweaking the engine to make it go faster.\u201d</p><p>I smile a little. Since I was named valedictorian, I\u2019ve been bored too. Like me, Corndog\u2019s always loved science. We partnered on projects together until Laura started liking him in middle school.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like walking would be faster than a lawnmower,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not nearly as cool!\u201d Corndog retorts.</p><p>\u201cHenry! Would you get your ass over here!\u201d Jordan Woods calls from beside Sam\u2019s truck. He\u2019s letting her drive his truck now? Must be real serious.</p><p>\u201cGotta jet. The ole ball and chain needs me,\u201d Sam says. His grin is so bright. He jogs to his truck and pulls her into a passionate kiss.</p><p>\u201cGet a room!\u201d Corndog yells at them, then focuses on us.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going shopping at Cool Springs,\u201d Drew says, pointing at me with his thumb. \u201cYou in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Corndog replies, glancing at my face. \u201cDad needs my help today. But thanks for the invite.\u201d He tools off on his lawnmower. Wow, it does go fast.</p><p>\u201cCorndog\u2019s dad had to let their farmhand go,\u201d Drew whispers. \u201cI guess money is super tight and demand for their milk and eggs is down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad,\u201d I say, watching Corndog disappear onto the highway toward the countryside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him,\u201d Drew says before he and I climb into the bug. He checks his hair in the rearview mirror. \u201cHarry Potter movie marathon tonight?\u201d</p><p>I buckle my seatbelt. \u201cYou don\u2019t have plans with Amy?\u201d</p><p>He stops combing his hair. Hesitates. \u201cI broke up with her last night.\u201d</p><p>I cover my mouth with a hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just moving on, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d He blushes. \u201cI just want to watch Harry Potter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He claps his hands together once, looking away from the mirror. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>I fiddle with a tangle of hair. Corndog must\u2019ve known about the breakup before I did and thought Drew did it because he likes me. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. Drew and I spend hours lying in bed together, chatting and watching TV and reading. I\u2019ve never felt that electric charge between us, telling me he wants to make a move. Drew\u2019s the friend who stuck by me through everything. I\u2019m scared for him. I\u2019m scared, that, if what I suspect is true, he\u2019ll face the same narrow-mindedness I did.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what Steven Reed did at the party I was at last night,\u201d Drew interrupts.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how he broke his leg ice skating last month and how he has to wear a walking cast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he was like completely trashed out at Miller\u2019s, and he was stumbling along the road, pretending to hitchhike. And he fell into a ditch, and he was so drunk he started screaming about how he\u2019d broken his leg. And Marie Baird had to convince him that his leg was already broken.\u201d</p><p>We laugh as Drew turns the ignition. I watch out the window as Brian climbs into his red Ford F150. Our eyes meet, but he doesn\u2019t acknowledge me. What went wrong? Just an hour ago we were joking around. Is he really that mad about the stats? About me wasting his time? Why didn\u2019t I tell him the truth?</p><p>I wave as his truck pulls away. He doesn\u2019t wave back. And that feeling of belonging, of having someone who understands where I\u2019ve been, fades.</p><p>Brian\u2019s left blinker turns on.</p><p>\u201cFollow him!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>Drew gapes as we pull out of the parking lot. He doesn\u2019t question me. He peels out onto the four-lane, heading into town, trailing behind Brian\u2019s truck. Good friends don\u2019t question stalkerish tendencies, and well, Drew\u2019s a great friend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay right behind him,\u201d I squeal.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, one, he has a rearview mirror. And two, how many people have red VW bugs around here?\u201d</p><p>Drew lets off the accelerator and swerves into the left lane. I slap a hand on the window as Brian takes the next right, and we keep on going straight.</p><p>\u201cDrew! You lost him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me not to stay right behind him!\u201d He clutches the wheel.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean lose him altogether.\u201d I throw my hands up in the air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Drew says, giving me a weird look. He narrows his eyes.</p><p>I rub his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s fine...How about Jiffy Burger for lunch?\u201d</p><p>His face lights up, and he steps on the gas.</p><p>I can\u2019t eat the food at JB\u2014too many carbs\u2014but their French fries and cherry Sun Drop make my friend happy. And that\u2019s enough for me.</p><p>After lunch and shopping with Drew, I find Dad passed out on the couch with his Bible splayed open across his chest. Piles of architecture and floor plan magazines lay haphazardly on the coffee table, alongside a cup of tea.</p><p>It\u2019s only 5:00 p.m., but he\u2019s snoring up a storm. At forty-two years old, he has a full head of brown hair the color of dark chocolate, and only a few wrinkles. He\u2019s very handsome, but you can\u2019t tell for the sadness. I press a kiss to his forehead. His eyelids flutter open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start dinner in a bit,\u201d he says, but I tell him not to worry. I\u2019ll take care of it. He whispers he loves me.</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d I mumble back, but he\u2019s falling asleep again already. I can hear music, the beat thumping against the walls of Ryan\u2019s room. The drums make the floor vibrate. I slowly walk down the dark hallway past prints of the Beijing National Stadium and the Kansas City Public Library to my room and set my shopping bags on the rug. A knock sounds on my door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Ryan pokes his head in. His brown hair sticks up every which way and one eye is squinty. \u201cCan you help me with my laundry, Park?\u201d</p><p>I sit down on my bed and open my laptop. \u201cGive me a few, \u2019kay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks.\u201d Ryan shuts the door, leaving me alone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I mutter. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you. I\u2019m great, thanks. Laura said mean things about me at practice. The chemistry test yesterday was a real bitch, but I studied hard so I hope I get an A. Thanks for asking, Ryan.\u201d I stare at my duvet as I say this, feeling like a crazy loser. I wish my brother would tell me he\u2019s proud of me, but I doubt he\u2019ll ever care about anyone trying to be their best again.</p><p>In high school, Ryan was a perfectionist. Woke up every day at 6:00 a.m. Mom would cook him breakfast and iron the button-down shirts he used to wear, while he went over his homework again. Like me, he made straight As, but he exceeded my accomplishments in so many ways. He was student council president. Lots of girls wanted to date him. He ran the yearbook staff. He played shortstop for the Raiders and was elected homecoming king. He ruled high school, but he couldn\u2019t wait for college. He couldn\u2019t wait to leave behind the people who didn\u2019t take school seriously, the people who partied on weekends and didn\u2019t give a crap about their SAT scores. He couldn\u2019t wait to study premed at Vanderbilt.</p><p>He started falling apart the middle of freshman year, after Mom left, after learning that even at a prestigious college, not everyone was focused like he was. It\u2019s like the minute our family disintegrated he finally figured out that reality didn\u2019t match his dreams.</p><p>My cell rings. The caller ID says it\u2019s Mom. I let it go to voice mail, then play it on speaker. I pull my knees to my chest and wrap my arms around my shins while I listen.</p><p>\u201cParker...it\u2019s me. Mom. I\u2019d love to chat with you, you know, whenever you have a chance. Your dad told me about Vanderbilt. Congratulations! I\u2019m so proud of you. Theresa and I are doing well. We just got a new puppy. She\u2019s a labradoodle! That means she\u2019s half Labrador, half poodle. I think we\u2019re going to call her Annie. I know how much you love that musical...Okay, well, I\u2019ll call again soon. I love you.\u201d Beep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I save the message. Just like all the others. I lie down on my bed and focus on the ceiling. Try to shove the loneliness out of my mind. I\u2019ve always wanted a puppy, but Dad and Ryan are allergic. And now Mom has one\u2014without me.</p><p>Sometimes I catch Dad staring at a picture of him and Mom that he keeps in his wallet. Dad says he\u2019s forgiven her, but does that mean I have to?</p><p>I\u2019ve only seen her twice in the past year. I miss her, and I want her in my life, but I can\u2019t bring myself to tell her. I\u2019m ashamed I never call her. But if people hear about me hanging out with my mom again, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll wreck my life even more. She ruined my family.</p><p>Why did God let this happen to me?</p> <p>A few hours later, I go down the street to Drew\u2019s double-wide trailer, walk inside without knocking, and head to his room.</p><p>His buddies on the football team love calling him Double-wide Drew, insinuating that he is well-endowed. It makes Drew laugh. Double-wides are a luxury, you see. My family\u2019s lucky enough to have a three-bedroom house, but it\u2019s smack dab behind a laundromat and a fried chicken joint, so you can only imagine the smell. A mix of fabric softener and grease. But besides the terrible odor and the fact we are definitely not in the ritzy section of Franklin where people have swimming pools shaped like guitars, the location rocks. It\u2019s only three minutes by bike from school, and I love riding my bike everywhere it can take me.</p><p>I knock softly, push Drew\u2019s door open, and find him sitting at his desk, typing on his laptop, which is surrounded by his bobble-head collection. He\u2019s the only person I know who loves writing in his spare time. When he goes to Middle Tennessee State next year, he\u2019s going to study journalism so he can be a sports reporter one day. As much as he loves playing football and baseball, he\u2019ll never be good enough to get a scholarship. It\u2019s a sore subject because he\u2019s worked so hard for so long and could really use the money.</p><p>It\u2019s only Drew and his mom\u2014his dad left before he was born, and his mom waitresses at Cracker Barrel like sixty hours a week to make ends meet. I cook dinner for Dad and Ryan every night, so I usually end up making Drew a plate too. I set a bowl of steamed rice and chicken on his bedside table.</p><p>\u201cYo, Drewsky,\u201d I say, tiptoeing around sports magazines and several days\u2019 worth of discarded newspapers.</p> <p>He turns and smiles wide, standing up. \u201cHarry Potter movie marathon time!\u201d he says, hugging me. He\u2019s wearing a thin gray sweater layered on top of T-shirts. He has the right body to play both running back and second base, short and stocky, but somehow he\u2019s rocking the skinny jeans. He\u2019s fixed his hair again and doesn\u2019t smell like boy (like socks). He smells like lemons.</p><p>Everyone is used to Drew dressing up and always looking like a million bucks, because he wants to stand on the Titans sidelines and report for ESPN someday. But I feel like it might be more than that. And I don\u2019t want people to judge him like they\u2019ve judged me. I can only hope that his friends would support him more than mine supported me. Corndog\u2019s a good friend to him.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why Corndog\u2019s comment about me messing around with his friends bothered me so much today, but it did. I mean, I thought guys like one-night flings. Right? I\u2019ve only made out with, I dunno, four guys on the basketball team? And how many on the baseball team? Two? I can\u2019t believe Paul Briggs announced that I put out, right in front of Brian. What must he think of me?</p><p>I slip my boots off while Drew inhales the rice and chicken, because he\u2019s always hungry. He turns on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone and flips off the lights. He grabs the big bowl of popcorn he popped and then we stretch out on the bed. I\u2019ve been saving my calories all day for this popcorn.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your favorite Harry Potter character?\u201d Drew asks, shoving a handful of popcorn in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cRon. Obviously. You?\u201d</p> <p>He chews. \u201cHermione. She\u2019s a little sex kitten.\u201d</p><p>I shove his shoulder, nearly knocking him off the bed. \u201cThat\u2019s so perverted! She\u2019s like ten years old in this movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s older than me now! How is that perverted?\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather be Hufflepuff or Slytherin?\u201d I ask, picking my first piece of popcorn. Mmmm, butter.</p><p>\u201cSlytherin. I like green more than yellow.\u201d He pops a piece in his mouth. \u201cAs a house elf, would you rather be responsible for combing Hagrid\u2019s beard or washing Snape\u2019s greasy hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross! Uh, I\u2019d rather comb the beard because I might find interesting animals or food in there. I might even find mini bottles of butterbeer or something.\u201d</p><p>We talk during the movie, making fun of Draco\u2019s terrible slicked-back hairdo and Hermione being a know-it-all until Oliver Wood comes on the screen.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so hot,\u201d I say, groaning. \u201cI want to date a guy with a British accent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou? Dating?\u201d He snorggles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forget about my no-dating rule for Oliver Wood. Just look at him ride that broom!\u201d</p><p>Drew bursts out laughing. \u201cIf you absolutely had to date someone who lives in Franklin, or else you\u2019d be eaten by a dragon, who would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian Hoffman.\u201d It pops out and I cover my mouth.</p><p>\u201cCoach Hoffman? So that\u2019s why you wanted to follow him today?\u201d</p><p>When Brian and I were talking, I was smiling and laughing and I felt good. I want to know more about him. I enjoyed joking around and loved making him laugh. I liked what he said...It\u2019s a scary thing to wake up and realize the people you need most aren\u2019t nearby anymore...But you keep moving.</p><p>I reply, \u201cWhat can I say? That boy is hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boy is a man but yeah, he\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Coach Hoffman is hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell which guys are hot and which aren\u2019t,\u201d he says slowly, looking at the TV. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><p>I clap my hands. \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s a test. Oliver Wood\u2014hot or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you pass the test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he blurts. \u201cThat was a short test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cIs Paul Briggs hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d I tap my lip. \u201cIs Coach Hoffman hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ve established that. You sure are thinking about him, huh?\u201d He taps the back of my hand.</p><p>My face heats up. \u201cIs Corndog hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird thinking of my friend that way.\u201d Drew quickly says, \u201cIf you could be any Harry Potter character, who would you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor McGonagall, so I could turn into a cat and sleep all day...If you could have any magical power, what would it be?\u201d</p><p>He pauses long enough for Harry to fall in love with the Mirror of Erised. \u201cI\u2019d want to know how people would react ahead of time. To anything, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo um, what did you want to talk about? Amy? Why didn\u2019t you tell me things weren\u2019t okay with her?\u201d</p><p>He touches his throat. \u201cCan I get a rain check? I want to watch the movie.\u201d</p><p>I let out a sigh, relieved, glad he doesn\u2019t want to chat.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, Brian probably won\u2019t show at church, considering he\u2019s never there\u2014trust me, I would\u2019ve noticed him\u2014but what if he comes today?</p><p>I shave everything that needs shaving and moisturize everything that needs moisturizing. I even curl my eyelashes. \u201cOw,\u201d I blurt, when I pull on them too hard. I still haven\u2019t gotten the hang of that part of my beauty regimen yet.</p><p>I use nail polish remover to ditch the Bubblegum Pink. Then I pull open the top drawer of my vanity and dig through the heap of polishes. Malaysian Mint, Atomic Orange, Blushingham Palace, Canadian Maple Leaf...No, no, no, no.</p><p>Brian is older, classier. I bet he\u2019d like a soft color. I paw through the bottles. Going once...going twice...Passion Peach it is. I hum as I redo my nails. Two coats of peach and a layer of clear. I keep messing up my right thumb. I remove the polish twice. Third time\u2019s a charm.</p><p>I pull on a pink bra, and pinch the skin hanging over the elastic of the matching panties. Brian does not seem like a guy who appreciates muffin top. I drag my hands through my tangled hair, tangling it more.</p><p>Last, I put on a sleek black dress and pair it with my leather boots. I\u2019ve been saving up my baby-sitting money for college, but I decided to treat myself to this dress. I admire it in the mirror, sliding my hands up and down my hips, making sure I look elegant. Not butch. I wince, recalling how Laura told people that.</p><p>When I bought the dress at Cool Springs Mall yesterday, Drew said it seemed like a waste of money. \u201cYou look hot in anything,\u201d he\u2019d said, holding a polo up to his chest, admiring himself in the mirror. \u201cNo need to go all Rodeo Drive.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve got a few minutes before we need to leave for church, so I unzip the dress and lay it carefully on the back of my desk chair. Then I lock my door, lie down on my bed, and slip my fingers under the elastic of my underwear, wondering what it would feel like if a guy touched me there.</p><p>I\u2019m praying Brian comes to church with his parents today.</p><p>He must\u2019ve felt the connection too, right?</p><p>Reasons Why I\u2019m the Worst Christian of All Time</p><p>Exhibit One: I drop the F-bomb at least twice a day. To tell you the truth, I kinda love the word. It\u2019s so versatile. It can be an adjective, a noun, a verb. Also, I take the Lord\u2019s name in vain. Sometimes.</p><p>Exhibit Two: I break all sorts of Bible rules. I do not treat my body like a temple, like Brother John tells us we should. When Drew snuck wine to school in a Dr. Pepper bottle, I didn\u2019t hesitate to take a few sips in the janitor\u2019s closet between French III and World History.</p><p>Exhibit Three: I don\u2019t see how a loving God would split a family up like he did mine. Nor would he mess with Dad\u2019s head like that. Brother John always says, \u201cGod tests our faith.\u201d My question? Why would an all-powerful being be so jealous?</p><p>Church is the one thing Drew won\u2019t do with me. Not because he\u2019s atheist or belongs to some other religion or cult or anything. He specifically dislikes Forrest Sanctuary. Mostly for how the congregation talked about us after Mom left, but also because the church gives him the heebie-jeebies.</p><p>Dad pulls the Durango into the church parking lot. Ryan rubs at his face and the smell of beer and cigarettes and weed sweating out of his body wafts over. If someone gave him a breathalyzer right now, it\u2019d beep louder than a fire alarm. Just call my father Daddy Denial.</p><p>Thank heaven our church uses Food Lion grape juice instead of wine at communion, or my brother would probably pass out in front of the altar. Hey, it\u2019d give new meaning to bowing before God. Ryan wouldn\u2019t come to church if he had his way, but if he\u2019s going to live under Dad\u2019s roof, he has to play the game. Ryan is a very nice guy. A very nice and always stoned or drunk kind of guy who sometimes gets it on with random girls before Dad comes home. Okay, okay, it\u2019s not \u201crandom girls.\u201d But I\u2019m probably \u201crandom\u201d in Macy\u2019s eyes. She ignores everything that isn\u2019t a really boring book about political science. In that regard, they\u2019re a good couple because they are moody and ignore each other for the most part. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I always wear my headphones, to distract myself, when his bedframe slams against the wall between our rooms. I confronted him once, asking why he screws himself over like he does, and he said, \u201cI want to forget.\u201d It makes me sad that he wants to get away from the world so bad. I think it\u2019s because he\u2019s so smart, and sadness comes with knowing so much. I feel sad in that way sometimes.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see Rachel, Tate, and Aaron waving at me from the church playground. Our parents usually let us hang there instead of subjecting us to Coffee Time before Sunday school. But where\u2019s Seth? He\u2019s usually attached to Rachel\u2019s hip. I think he has a thing for her, but he\u2019s too embarrassed to get involved with her, considering the whole scandal with her dad, the district attorney, screwing his secretary and all.</p><p>I unbuckle my seatbelt and blurt, \u201cSee you at Big Church.\u201d</p><p>Mom started calling services Big Church when I was little, because the adults went there while kids went to Children\u2019s Church. I can\u2019t seem to break the habit.</p> <p>\u201cBye, Dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d he says, turning to face me. \u201cYou won\u2019t miss Sunday school this time, right?\u201d</p><p>I rub my palms on my new dress. \u201cIt was just that one time. We got to talking about Death Cab for Cutie, and then Laura told us that Brother John believes that any secular music is from the devil! And then Aaron said that at his old church, a bunch of the youth decided to burn all their secular music. Aaron said one girl burned a new iPod. Isn\u2019t that fucking outrageous?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung lady, watch your mouth,\u201d Dad replies, glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you hanging out with all those guys,\u201d Ryan says, rubbing his temples with his fingers. \u201cYou know what they want, right?\u201d</p> <p>I shove his shoulder and he groans and leans against the window. His forehead leaves a sweaty smudge on the glass.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d Dad asks me.</p><p>\u201cNope!\u201d</p><p>I love that Ryan\u2019s bombed again and Dad\u2019s worried that I\u2019m not wearing a coat. My brother\u2019s been getting trashed a lot lately. Sometimes I don\u2019t know what to do, like two weeks ago when I came home and found him curled up in bed with an empty bottle of Robitussin on the floor. He had drunk the whole thing. And when I confronted Dad about Ryan, he asked me to pray with him.</p><p>I open the door, step out onto asphalt spotted with overgrown weeds, and make my way to the playground. It\u2019s freezing outside, but I can\u2019t cover up this rockin\u2019 dress.</p><p>\u201cRemember what I said about Sunday school!\u201d Dad calls out. \u201cI love you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove you too!\u201d I yell back.</p><p>I skip toward Rachel, Tate, and Aaron, who look me up and down as I approach the seesaw. Aaron\u2019s eyes grow wide as he takes in my hips and chest.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t returned my calls,\u201d Aaron says slowly, his eyes becoming narrow slits.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve had a busy week.\u201d Now that I know this dress will have the desired effect, I\u2019m ready to go inside to see if Brian\u2019s here with his parents.</p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d Aaron asks, slipping his gas station jacket off. Its faded blue linen smells like dust and rain. Last week I buried my face in his shoulder and cringed while he peppered my neck with kisses.</p><p>He moves to slide the jacket around my shoulders, but I wave him off. He starts to put his jacket back on, looking disappointed. Corndog\u2019s comment about me messing with his friends rings in my mind again. I didn\u2019t realize I was hurting guys so much. It never occurred to me that they might want more. Does Aaron actually like like me? If so, I feel bad.</p><p>\u201cYou guys want to get a doughnut?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou? But you never eat anything,\u201d Tate says, looking up at me. He\u2019s 5'3\". He laughs and runs a hand through his shaggy, honey wheat hair. I love how he wears his Converses with black church pants. Leather bands are wrapped around his wrists, and a hemp necklace with a cross charm hangs from his neck. Last week he wore an X-Men tie. I said, \u201cI knew you were a mutant!\u201d and he laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI love stale powdered doughnuts,\u201d I say in a monotone.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m starving,\u201d Rachel adds. She\u2019s a sophomore. A younger, tinier version of her brother, Tate. She has a thing for wearing sweet little dresses and ballet flats.</p><p>Tate\u2019s nose wrinkles. \u201cYou actually want to go inside 15 minutes before Sunday school starts?\u201d I see his hand moving inside his pocket, touching something. Must be a cigarette he\u2019s dying to light up.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d I whine.</p><p>\u201cDoughnuts for the win,\u201d Aaron says, shoving his hands in his pockets.</p><p>I whisper to Rachel as we walk. \u201cDo you know a Brian Hoffman? I think his parents go to church with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never heard of him,\u201d she whispers back. \u201cHey, I love that dress. Goes great with the boots.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThanks. How\u2019re things going with Seth? Did he ask you out yet?\u201d</p><p>She scrunches up her face. \u201cNo. I invited him over Friday night and his parents said he couldn\u2019t come, but he snuck out and came anyway. We kissed a couple times, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with us.\u201d</p><p>I give her a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019m around if you want to talk or anything.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and takes off to find Seth. We trudge up to the Fellowship Hall and get in line for Coffee Time. I avoid Mrs. Carmichael, this ninety-something-year-old lady who thinks I\u2019m Sophia Loren. For real. She believes I\u2019m an actress and always tries to touch my face and hair. If she gets hold of my arm, her grandson will have to pry her off me.</p><p>Then Laura and Allie strut past, giggling.</p><p>\u201cWhere does she think she is? A strip club?\u201d Laura says, taking in my outfit.</p><p>I don\u2019t reply\u2014it\u2019s not right to hurt other people\u2019s feelings, even if they\u2019ve hurt mine. I smooth my dress. My eyes water.</p><p>\u201cPrudes,\u201d Tate says under his breath, making me smile. \u201cJealous prudes.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Brother John walks by. The youth pastor says, \u201cI hope you haven\u2019t been smoking again, Tate. God never intended for you to abuse yourself like that.\u201d He scans my dress, and my body tenses up as he stalks off.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too,\u201d Tate says, the corner of his mouth edging up.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why we still come here, what Dad\u2019s trying to prove. I look across the room as he chats with Tim Anderson of Anderson\u2019s Paint and Hardware and Jack Taylor of the Jack Taylor Ford dealership. Sometimes I hear them teasing Dad because he works at City Hall, stamping housing permits and whatnot, and doesn\u2019t own his own business or have stock or anything. Whatever. He says he comes for \u201cfellowship\u201d and \u201cfriends,\u201d but what kind of friends don\u2019t stick by you after your wife leaves? No one from church ever invites him to bingo parties or to play golf anymore.</p><p>So what if he\u2019s been coming here since he was a boy? Gramma and Poppy retired to Florida\u2014it\u2019s not as if they\u2019d notice if we stopped coming. But Dad\u2019s always talking about the good times he\u2019s had here, hoping the good times will start again. For years and years, he ran the church-wide barbecue and held barbecue sauce contests. All the men went wild for it. But Brother Michael canceled it last year, claiming interest had gone down. Dad said he understood, but I was so sad for him.</p><p>I have a lot of good memories from church too. Pouring hot wax into sand at Vacation Bible School, to make a candle for Mom. Packing baskets of canned goods and delivering them to less privileged families. Kneeling at the altar and thanking God for my friends. For Laura and Allie, who I played Beauty Parlor with. In junior high, we\u2019d go to the city pool, lay our beach towels on the steaming hot concrete, and stare at Jeff, this lifeguard who looked like a Ken doll and drove a Harley.</p><p>I get a powdered doughnut and a black coffee, then go stand next to a window where I can see the entire room. Prime vantage point. No sign of Brian. Tate and Aaron join me, holding white paper napkins filled with donuts.</p><p>Tate and Aaron eat approximately twenty stale doughnuts and slurp down their coffees in the amount of time it takes me to eat my one doughnut. The church bell dings and dongs, letting us know that Sunday school starts in ten minutes. I love that bell. When I was little, the ushers would let me pull the long velvet cord, to make the bell sound clear across the county. I wish life were still simple like that sound.</p><p>It\u2019s like the minute we entered high school, the church\u2019s messages all changed. It was no longer about loving God. It was about not sinning. No drinking beer, no touching body parts that bathing suits cover, no swearing.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t Seth and Rachel hanging out with us?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Tate\u2019s face goes white. \u201cWell, his mom told him to stop hanging around us...I guess she saw you and Aaron on the playground last Sunday, um...\u201d</p><p>Aaron crumples his Styrofoam cup. \u201cShut up, man.\u201d</p><p>I stare across the Fellowship Hall at Seth. He lifts his chin, acknowledging me, then goes back to talking to Rachel. Seth\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t seem pleased about that either. I get that his mom wants to protect him. But Rachel\u2019s a sweet girl.</p><p>I used to be a sweet girl.</p><p>Tate and Rachel didn\u2019t turn on me post Mom-gate. They go to Woodbury High, with Aaron, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re great friends or anything, but they\u2019re good company. We giggle a lot. Especially when Brother John does PowerPoint presentations of common devil worshipping signs.</p><p>But Aaron\u2019s new here. That\u2019s the only reason his parents haven\u2019t told him to steer clear of me, Parker Shelton, Sinner Extraordinaire.</p><p>I should have business cards made.</p><p>They say you give us gifts. You made Drew great at football, but he\u2019s no Jordan Woods. He\u2019ll never play in college. You made Dad an architect, but he\u2019s not designing skyscrapers in New York or opera houses in Paris. You made me into a killer softball player. Good enough to make the all-conference team sophomore year. But more than that, you gave me something I loved.</p><p>But didn\u2019t you realize that when you took Mom from me, that you were also taking something we shared? Mom was there the first time I picked up a tee-ball bat. Mom bought me my first glove. She showed me how to put a ball in my glove, wrap it up in a rubber band and put it under my pillow at night, so I could break it in. So I could dream about it.</p><p>But you took away that dream, and now I don\u2019t know what\u2019s left.</p><p>Written during services on February 14. Burned.</p><p>Brian never showed at Big Church.</p><p>But before I left, I lifted a copy of the church directory from the main office, so I could stalk Brian in the comfort of my home.</p><p>\u201cIs that them, you think?\u201d Drew asks, pointing at a picture of an older couple. The caption reads Mr. and Mrs. William Hoffman. Where Brian\u2019s sexiness came from is not evident in this picture. But they\u2019re the only Hoffmans at Forrest Sanctuary.</p><p>I close the directory, go over to my vanity, and drag a hand through my drawer o\u2019nail polishes. I pick out Bodacious Boysenberry and carry it to my bed, where I plop down next to Drew and start removing Passion Peach.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s Google him!\u201d he says, opening my laptop, going into reporter mode. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I groan. If I do that, I\u2019ll be a bona fide stalker. My business card should actually read \u201cParker Shelton, Slutty Sinner Sleuth Extraordinaire.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s already typing his name into the search bar. Right then Ryan pokes his head in my room.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asks. Dark circles ring his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGive me twenty minutes, and I\u2019ll start cooking,\u201d I say, holding up my nails. Ryan nods and the door clicks shut. I love, love, love cooking, but it\u2019s the only chore I really like. I love taste testing. Mom never worked. She was a housewife, and when she left, I had to take on chores like laundry and ironing after Dad turned his T-shirts pink and burned his thumb while pressing his pants. I wish Mom and Dad were still together. I wish her dog Annie was here. All I really want in life is a big furry dog that slobbers a lot.</p> <p>\u201cHere he is!\u201d Drew says. Brian\u2019s Facebook page pops up. The profile picture is of him in a Georgia Tech baseball uniform, holding a bat. He\u2019s smiling. He\u2019s younger than he is now. The rest of the profile is locked down, so I can\u2019t get any juicy details like his favorite books and movies, to see what we have in common.</p><p>\u201cYou should friend request him,\u201d Drew says, moving the cursor to click the button.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d I slap his hand and log out of my account before he does something drastic.</p><p>I make a split-second decision to repaint my nails with Passion Peach.</p><p>When I asked if he played ball, Brian replied, \u201cSomething like that.\u201d He played college ball but won\u2019t admit it?! I start to Google his name, then shut the laptop. I will not be a psycho, no matter how much I want to know him. No matter how much I want to feel that link again. He understands what it\u2019s like to miss someone. He treated me like I\u2019m somebody worth knowing.</p> <p>Brian Hoffman. Who are you?</p><p>defcon 1</p><p>49 days until i turn 18</p><p>My Monday thus far:</p><p>1. Ride bike to school. Store bike at racks. Notice Brian\u2019s red truck. Casually peek in windows for clues as to who he is. A fruit punch Gatorade sits in the center console along with a heap of coins. He has two bumper stickers: one is for the Braves, the other reads coexist and is covered by all these symbols that I recognize from Brother John\u2019s PowerPoint presentation on devil worshipping signs. Based on this evidence, I have determined Brian and I are meant to be together. I love Gatorade! I use money! The Braves were my team once. I believe in coexisting. Totally meant to be together! (Kidding, kidding.)</p><p>2. Inside Hundred Oaks before first period, I make a point of walking by Coach Burns\u2019s office near the gym. No sign of Brian. Unfortunately I hear Coach Burns talking on his phone. His sweet nothings are gag-worthy. \u201cYes, baby. I love you, sweet plum.\u201d Sweet plum? Really?</p> <p>3. Daydream during advanced US history. Does Brian have an apartment? I picture myself tangled up in his crumpled sheets, our legs knotted. The idea scares me a little because I\u2019ve never gotten naked with anybody. I close my eyes, thinking of him in the buff, and accidently let out a moan. The entire class looks at me.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Crickets.</p><p>Embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cSlut,\u201d Laura hisses under her breath.</p><p>Prude, I think, remembering what Tate said at church.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey! I\u2019m trying to learn here,\u201d Sam says, slipping a pencil behind his ear. \u201cSome of us think about more than the opposite sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one believes that, Sam,\u201d Mr. Davis says, rubbing his eyes.</p> <p>4. I walk by Coach Burns\u2019s office between classes. Where is Brian? He must be the only coach/teacher who doesn\u2019t actually come to school. Gar. This time Coach Burns has two guys in his office and is yelling at them for horsing around in the locker room. Apparently one guy stole the other\u2019s clothes and tried to flush them down the toilet, which explains why the other is wearing only boxers with pine trees on them. I remember those boring underpants from the Pajama Party Prom.</p><p>At lunchtime, I\u2019m sitting in the cafeteria, checking over Drew\u2019s algebra, when Corndog plops down next to me.</p><p>\u201cCan I see your calc homework?\u201d he asks. \u201cI want to make sure I got the third word problem right.\u201d</p><p>A month ago, I would\u2019ve said \u201chells to the no,\u201d but valedictorian is in the bag and Corndog got stuck in second place because he bombed that horrific chemistry pop quiz back in October. Ha! Our school announced the valedictorian and salutatorian in January, so I\u2019m not studying for three hours a night anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhich problem was that again?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Corndog reads from his book. \u201cA cup is in the shape of a truncated cone with a radius of 4 centimeters at the top and 2 centimeters at the bottom and a height of 6 centimeters. Water is being poured into the cup such that the height of the water in the cup is changing. Write an equation for volume of the water in the cup as a function of its height.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one was hard. My answer\u2019s in my blue folder.\u201d I nod at my backpack. He digs around inside, pulls out the folder, and brushes his brown hair away from his face.</p><p>I erase Drew\u2019s answer to number four and fill in the correct one. He hovers over my shoulder, watching.</p><p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAre y\u2019all cheating?\u201d Corndog asks, peering at Drew\u2019s homework.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I feel myself blushing. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d I ask, pointing at my paper.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I couldn\u2019t do this problem is \u2019cause I didn\u2019t have a cup.\u201d Corndog purses his lips, laughing.</p><p>I set my pencil down. \u201cEnlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have my cup? As manager of the baseball team, aren\u2019t you in charge of our equipment?\u201d</p><p>Drew bursts out laughing.</p><p>\u201cI am not in charge of your cups or your dirty jockstraps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk tsk. I\u2019m going to report you to Coach Hoffman for not being in complete control of our equipment.\u201d</p><p>Drew is wiping tears away from his eyes.</p><p>I stare Corndog down. \u201cI\u2019m going to report you for being a complete tool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to write an answer to this problem if you can\u2019t tell me where my cup is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d touch a cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even say, Bates\u2019s?\u201d He smirks and stares past me at Drew, who quickly looks away. His face goes red, and he plucks his algebra homework from my hand, gathers his backpack and laptop case and storms out of the cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Corndog asks, his forehead crinkling.</p><p>I rap my pencil on the table. \u201cPiss off, Corndog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d His face turns serious. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Saturday...you said something about Drew? Did you really think I\u2019d use my best friend? Do you really think I\u2019m that kind of person?\u201d I play with a string hanging from my hoodie, waiting for him to respond.</p><p>He steals a chip off my tray. \u201cOn Friday night at Miller\u2019s Hollow, he told me he was dumping Amy. He said he doesn\u2019t like her as much as he likes someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think he meant me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and eats another of my chips. \u201cI dunno. I figured so.\u201d</p><p>I shove a bunch of chips in my mouth and crunch on them. I swallow, hating that I\u2019m giving in to hunger. I want people to see me as pretty, as ladylike.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him like that,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he replies, dragging a hand through his hair. \u201cPoor Bates.\u201d For as much as he gets on my nerves, Corndog\u2019s a pretty good friend to lots of people. But he obviously doesn\u2019t share my suspicions about Drew.</p><p>At the table behind us, Laura is going on and on about the Prom Decisional. \u201cY\u2019all, you have to vote for a Disney theme. You just have to. I\u2019m gonna dress as Princess Jasmine and I\u2019ll get Aaron Pritchard to go as Aladdin!\u201d</p><p>Aaron from church? The Aaron I made out with? Same ole Laura. What\u2019s mine is hers, and what\u2019s hers will always be hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather do the Roaring Twenties,\u201d Allie tells Laura. \u201cWouldn\u2019t flapper dresses be so cute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing Disney!\u201d Laura squeals.</p><p>Corndog groans so low I can barely hear him. \u201cDisney sounds terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Ancient Rome more,\u201d I reply. \u201cI have this gorgeous white silk dress I could wear.\u201d It belonged to Mom, but she never wore it and left it behind for me.</p><p>\u201cSounds pretty. Who are you going with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one in particular. I love my dress though,\u201d I say, smiling to myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of suggesting a Ho Down Prom. We\u2019ll tell all the girls it\u2019s a farm theme, you see, but really all the guys will dress in drag. Like hookers. Get it? A Ho Down?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019d pay money to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d Corndog chuckles and grabs another chip. \u201cSo are you gonna tell me what you did with my cup?\u201d</p><p>I grab a handful of chips and throw them in Corndog\u2019s face.</p><p>I hear a laugh. A shadow falls across my tray and papers, and someone taps my shoulder. \u201cParker, I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re keeping my captain in check.\u201d</p><p>I twirl around and look up to find Brian Hoffman standing there in a button-down Oxford shirt and black tie. He looks like a Geek Squad sexpot. Black hair falls in waves around his ears.</p><p>He nods once at me. \u201cI need your help with something after practice this evening. Can you stay for fifteen minutes or so past six o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes?\u201d I squeak.</p><p>\u201cGive or take a few.\u201d Brian smiles.</p><p>I examine my nail polish. I\u2019m glad I stuck with Passion Peach. \u201cYeah, I can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, see you then.\u201d</p><p>A bunch of girls, including Laura, stare at him as he struts out of the cafeteria.</p><p>Corndog gives me a smile and looks from me to the cafeteria doors, shaking his head. \u201cYou are highly entertaining, Parker Shelton.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re not going to believe this, but after lunch, I don\u2019t stalk Coach Burns\u2019s office to look for Brian. Instead, I stalk Drew\u2019s locker to make sure he\u2019s all right. A sign advertising the annual Baseball-Softball Prom Decisional on April third hangs on the wall. Tickets for the game are already on sale.</p><p>I glance at my watch a few times and slide on fresh lip gloss while waiting for him. Approaching at my ten o\u2019clock is Ty Green, aka the hottest guy at school, swaggering sexily. We talked briefly at this New Year\u2019s party, but he disappeared before the ball dropped. When the ball fell, I was all alone, and this incredible loneliness washed over me, like being pulled under by a strong tide.</p><p>Ty gives me this knowing grin, then heads toward the art room. That\u2019s when Drew shows up with Matt Higgins, who does this vanishing act into the library. As if he\u2019s ever been in there.</p><p>Drew opens his locker to check his reflection in the little mirror he has hanging inside.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He grins at himself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like the Narcissus of Hundred Oaks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looks over his shoulder at me. \u201cWho? You callin\u2019 me a girl?\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes and shake my head. My brother has been complaining for years that he and I must be the only cultured people in Franklin. \u201cNo, he was this Greek guy. In the time of the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a Greek god? I knew you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, you.\u201d I shut his locker door and pull him into the library, leading him to the magazine room. We fall down onto cushy chairs. Drew sets his laptop case on the floor. He always keeps his computer nearby in case he has a free moment to write.</p> <p>I open my purse and pull out my compact so I can re-powder my face. I dab it across my nose and chin. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He props his ankle on his knee and shakes his foot.</p><p>\u201cYou ran out of the cafeteria. I was worried.\u201d I shut my compact and slip it back into my bag.</p><p>Drew drums his fingers on the chair\u2019s arm, then takes my hand and studies my peach nails. \u201cI like this color. It\u2019s simple.\u201d He slowly meets my eyes.</p><p>My cell beeps, and I quickly check the screen. Mom. She sent me a text saying she hopes I\u2019m having a nice day. \u201cUgghhh,\u201d I groan. \u201cShe\u2019s so annoying. She won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to her lately?\u201d Drew asks softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes she calls my mom to check in, because you never answer her calls. Why haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I snap. The librarian gives me a warning glare. \u201cShe ruined my family and everything with my church when she...you know...came out. I just don\u2019t get why she had to leave us.\u201d</p> <p>I rarely talk about any of this, not even with my family, so I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s tumbling out of my mouth. It\u2019s like, if none of this had happened, everything would\u2019ve been okay with me\u2014with church, with softball, maybe I would\u2019ve had real dates. The real goddamn kicker is that her girlfriend, Theresa, was the church office assistant.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not your mom\u2019s fault,\u201d Drew starts.</p><p>\u201cBut it is.\u201d I shove the phone deep in my bag.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t help it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me that she\u2019s gay. I just wish my family was still together.\u201d My eyes water.</p><p>He hesitates, and looks around the magazine room. His mouth opens, but the warning bell rings for next class and Drew jumps to his feet. He throws an arm around me as we enter the crowded hallway.</p><p>Laura had a big black dog named June. I loved going to her house. I\u2019d throw stick after stick, and June would go retrieve them and lope back to me, and I swear, if dogs could smile, June would have the biggest grin on her face. I loved playing with that dog. Hugging her. Kissing her. Laura hated that I got along so well with the dog, because June belonged to her and she didn\u2019t like sharing.</p><p>Then, one Sunday morning, Laura told me June had died. I cried during Sunday School. I wiped tears off my face during Big Church, using the hem of my dress. Mom and Dad asked what was wrong, so I told them the dog had died. When my parents expressed their condolences to Brother John, he told them June was alive and well. And then Brother John gave me a lecture on how lying is a straight path to Hell. I never told anyone that Laura lied. I didn\u2019t want anyone to tell her she was on a path to Hell.</p> <p>Written February 15. Wadded up and burned. The flame caught my thumb and I stuck it in my mouth, to soothe it.</p><p>Today\u2019s practice starts out with a team meeting. I squeeze between Drew and Sam on the bleachers.</p><p>Brian is standing in front of us, twirling a bat in his hands like a pinwheel. I\u2019m glad to see he ditched the Best Buy employee costume for a sweatshirt and baseball pants that\u2019ve seen a few workouts.</p><p>He glances at me and then focuses on Coach Burns, who clears his throat and reads from his clipboard, telling us about the first game set to take place Saturday against Tullahoma. He explains that we should meet at school at 6:30 a.m. to get on the bus so we can go to Cracker Barrel for breakfast and then make it to Tullahoma in time to warm up.</p><p>Drew growls, \u201cI hate Cracker Barrel. I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d His mom is always bringing food home because she gets a 50 percent discount.</p><p>\u201cI love their pancakes,\u201d I say, knocking my knee against his. \u201cI wish you\u2019d hook me up more often.\u201d</p><p>Drew knocks his knee against mine. \u201cAs if you\u2019d eat a pancake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would eat one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPancakes or waffles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaffles. Syrup or butter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Shelton, is there a problem?\u201d Brian asks. He stops twirling his bat.</p><p>\u201cUm, no?\u201d I narrow my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cNo private conversations while Coach Burns is talking, please.\u201d He turns his gaze from me to Coach Burns, and heat rushes through my body. Why\u2019d he have to embarrass me like that?</p><p>Since the softball team is still using the field, Coach Burns starts talking strategy for Tullahoma, the first of forty-five games. The football team gets all the money they want, but our baseball and softball teams share equipment and a field. Coach Burns seems like the kind of guy who makes do with whatever he gets. What kind of coach will Brian be next year?</p><p>Coach Burns says blah, blah and I focus on the softball team, watching them scrimmage. The girl they\u2019ve got playing third base has poor range. She\u2019s not quick on her feet. I could always cover the entire gap between third and shortstop, diving when I needed to, taking a ball straight to the gut when required. This girl barely moves three feet, then lets the left fielder clean up her mistakes.</p><p>Laura steps up to bat next. I feel a pang of hatred for her as I watch her dig a trench with her cleat. She taps her bat on home plate then rests it on her shoulder. Terrible stance. How is Coach Lynn standing for this?</p><p>I scan the field for her, but she\u2019s nowhere. Then I notice Mr. Majors, the music teacher, is standing by the dugout reading People. What? Where\u2019s Coach Lynn? They\u2019ve got the resident accordion player supervising practice? Huh. I hope she\u2019s okay.</p><p>Laura swings at the first two pitches, missing both.</p><p>I pull my knees to my chest and stare at the field, sort of wishing I was out there. Ever since I came here on Saturday, my hands have been aching to hold a bat. I want to slip cleats on and jog the bases and slide into home. I shake these ideas out of my head the moment I see Allie and Melanie pointing at me from first and second bases, respectively.</p><p>Boy, have I fallen. I might as well be third-string.</p><p>Laura takes a few more practice swings. Hardly any pitchers are great batters, because they spend all their time practicing pitching, but Laura\u2019s worse at bat than most. She makes up for it on the mound\u2014she\u2019s one of the best in the conference. I\u2019m feeling evil, so I pray she\u2019ll strike out. Strike out, strike out. She steps up and swings away at a high ball.</p><p>Strike three!</p><p>I clap my hands together and laugh.</p><p>\u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to share with us, Parker?\u201d Brian asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a look. He mouths, sir?</p><p>I salute, which makes him chuckle. His eyes look like melted Hershey\u2019s Kisses.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to find out what he needs help with after practice.</p><p>An eon later, practice ends.</p><p>Brian beckons me to follow him toward center field, toward the batting cages. He twirls his bat and glances back at me.</p><p>I trot up to his side. \u201cSo you need my help with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d His stride is long and full of importance.</p><p>I pull my hair over one shoulder and play with a clump of it, trying to de-stress. He smells delicious, like bubblegum, and his frayed sweatshirt looks soft. It\u2019s the kind of shirt I\u2019d love to curl up in to watch TV.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had a haircut?\u201d he jokes.</p><p>\u201cNot in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d He checks my tangles out.</p><p>\u201cI like my hair! Most guys like it too!\u201d</p><p>He laughs and chews his gum, making a smacking noise. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to say.\u201d He goes silent. Cars roar by on the highway beyond the train tracks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t totally honest with you about the stats on Saturday...It\u2019s just, I was enjoying talking to you and didn\u2019t want to stop.\u201d</p><p>He nods and gives me a smile. \u201cApology accepted.\u201d</p><p>He pulls open the center field gate, and we walk over to the batting cages. The sun has completely set, and only a few floodlights illuminate the field. I shiver, and warm my hands in my armpits.</p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod. Normally, this is when the guy would warm me up in some way, by hugging me or giving me his jacket or starting an intense make-out session that would leave me hotter than a volcano. But all Brian does is turn on the pitching machine and swing his bat.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to load balls for you?\u201d I ask, not totally disappointed. It\u2019s nice he wants my company.</p><p>He finds my eyes. \u201cNo. I want you to hit for me.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open. My fingers itch to hold a bat. My fingers itch to hold him too, but that\u2019s beside the point.</p><p>I step closer and look up at his face. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...I\u2019m interested to see what you\u2019ve got. You played varsity as a freshman? That\u2019s gotta mean something.\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cWill you hit a few balls? For me?\u201d His voice is soft and pleading.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d</p><p>He moves a step closer and stares down at me. \u201cI\u2019d hate to see someone with potential throw it all away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I bat for you, what\u2019s in it for me?\u201d</p><p>He smirks slightly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>You. I don\u2019t say that though. He watches as I play with my hair.</p><p>\u201cIn return, I want you to tell me about what baseball means to you,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you play? And you can\u2019t just say \u2018something like that.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He exhales, and stares up at the stars. \u201cYes, I played. Now you have to hit a ball.\u201d</p><p>I grab his elbow. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough. Where did you play? For how long? What position? What\u2019s your best batting average? Or are you a pitcher? What\u2019s your ERA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa,\u201d he says, raising a hand, looking amused. \u201cBat first, talk second.\u201d</p><p>I take the aluminum bat from his hand, run my fingers over the cool metal, and take a few practice swings. My arms feel stiff and weak, but I haven\u2019t lost my mechanics. Batting is like breathing.</p><p>He steps over to the pitching machine and turns it off. The whirring sound ceases. He picks up a softball and tosses it to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll throw a few at you first, if you\u2019d rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you turn the damned machine back on?\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows, smiles, and laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re a feisty one. No wonder all the guys like you so much.\u201d</p><p>I shoot him a look, but deep down I\u2019m pleased he called me feisty and knows that guys like me. One point for Parker.</p><p>He turns the machine back on and stands behind the protective fence. I put on a batting helmet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d I take another practice swing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got good form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>He grins. \u201cBoy, are you humble. Here we go.\u201d He feeds a ball into the machine and it whizzes toward me. I let it pass. I dig my boot into the dirt, wishing I had cleats. I take another practice swing.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Brian says, dropping a ball into the hole.</p><p>This time I swing and make contact. The ball slams into the fence right in Brian\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSure. Take whatever\u2019s wrong out on me,\u201d he says with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d Back into my stance. Practice swing before the real thing. This time I connect. Feel a rush of electricity tingle down my biceps and forearms. I knocked it out of the park. Well, I hit the rear nets. But I bet it would\u2019ve been out of the park. And it feels good. I grin.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d Brian asks, holding up another ball.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I drop the bat. \u201cYou got any more of that gum?\u201d</p><p>At 7:00 p.m.\u2014way past the 15 minutes I\u2019d agreed to\u2014Brian turns off the pitching machine. I only missed, I dunno, six or seven balls out of a hundred? My muscles are screaming at me and I\u2019m stiff as stale licorice, but my mind feels clearer than it has in a long time.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019ve got a bat on you,\u201d he exclaims, walking over as I pull off my helmet. \u201cFun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d I admit. \u201cNow what about my questions? Are you going to answer them now?\u201d</p><p>My stomach grumbles.</p> <p>\u201cHungry?\u201d He takes his cap off, smoothes his hair, and puts it back on.</p><p>\u201cStarved.\u201d I poke him in the chest. \u201cBut you owe me a bunch of answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, true.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cWould you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I?\u201d I\u2019m bouncing on my tiptoes now.</p><p>He secures his bat beneath his arm. \u201cWant to get some food?\u201d</p><p>Holy scandal!</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of food?\u201d I ask, calm and cool.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, does it matter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat olives.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cI once read that there\u2019s an olive in the world for everybody, you just have to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t found any olives that I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we won\u2019t get olives.\u201d</p><p>I blow warm air onto my hands and rub them together. \u201cIs this okay? I mean, are we allowed to talk off school property?\u201d</p><p>He thinks for a few secs. \u201cI haven\u2019t read the school handbook. I have no idea. But we\u2019re not going clubbing or anything. We\u2019re just getting food, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Totally cool. I\u2019m totally cool. Breathe. \u201cWhy do you want to get dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>He lifts a shoulder, chewing his gum. \u201cWe both gotta eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have plans? A family? A girlfriend? A wife?\u201d</p><p>He laughs and jingles his keys. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place is a total swamp.\u201d</p><p>Brian tosses his beige cap onto the dashboard. \u201cI came here all the time in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? Like fifty years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush,\u201d he says with a smile. He musses his wavy black curls before we climb out of his truck. The neon Foothills Diner sign flickers in the window. Empty plastic bottles and cigarette butts litter the parking lot. No one from school ever comes here\u2014because it\u2019s a total swamp, making it an ideal place where no one will see us.</p><p>He opens the door for me; the little bell jingles. Burger stench hits me in the face.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of my favorite places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cKiller cheese fries.\u201d He points at me. \u201cWith bacon bits.\u201d</p><p>My mouth waters. \u201cI looooooovvve bacon bits.\u201d</p><p>If Brian wants me to eat cheese fries, I\u2019m eating cheese fries. I once read that the bloomin\u2019 onion at Outback Steakhouse has 1,800 calories, so I can only imagine how much fat these cheese fries have. How big are the portions? I take a quick glance around the tiny diner and find that the plates are the size of trashcan lids. Lovely.</p><p>Brian asks the hostess if we can take the booth in the corner, and a wave of embarrassment floods my body. He doesn\u2019t want to be seen with me. But if he didn\u2019t want to be seen with me, would he risk going anywhere public? Believe it or not, swampy Foothills Diner is a public place.</p><p>\u201cParker?\u201d</p><p>I look up to find Brian already sitting in the booth with his arm stretched across the back of the seat, and I\u2019m still standing by the door. I\u2019m such a nerd. I shuffle over and plop down in the seat across from him right as the waitress saunters up to ask for our drink order. She checks Brian out the way I stare at pictures of cupcakes.</p><p>Brian reads the drink menu. \u201cI\u2019ll take a PBR on tap.\u201d</p><p>He ordered a beer?! He\u2019s a coach at my school and he orders a beer? What does that mean? Does he feel comfortable with me like I feel comfortable with him?</p><p>\u201cAnd for you?\u201d the waitress asks, giving me stink eye. It\u2019s like she\u2019s daring me to order a beer.</p><p>I take the menu from Brian\u2019s hand and scan it. My fingers stick to the sticky plastic. \u201cIced tea? Unsweetened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing up,\u201d the waitress says, smiling brightly at Brian, and then goes behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cI forgot you can\u2019t drink yet,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even vote yet.\u201d</p><p>He examines the mini jukebox on the table. \u201cWhen can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril fifth.\u201d</p><p>He rubs the scruff on his jaw. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a great bat. I can\u2019t wait to see you in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says you\u2019re going to see me in the field?\u201d I start looking over the dinner menu, to see if anything might be less than 80,000 calories.</p><p>\u201cI figured...You know, since you enjoyed batting tonight, you might want to go out for the team again.\u201d</p><p>The waitress sets our drinks on the table.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to rejoin the team, but I do love softball,\u201d I admit.</p><p>He rushes to sip his beer. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I fish a Splenda out of the sugar caddy, rip the package open, and stir the powder into my tea. \u201cI\u2019m not answering any of your questions until you answer mine, Brian Hoffman. You must be the king of deflection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d He shrugs a little, smiling. It\u2019s cute, and I find myself leaning across the table toward him, cradling my tea glass with both hands.</p><p>\u201cTell me about you and baseball.\u201d</p><p>He nurses his beer. \u201cNot much to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much?\u201d</p><p>He swallows another sip. \u201cI got a scholarship to play at Georgia Tech, but I never got much playing time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be a great hitter, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d he says softly. I get what he means: Playing outfield doesn\u2019t take the kind of skill you need to play say, pitcher, catcher, or shortstop. All the really great batters play outfield.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d</p><p>Half his beer is gone already. Will I have to drive him home?</p><p>\u201cLost my timing...wasn\u2019t as good as I thought I was...coaches thought I\u2019d peak, but I never did.\u201d His brown eyes bore into mine. Embarrassed, but open. My mind flashes back to how he showed me his bitten fingernails.</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He raps his fork on the table. \u201cIn four years of college, I never started. I became a utility player they used only when another guy needed a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you regret playing in college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...it\u2019s just, I learned from it. That and...well, I learned that I can\u2019t plan anything anymore.\u201d He rubs his eyes and looks out the window, hesitating. A semi pulls into the parking lot. \u201cI need to take it all as it comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t some plans important, though?\u201d I ask, thinking of Vanderbilt, where I can start all over.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI live for now. Which is why I want to see you play again. I can tell how much you like it. What if you regret it later?\u201d</p><p>I lick my lips. He\u2019s right. But I\u2019m not sure I want to reach out again.</p><p>That\u2019s when Waitress Seductress Extraordinaire comes back and gets our order. Brian surprises me by ordering for us. \u201cWe\u2019re sharing an order of Fries \u00e0 la Appalachia,\u201d he says, handing over the menus and turning his focus back to me. Le waitress stomps off.</p><p>I ask, \u201cWhy are they called that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when they\u2019ve got the fries stacked up they\u2019re higher than a mountain range.\u201d</p><p>I groan and touch my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny,\u201d he says, his eyes twinkling. He scrunches his bangs in his fist.</p><p>I pull my legs up under my butt and ask, \u201cSo do you know which gym class you\u2019re teaching yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m shadowing Coach Burns...but I\u2019m going to take over Coach Lynn\u2019s classes when she goes on maternity leave the last week of April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be my gym teacher? You\u2019d better not make us do step aerobics or play with the giant parachute or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re definitely gonna play with the giant parachute...\u201d He runs a hand over his head, looking around the diner. He smiles and focuses on me again. \u201cTechnically, I\u2019ll only be your gym teacher for like two weeks. And then you graduate. And then I\u2019m teaching driver\u2019s ed this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s so cool,\u201d I tease.</p><p>He laughs, but then grows serious again. \u201cI never planned on becoming a teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you plan on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to the majors...And if not that, then maybe working for an MLB club. As a coach or trainer or something. That\u2019s why I got a master\u2019s, so I could at least work in the game...I might try to get a job doing field crew somewhere. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d</p><p>I sip my tea and swallow. He doesn\u2019t offer any further details about his career choices, so I change the subject. \u201cSo, what brought you back here?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates and chooses a song to play on the jukebox. \u201cEverywhere\u201d by Tim McGraw. A great, depressing choice. Finally he whispers, \u201cI wanted to be back with my parents for a while?\u201d He says it like a question. Like he\u2019s unsure of why he\u2019s living with his parents? Like he\u2019s unsure of why he\u2019s admitting this to me?</p><p>Maybe I do need to Google him. Brian Hoffman is like an onion. I peel back one layer only to find a hundred denser layers full of secrets.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss your parents?\u201d I ask, missing my own mom like crazy.</p><p>He nods, finding my eyes. He looks younger than twenty-three right now. Did he wander after not making it to the major leagues? Is he lost?</p><p>\u201cDo you like coaching at all?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me over the top of his glass as he sips his beer. \u201cI don\u2019t have much interest in writing daily status reports for Dr. Salter on how the baseball team is doing. Shouldn\u2019t our win-loss record be report enough? And you wouldn\u2019t believe what the women talk about in the teachers\u2019 lounge. I\u2019ve learned all about breast pumps.\u201d He shudders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laugh. \u201cSo it\u2019s not what you expected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughs with me. \u201cI guess I thought...I guess I thought that if I came back to Franklin, I would feel good again. Like in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollege was really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I expected. Like I said, I thought I\u2019d be playing ball and going on to bigger things. I thought if I came back here I could at least have fun with my old friends...but they\u2019re all busy planning weddings and buying houses and having kids, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for that.\u201d</p> <p>This conversation feels very adult-ish and mature. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s speaking to me about it, but I can tell he doesn\u2019t want to. \u201cOkay, on to a more important question,\u201d I ask, propping my chin on my fist.</p><p>He glances up, wary.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your most embarrassing moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks amused. \u201cThat\u2019s your important question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important!\u201d I nod seriously, trying not to crack up.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, well, if I tell you this, you can\u2019t tell anyone at school. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPinky swear.\u201d I link my finger with his.</p><p>\u201cSo...in high school, this buddy of mine and I discovered that if you climbed up on top of the lockers in the boys\u2019 locker room, you could push the ceiling tiles up and crawl into the ceiling next to the girls\u2019 locker room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you like, fell through the ceiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fall through the ceiling! At least...not then anyway.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI gotta hear more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUp in the ceiling, the wall between the two locker rooms was made of concrete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcrete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend Evan got this idea that we could chisel through the concrete. Like make a tunnel.\u201d</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>\u201cWe spent two months chiseling through the concrete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you worried about structural damage? Why didn\u2019t you just run into the locker room or something if you wanted to see the girls so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sixteen. I wasn\u2019t thinking about structural damage. I was thinking about how if Evan and I ran in the locker room all the girls would scream and yell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you were hot in high school. Why\u2019d you need to spy on girls to see them naked?\u201d</p> <p>I cannot. Believe. I said that.</p><p>Brian\u2019s face goes redder than the ketchup. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was about the adventure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe adventure of chiseling through concrete to spy on girls?\u201d I snorggle.</p><p>He gives me a look. \u201cDo you want to hear the rest of the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen behave.\u201d</p><p>I salute. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop calling me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the story already.\u201d</p><p>Our drinks sit untouched as Brian and I move closer and closer, leaning across the table toward each other. We\u2019re laughing as Brian goes on to explain that after they chiseled through the concrete, he edged onto the ceiling tiles on the other side, they couldn\u2019t support his weight, and he fell straight down into the locker room. Girls wearing nothing but bras and panties ran screaming while he sprained his wrist and got suspended for a week.</p><p>\u201cNow I get to ask you an important question,\u201d he says, once I\u2019m done wiping tears of laughter off my face. \u201cWhat\u2019s your earliest memory?\u201d he asks.</p><p>The Waitrix brings the cheese fries, and we dive in. He invited me out, so screw the calories. I nod, I listen, I ask him questions, I laugh.</p><p>To be here with me\u2014a seventeen-year-old, and having a great time, he must truly be living in the now. And so am I.</p><p>It\u2019s not my earliest memory, but it\u2019s my favorite.</p><p>When I was eleven, I packed up my suitcase and went to sleep-away camp for the first time. Cumberland Creek church camp. Laura and Allie went too. We spent the week canoeing and cooking burgers over a crackling campfire and doing three-legged races in Field Olympics. I spent a lot of time in this outdoor chapel, praying and writing in my journal about how much fun I was having and how I loved being a Christian because it made me feel good about myself. I liked being a good person.</p><p>During night devotion, the counselors allowed us to write prayers on slips of paper and burn them, so whatever we prayed for would be just between us and Him. I hoped for things like relief for Gramma\u2019s arthritis and for Dad and Ryan to stop being allergic to animals so my parents would let me adopt a yellow lab puppy already.</p><p>Campers received mail, but if you received more than three pieces of mail, you had to sing a song in front of the entire camp. On Wednesday, I sang \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle\u201d in front of three hundred kids. But I didn\u2019t care. My parents loved me enough to send fifteen postcards.</p><p>That\u2019s my favorite memory.</p><p>On the last night of camp, a dance took place and everyone could bring dates. Nobody asked Laura and Allie, and they felt disappointed because that was the activity we\u2019d been looking forward to most. This boy J. C. and I went together and held hands. I\u2019d never done that before. At the end of the night, he kissed my cheek.</p><p>I never saw the boy again because he was from Nashville, but Laura and Allie saw the kiss, and I saw the envy in their eyes. Laura told me that I was moving too fast and should be careful or I would end up pregnant, or worse, I would sin. After that, I worried what other girls thought of me. I knew how pretty I was, I knew that boys liked me. But I didn\u2019t so much as hold hands with another guy until after Mom left. Up until then, I\u2019d never done anything wrong, never even kissed a boy on the lips. But my church turned on me anyway.</p><p>Brian pulls his truck up to my house.</p><p>He peers at my yard. I hope he\u2019s not disgusted by the stench of fried chicken and laundromat. \u201cThis is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>We sit in silence for a minute, listening to the Fray. This silence isn\u2019t awkward. It\u2019s nice, and I probably should get out of the truck, but I don\u2019t want to. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cSo will you think about playing ball this year?\u201d he asks quietly, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel.</p><p>Ever since Corndog asked me to stay away from Drew, I\u2019ve been thinking about my reputation. How even though I\u2019ve never made a move on Drew, Corndog thought I might, which goes to show that even if my intentions are good, someone could misinterpret them.</p><p>If someone saw Brian and me at Foothills Diner tonight, they might\u2019ve thought:</p><p>1. He\u2019s my big brother. (Ew.)</p><p>2. He\u2019s my husband. (Kinda weird.)</p><p>3. Isn\u2019t that the new coach of the Hundred Oaks baseball team and the new manager? (Truth sucks sometimes.)</p><p>4. Isn\u2019t that the new coach of the Hundred Oaks baseball team with some gorgeous model? (Ideal.)</p><p>5. Isn\u2019t that sweet Parker Shelton with some gorgeous male model? (Doubly ideal.)</p><p>So who knows how people interpreted my quitting the softball team? Sure, I was trying to prove I\u2019m not like my mom, but did everyone realize that? Or did they think Parker Shelton is a big ole quitter?</p><p>And how is it fair to people like Brian, who tried so hard, for me not to even attempt playing again?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Coach Lynn tomorrow,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Brian chomps his gum as he stares out the window into the night. The moon and stars shine brightly on his smiling face. Then his smile fades. \u201cI guess this means you won\u2019t be managing anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked hanging out with you. It was fun. You\u2019re easy to talk to.\u201d</p><p>I bite back my grin. \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll see you around?\u201d he asks quietly. He turns to face me and drops a hand on my shoulder. His touch zaps my senses, and a jolt runs up my arm and down through my body to my toes and between my legs. Sin lightning. Or something.</p><p>I steal a breath. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He folds his hands and glances up at my face.</p><p>\u201cThanks again. For everything,\u201d I say, and he nods before I climb out of his truck. I walk to the door and turn to wave bye. He waves back. The Ford\u2019s headlights flicker on as he reverses out of my driveway. I smell my arm, to see if I picked up his scent. Nothing.</p><p>The door pops open behind me, letting out lamplight and warm air.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Ryan says. He peers over my shoulder at the driveway. I slip past my brother to go make dinner for him and Dad, who\u2019s stretched out on the couch watching a Law and Order rerun.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Ryan asks, following me into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nobody.\u201d</p><p>Nobody who I hope will become somebody very, very soon.</p><p>trust</p><p>48 days until i turn 18</p><p>I\u2019ve had a chance to date before. Right before Mom left, before I quit the softball team, Jack Hulsey invited me to the Winter Wonderland formal. Jack was a senior and played center on the basketball team. The moment after he asked, a bazillion things ran through my mind.</p><p>Why would he want to take a girl like me? I\u2019m overweight.</p><p>What color dress should I wear?</p><p>Should I make a hair appointment?</p><p>Get my nails done?</p><p>Will we go to dinner first?</p><p>Will I get my first real kiss at the end of the night? Or will he kiss me in front of everyone on the dance floor, when I\u2019m curled up in his arms, swaying slowly?</p><p>Laura likes him. Laura likes him a lot.</p><p>Jack smiled while waiting for my answer.</p><p>I ended up going with Laura and Allie, and we giggled and danced and had a great time, but tears filled my eyes when I saw Jack slow dancing with another girl, kissing her.</p><p>It was okay, I decided. Laura would\u2019ve made me feel guilty for accepting. Besides, I always put my friendships first.</p><p>Funny how Laura didn\u2019t return the gesture when I needed her more than anything. Are you there for me, God? Are you putting me first? Or is something else way more important in your eyes?</p><p>Written at the breakfast table on February 16. Burned.</p><p>Call me presumptuous, but I bring my cleats and workout clothes to school. I don\u2019t have any softball pants or jerseys that fit this 110-pound frame. I\u2019ll have to buy new stuff.</p><p>I blow out air before knocking on Coach Lynn\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she says.</p><p>I open the door and step inside, and she beams.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell Coach Burns I\u2019m stealing you,\u201d she says with a smile, touching her swollen stomach.</p><p>Late that afternoon, I accompany her out to the field, and when my cleats sink into the clay I suck on my bottom lip to stop myself from grinning like a crazy person. I gaze up at the lights, which are already blazing because the sun is beginning to set. The boys have just finished up their practice, and I wave at Drew, who gives me a thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cNoooo, Parker, don\u2019t leave us!\u201d Corndog yells, getting down on his knees and clasping his hands like he\u2019s praying. \u201cI need you! Who\u2019s going to take care of my cup?\u201d</p><p>I flip him the bird down low, making him laugh. Then a bunch of the guys get down on their knees and start begging me to come back to them, and I\u2019m laughing and playing with my tangly ponytail, to calm my nerves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brian swings his bat in circles, raising his eyebrows, glancing from the boys to me.</p><p>The softball team has already gathered by the dugout. They\u2019re watching the baseball boys act like idiots, and envy flickers on their faces. A volcano erupts in Laura\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cBefore we talk to the team,\u201d Coach Lynn says, \u201cdo you want to tell me why you quit in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, um, it was family problems and some issues with friends...\u201d I feel my face burning up.</p> <p>\u201cI figure it must\u2019ve been pretty serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>Coach Lynn nods and touches my shoulder. She leaves it at that, and I\u2019m grateful. But it turns out she doesn\u2019t even need to tell the team. The minute I look at Laura, she lets out this whimper-scream-yelp thing that sounds like a puppy caught in a trap.</p><p>\u201cCoach! No way!\u201d Laura says, shaking her head like crazy.</p><p>Coach Lynn ignores Laura and looks from girl to girl. Some of them I know. Some of them I don\u2019t. Some of them I used to share clothes and Animal Crackers with.</p> <p>\u201cParker Shelton\u2019s decided she wants to join the team this season. We\u2019ll see how she does in practice tonight and go from there in terms of choosing her position and where she\u2019ll bat in the lineup. But I imagine we\u2019ll try to put her at third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Coach, this isn\u2019t fair!\u201d Laura whines. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working out all winter, and practices have already started, and she just gets to waltz in and take over third base?\u201d My former best friend looks like she might cry. Allie pats Laura\u2019s back and nods vehemently at the coach.</p><p>\u201cIt is fair,\u201d Coach Lynn replies, checking her watch. \u201cI\u2019m the coach, I make the decisions, and as captain, I hope you\u2019ll welcome Parker back, Laura.\u201d</p><p>Laura pounds her fist into her glove and bites her lip. I bet she\u2019s thinking: if Parker rejoins the team, I won\u2019t be the best player anymore, and I have to be the center of everything or I\u2019ll just die.</p><p>Some of the girls look at Laura with sympathy, but I notice a few girls rolling their eyes. I sort of want to tell them to stop, because our friendship was once good, and deep down, I still care about her.</p><p>Freshman year, one of our favorite things to do was to go tanning in her backyard. Then one day her dad, Brother John, decided to plant an apple tree right in the middle of our spot. Fourth of July was coming up, and Laura\u2019s older brothers had been stockpiling fireworks. We stole some in an attempt to blow up the apple tree, so we could have our tanning spot back.</p> <p>Let\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t work. Her parents were pissed, but we laughed like maniacs, then rode our bikes to Dairy Queen for Blizzards, singing Taylor Swift songs at the top of our lungs.</p><p>\u201cPair off and start warming up,\u201d Coach Lynn says.</p><p>I pull my glove out of my bag and slip my hand into it. It feels soft, yet stiff, and it still smells like leather and dirt. Love. I pound my fist into it and chew my gum and whirl my arm around in a circle. My muscles ache, thanks to batting last night.</p><p>Everyone pairs off. I look from girl to girl, then one player\u2014a sophomore whose name I can\u2019t remember\u2014shrugs and approaches me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSydney. I play catcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Parker. Wanna partner up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>I nod and toss the ball at her, then take a step back. We keep stepping back until we\u2019re at least fifty feet apart. I don\u2019t miss a single throw.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still got your arm,\u201d Coach Lynn says. \u201cBut you need to put some muscle back on.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at my body. The minute I start working out, I won\u2019t weigh 110 pounds anymore. Will any of my clothes fit? Will Laura call me butch again? A memory of leaving the locker room alone and crying flashes in my mind.</p><p>When it\u2019s time for batting practice, Coach Lynn instructs me to go first. The sun has completely set now, and the area beyond the field is black. I grab my favorite aluminum bat from my bat bag and jog up to home plate. I slip on a batting helmet and glance at Brian\u2019s truck.</p><p>His headlights come on, and he drives out of the parking lot. I wish he had stayed to watch me. Because, if I\u2019m being honest with myself, he\u2019s a lot of the reason I\u2019m doing this.</p><p>\u201cRun on your fifth hit,\u201d Coach Lynn calls out. This means I\u2019m supposed to hit the ball four times before running to first base after my fifth hit. I spread my legs apart and take a practice swing.</p><p>Laura winds up to pitch and whirls her arm around. The ball comes straight at my head. I fall to the clay, narrowly avoiding getting whacked. On the ground, I pant hard. On the mound, Laura cackles and digs her cleats into the mound. I lift my head to find Mel and Allie laughing, along with some other girls.</p><p>I lie back down on the ground, inhaling clay. This was stupid. Why did I think I could rejoin the team and everything would be okay? Because Brian, a twenty-three-year-old hot guy who knows nothing of my life, thought it would be a good idea? Well, it\u2019s not. Tears spring to my eyes, and my heart races.</p><p>\u201cLaura!\u201d I hear Coach Lynn yell. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>This was stupid, this was stupid. Stupid, stupid me.</p><p>\u201cParker?\u201d I peek up. Corndog threads his fingers through the fence. I rest my forehead on the red clay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bench you if you keep pulling this crap, Laura,\u201d Coach Lynn says. But I know she\u2019s lying. Laura\u2019s one of the best pitchers in our region. She could steal the principal\u2019s prized BMW and go mudding in it and the school would still let her play.</p><p>I feel hands gently lifting my arms. \u201cYou hurt?\u201d Corndog asks quietly.</p><p>My pride is broken. I shake my head. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawnmower broke down.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just wanted to see you bat. Then I was gonna take off.\u201d He helps me to my feet. I wipe dirt off my sweatpants. \u201cCome on,\u201d he adds, leading me over to the dugout.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Parker?\u201d Coach Lynn calls, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a breather,\u201d Corndog replies. We sit down on the bench together, and I pull my batting helmet off and drop it on the patchy dirt floor. It bounces away.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cLaura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw. But why let it bother you so much?\u201d</p><p>I lift a shoulder and peek over at Corndog. A tear slips out of my eye and runs down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stronger than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me all of a sudden?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cCompetition\u2019s over. You won.\u201d He grins and laughs, looking out at the field. \u201cHey, listen,\u201d he says in a slow drawl. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool you\u2019re going out for the team again. I never understood why you quit.\u201d</p><p>I drop my chin to my chest. I was right. Anyone can interpret my intentions however they want. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a quitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I just didn\u2019t get it. I could tell how much you loved the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d I glance at him.</p><p>\u201cRemember sophomore year, during the Prom Decisional, how you stole third base and slid into me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cleats dug into my shin and you knocked me down. And then you stretched out a hand and pulled me to my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that...\u201d</p><p>Corndog waves a hand. \u201cI liked that you didn\u2019t gloat. You were just happy and playing the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love this game,\u201d I admit, watching as Laura steps up to the mound, whirls her arm, and pitches a strike right down the center. \u201cBut I don\u2019t trust this team.\u201d</p><p>Corndog looks confused and clutches his knees. \u201cYou gotta trust your team. I trust every single one of my guys.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, smiling a pained smile.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna go back out there now? You can do this.\u201d</p><p>I know I can do this. But do I want to? No, not really.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a ride home?\u201d I ask him. Drew\u2019s long gone, and I don\u2019t feel like riding my bike tonight.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mind riding my lawnmower. Left my truck at home.\u201d</p><p>I give him a tiny grin. \u201cI\u2019m up for an adventure.\u201d</p><p>Drew is one of those people everybody likes.</p><p>Even crazy Max Reddick, the guy who spends all his time carving sculptures out of Ivory soap, rushes to get a seat at Drew\u2019s art table.</p><p>On the first day of sixth grade, everyone was terrified of not knowing where to sit in the lunchroom. Students had graduated from three different elementary schools to attend Green Hills; middle school was another world. I felt lucky to know Laura, Allie, and Drew.</p><p>Will Whitfield had been homeschooled, so this was his first time learning with other kids. After paying for his lunch, he carried his tray in one arm and pushed his glasses up on his nose with the other hand. I saw the whole thing happen in slowmo. Someone jostled Will. The tray tilted.</p><p>The corndog went flying.</p><p>It hit JJ in the chest. JJ was, and still is, this huge football player, and he stood up and strutted toward skinny little Will. No one hits JJ with a corndog, that\u2019s for sure. I don\u2019t think JJ would\u2019ve punched him or anything, but nobody wants to be humiliated on their first day at school.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, man! These corndogs are crap!\u201d Drew yelled, launching a corndog straight at JJ\u2019s face.</p><p>Everyone knew Will as Corndog after that. Everyone knew him as Drew\u2019s friend.</p><p>The day Laura told everyone I was probably just like my mom\u2014a butch softball player who likes girls\u2014Drew crawled into my bed and held me until I cried out every tear in my body. He held me all night long.</p><p>Even with everything that\u2019s happened to me, I have to thank you for letting me keep Drew.</p><p>Written on February 17; kissed and tucked away in my Bible.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on my bed, removing my Passion Peach nail polish and chatting with Drew over Skype, even though he\u2019s right down the street. I tell him what happened with Laura.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a jealous bitch,\u201d Drew replies.</p><p>I tell him about Corndog giving me a ride home on the lawnmower, which was surprisingly fun, but very, very cold and windy. Not to mention bumpy.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Drew replies. Pauses. \u201cSo...did you talk to Coach Hoffman today?\u201d he yell-whispers over the Internet.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not technically true, but I don\u2019t want to let on how I feel about him. I\u2019ve never had a real real boyfriend, and I\u2019ve never felt the urge to have a real relationship, \u2019cause what if the guy ditches me like Mom ditched Dad? Like Mom ditched me and Ryan? Like Laura and the other girls at church ditched me? A relationship never felt worth the risk.</p><p>Today I saw Brian when I arrived at school. He smiled and winked at me. I know, right? Scandal! But Drew doesn\u2019t need to know he winked. It\u2019s my secret. I set my cotton ball and nail polish remover on my bedside table and pull my laptop closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Drew must be able to hear me typing. \u201cJust checking my mail,\u201d I lie, opening Brian\u2019s Facebook page. I move the cursor over the \u201cAdd as Friend\u201d button. I take a deep breath, close my eyes and push click. Now I wait. For a minute, for a month, forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I retrieve my cotton ball and get back to work on my thumbnail, listening to Drew talk about the op-ed he\u2019s submitting to the Franklin Times. Then an email alert pops up at the bottom of my screen. Brian Hoffman has accepted your friend request.</p><p>I kick my feet up and down on the mattress and squeal for like, ten seconds straight. Ryan pounds on the wall with his fist and tells me to control my estrogen.</p><p>Drew blurts, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me call you back,\u201d I say, disconnecting. I immediately click on Brian\u2019s profile and scan his wall. He posts lots of status updates regarding baseball scores and sports news\u2014especially about the Braves and Georgia Tech. He also links to articles about healthy living, and it looks like he\u2019s planning to run the Nashville half-marathon in April and is raising money in support of the American Heart Association.</p> <p>I check his relationship status: Single.</p><p>I squeal again, and Ryan pounds on the wall again. I fluff my pillows behind me and get comfy. I garner the courage to send him an instant message over Facebook. I have something to talk to him about, so why not?</p><p>Hey, I type.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Hey.</p><p>Parker Shelton: Can I be manager again?</p> <p>Brian Hoffman: So you\u2019re quitting already?</p><p>Parker Shelton: You behave or I\u2019m leaving!</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Where\u2019d you go? LOL. Come back.</p><p>Parker Shelton: You have to behave.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Funny, I was about to say the same thing to you.</p><p>The cursor blinks for a few seconds.</p> <p>Brian Hoffman: Are you going to tell me what happened?</p><p>Parker Shelton: Nope.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Why\u2019d you quit the team last year?</p><p>As comfortable as I feel with him, I can\u2019t tell him about Mom. Considering his parents go to Forrest Sanctuary, who knows how Brian feels about homosexuality. I\u2019m not ready to take the risk to find out yet. I\u2019m enjoying this too much. Maybe one day, if I trust Brian enough, I\u2019ll tell him everything.</p><p>Really, that\u2019s what it all comes down to.</p><p>Parker Shelton: I don\u2019t trust the team</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Wow.</p><p>I pick at my nail polish. Then I type.</p> <p>Parker Shelton: What\u2019s the point in playing for a team you can\u2019t trust? Isn\u2019t that the whole point of a team? To be part of something? I mean, last night when we went to the batting cages, I felt like I belonged there.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: With me?</p><p>I want to type Exactly, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>Parker Shelton: Can I be a manager again? I like being around Drew.</p><p>(And you, Brian Hoffman. But I don\u2019t type that.)</p><p>Brian Hoffman: I can\u2019t say I\u2019m that disappointed you\u2019re not playing.</p><p>Yeah? I reply, and kick my feet up and down silently.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Yeah, I need a good manager.</p><p>Parker Shelton: Oh, is that it?</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Good managers are hard to find. Filling coolers with ice is serious business.</p><p>Parker Shelton: Jerk.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: :) I wish you\u2019d play, because you\u2019ve got talent. But\u2014</p><p>Parker Shelton: But?</p><p>Brian Hoffman: I\u2019m glad you\u2019ll be around. I like talking to you. You\u2019re hilarious.</p><p>One thing\u2019s for sure: I get to spend a whole hell of a lot more time with Brian, and I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>The rest of the week is sucky and wonderful.</p><p>Sucky because, during lunch, I had to listen to Laura and Allie going on and on about how I\u2019m nothing but a quitter.</p><p>Sucky because I never talk to Brian one-on-one in person. During gym, he stands with Coach Burns while the boys play basketball or volleyball, and I usually run past him when we girls are doing laps. I wear the shortest shorts I own and try to look as sexy as possible, even when doing sit-ups. He barely looks my way! But then at night, we message on Facebook. That\u2019s the wonderful part.</p><p>He has a dog, a black lab named Brandy. They go running together every morning before work. His favorite vacation spot is Destin, Florida\u2014he loves the white sand beaches. After surviving an outbreak in fourth grade, lice scare him to death, and that\u2019s why he\u2019d never consider teaching at an elementary school. His arch nemesis at school is Ms. Bonner, the home ec teacher, because she\u2019s always nagging him about his wrinkled shirts and slacks.</p><p>I told Brian she wants to iron his clothes as a prelude to a scandalous affair. He told me I have wicked, disgusting thoughts.</p><p>He knows I adore animals but that my biggest fear is granddaddy long-legs because once when I was little girl, a spider crawled into my glass of water in the middle of the night and I almost drank him. Brian knows I don\u2019t eat much\u2014he\u2019s been scoping me out in the cafeteria, and he got on to me. He knows my favorite drink is the ninety-nine-cent fat-free latte from that janky machine down at the Highway 41 Exxon station. He knows I want to meet Brandy the black lab. Brian has black hair, so I asked if he and Brandy look alike, since dogs and owners are supposed to resemble each other. That made him LOL. I could see his smile over the Internet.</p><p>I keep painting my nails Passion Peach.</p><p>the first baseball game</p><p>44 days until i turn 18</p><p>On Saturday, the team meets in the parking lot to drive to Tullahoma for the first official game of the season. Drew and Sam are sipping water and gargling \u201cBad Romance.\u201d When they finish the song, Drew spits his water out on the pavement and says, \u201cAny requests?\u201d</p><p>Jackson Powers says, \u201cDo \u2018Like a G6.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Drew laughs. \u201cI can\u2019t rap! I\u2019m a white hick last time I checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich explains why you do Lady Gaga so well?\u201d I tease.</p><p>Drew hugs me from behind and musses my hair.</p><p>Corndog parks his truck in the lot and heads over, carrying his bat bag. His hair is all disheveled like he just rolled out of bed. It\u2019s kinda yummy looking. But not as yummy looking as Brian\u2019s\u2014his is still wet. Like he got out of the shower and came straight here.</p><p>Corndog joins Drew, Sam, and me. \u201cGlad you made it on time, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d I retort.</p><p>\u201cFigured you were out late hooking up with somebody. Isn\u2019t that what you do on Fridays?\u201d</p><p>I suck in a deep breath. Asshole.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man,\u201d Drew says to him. \u201cIt\u2019s not her fault.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s not my fault?</p><p>Corndog runs a hand through his hair. He has bags under his eyes. \u201cSorry...I had a rough night. Didn\u2019t mean to take it out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I reply, bowing my head and moving a few steps away. I thought he and I were getting past this whole feud. Guess not. Guess I can\u2019t completely abandon my rep.</p><p>Brian appears beside me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been picking at my pinky nail all morning.\u201d I show him how I peeled some of the paint off.</p><p>\u201cAw, poor baby. Get on the bus.\u201d He grins mischievously, patting my back with his clipboard.</p><p>Okay, so riding on the boys\u2019 bus is like going to another planet. The moment I get onboard, the stench of dirty feet, sweat, and farting hits me in the face. On top of that, someone shoots a jockstrap like a rubber band and it nearly hits me in the face. I duck just in time.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, you assholes,\u201d Corndog says, flopping down in back with Drew and Sam. That\u2019s where the softball captain sits too.</p><p>\u201cThe only jockstrap Parker wants belongs to me,\u201d Paul says.</p><p>A smattering of laughter breaks out, and I blush, clutching the strap of my bag.</p><p>\u201cShut it, Paul,\u201d Corndog says, giving him a dirty look. \u201cTake a seat,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to sit,\u201d I reply. \u201cSeniority and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better stay up front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine with me,\u201d I mutter when I realize I\u2019ll be right across the aisle from Brian, who\u2019s already immersed in the lineup, murmuring to himself. It\u2019s like he\u2019s having a love affair with his clipboard. Before we leave, he shuts his eyes for a long moment, then stands to face the team.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Coach Burns?\u201d Corndog calls out.</p><p>\u201cCorndog\u2019s got a hard-on for Coach!\u201d someone yells. \u201cHot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being morons,\u201d Brian says, \u201cAnd shut up and listen to me for a sec, okay?\u201d</p><p>The guys actually do shut up. It\u2019s cool he\u2019s got their respect.</p><p>\u201cCoach Lynn was sent to the hospital yesterday due to pregnancy complications,\u201d Brian says, and I gasp. I bite my tongue.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Corndog asks. \u201cIs she okay? Is the baby okay?\u201d</p><p>I peek around the edge of my seat to see him standing up at the back of the bus. He looks worried.</p><p>\u201cI think she and the baby are fine,\u201d Brian says. \u201cBut the doctor says she has to go on bed rest for the remainder of her pregnancy. So Dr. Salter asked me to take over the baseball team while Coach Burns coaches softball this season. He has more experience with softball than I do.\u201d Brian swallows hard.</p><p>Oh. My. God. That means no supervision. Coach Burns won\u2019t be around to yell at Brian and me to stop chatting. I can\u2019t help but grin, even though I\u2019m worried for Coach Lynn. She\u2019s a nice lady.</p><p>Brian\u2019s eyes shift to mine, then he goes back to talking to the team. \u201cI know y\u2019all love Coach Burns, but I hope I can fill his shoes, at least somewhat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to have your babies, Coach Hoffman!\u201d Sam calls, cracking up the guys. Sam says that to pretty much everybody these days, so if he was being truthful, he\u2019d have like eleven billion kids by now.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Henry,\u201d Brian says, and looks at the ceiling, as if praying for help. He turns to the bus driver. \u201cCan we go already?\u201d</p><p>The ignition cranks to a start, and then we\u2019re hurtling down the highway toward Tullahoma, passing farms and rolling hills. It\u2019s a beautiful, sunny February day. Too bad Corndog ruined the sun by being a jerk. I pull the new Cosmo out of my bag and start learning about these sit-ups that guarantee a six-pack in less than a month. I have a romance novel about cowboys in my bag that I\u2019m dying to break out, but I don\u2019t want anyone to see it and make fun of me. It\u2019s called The Lonesome Hero, and the cover features a naked guy, a semi-naked girl, and a strategically placed horse trough.</p><p>Instead, I drown myself in an article about what kinds of bras are best for my body type until Corndog flops down next to me. He slouches and gazes over at me with tired eyes.</p><p>He blocks my view of Brian.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I mumble, shifting in my seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about before. I\u2019m stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re stressed, you can\u2019t be mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, people don\u2019t expect a lot from you like they do me,\u201d he mutters, shutting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me,\u201d I whisper. Stupid, stupid me, to let him take me home the other night. Stupid, stupid me to think I might be making a new friend. \u201cGo away. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to apologize. I\u2019m trying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should practice more.\u201d</p><p>He holds my gaze for a few seconds, his blue eyes piercing into me, and then he stands and disappears to the back of the bus.</p><p>I slide down in my seat, trying to control my breathing. I rip a page out of Cosmo and write: </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why is it, the minute everything begins to feel okay, you decide to test my faith again?

Brian wants me. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mere for a sec.\u201d He pats the bus bench. \u201cI need to go over a few stats with you.\u201d</p><p>My hands tremble. I stand and see what the players are up to.</p><p>\u201cTell us how far you\u2019ve gotten with her, man!\u201d Paul asks Sam. They\u2019re talking about Jordan.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I can\u2019t tell you. She\u2019d rip my balls off,\u201d Sam replies, pounding a fist into his glove.</p><p>\u201cShe would totally rip his balls off,\u201d Corndog says, cringing.</p> <p>None of them seem to notice me moving to slip into the seat with the coach. Our elbows touch but he doesn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He turns the pages until he reaches a blank section for notes, then draws a Tic-Tac-Toe board. He pulls a pencil from behind his ear and hands it to me. I fill the center box with an X.</p><p>\u201cThis game is so stupid,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>He draws an O. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we playing it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou looked like you need to talk.\u201d</p><p>I jot down an X. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just sit here with me, okay?\u201d</p><p>I shift a little, so our hips are touching too. Brian glances around, at the bus driver and over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWant to play MASH instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he replies.</p><p>\u201cI used to play it in elementary school.\u201d I take the book and pencil and start writing down numbers from one to four. \u201cIt\u2019s this game where we figure out what kind of house and car you\u2019ll have, who you\u2019ll marry and stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>He groans. \u201cSounds girly.\u201d</p> <p>I ignore him. \u201cMASH stands for mansion, apartment, shack and house, but I like to play this my own way. Name four kinds of places to live. You know, a trailer or a Victorian-style house or whatever.\u201d</p><p>He ticks choices off on his fingers. \u201cLog cabin, beach house, country farmhouse, and igloo.\u201d</p><p>I write down his choices. \u201cName four cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan they be other methods of transportation? Do I have to say lame things like Toyota Corolla and Ford Escort?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou can say whatever method of transportation you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse, Harley, submarine, and bicycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love riding my bike,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI know. I see you riding all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stalking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on Wednesdays.\u201d</p><p>I give him an evil eye. \u201cName four women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lindsay Lohan, and Kim Kardashian.\u201d</p><p>I make a gagging noise.</p><p>Laughing, he looks over my shoulder at MASH as I jot down his answers. \u201cGive me four places you want to go on your honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat honeymoon? I\u2019m not getting married.\u201d</p><p>Yay! \u201cA hypothetical honeymoon. Honestly, have you never played MASH before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmateur hour.\u201d</p><p>He grins and rubs the scruff on his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re funny, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop sucking up and give me four places for your hypothetical honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He pauses to think. \u201cTokyo, Canberra, Venice, and Alaska.\u201d</p><p>I tell Brian about how I love picking up worn travel books at yard sales and paging through them in bed at night. My favorite guide is for Italy. Dad wants to visit there so bad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to travel,\u201d Brian says. \u201cI\u2019ve never left the States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. But I want to.\u201d I love that we have that in common. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lines appear on his forehead. \u201cHaven\u2019t gotten around to it yet, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I begin drawing a pinwheel. \u201cTell me when to stop drawing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Brian replies. \u201cWhat the hell is this game anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch.\u201d The pinwheel has eight lines, so I begin going through his answers and cutting them out until I\u2019m down to one of each.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you\u2019re going to marry Kim Kardashian and you\u2019ll go to Tokyo for your honeymoon. Then you\u2019ll live in a house at the beach and drive a submarine around.\u201d</p><p>He grins and chews his gum. He nudges me gently and glances over his shoulder for a third time. \u201cYou\u2019d better go back to your seat now that you\u2019ve predicted my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I mock, and slip across the aisle, grinning.</p><p>When God created the Earth, he had such a sick wicked sense of humor. He made everything that\u2019s wrong feel really, really good.</p><p>Before the game against Tullahoma starts, both teams stand on the sidelines as a girl sings the National Anthem.</p><p>The last ball game I went to was sophomore year. Mom watched me play, then we went out for smoothies and she kissed my cheek and told me how great I am at ball. Leaning against the dugout fence, smelling the clay and clipped grass and feeling the sunshine on my face reminds me of her. Her, her, her.</p><p>I breathe in and out, getting myself into the groove. I can do this. I want to be here. I say \u201cOmmmm. Ommmm,\u201d under my breath, because Cosmo says that helps center your core.</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d Brian calls out. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>I jog to the other side of the dugout.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing over there?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI was Ommm-ing. You know, centering my core?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Obi-Wan, take this lineup to the press box.\u201d He waves a scorecard.</p><p>\u201cCan I have some gum, please?\u201d I hold out a hand and he digs a package out of the back pocket of his gray baseball pants. He hands me a piece, shaking his head. I also take the list from his fingers and make my way across the field to the box. Guys on the other team start catcalling at me.</p><p>\u201cYou can play with my balls anytime you want, babe!\u201d the other team\u2019s catcher yells, getting lots of laughs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t grip my bat too hard!\u201d another one says.</p><p>Drew and Sam appear on either side of me, to walk me to the press box. The Wildcat players blow kisses my way. Drew jumps up and down and pretends to bat the kisses away before they reach me, making me smile.</p><p>Sam throws an arm around me. \u201cOf all the sexist humor out there, they immediately jump to bats and balls? Lame.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly. Now this is a team I can trust. Well, besides Corndog. He\u2019s a total flip-flopper.</p><p>We\u2019re up to bat first, so Sam puts his batting gloves on, grabs his bat and helmet, and heads toward home to lead off. I sit Indian style on the bench with the stats book on my lap and the pencil in my mouth, ready to go.</p><p>By the fourth inning, we\u2019re tied at two runs apiece. Paul hit a double that drove in Travis Lake and Drew hit a single to bring John Thames home.</p><p>Brian\u2019s standing on the dugout steps, leaning on one knee, fully immersed in the game.</p><p>\u201cCoach,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have any gum.\u201d He laughs to himself.</p><p>\u201cI need to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord. Go. Hurry.\u201d He waves me away. \u201cWait. Give the stats book to Luke over there.\u201d He nods at a wiry freshman.</p><p>I dart out of the dugout and up the hill toward the concession stand and zip into the bathroom. The smell of popcorn and nachos wafting through the vents just about kills me.</p><p>I\u2019m coming back from the bathroom when a little boy rushes past me, chasing a baseball. He slips and falls to the asphalt. I rush up and squat as he cries out and clutches his knee. Big tears fill his blue eyes. They\u2019re really pretty. Familiar.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say calmly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. The tears drip down his cheeks, and he squeals.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I ask softly, checking out the scrapes on his knees and palms.</p><p>He wipes his eyes. \u201cBo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cool name. You like baseball, Bo?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>He hiccups and lets out a sob, then holds up four fingers.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re big, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nods again and clutches at his knee, where the skin is raw.</p><p>\u201cAre your parents here with you at the game?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He nods. All he does is nod.</p><p>\u201cCan I pick you up and help you find your mom?\u201d</p><p>Bo gasps and begins to shake all over. It\u2019s freaking me out. Is he having a seizure? I jerk my head around, searching for his parents.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI like baseball too, and I know you want to watch the game with your parents, right?\u201d</p><p>His head bobs up and down.</p><p>\u201cCan I pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I lift Bo in my arms, and I\u2019m moving toward the stands when Corndog sprints up and takes the little boy into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispers, kissing Bo\u2019s temple and patting his floppy brown hair. \u201cShhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle brother. Did you get lost, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Bo nods and hiccups again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you back to Daddy, okay?\u201d Corndog says, hugging him.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Bo,\u201d I say, starting to turn.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s you?\u201d he replies.</p><p>\u201cI think he wants to know your name,\u201d Corndog says, giving me a weird look.</p><p>\u201cParker. Have fun at the baseball game, okay?\u201d I hustle back to the dugout before Brian gets all up in my grill for being gone so long.</p><p>\u201cCan I have more gum?\u201d I ask Brian, putting out a hand. He gives me another piece, and smiles before focusing on the game again. I retrieve the stats book and grab a seat on the bench. A minute later, Corndog sits down and narrows his eyes and stares at me for a long time, like he\u2019s trying to figure something out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, slipping the new gum into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat was nice.\u201d He jerks his head toward the spot where I helped Bo.</p><p>\u201cHe was real sweet. His blue eyes are so pretty. Just like yours.\u201d</p><p>Corndog looks like he can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d</p><p>I chew. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you calm Bo down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked. I dunno,\u201d I say with a shrug. We\u2019re in the middle of the lineup\u2014I circle Drew\u2019s name in the stats book.</p><p>Corndog seems amazed. He grins again. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he talked to you. He\u2019s sorta, um, autistic,\u201d he whispers, his eyes darting around. \u201cBo\u2019s got Asperger\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Having a sick brother must be tough. \u201cOh. Well, I couldn\u2019t tell anything\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my wrist and searches my face, looking deeper than anyone has in a while. It gives me chills.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard sometimes,\u201d Corndog says quietly. \u201cLast night I heard my mom crying, and I got upset. That\u2019s why I was a dick today. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Shitty stuff happens, you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do know.\u201d He averts his eyes.</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d Brian says, beckoning me. \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>I walk over to Brian, carrying the stats book. \u201cYeah, Coach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand with me, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou double-checking my work?\u201d I joke.</p><p>He chomps his gum. \u201cI guess you could say that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m smiling the rest of the game.</p><p>And we win four-two.</p><p>I\u2019m very happy.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m very unhappy.</p><p>As the team\u2019s boarding the bus after the game, I\u2019m watching Brian flirt with a woman who\u2019s with the Tullahoma softball team. Is she their coach? She\u2019s wearing a Wildcats parka, jeans, and ballet flats. Seriously? I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d talk to a coach who\u2019d dare to wear something so ridiculous onto a baseball field.</p><p>Then I look down at my clothes. Tight sweater, skinny jeans and Converses. My makeup is perfect, and I woke up extra early to tangle my hair. I guess I\u2019m not behaving any better than Coach Vixen over there.</p><p>She\u2019s much prettier and curvier than me, and I can tell Brian likes her because he\u2019s leaning toward her and laughing at everything she says.</p><p>I should stop watching, but I can\u2019t look away. My chest hurts. My eyes burn. Then it gets worse: she pulls her phone out of her back pocket and hands it to him. He enters his numbers for her.</p><p>And to think I played MASH with him.</p> <p>I stomp up the stairs to the bus and flop onto my bench. When Brian climbs aboard, I fold my arms across my stomach.</p><p>Sam is loudly telling this story about how he saw a hot pink dildo laying on the concrete behind the cafeteria back at Hundred Oaks and all the guys are hollering and carrying on, trying to guess how it got there.</p><p>\u201cI bet it belongs to Ms. McCanly,\u201d Jake Sanders says.</p><p>\u201cI bet it was put there by aliens!\u201d Corndog calls out.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Brian groans.</p><p>I sneak a peek at him. His eyes are shut and he looks exasperated, thanks to the tale of the dildo. He glances over at me and smiles. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pissed, but I slide across the aisle anyway. None of the guys are paying attention to me. Dildos are way too distracting.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, making sure not to touch him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019ve been upset a lot today.\u201d</p><p>I pick at the hole in my jeans.</p><p>\u201cIs this \u2019cause I\u2019m marrying Kim Kardashian?\u201d</p><p>A laugh escapes my lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d he asks softly. There\u2019s care in his voice.</p><p>I look out the window as we fly past cornfields. \u201cWho was that lady you were talking to? You know, Coach Vixen in the ballet flats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoach Vixen?\u201d he exclaims. \u201cCoach Black? Jenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Coach Vixen.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a knowing smile. \u201cAre you stalking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on Wednesdays.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, chewing his gum. \u201cI went to high school with her. We haven\u2019t seen each other in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all right,\u201d he replies, shaking his leg up and down.</p><p>I suck on my bottom lip.</p><p>He jabs me softly in the side. \u201cLet\u2019s play another round of that MASH game of yours. I want to see if I can live in an igloo, drive a tractor, and marry Angelina Jolie instead.\u201d</p><p>sinner extraordinaire</p><p>43 days until i turn 18</p><p>On Sunday, Dad, Ryan, and I head to church. This morning I had to pound on Ryan\u2019s door for five minutes before he woke up. Sweat drenched his clothes, and he could barely open his eyes as he rubbed his face. He leaned against the wall before making his way to the shower. I made him scrambled eggs and toast to fill his stomach and hopefully clean out whatever he drank/ate/snorted/shot up last night.</p><p>When I confronted Dad in the laundry room about Ryan, he said, \u201cYour brother\u2019s an adult.\u201d He moved wet socks from the washer to the dryer. \u201cI can\u2019t tell him how to live his life.\u201d Then Dad put an arm around my shoulder, kissed my head, and told me to call Mom sometime.</p><p>Daddy Denial, as always. I find it funny that Dad makes Ryan come to church, which seems to be telling him how to live his life, if you ask me.</p><p>The Durango pulls into the parking lot, and I see Tate standing by himself by the swing set. I hop out of the car and skip over to him.</p><p>\u201cDoughnuts?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Tate laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hungry lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m famished,\u201d I reply, looking down at his tie that\u2019s covered by music notes. His hair is all crazy gelled up, but I like it. Together we start walking to the Fellowship Hall. He fumbles with something in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Aaron?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cUh, he went inside already,\u201d Tate replies.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, um, never returned his calls...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...?\u201d I look at Tate sideways.</p><p>\u201cSo he thought you were interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said anything, though,\u201d I blurt.</p><p>\u201cBut you made out with him. What\u2019s he supposed to think?\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Tate to give it to me straight. Because he went to other schools, I never really knew him until after Mom left. That\u2019s when he started hanging around.</p><p>\u201cSo what, Aaron and I can\u2019t be friends?\u201d I ask, playing with my hair.</p><p>Tate lifts a shoulder. \u201cI dunno, you should talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Inside the church, Tate and I get in line for Coffee Time, and that\u2019s when I see Aaron and Laura across the Fellowship Hall. Laughing and smiling and touching each other.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I mutter, nudging Tate and pointing. Laura just fed Aaron a grape! In Sunday school last week, she started crying because she was worried people she knows are going to Hell. She looked at me pointedly. But it\u2019s okay for her to flirt at church?</p><p>\u201cIs he actually interested in her? If so, why?\u201d</p><p>Tate scratches his neck. \u201cI dunno. She answers when he calls. Why? Do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Truth. Last night, I could\u2019ve gone to Miller\u2019s Hollow and hung out with somebody, but I stayed in and chatted with Brian over Skype. And that connection felt better than kissing could ever feel.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see him. Standing across the room drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup. Brian raises his eyebrows at me, and I can see him smiling behind the cup. He\u2019s wearing his Best Buy costume: white shirt, black tie. So nerdy hot.</p><p>I peer around the room. Ryan\u2019s sitting between a piano and a potted plant with his head up against a wall. Dad is deep in conversation. With a woman! She looks like she might be from India. She\u2019s gorgeous, with long black wavy hair and a nice smile. Jack Taylor of the Jack Taylor Ford dealership looks at them like they have the plague. Dad\u2019s so busy talking to Mystery Woman he doesn\u2019t even notice Jack. Or me.</p><p>I touch my stomach. \u201cI need to use the bathroom. Damned stale doughnuts.\u201d</p><p>Tate laughs. \u201cTMI.\u201d</p><p>I toss my napkin and cup in the trash and head toward the bathroom down the hall. Fifteen seconds later, Brian appears. We smile but don\u2019t say a word. He glances over his shoulder. I lead him past the women\u2019s restroom to the janitor\u2019s closet. Inside, it\u2019s dark. I pull on the chain cord that turns on the light and glance around at the bottles of Windex and Clorox. The stench of bleach nearly knocks me down. I\u2019m panting.</p><p>I climb the ladder that leads up to a crawl space above the supplies. I tell Brian I know about this place because Laura and I would hide here sometimes as kids, during church-wide games of Hide and Seek. The cubby has very little space\u2014the last time I was up here I was nine\u2014so he and I are touching elbows and legs when we squeeze in.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says, grinning.</p><p>\u201cHi...Do you have a second job at Best Buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No.\u201d He looks down at his clothes and realization dawns on his face. \u201cYou smart ass. Trouble.\u201d His mouth twitches in amusement. \u201cI bet there are lots of spiders up here.\u201d</p><p>I smack his bicep. \u201cShut up, you.\u201d</p><p>He shoves me with his elbow.</p><p>I smile at his lips. \u201cYou came to church.\u201d</p><p>He plays with his bangs and looks at me sideways. \u201cYeah. I figure I need to repent for my sins.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go all buggy. I gasp. Is he thinking the same sinful things about me that I\u2019m thinking about him?</p><p>\u201cWhat sins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was six, I stole a Three Musketeers bar from Walmart. When I was nine, I scribbled Evan\u2019s name on a desk with permanent marker and denied I did it. He had to scrub it off. In high school, I wrote the Pythagorean Theorem on my palm and cheated on a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut other than that, you\u2019re perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally perfect.\u201d</p><p>I want to touch his knee and run my hand up his thigh, but I keep my hands folded tight in my lap. He crosses his arms. We\u2019ve talked every night this week. He knows that sometimes I wear a My Little Pony T-shirt to bed. I decide being up front is best.</p><p>\u201cDo you consider me a sin?\u201d I whisper, my hands fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cTalking to you? No. But...anything else? Yes, that would be bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad?\u201d My voice shakes and squeaks.</p><p>He loosens his black tie. \u201cListen...I think you\u2019re beautiful, and really smart and funny and kind\u2014\u201d</p><p>My heart swells, my pulse races, my grin explodes.</p><p>\u201cBut I teach at your school. You\u2019re a minor.\u201d He gives me a sad smile.</p><p>Everything slows to a stop. I\u2019m ready to cry. I mean, why would he come up here with me, if not to do something more? We\u2019ve been talking every night on Skype and chat. What is that supposed to mean?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, right?\u201d he asks, taking my hand.</p><p>My face hurts from frowning so hard. Friends don\u2019t hide in janitors\u2019 closets to talk to each other.</p><p>He nudges me with his elbow. I lean against his shoulder, and he tells me about how, this morning, he ran fifteen miles in two hours, his best time yet. He\u2019s in perfect shape to run the Nashville half-marathon in April.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you raising money for the American Heart Association?\u201d</p><p>He holds my gaze for several seconds before rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s a good cause. My grandmother died of a heart aneurism.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze his hand. \u201cI bet she was a great person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved her.\u201d</p><p>I can tell he wants to change the subject. \u201cYou know what\u2019s also a good cause? Buying me cheese fries at Foothills Diner.\u201d I wink at him.</p><p>\u201cI knew I would convert you to the cult of Fries \u00e0 la Appalachia. You should eat more of them. You need to put on weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, I like being skinny.\u201d He scans my body slowly, and when he looks up into my eyes, he jerks his neck, flipping hair off his forehead. He pulls his knees to his chest and clutches his shins.</p><p>I grab his wrist and pull it closer to check his watch. It\u2019s so dim in here. \u201cWe should go. Dad\u2019ll kill me if I miss Big Church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig Church?\u201d Brian says, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>I climb down the ladder, and Brian puts his hands around my waist and helps me to the floor. I turn around to face him and stare up at his chapped lips. Does he bite them? Is he stressed? He avoids my eyes and gestures toward the door. We exit the janitor\u2019s closet and I run straight into Mystery Woman. She sees Brian emerging behind me. She throws us a questioning look, then goes into the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I whisper to him.</p><p>\u201cJust keep walking,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I hustle down the hallway and up the stairs to the sanctuary, but by the time I get there, Brian\u2019s not behind me anymore. He just...left?</p><p>I play zombie all through the service, acting like I\u2019m in the sanctuary, but really I\u2019m in that janitor\u2019s closet. Our arms touching. Sharing the same Clorox-infused air. My mind wanders when we sing my favorite hymn, \u201cI\u2019ll Fly Away,\u201d because the words are beautiful, but when the organ goes silent I\u2019m thinking of his chapped lips again.</p> <p>After Big Church, everyone shakes hands and chats for a while before leaving. I avoid Aaron and Laura, who are looking at each other like they\u2019re getting married in an hour, but Tate asks where I disappeared to during Sunday school.</p><p>\u201cThe doughnut was way staler than usual,\u201d I lie.</p><p>Outside in the parking lot, I lean up against the Durango and wait for Dad. Will Brian want to talk later today? Is this it for us? Should I stop talking to him altogether? Should I settle for being friends? Can my heart handle only being friends? Could I bring up April fifth again to see if we could hang out after that? Could I bring up hanging out after graduation?</p><p>\u201cI want you to meet my daughter.\u201d</p><p>I look up to find Dad standing there with Mystery Woman, smiling like someone just handed him a winning lottery ticket. I gasp and cross my arms and look around. I blush. She studies me like I\u2019m a difficult calc problem.</p> <p>Dad beams. \u201cParker, meet Veena. Veena, meet Parker.\u201d</p><p>When I was little, I looked up to Ryan. He was my hero: so good at baseball, so smart at school, so funny and cool with his friends. I felt like a twerp by comparison.</p><p>Opryland was Nashville\u2019s theme park, but it went out of business a couple of years ago. It had this crazy 3-D rollercoaster called Chaos. It scared the bejesus out of me. I loved the bumper cars. I ate cup after cup of Dippin\u2019 Dots ice cream. But my favorite attraction was the Tin Lizzie cars. Kids could drive horseless carriages from the early 1900s around a track. I did that over and over again. One time, when I was eight, I took off for the Tin Lizzies, thinking my family was right behind me.</p><p>They weren\u2019t.</p><p>I ran around in circles, crying. My parents told me never to talk to strangers, so I wouldn\u2019t let anyone who was trying to help me come near. I was lost for ten minutes before Ryan found me. I\u2019ll never forget how he came sprinting up and lifted me into his arms and twirled me in a circle. My running off scared him bad.</p><p>Now, I wish I had a Tin Lizzie that I could drive to find the real Ryan. The one I love and miss. Where did he run off to? And God, will you bring him back?</p> <p>Written on February 21 on a napkin. Wadded up and burned.</p><p>I have never ever sat by the phone before. Never. Ever.</p><p>But that\u2019s how I\u2019m spending Sunday afternoon, instead of my usual: doing homework. Ring, phone, ring! He has my number\u2014I gave it to him over Skype. Hell, he can talk to me on Skype if he wants to. But he hasn\u2019t been online all day. The only thing in my inbox is a draft article Drew wrote that he wants an opinion on.</p><p>I compose a short email to Brian:</p><p>Hey, where did you disappear to today? Loved talking to you in the janitor\u2019s closet. It\u2019s my new favorite place. Let\u2019s do it again sometime. Next Sunday during Big Church?</p><p>Egads, what am I thinking? I delete the email immediately and pray that no hacker saw that and plans to post it all over the Internet announcing it as the lamest thing anybody\u2019s ever seen.</p><p>Maybe Brian\u2019s online but invisible. Maybe he\u2019s staring at my name and thinking, Wow, she has no life and she\u2019s sitting there waiting for me to message her. I\u2019m gonna go running with Brandy the dog and then go drink a beer and live my real adult life and do adult things.</p><p>I click the Go Invisible button. Now he\u2019ll think I have a life. He\u2019ll think I\u2019m out doing cool things, like hanging at Jiffy Burger with Drew, Corndog, and Sam, pretending to be Elaine and yelling \u201cGet out!\u201d</p> <p>What if he\u2019s with Coach Vixen? What if they\u2019re doing it right now?</p><p>This goes on for two more hours. I download that movie Never Been Kissed starring Drew Barrymore from iTunes. As if anyone would actually believe a twenty-five-year-old woman who looks like her\u2014hideous makeup or not\u2014has never been kissed. Her teacher, who thinks she\u2019s a teenager when she\u2019s really twenty-five, is into her, but he doesn\u2019t go after it until he discovers she\u2019s really an adult.</p><p>I consider telling Brian that I\u2019m not really a teenager. Really, I\u2019m a twenty-five-year-old reporter for the Tennessean and I\u2019m researching the athletics department at Hundred Oaks High because the football team gets all the money.</p><p>My phone buzzes. I pick it up faster than a jet at Mach 5. Aw, it\u2019s just a text from Corndog that reads Look outside ur window.</p><p>I move my laptop and go push the curtains aside to find Corndog sitting out front on his lawnmower. Without bothering to check my hair or makeup, I head to the front door. He gives me a big smile when I let him inside. He\u2019s wearing a polo layered on top of long-sleeved T-shirts with a pair of jeans, sneakers, and a cap.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s listening to some god-awful trance music in his room, and Dad is passed out on the couch with the Sunday comics draped across his face, so they don\u2019t even notice a boy coming in. That\u2019s what I should tell Brian. I\u2019m the real adult in my house, you know.</p><p>Corndog follows me to my room without a word. As soon as the door\u2019s shut, I yell-whisper, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and rubs his palms together. \u201cBored. I don\u2019t have any homework or practice or chores so I thought I\u2019d see what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d We\u2019ve never really hung out alone before, considering (1) he was my nemesis for valedictorian, and (2) he\u2019s never tried to hang out alone with me before. At least not since those science projects we did together in eighth grade.</p><p>His mouth slides into a smile. \u201cYes, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to do something on the farm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCows are milked. Eggs are collected. I got the afternoon off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Bo? Did he get booboos on his knees and hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But he\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Corndog starts looking around my room and beelines straight for my bookshelves. He drags a finger over my shelf o\u2019 vampire novels, then moves on to the travel guides I grab at yard sales and used bookstores. I love collecting random travel books for places like the Galapagos and Australia and Tanzania and South Africa.</p><p>Then he moves on to my nonfiction shelf, which has all sorts of randomness...books on zookeeping, books on the horrors of animal smuggling, books about the Serengeti. I\u2019m praying he doesn\u2019t pull any of those books down, because I hide my Harlequin romances behind them.</p><p>Corndog starts looking at my bulletin boards, which are covered with pictures of me and Drew and me and my family. I took down the pictures of me, Laura, and Allie and buried them in a box under my bed. There\u2019s only one picture of me and Mom. It was taken when I was five, out in front of Forrest Sanctuary on Easter. Mom looked gorgeous that day in a trim blue dress and matching hat.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing before I got here?\u201d he asks, coughing into a fist.</p><p>Stalking your baseball coach online. \u201cI was watching a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis chick flick thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite!\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cCorndog, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019m bored and wanted to hang out. Can\u2019t George hang out with Elaine once in a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>He pulls his sneakers off, then lies down on my side of the bed\u2014the side I sleep on!\u2014and situates the laptop on his thighs. He yanks his cap off and tosses it on top of his sneakers. I hesitate for a sec, then lie down on the other side of the bed while he restarts the movie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>We watch the movie in a nice silence until he exclaims, \u201cThis is unbelievable. How can they make Drew Barrymore look that bad? Well, I mean, she\u2019s still hot\u2014I\u2019d do her, but geez!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m cracking up. \u201cI know! And the teacher still wants her even though she\u2019s wearing that hideous sombrero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a perv that guy is. What kind of teacher goes after his student?\u201d</p><p>I clutch my pillow. \u201cHe probably has some sixth sense and knew that she wasn\u2019t really seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sixth sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that perv guy has a sixth sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He has the ability to tell if women are really older than they say they are. He can tell when forty-year-olds are pretending to be thirty-five too.\u201d</p><p>He hoists himself up on an elbow and throws me a withering look. \u201cAre you really our valedictorian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. I beat you by a tenth of a point, remember?\u201d I chuckle. \u201cBesides, we can\u2019t have someone named Corndog giving the valedictory speech. Everyone would spend the whole time salivating instead of listening. Everyone would just get up and leave to go get a corndog!\u201d</p><p>He laughs, but then his face goes soft and pensive. \u201cIt\u2019s Will. You can call me that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one would have any idea who I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cI kinda like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking over the movie,\u201d I say, gesturing at Drew Barrymore making an ass of herself singing with a band at a bar. She was stupid enough to eat a brownie full of roofies or something.</p><p>I snuggle up with Patrick the stuffed koala and Corndog? Will? slides a hand behind his head and we watch the movie together.</p><p>I guess at some point I passed out, because I wake up to find a black screen. I also find my mouth pressing against Corndog/Will/Person/Guy\u2019s shoulder. I left a big drool spot on his polo. Holy mortifying! I\u2019m pawing at it, trying to make my spit bleed into the shirt, when he opens his eyes and looks over at me with a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I drooled on you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He ruffles his hair. A cowlick sticks straight up. One eye opens wider than the other.</p><p>Oh. My. God. I fell asleep with a boy in my bed.</p><p>The sun is setting outside the window, leaving my room in shadow. It\u2019s nice lying here with him in a warm silence. It\u2019s pretty weird that he just dropped by and hasn\u2019t tried to make out with me or do any other funny business. I don\u2019t think this has happened before, well, at least not with anyone other than Drew. And he doesn\u2019t count.</p><p>So what\u2019s this about?</p><p>Will folds the laptop lid down and sets it on the floor, then shuts his eyes, pulls Patrick the koala to his chest, and curls up. I stare at the ceiling. How weird is this? The captain of the baseball team is cuddling with my stuffed animal? I shrug and shut my eyes and wonder if Brian\u2019s spending a quiet afternoon reading. I let myself doze back off.</p><p>Next thing I know, Dad has barged into my room. \u201cI\u2019ve been knocking for over a minute. What\u2019s going on in here?\u201d he exclaims.</p><p>I sit up straight and smooth my tangles. Will quickly pulls himself to a sitting position, grabs his sneakers, and fumbles with the laces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust watching a movie, Dad.\u201d I yawn.</p><p>\u201cWho is this boy in your bed?

It\u2019s not like I really care\u2014I mean, this is just Corndog\u2014what if Brian were in my bed?</p><p>\u201cI better go,\u201d Corndog says, giving me a nervous smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the front door.\u201d I hop out of bed and lead him down the hall. When we get to the living room, I stop dead. Mystery Woman Veena is here. Staring at me. She looks from me to Corndog and back to me again.</p><p>Who is this lady? Some angel of darkness God sent to confront me for my sins? Thanks but no thanks, God. I\u2019ve already got Laura.</p><p>Dad walks up behind me, whistling. He drops a hand on my shoulder. \u201cI invited Veena over for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow,\u201d I mumble to Corndog. My face feels hotter than a supernova.</p><p>He glances at Dad and Veena, then gives me a quick smile. \u201cThanks for the chick flick.\u201d</p><p>Once he\u2019s gone, Dad claps his hands together and looks at me. \u201cSo what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um...\u201d I say. I hadn\u2019t really thought about dinner yet. I glance at my watch. It\u2019s 6:00 p.m., and normally I\u2019ve started cooking by now. Veena narrows her eyes at Dad. I guess he invited her over for dinner and failed to mention that his daughter makes most of the meals.</p><p>\u201cI love cooking,\u201d I explain, not wanting to embarrass my father. \u201cI accidentally fell asleep. I\u2019ll start making dinner now.\u201d I nervously play with my hair as I head into the kitchen. Pasta is a good, fast option. I don\u2019t have time to make a roast or anything. I could toss a salad to go with it. I grab a pot from the wall and begin filling it with water.</p><p>Brian hasn\u2019t called all day. Didn\u2019t that time in the closet mean anything to him? Obviously not.</p> <p>I\u2019m shutting off the water when Dad enters the kitchen. \u201cForget cooking. Let\u2019s go out for a change, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ryan said he has a paper due tomorrow (can you say \u201cexcuse\u201d?), so it\u2019s just me, Dad, and Mystery Woman Veena at Davy Crockett\u2019s Roadhouse. I like this place because they serve peanuts by the bucket, and I can eat a bucket load of peanuts because my diet depends on lots of protein.</p><p>I crack open a few and line eight peanuts up across my bread plate. I\u2019ll savor them one by one.</p><p>\u201cVeena\u2019s a nurse,\u201d Dad says, touching her hand.</p><p>She blushes. Is she embarrassed of her job? Or because Dad is coming on way strong? Since when does Dad come on to anybody? He hasn\u2019t dated since...since...ever? Since Mom.</p><p>\u201cI work at the Murfreesboro Regional Medical Center,\u201d she says, avoiding my eyes.</p><p>Dad rattles peanuts in his fist like a pair of dice. \u201cAnd Parker is a senior at Hundred Oaks. She\u2019s going to Vanderbilt next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanderbilt? Really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s valedictorian too,\u201d Dad adds, smiling and popping a peanut in his mouth.</p><p>I\u2019m pleased that Dad is proud of me, but Veena looks way surprised. How humiliating. But then I remember: she doesn\u2019t know me. She has no right to judge me. Is that why she agreed to come out with us\u2014to judge me? But on the other hand, all the evidence I\u2019ve given as to my personality involves me hanging out with two different guys on the same day. One in a janitor\u2019s closet, one in my room. I rub my eyes. This isn\u2019t what I wanted for myself. Maybe I was meant to be a sinner. Maybe that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be. Maybe Laura\u2019s right.</p><p>A good person wouldn\u2019t lust after a teacher. Lonely or not.</p><p>Veena takes a greasy roll from the bread basket and butters it up. Saliva forms in my mouth as I stare at the bread. I could have one bite, right? No, I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to Forrest Sanctuary now?\u201d I ask Veena.</p><p>She sips her water, then nods. \u201cYes. I just moved here from New York and don\u2019t really know anyone except for people at the hospital. But I\u2019ve always gone to church, so here I am.\u201d She shrugs and blushes again. It gives her dark skin a rosy touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d Dad replies. He touches her hand again. \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He stands and heads toward the restrooms.</p><p>I eat the first of my eight peanuts, savoring the salt.</p><p>Veena takes a bite of roll, and after swallowing, she whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t say anything to your father about this morning.\u201d</p><p>I find her eyes. They are kind but questioning.</p><p>She continues, \u201cThe man you were with...he seemed older.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond. I concentrate on peanut #2. I want to eat it in peace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business, I know. And I\u2019m one to talk...your father must be over ten years older than me...I\u2019m 29...I just wanted to let you know I won\u2019t say anything, okay?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thank you,\u201d I whisper. \u201cNothing happened, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>She pauses. \u201cSo, Vanderbilt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I got in early admission.\u201d I say it with a strong, proud voice.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cGood school. I didn\u2019t get into their medical program. I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI studied hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t study hard enough.\u201d She laughs, sipping her water, and I join in laughing.</p><p>I eat peanut number two and smile at Veena as I chew. She\u2019s very pretty and slim. I love her black curls, and it looks like she knows how to use an eyelash curler. Her full lips are painted a bronze-ish color.</p><p>Dad hustles up and slides into the booth next to her. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d he asks, putting his napkin back on his lap.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Veena replies. \u201cGirl talk.\u201d</p><p>I pop peanut number three in my mouth and think: don\u2019t mess this up, Dad! She\u2019s pretty nice.</p><p>But she knows about Brian. I hope she keeps her mouth shut like she said she would.</p><p>Before bed, I wash my face with cleanser, moisturize, and carefully tweeze my eyebrows. I slip on pajamas and climb into bed with my laptop.</p><p>My phone beeps. A text from Corndog reads: Had fun today.</p><p>I text back: Me too. Can\u2019t wait to tell everybody u love chick flicks!</p><p>Don\u2019t! You\u2019ll destroy my street cred!</p><p>I log in to Skype, and ten seconds later an IM from Brian pops up.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Hey. Sorry I flaked.</p><p>I smile, and a warm feeling rushes through my body.</p><p>Parker Shelton: No prob.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Want to talk?</p><p>Parker Shelton: Yes!!</p><p>Skype rings, I answer, and Brian\u2019s voice tumbles out of the speakers. \u201cHey, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your day.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes again. I ignore it.</p><p>Drew and I don\u2019t have many classes together.</p><p>I\u2019m taking AP courses, while he\u2019s in classes like music theory and art. It\u2019s senior year and he wanted to relax. But we do take AP English together, because he cares a lot about making his writing the best it can be. He sits in the front row, next to Corndog, and I sit right behind them. And because everyone now knows Drew broke up with Amy, the girls are out in full force to win his heart. Or win a chance to fool around with him. I don\u2019t know which.</p><p>While we\u2019re waiting on the final bell to ring before class starts, Marie Baird is leaning against his desk, chatting, laughing, and playfully slapping his shoulder, and Kristen Markum is standing between his legs, smiling down at him. He grins up at them, shaking his leg and tapping his foot. They\u2019re discussing what one item they\u2019d bring if they were to go on the TV show Survivor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bring my iPad so I could download books to read,\u201d Marie says.</p><p>\u201cBut how would you charge the battery on a deserted island?\u201d I hear Corndog murmur to himself. I laugh silently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bring a big pad of paper and pen so I could work on my autobiography,\u201d Drew tells them.</p><p>\u201cI want to read it!\u201d Kristen says.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Marie adds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bring a cell phone, so I could call you,\u201d Kristen says to Drew.</p><p>\u201cBut how would you charge the battery?\u201d Corndog mutters to himself again, and I start laughing.</p><p>Corndog lobs a note onto my desk. I unfold the paper. How does Drew always get this mad play?</p><p>I write back: Because he\u2019s Double-wide Drew. I toss the note to Corndog; he catches it one-handed and reads. Then bursts out laughing. He writes me back.</p><p>Is that all girls care about? Penis size?</p><p>You better believe it. (Just kidding. We care about how much $$ you have too.)</p><p>Marie? Is that who he\u2019s interested in? Corndog writes.</p><p>No idea. She\u2019s pretty and nice, though.</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019s hot.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just ask him?</p><p>I fold the note and move to toss it to Corndog, but Drew intercepts my pass. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He unfolds the paper and I swipe at him, trying to get it back, but he blocks me with a forearm. Ugh, he\u2019s such a football player. Corndog doesn\u2019t seem to care that our note has been hijacked, because he\u2019s giggling like a little girl.</p><p>Drew reads the paper. \u201cWhy are y\u2019all writing notes about my junk?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lips together to stop myself from laughing.</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t help but think about my package all day long,\u201d Drew says to me. \u201cBut English class is not the time or place to obsess over it.\u201d He snorggles and flicks my forehead. I flick his forehead. And then we\u2019re in a forehead flicking war.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so boy crazy, it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d Kristen whispers to Marie, throwing me a glare. I suck in a deep breath. Corndog avoids my eyes and turns to face the whiteboard.</p><p>I sink down into my seat, embarrassed. My rep must be pretty bad if Kristen Markum, the girl who gets it on with everybody, thinks I get around.</p><p>Brian works us like plow horses in gym class.</p><p>But there is a bit of good news. I get lots of smiles from him as I run laps around the track.</p><p>I speed past Laura just in time to hear her comment on how cute Brian is, and how it\u2019s too bad he\u2019s our gym teacher. It\u2019s a good thing Brian\u2019s busy yelling at the baseball players in Coach Burns\u2019s class to pay any attention to her.</p><p>I\u2019m on lap six of twelve, thinking about Brian\u2019s chapped lips and wondering why he bites them so hard, when Corndog jogs up next to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Parker,\u201d he says, loping along, arms flailing all over the place.</p><p>\u201cYour form sucks today,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. I stayed up too late texting.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. We have been texting a lot. Corndog and I talk about books and animals and how I might become a zookeeper and how he wants to study agricultural law one day. A lawyer for farmers?! I texted him last night.</p><p>A soil expert, he replied. One of the reasons farming has become so hard for people is soil erosion. It\u2019s become chemically altered because people overuse it.</p><p>Part of me wishes we could\u2019ve been close friends before our last semester, but considering we spent three and a half years duking it out over grades, this is the first time we\u2019ve been able to relax around each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou stayed up late texting?\u201d I tease. \u201cThat was very wrong of you. You should be removed as captain. You are a horrible influence on these young minds.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, his brown hair flopping in the wind. \u201cYou\u2019re the bad influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I blurt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jogging with me. All the other girls want to be like you. They\u2019re gonna be all over me now.\u201d He jerks his head, indicating I should look behind us, and sure enough, Kate Kelly and Emily Mansfield are following, checking us out. Those girls are goody two-shoes who go to my church, and started ignoring me after Mom left. Everyone knows Kate\u2019s had a huge crush on Corndog for a century.</p> <p>\u201cI highly doubt anyone wants to be like me,\u201d I say, wiping sweat off my forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou slaughtered my GPA and ruined my lifelong dream of being valedictorian and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorndog!\u201d Brian yells, waving his hand in a circle. \u201cPick up the pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoach, come on!\u201d Corndog snaps, but he starts running faster than I could ever hope to run.</p><p>I go back to jogging by myself, and when I pass Brian, he narrows his eyes and mouths, \u201cCorndog?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head and give him a knowing smile. I feel a shift: Brian doesn\u2019t have all the power. Is he waiting on me to make a move?</p><p>insurance paperwork, monster burgers, and matching furniture</p><p>39 days until i turn 18</p><p>Saturday\u2019s game is at home.</p><p>We\u2019re playing Coffee County Central, one of the biggest schools in Middle Tennessee. They are damned good at baseball. Better than Hundred Oaks. Every year when we play them, we play for the Coffee Pot. It\u2019s a trophy in the shape of a coffee pot. It\u2019s stupid, really, but all these guys would go to war for that trophy. Anyhow, Brian is taking this game super seriously and keeps taking the stats book out of my hand, combing over the numbers, and handing it back.</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t mention last night\u2019s conversation at all. We chatted online for a few minutes before he went out with a high school friend. I prayed that \u201cbowling with an old buddy\u201d isn\u2019t code for \u201cI\u2019m having sex with Coach Vixen tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Are you wearing a bowling shirt? I had asked.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: No. A button down. What are you wearing? :)</p><p>A bowling shirt, I lied.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: LOL</p><p>I garnered some guts and typed, I wish I could go bowling with you.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Oh yeah?</p><p>Parker Shelton: I want to hang out with you. Alone. Together. You know?</p><p>Brian Hoffman: Like in the closet at church last week? :)</p> <p>We could hang out in a nuclear reactor for all I care, I pressed Enter and pulled a deep breath.</p><p>The cursor blinked and blinked.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: You\u2019re fun. I wish we could hang out too...</p><p>He seemed wistful. Like it would never happen. But I also could tell I have a shot. A shot I desperately want.</p><p>I decided to play the hard-to-get card, I guess it\u2019ll never happen, eh?</p><p>Brian Hoffman: I don\u2019t know about never.</p><p>Parker Shelton: It\u2019s too bad it can\u2019t be sooner rather than never.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: I know, I know......I have to run.</p><p>Parker Shelton: Ok, see you tomorrow at the game.</p><p>Brian Hoffman: See you.</p><p>Right as I was about to sign off, Brian wrote, Soon. We\u2019ll hang out soon.</p><p>I did a bit of Internet sleuthing after our call. I looked up the age of consent for Tennessee. Not because I think Brian and I will have sex, but because I wanted to know how bad this is. My wanting him. Turns out the age of consent is 18, unless the partner is less than four years older.</p><p>That scared me, but nonetheless, now I find myself hoping that hanging out soon means today.</p><p>While most of the team is on the field during the top of the seventh inning, and we\u2019re losing four to one, Brian\u2019s leaning over onto his knee and yelling at Travis Lake to get into the game at shortstop.</p><p>I take a chance and tug on his jersey sleeve.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, barely throwing me a glance.</p><p>\u201cHow was bowling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring. It was just me and Evan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan is boring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no Parker.\u201d He smiles slightly, then claps a couple of times and hollers to Jake Sanders that he\u2019s pitching a great inning. \u201cEvan spent the whole time talking about how he hates changing his kid\u2019s diapers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should be a lesson to you,\u201d I say, barely able to contain my laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should hang out with me while you\u2019ve got the chance.\u201d I can\u2019t believe how bold I am toward him.</p><p>\u201cFocus on stats, will you?\u201d he says, chewing his gum and smiling.</p><p>We lose the Coffee Pot five to one. After storing the coolers in the equipment shed, I head back across the field toward the bike racks. The softball team is already warming up for their game.</p><p>\u201cHow old do you think he is?\u201d Laura asks Allie, gazing over at Brian.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three,\u201d I say, skipping past. I can\u2019t help but smile, because I know the answers to everything they want to know.</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d Brian calls, beckoning me with two fingers. I can feel Laura\u2019s eyes burning holes in me.</p><p>I hustle up to him, summoning my cutest smile. He adjusts his cap and chomps on his gum. \u201cHave any plans this afternoon?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the park by Little Duck River?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there with Brandy at about four o\u2019clock. She likes the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat river has water moccasins! You shouldn\u2019t let Brandy play in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on. My dog ain\u2019t afraid of no snake. Snakes are scared of my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that it?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>From beside his truck, Corndog calls out from across the parking lot, \u201cYou need a ride home, Parker?\u201d He jingles his keys.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my bike, but thanks!\u201d I smile and wave.</p><p>Corndog nods slowly. He looks a bit sad. \u201cHave a good night then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got a crush on Parker,\u201d Brian says in a sing-song tone only I can hear.</p><p>\u201cShut up, you.\u201d I\u2019m tempted to slap his arm playfully, but Laura and Allie are here and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re looking this way. Do they suspect anything? Do they know I want Brian bad?</p><p>One thing\u2019s for sure: any problem can be solved with a big slobbery dog named Brandy.</p><p>The sun is low and the sky is a dark blue when I lock my bike, shove my hands in my jacket pockets, and skip toward the stream.</p><p>I stroll along the creek, admiring the tall green reeds sticking out of the water. Rocks and mud line the banks. I keep an eye out for frogs and turtles and lizards and snakes\u2014I\u2019d like to see them. I toss a few stones in the water.</p><p>A dog barks, and I lift my head to find Brian coming my way, being pulled by a big black lab. I glance around quickly to make sure we\u2019re alone, then rush toward them.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing flip flops, worn jeans, and a faded Titans sweatshirt. No cap\u2014his black wavy hair hangs loose. I want to weave my fingers into it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say to Brian. I get down on one knee, feeling mud soak through my jeans, and start scratching Brandy\u2019s ears and kissing her face. \u201cYou are gorgeous,\u201d I tell the dog. I hug her neck and pat her back and she barks and paws at me and wags her tail. \u201cYou are the sweetest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Brian says, smiling down at me, the leash wrapped tightly around his fist.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to Brandy. Duh.\u201d</p><p>Brian squats and rubs Brandy\u2019s neck while staring at my face. \u201cThis is much better than hanging out in a janitor\u2019s closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with hanging out wherever.\u201d I look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWant to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, bouncing to my feet. Brandy jumps, and her paws get muddy prints on my pink shirt.</p><p>\u201cBrandy, behave, girl!\u201d Brian exclaims, securing her leash. His eyes run over the dirt on my clothes. \u201cSorry...\u201d</p><p>I wave a hand. \u201cCan I hold her leash?\u201d He hands it to me. Brandy jumps up again, to try to lick my face and I say, \u201cGood dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got a fan,\u201d Brian says.</p><p>Brandy hauls me down to the water and starts drinking. Then she hops in and splashes around the rocks. \u201cBrandy, be careful! There are snakes in there.\u201d</p><p>Brian appears beside me and plays with my shirt sleeve. My heart beats like crazy. I have to control my breathing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious, you know that?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI am Elaine.\u201d</p><p>He lifts his eyebrows, so I go on to tell him about how I play Elaine for Drew, Corndog, and Sam sometimes, and that makes Brian laugh so hard.</p><p>\u201cSo you go sit at Jiffy Burger and talk about nothing?\u201d he asks, grinning like a madman.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, it\u2019s funny. I totally would\u2019ve done that in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you weren\u2019t in detention or suspended, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me.\u201d</p><p>We wander by the creek, and Brian picks up sticks and rocks to lob into the water. The air is perfect\u2014cool, with a dash of spring. For a while we don\u2019t talk. We listen to the wind and Brandy\u2019s barking and slobbering. Soon we\u2019re under a bridge. The concrete supports are covered by colorful graffiti like \u201cI\u2019m an audio pirate!\u201d and \u201cCrips\u201d and \u201cAW + TG.\u201d</p><p>Brandy tugs on her leash, pulling me forward.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s enough, Brand,\u201d Brian says, taking her leash back. His fingers graze my skin before he squats down to whisper to his dog.</p><p>Aside from nudging me or playing with my shirt and other meek attempts at flirting, he hasn\u2019t made a move. Do I have to wear the pants? I peek down at his face\u2014pensive, as he pets her black coat.</p><p>I thrust my hand toward him. He looks at it, then at my eyes before taking it and standing. I lace my fingers with his. The wind gently threads through his black hair.</p><p>\u201cParker...I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat idea?\u201d</p><p>He looks at our hands again, then strokes mine with a thumb. It feels so good I moan softly like I did that day in class. Only this time, I\u2019m a hell of a lot more embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat idea?\u201d I press.</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He holds up our entwined hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right, it\u2019s wrong, and I should care, but I don\u2019t. And I tell him as much. His eyes grow wide. I keep moving closer to him, and he doesn\u2019t run or jump into the river or anything, so I squeeze his hand tighter. Brandy jerks her leash, trying to pull Brian away from me. His gaze never leaves mine as he says, \u201cBrandy, come on, girl. Sit.\u201d</p><p>The dog collapses at his feet, and Brian secures the leash around his hand as I put my hands on his hips. He shudders. With his free hand, he touches my hair and laughs softly at my tangles. The thumping of my heart threatens to drown out Brandy\u2019s panting and the sound of water lapping over rocks.</p><p>I get up on tiptoes and stroke his stubble. I glance at his lips, then at his eyes. He\u2019s focusing on my mouth. He digs fingers into my hip. Now or never. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrian.\u201d</p><p>My mouth finds his, and I wrap my arms around his neck. He pulls back at first, gasping, his breath warm against my lips. He dives back in. His chapped lips feel rough against mine. He pushes me up against the concrete bridge support. The stone scrapes my lower back. I deepen the kiss. His tongue explores inside my mouth. My knees go wobbly. My breathing quickens, and I\u2019m clutching his shoulders and holding on tight so I don\u2019t fall.</p><p>He yanks away from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I whisper, panting.</p> <p>\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d He touches his lips. \u201cI had fun today. See you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I blurt.</p><p>\u201cI need to change the oil in Mom\u2019s car, and I have to pay some bills and work on some insurance paperwork.\u201d</p><p>He stopped kissing me so he can go work on insurance?!</p><p>Was I not a good enough kisser? Is he not interested in me? \u201cInsurance? Really?\u201d</p> <p>His face is all red, and he clutches the back of his neck. \u201cI need to go before I do something we\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t regret anything!\u201d I say, but he\u2019s already moving away quickly. He leads Brandy back to his truck, leaving me here with nothing but dark rushing water.</p><p>This makes two Saturday nights in a row I haven\u2019t gone out to find someone to kiss. I guess I really like Brian. I\u2019m repainting my fingernails when I get a text from Corndog:</p><p>Look out ur window!</p><p>I peek outside and find him and Drew standing in the front yard, waving. I go let them inside, and Corndog says, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Jiffy Burger. I need a Monster burger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, those things have, like, a thousand calories,\u201d I reply, blowing on my wet nails. My pinky is smudged already.</p> <p>\u201cA thousand calories? Really?\u201d Corndog smiles. \u201cI could eat two of those burgers and meet my caloric intake needs for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Drew responds, bumping Corndog\u2019s fist.</p><p>\u201cYou in?\u201d Corndog grins coyly at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply. Anything to take my mind off Brian and his kisses. And his insurance paperwork, for crying out loud.</p><p>As we drive the streets of Franklin, I watch for Brian\u2019s truck. He\u2019s not at Freddie\u2019s Oyster Bar. He\u2019s not at the Barnes and Noble. He\u2019s not at the Porno Supermarket (thank the heavens!). He\u2019s nowhere. I check my phone to see if he texted\u2014maybe I didn\u2019t hear the chime over Drew\u2019s rap music.</p><p>I\u2019m such a psycho. He\u2019s twenty-three! We can\u2019t have anything. Why would he risk his reputation, risk everything, by dating a student? Even if we wait until after I graduate, I\u2019ll still be six years younger and in a totally different universe of meal plans and being sexiled out of my dorm room and not worrying about insurance. I haven\u2019t even gone to college, and he\u2019s probably worried about buying matching furniture and starting a 401K. He\u2019s spending his Saturday night paying bills! Holy boring.</p><p>\u201cParker? Parker?\u201d Corndog shakes my knee. I jerk my head. He\u2019s been trying to get my attention from the front seat apparently.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d Corndog asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about matching furniture?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t your mom\u2019s furniture match?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, then thinks for a long moment, drumming his fingers on his thighs. \u201cI was thinking about what toppings I should get on my Monster burger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m not getting tomatoes this time. They make the bread soggy. But I love tomatoes, so maybe I\u2019ll ask them to put some on the side for me? And I like pickles, but I don\u2019t like them mixed with mustard, so I\u2019ll probably ask for those on the side too.\u201d</p><p>I tsk tsk. \u201cPicky, picky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting on your Monster burger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat that. It has tons of calories and carbs.\u201d</p><p>He flicks the back of my hand. \u201cC\u2019mon. You can afford to cut loose a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was going to get toppings, I\u2019d get mayo and lettuce. I agree with you about the tomatoes. I think they take away from the taste of the burger. I like dipping my fries in mayo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre y\u2019all gonna ignore me the whole night?\u201d Drew asks from behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeaaaah,\u201d I reply. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re obviously all dressed to impress somebody.\u201d I point at his skinny jeans. He\u2019s been wearing them a lot lately.</p><p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d Corndog mutters.</p><p>\u201cShut up, man,\u201d Drew replies. He fixes his hair with one hand.</p><p>At Jiffy Burger, aka Monk\u2019s (per Corndog\u2019s instructions, when we are inside JB we have to call it Monk\u2019s like on Seinfeld. Boys are ridiculous.), the guys get in line while I stake out our usual booth by the fingerprint-covered window.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to eat, Parker?\u201d Corndog calls out.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I reply, and he gives me a look. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll take a Diet Coke.\u201d He grins and holds my gaze for a few seconds. Then my phone buzzes.</p><p>Brian\u2019s text reads: What are u doing?</p><p>Out at JB w/ guys.</p><p>Corndog?</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019s here</p><p>Jealous?</p><p>He\u2019s a friend</p><p>Good to know</p><p>Don\u2019t go all stalker on me LOL :)</p><p>:) Can we talk?</p><p>Later\u2014I\u2019m out w/ friends</p><p>I slide my phone shut and put the ringer on silent. I\u2019m still processing what happened this afternoon. I made out with a twenty-three-year-old guy! He kissed me and ran! He\u2019s acting all jealous. All in one day! Normally, I\u2019d just say to heck with him, but boy can he kiss. He makes my body crackle like a firework. We connect. And I like him. I really like him. My heart surges and I grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d</p><p>I look up to find Tate standing there...with Aaron and Laura, fused at the hip. It\u2019s not like I was into Aaron, but I hate that Laura\u2019s here flaunting that she could get what I once had.</p><p>Seeing them together and being here with Corndog reminds me of the eighth grade homecoming dance. Laura and I went together. Corndog was pretty dorky back then\u2014always pushing his glasses up on his nose, always hiking his jeans up because he was skinny. But I was a nice Christian girl, and when he asked me to be biology partners, I said okay. We\u2019ll make a good grade together, I thought. At the dance, he was there hanging out with Drew, but Drew had plenty of girls to dance with, while Corndog stuck to sitting on a radiator on the side of the cafeteria. When Laura went to the bathroom, I leaned against the radiator and talked to Corndog about our science fair project. We wanted to know if different kinds of water affect the growth of plants, and so far my rainwater was making our dandelions grow faster than his Little Duck River water. We laughed about that, and he looked me in the eyes and asked me to dance.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I replied, and in the middle of the cafeteria, under dimmed lights, he set his trembling hands on my waist and I smiled up at him.</p><p>I remember JJ walking by, smacking his butt, and saying, \u201cCorndog, you dog, you. Good for you, man.\u201d</p><p>Corndog blushed, and smiled, and said to me, \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo biggie.\u201d</p><p>His hands kept shaking. \u201cJJ said that \u2019cause you look really pretty tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, grinning. The song ended, and Corndog wiped his palms on his jeans and rocked from foot to foot, and that\u2019s when Laura stormed up and asked him to dance. He glanced at me, but said yes to her, and by the end of the dance, Laura had a major crush on Corndog. But he didn\u2019t want to date her. Frankly, he seemed scared, shuffling away any time she came near.</p><p>Laura said it was my fault he didn\u2019t like her, and that if I was a good friend, I\u2019d hate him along with her. After that, I kept away from him, for Laura\u2019s sake. I could never hate somebody, but we never partnered on projects again. We battled it out over grades. And now here we are tonight, together at Jiffy Burger.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d I ask, fidgeting in my seat.</p><p>\u201cEating Monster burgers, obviously,\u201d Tate says with a grin. He holds up a brown sack.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who your friend is,\u201d Drew says, sliding past Tate into the seat across from me. He pops a fry in his mouth and speaks as he chews. \u201cBut I like him. Any friend of the Monster burger is a friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>Tate raises his eyebrows at Drew and smiles.</p><p>Corndog slips into the booth next to me and starts pulling burgers and cartons of fries out of the greasy paper sack. Holy calories. My stomach grumbles.</p><p>Aaron throws Corndog the same look Brother John wears anytime someone mentions Satan. \u201cIs this guy why you never answered my calls?\u201d Aaron turns his glare to me.</p><p>Laura grasps his elbow, looking horrified. Her eyes dart back and forth between Aaron and Corndog.</p><p>\u201cThis is my friend, Corndog,\u201d I say to Aaron and Tate. I introduce everyone, and Corndog shifts in the seat next to mine, glancing from me to Aaron.</p><p>Drew asks, \u201cDo y\u2019all want to join us?\u201d</p><p>Tate replies, \u201cI\u2019d love to, but we already bought tickets to see Fat Momma\u2019s House 6...See you at church tomorrow?\u201d He\u2019s speaking to me, but his eyes shift back to Drew.</p><p>\u201cSee ya then,\u201d I say with a wave, and they head for the exit. Laura slips an arm around Aaron\u2019s waist, but he edges away. Tate points at them and then looks back at me and laughs, rolling his eyes. She\u2019s never been very nice to Tate either. One time he attached a peace sign charm to his shoelace, and she went on and on about how the peace sign is a common devil worshipping sign. Hell, I bet the JB emblem is a devil worshipping sign. Thou shalt not eat Monster burgers!</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cI know those guys from church.\u201d</p><p>After a long silence, Corndog unwraps a burger, then slides it in front of me. I stare down at the burger. Lift the bun. It has mayo and lettuce only. Just how I would\u2019ve asked for it. Then he gives me a carton of fries with a little cup of mayo for dipping.</p><p>\u201cEat up,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I kind of want to cry.</p><p>He grins. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>I bite into my burger and wipe the juice from my lips. Chew. Right then, being here with these two guys, everything is perfect.</p><p>That\u2019s when Drew decides to tell the truth.</p><p>37 days until i turn 18</p><p>Drew finishes swallowing a fry, takes a deep breath, then looks up at me. \u201cIs your friend Tate dating anybody?\u201d</p><p>I suck air in. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He hasn\u2019t mentioned anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Corndog asks, crinkling his forehead.</p><p>Drew suddenly buries his eyes in the heels of his hands. I meet Corndog\u2019s face as recognition sets in for him. Corndog grabs my fingers under the table and squeezes hard.</p><p>What do I say?!</p><p>I don\u2019t want Drew to think I\u2019m judging him. I don\u2019t know why, but I know how to play this.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. Tate\u2019s gay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Drew pokes his face out from behind his hands. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea.\u201d I eat a fry and talk as I chew. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can just tell.\u201d</p><p>Corndog smoothes his hair and glances at me sideways. I let go of his fingers and reach across the table and take Drew\u2019s hand in mine, to show I love him. His eyes find mine, and I can tell he knows I knew.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Corndog asks.</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d With his free hand he stuffs fries in his mouth. That\u2019s when Corndog reaches across the table and puts his hand on top of ours.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you said something,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cIs this staying a secret?\u201d Corndog asks. \u201cOr are you going to tell other people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he croaks. His breathing quickens. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure...I mean, I like girls too. Sometimes, I mean. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Corndog says. \u201cLet us know if we can do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you guys huddling in Jiffy Burger?\u201d Sam calls out, striding up to our table.</p> <p>Drew quickly wiggles his hand out from under ours and takes a big bite of his burger, getting ketchup and mustard on his chin. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and burps. Nice front. I guess this is staying a secret for now. What a relief.</p><p>\u201cYou pig,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t choke on your Monster burger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone say Monster burger?\u201d JJ says from behind Sam.</p><p>\u201cNasty,\u201d Joe Carter says.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jordan tonight?\u201d I ask Sam.</p><p>\u201cShe kicked me out,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s with Carrie and Marie at some party. We\u2019re going to crash it in a few. Y\u2019all want to come?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d Drew says, dusting salt off his hands.</p><p>After I watch the guys eat, like fifty thousand Monster burgers, we drive to Kristen Markum\u2019s house, where lots of people are crowded in the dark living room, dancing to rap music and sipping beer. She\u2019s a nasty piece of work and lots of people dislike her, but hey, a party\u2019s a party, I guess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Sam yells and hurtles himself into the mix.</p><p>\u201cWoo!\u201d Drew hollers, following him into the throng of girls huddled near a beer pong table. I watch as he takes a shot directly out of a Smirnoff bottle and wipes his mouth, then does another shot. He passes the bottle to Sam, who takes a swig.</p><p>JJ and Carter meet up with their girlfriends, leaving me alone with Corndog. He slips a hand onto my lower back.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d He seems deep in thought and looks around the room. His hand doesn\u2019t leave my back. It makes me feel safe.</p> <p>Laura doesn\u2019t come to parties\u2014she\u2019s a Christian, after all\u2014so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that she\u2019s not here with Aaron and Tate, but Allie is here, checking me out. Hypocrite. Some guy has his arms around her and she\u2019s grinding her butt against him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d I hear Drew yell. Some laughing sophomores\u2014very popular sophomores\u2014are backing him into a corner. One girl whips out a roll of duct tape. Another shoves him against the wall and French kisses him. \u201cI\u2019m the star of the football and baseball teams\u2014you can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis oughta be good,\u201d Corndog says, crossing his arms and smiling. The warm spot on my back where his hand had been goes cool.</p><p>A minute later, the girls have gotten JJ to lift Drew off the ground, and they duct tape his wrists and ankles to the wall. He\u2019s hanging there like a fly stuck in honey.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know that was possible,\u201d I say, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to find someplace quiet?\u201d Corndog asks over the music. \u201cTo talk?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt comfortable at parties. \u201cCan we leave?\u201d</p><p>He grins, and we go tell Drew we\u2019re taking off. He\u2019s still hanging on the wall.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll head home,\u201d I say, faking a yawn.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Corndog says, touching my back again. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she gets home, okay?\u201d he says to Drew, who looks from me to Corndog. Sadness washes over his face.</p><p>I get up on tiptoes and give Drew a hug\u2014well, the best hug I can considering he\u2019s totally spread eagle.</p><p>\u201cTake care of him,\u201d I tell Sam, who\u2019s standing nearby with Jordan, nuzzling her neck. She\u2019s smiling at Sam sideways.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he replies. I can trust him to peel Drew off the wall and get him home safely.</p><p>Then Corndog and I take off walking down the highway, passing the Franklin Public Library and Rose Jewelers.</p><p>\u201cWell this was a stupid idea,\u201d I say, once I realize it\u2019s freezing outside. Must be in the fifties.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d offer you my coat, but I don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could offer me your shirt.\u201d I laugh, pointing at his long-sleeved tee.</p><p>\u201cBut then we\u2019d look like total white trash. Me walking down the street all bare-chested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still be your friend, even if you look like white trash.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and stuffs his hands in his pockets. \u201cThanks, that means a lot. I think.\u201d He pauses as a semi races past us, kicking up dust and gravel. He shields me from most of the debris. The dust makes me cough, and he pats my back. We continue on down the highway, and every time a car gets near us, I yell, \u201cAhhh, Corndog, save me!\u201d and bury my face in his shoulder so I don\u2019t get a mouthful of rocks.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you call me Will?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. You\u2019ve always been Corndog. My archrival.\u201d</p><p>He focuses on the pavement. \u201cNot anymore. You won valedictorian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still thinking of me as your archrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Princess Peach, and you\u2019re Bowser,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an ugly dinosaur-dragon dude who kidnaps women for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than being a plumber like Mario. At least Bowser has all those castles. He\u2019s rich!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s all about money for you?\u201d</p><p>Right there on the side of the road, I do a little line dance. \u201cAny man of mine\u2019s gotta give me lots of presents.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me into a waltz. \u201cOh yeah? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNail polish? iTunes gift certificates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy doesn\u2019t have to be rich to manage that. I can definitely afford to buy nail polish.\u201d Will twirls me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell all the guys you\u2019re gonna buy me nail polish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d he blurts. We laugh so hard, dancing stupidly in a circle.</p><p>We mosey past Advanced Auto Parts. Will says, \u201cCrazy what happened with Drew. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling. I\u2019m surprised he finally told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Will supported Drew tonight when he told us his secret, so I decide to tell the truth, even though it makes me feel a bit like I\u2019m standing on a cliff with a strong wind at my back. \u201cBecause of everything with my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d</p><p>I pause. \u201cYou don\u2019t know about my mom?\u201d</p><p>His face is blank. \u201cNope. Your parents are divorced, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember what happened last year? You don\u2019t remember all those rumors that Laura spread around?\u201d</p><p>He musses his hair, looking confused. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>He never knew about my mom? He and Drew never discussed it? If he doesn\u2019t know, who else doesn\u2019t know? That means Will doesn\u2019t understand why I fool around with so many guys, that I want to show people I\u2019m not like my mother. He probably thinks I\u2019m just a slut. That day at baseball practice, he told me that I keep screwing with his friends. My reputation must be complete shit. And all for nothing.</p><p>This isn\u2019t what I want for myself. I want a normal life, a life where I won\u2019t be afraid of people letting me down. I squat by the side of the road and cover my face, letting a few tears trickle out. Will kneels next to me and rests his hands on my knees.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Parker?\u201d</p><p>The story tumbles out. What happened with Mom and Dad. What happened with Laura. Why I quit softball. I squeeze Corndog\u2019s hand, wanting him to pull me out of the wind.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks...Listen, I\u2019m so sorry about what happened with Laura and softball and school, but your parents still love you, right?\u201d</p><p>I wipe my nose with the heel of my hand and sniffle. \u201cUm, I hardly ever talk to Mom. And Dad is like a zombie who thinks prayer solves everything. And my brother is all messed up on drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she messed everything up,\u201d I whisper. \u201cShe caused my church to turn on me.\u201d I give him a rundown of what happened.</p><p>\u201cYour church turning on you doesn\u2019t sound very Christian-like to me,\u201d he says, rubbing the side of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI know...Church used to be so important to me...and after that, I didn\u2019t know who I was anymore.\u201d</p><p>A semi roars by, so I shut my eyes to shield them from dust. Will runs a hand over my head and then lifts my chin. \u201cYou\u2019re a great girl.\u201d He pulls me to my feet. \u201cI\u2019m sure your mom feels terrible about what happened. Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>I pause, listening to the sound of cars rushing by. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been so worried about myself and Dad and Drew and Ryan that I haven\u2019t even considered Mom\u2019s feelings. I\u2019m a hypocrite. I worried about how Drew would feel, if he came out, but never thought about how it affected Mom. Does she feel bad for leaving Dad? Does she feel guilty?</p><p>Does she feel alone?</p><p>Does she hurt because she lost her family too? Because we left her like she left us? I was ready and willing to support Drew, but not my own mother. The memory of the day I found her cooking a roast while crying screams in my mind.</p><p>Tears trickle down my face, and Will wipes them away with his shirt sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m so mad at God. For doing this to my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you said,\u201d Will whispers. \u201cShitty stuff happens sometimes. I\u2019m angry at God right now too, because of Bo.\u201d</p><p>We start trudging down the highway again, soon turning onto my street behind the KFC.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should come to my church sometime,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWestwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be up for that.\u201d I\u2019m enjoying walking with him. Going slowly gives me time to think.</p><p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow?\u201d he asks softly, as we approach my house. The porch light splashes onto the grass and sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do about your mom?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and yawn. \u201cI can\u2019t think anymore tonight.\u201d I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019d say if I were to call Mom. I\u2019m too embarrassed. Too ashamed. Too hurt. I can\u2019t sort it out in my mind.</p><p>He drags a hand through his hair and studies my face. \u201cThanks for telling me that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can pour your heart out to me next time,\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will tomorrow after church.\u201d He laughs. \u201cWe can watch another chick flick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Part of me wonders if Brian will want to hang out tomorrow, while another part of me wants to spend time with Will.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my hand before hopping off the porch. \u201cI\u2019m picking the movie this time, though.\u201d</p><p>Before doing anything, I send Drew a text: Are you off the wall?</p> <p>Barely.</p><p>Drunk?</p><p>I drank sooo much. Will be sick for days. :(</p><p>:( Thx for telling me about u. Love u.</p><p>Love u too. Nice time w/Corndog?</p> <p>Very nice. Good friend.</p><p>Only a friend?</p><p>Yeah...</p><p>I like him</p><p>Oh no, I think. Drew must be way drunk. I text back: You like like Corndog?</p><p>For a long time. Pls don\u2019t tell him! I just wanted to tell somebody!</p> <p>I won\u2019t tell. No worries.</p><p>Thx. Love u.</p><p>I slide my phone shut. Stare at it. Drew likes Will. After Drew broke up with Amy, he told Will he was interested in someone else. Shit.</p><p>I wash and moisturize my face and brush my teeth. All the while thinking of Will and how fun tonight was, and how now that I know how Drew feels, I\u2019m like a balloon that\u2019s been popped and the air is rushing out, leaving nothing but confusion.</p><p>Once I\u2019m in bed, I think of Brian. He said he wanted to talk, so I take a deep breath and call him. He picks up on the first ring. \u201cHey.\u201d He sounds tired and relieved. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine...so this afternoon...\u201d I curl up under my covers while waiting for his response.</p><p>\u201cIt was...nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get that. We\u2019ll keep it a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so young...\u201d He pauses for a long moment. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep away from you. My job\u2019s on the line. My future. I could get in a hell of a lot of trouble for what happened today, Parker. Have you thought of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorta...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sorta? You have to take responsibility for stuff as an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were living for today or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying. But I\u2019d rather live for today and not lose my job for kissing a student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to be a student for another couple of months, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cThis is hard for me right now, okay? My mind\u2019s messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause of baseball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I thought I\u2019d make it to the big leagues and now I\u2019m stuck\u2014\u201d He stops.</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to, but I need time to figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to figure out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you, okay? I like you. But I don\u2019t know how to deal. I don\u2019t really want to sneak around. I\u2019m not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says we have to sneak around? Give it a month and it\u2019ll be legal. I\u2019ll be eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d</p><p>Today\u2019s kisses seemed right to me.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He exhales deeply. Hesitates. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>I glance at my watch. 11:30 p.m. Dad is definitely asleep. Ryan probably passed out listening to his strange trance music.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d I say.</p><p>He says he\u2019ll meet me at the laundromat across the road in twenty minutes. Perfect! Gives me time to take a quick shower. After doing my powder and lip gloss, I slip on black underwear, velvet sweatpants, and a matching hoodie. Then I click the front door shut and dart across the street, shivering under the streetlights. I\u2019m glad Ryan\u2019s window faces the backyard.</p><p>The laundromat is closed, so Brian\u2019s truck is the only vehicle in sight, tucked behind the Dumpsters. Away from the streetlights. He smiles through the window and waves, his eyes darting around. I open the door to his truck, slide across the bench and kiss him before he can stop me. He tastes like mint toothpaste. My hands are on his neck and his are in my hair, and I can tell he\u2019s experienced. He\u2019s probably had sex.</p><p>He pushes me backward and climbs on top, his weight heavy, yet comforting.</p><p>This is way different than with other guys.</p><p>Every Halloween, my church puts on a morality play, usually where the teenage characters get sloppily drunk and don\u2019t treat their bodies like temples, or have sex before marriage, and end up going to Hell. People who come to watch the play walk through a room made to look and feel like Hell. A Judgment House. We crank up the heat to 100 degrees. Red Christmas lights act as burning embers in the bowels of Hell. A soundtrack featuring a weird demon-devil creature cackling plays in the darkness. Sure, people made fun of the depiction of Hell, but it always scares me because I know the real Hell must be a million times worse.</p><p>God, is my family going to end up there? Because we\u2019re sinners?</p><p>Written before church on February 28. Burned, using a match.</p><p>I whip open the front door to find Will, here to collect me for church.</p><p>\u201cHey, come on in,\u201d I say, grinning.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He\u2019s wearing khakis, a blue shirt and tie, and loafers. He rubs his palms together.</p><p>\u201cLet me just get my bag.\u201d I skip to the bathroom and check my lip gloss and powder one more time before grabbing my purse from my bed. Instead of leather boots, I slip my feet into heels. When I go back to the foyer, Dad\u2019s standing there pinching his bottom lip. I picked up that habit from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to another church?\u201d Dad asks, furrowing his brow.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is that okay?\u201d I ask, pulling a jacket on over my simple pink dress.</p><p>Dad sets a hand on Will\u2019s shoulder and studies his face. \u201cWhat church do you go to, Corn Fritter?\u201d</p><p>I crack up. \u201cIt\u2019s Corndog!\u201d</p><p>Will covers a laugh with his fist. \u201cI go to Westwood, sir.\u201d</p><p>Dad turns his attention back to me. \u201cI, uh, is there something wrong with our church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to spend time with my friend.\u201d</p><p>Will beams at that, but I shrug, acting like going to another church is no big deal, even though it kinda is. I\u2019ve never been anywhere but Forrest Sanctuary.</p><p>Dad takes longer than an inning to come up with a response. \u201cThis is a one-time thing, right? You\u2019ll be back at our church for WNYG and services next Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I say, then I\u2019m pulling Will out the front door by his wrist. We climb into his truck, and he whistles.</p><p>\u201cYou sure got a strong grip.\u201d He rubs his wrist, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a ball bat.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m out of shape.\u201d</p><p>Will inserts his key into the ignition and turns it; the diesel engine rumbles to a start. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to bat or throw a ball around with you anytime,\u201d he says, pulling onto the highway. A milk truck passes us.</p><p>We ride to Westwood in a comfortable silence filled only by the soft crooning of Rascal Flatts. He has a picture of Bo and two other boys tucked against the glass above his odometer. Must be his brothers. We grin at each other.</p><p>\u201cI wish we hadn\u2019t competed all through school,\u201d I say. \u201cI wish we had been friends before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He focuses on the road.</p><p>We pull into the church parking lot, and even though it\u2019s February and freezing, people our age are either playing a game of pick-up basketball or cheering the players on. Will is out of the car and jogging toward the guys before my seatbelt is unbuckled.</p><p>He jets to center court, steals the ball from some guy, and shoots, nailing two points. It makes me smile, but I\u2019m also kinda pissed he abandoned me in the car. But before I flip out, he\u2019s jogging back over, his brown hair flopping across his forehead. He whips open my door and helps me step out, then leads me over to the courts. Only about twelve kids are here\u2014a lot fewer than at Forrest Sanctuary. I recognize two people: Asshole Paul Briggs the catcher, and Jenna\u2014a sophomore who plays center field for the softball team. She\u2019s killer at bat. She gives me a little wave.</p><p>\u201cGo say hi,\u201d Will tells me. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you around after I play some ball.\u201d He runs off to steal the basketball again.</p><p>I take a deep breath and go see Jenna.</p><p>\u201cLove your dress,\u201d she says, scanning me.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I reply. She\u2019s wearing a cute gray dress. It looks vintage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here with Will?\u201d she asks, bouncing a little.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never brought a girl to church before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Jenna nods, and proceeds to talk my ear off about softball and her crush on some sophomore named Tim Keller who I\u2019ve never heard of, and she starts quizzing me about Will and who he\u2019s dating. I shrug and watch as Will dodges Paul to bank a layup off the backboard. The ball swooshes through the net.</p><p>I clap and go, \u201cWooo!\u201d</p><p>Will tosses the ball to some guy and heads toward me with a blazing smile on his face. \u201cSorry. Couldn\u2019t help but show off a bit. Want to come inside and meet my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure.\u201d I tell Jenna it was nice talking to her, then follow Will inside what must be their Fellowship Hall. Will holds my elbow as we stride up to a beautiful woman drinking coffee while playing with her necklace, a chain holding a single pearl. She\u2019s in her forties and has very structured brown hair, like she\u2019s in a Lands\u2019 End catalog or something. When he touches her shoulder, the woman stops talking and turns.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Parker,\u201d she says, sticking out a manicured hand. Her nails are a deep maroon.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I reply. She checks out my nails too. Today I wore Blushingham Palace, a soft pink to match my dress. She releases my hand, then looks back up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Whitfield.\u201d Ah. A true Southern belle. Those kind of women at my church give me total stink eye.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, ma\u2019am,\u201d I say, giving her a nervous smile.</p><p>\u201cYou too, dear.\u201d She sips her coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to meet the girl who\u2019s smarter than my Wills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Will whines. \u201cWould you stop calling me Wills? It makes me sound like I\u2019m royalty or something.\u201d</p><p>She sticks out her pinky finger and waves her Styrofoam cup in an aristocratic manner. \u201cWell you are my little prince.\u201d</p><p>His eyes bulge and his mouth falls open. \u201cMom. Stop.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and wraps an arm around his waist. \u201cHush. You know I\u2019ve been wanting you to bring around a respectable girl.\u201d</p><p>My face heats up, and I can\u2019t help but grin. Respectable. This is new and different. If the women at my church could keep their sons on a different continent than me, they would.</p><p>Will goes to get me some water and leaves me to chat with his mother, who\u2019s thrilled to hear I\u2019m planning on going to Vanderbilt. He comes back carrying bottled water for me in one hand and Bo in the other arm.</p><p>\u201cYou remember my brother, Bo,\u201d Will says, looking at him proudly. Will squeezes Bo\u2019s knee, and I\u2019m overcome by how jealous I am of that love. \u201cCan you say hi to Parker?\u201d</p><p>Bo buries his face in Will\u2019s shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Bo,\u201d I say. \u201cYou love baseball, right?\u201d</p><p>He peeks up and nods, and Mrs. Whitfield raises her eyebrows at Will.</p><p>Later, Will introduces me around. I say hi to Marie Baird from school, and she says she\u2019s glad I came to church today. And then Will\u2019s youth pastor, this huge guy named Lance, shakes my hand like a rattle.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Westwood,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s Game Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGame Sunday?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWe clear the tables out of this room and the youth play games. Today we\u2019re gonna play Freeze Tag and Red Rover for sure.\u201d Lance shuffles off.</p><p>\u201cFreeze Tag is a terrible idea,\u201d Will murmurs to me.</p><p>\u201cDoes he not notice that y\u2019all aren\u2019t five anymore?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cLance is the king of terrible ideas.\u201d</p> <p>Lance begins moving furniture as the adults and younger children clear out of the room. Soon it\u2019s only people our age. Jenna is flirting with some boy while Paul keeps touching Marie and she keeps batting him away.</p><p>Loud Christian rock music tumbles out of the speakers. The drums make the windows vibrate. Funny. Brother John once told us that \u201cheavy drum music makes teenagers act in sinful ways,\u201d so we shouldn\u2019t listen to it.</p><p>Will takes the water out of my hand and sets it on a window sill as Lance yells, \u201cTag, you\u2019re it!\u201d and slaps a younger boy\u2019s arm. All the girls kick their heels off, so I do too. We start running, slipping on the linoleum floor, and I\u2019m laughing like crazy. The boy tries to tag me, but I sidestep him and speed across the room.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Will calls out to me.</p><p>The boy takes off after Jenna and tags her. To unfreeze her, Paul tries to crawl through her legs and she\u2019s hollering \u201cGross! Stop! Stop!\u201d and batting him away.</p><p>\u201cPaul! You\u2019re three times her size!\u201d Lance calls out. He\u2019s trudging around the room at a turtle\u2019s pace.</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d Paul pauses right between her legs, and it\u2019s such a sight I stop running and I\u2019m dying of laughter. Will is too.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can unfreeze her? You\u2019re like ten times the size of me,\u201d Paul says to Lance, who laughs.</p><p>The boy tags me, so I freeze. \u201cWill! Come unfreeze me!\u201d</p><p>He stops, finding my eyes. \u201cMarie, help Parker!\u201d</p><p>Marie comes and crawls through my legs, and I can\u2019t stop laughing. After my third game of Red Rover, I take a breather. Will joins me in sitting on the window sill; our feet bang against the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you unfreeze me?\u201d I ask, giggling.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019m a lot bigger than you,\u201d he says, gesturing at his body. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not a very gentlemanly thing to do. I don\u2019t want to be like Pervy Paul over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right, Will Whitfield.\u201d I smile at him sideways.</p> <p>He blushes, and gestures at his Fellowship Hall. \u201cWhat do you think so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun. But don\u2019t you have Bible Study? Or talk about good Christian behavior and whatnot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sometimes,\u201d he replies, lifting a shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play games every week?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t visit on Don\u2019t Make Bad Life Choices Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Make Bad Life Choices Sunday?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Lance had a doctor come in and show us pictures of what lung cancer and STDs look like under a microscope.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cSounds more effective than telling us we\u2019ll go to Hell if we get trashed or have sex before marriage.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s face wears a look of horror. \u201cIt was very effective. And then the doctor told us about the tests they run to find out if you have an STD.\u201d He swallows.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou definitely do not want to know.\u201d He glances at me, and his face goes even redder. But then he laughs. \u201cPaul was freaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaaaaay too much info, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, if I had to suffer through it, so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you want to watch The Notebook this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>His mom invites me back to his house for Sunday lunch. She made baked chicken with lemon, corn on the cob, and cornbread. We hold hands while Mr. Whitfield says the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Will has two other brothers\u2014Trey is nine and Rory is fourteen. Will and I open our eyes during the prayer, sneaking a quick smile at each other.</p><p>I love eating a home-cooked meal that I didn\u2019t have to make. And after that, Will and I collapse onto a couch in his basement and promptly fall asleep, like last Sunday. Only this time when I wake up, Will\u2019s head is resting on my shoulder and his hand is draped across my thigh.</p><p>A warm breeze rushes through my body, and I feel safe. Safe with him. His hand is on my leg and I find I like it being there.</p><p>What if Drew finds out? What if Brian finds out? How could I hurt Drew like that? How could I hurt Brian, who\u2019s risking everything for me?</p><p>Just goes to show that a trip to a new church won\u2019t automatically make me a good person. I don\u2019t deserve any of this.</p><p>Even if I like Will, and if by some miracle he wants me\u2014which is kinda doubtful, considering how pissed he got that I was fooling around with his friends\u2014I can\u2019t do this to Drew.</p><p>getting serious</p><p>36 days until i turn 18</p><p>No one except Tate calls to find out why I wasn\u2019t at church. Not Aaron, not Brother John, not Laura, not Allie. Will\u2019s right. They aren\u2019t very Christian. Only Tate called\u2014not my cell, but my landline.</p><p>\u201cI found your number in the church directory,\u201d Tate says.</p><p>\u201cHi, Parker!\u201d I hear Rachel yell in the background.</p><p>He says, \u201cI missed you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to church with Will. You know, Corndog? From JB last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seemed nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. We just recently started hanging out.\u201d I tell Tate about how Will and I have been jostling for valedictorian for eons.</p><p>Tate asks, \u201cAre you, um, interested in him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend likes him,\u201d I say, sinking my head into a pillow. If Drew wasn\u2019t interested in him, and I wasn\u2019t messing around with Brian, and if Will and I hadn\u2019t been rivals all through school, would I be thinking way different thoughts about him? Yeah. But some hands don\u2019t always result in a full house. Sometimes you get two of a kind or an ace high. You don\u2019t get a royal straight flush including two happily married parents, a non-drug-using brother, and a big, slobbering dog, with none of your family members being deathly allergic to said dog.</p><p>\u201cSo Aaron\u2019s really with Laura?\u201d I ask. I feel bad for hurting him, but I\u2019m ashamed I kissed a guy who was so willing to try to make me jealous.</p><p>\u201cFor now. He doesn\u2019t like her like he likes you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even get why he likes me.\u201d Why anybody likes me.</p><p>He clucks his tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re your own person. You wear what you want and don\u2019t bother with people who annoy you. Everyone wants to be like that.\u201d</p><p>What? Really? They think I don\u2019t bother with people who annoy me? It was Laura who started those rumors. It was the church ladies who started telling their children to keep away from me, for fear I\u2019d turn out like Mom. Ladies who had once been Mom\u2019s friends.</p><p>But even if they did want to talk to me, would I want to talk to them? It\u2019s best to keep people away. Then I remember how I told Will everything last night. Everything. And he still took me to his church. He introduced me to his family.</p><p>\u201cParker? You there?\u201d Tate says over the phone.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>I pick at a loose thread dangling from my duvet. \u201cDo you like our church?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cNot much. The people are worse than Phillies fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarsh. You like baseball? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about anything when we\u2019re always trying to stop Laura from convincing us to burn our iPods because we listen to Coldplay.\u201d</p><p>I pause. \u201cDrew plays baseball for Hundred Oaks. Second base.\u201d</p><p>Tate exhales. The phone line crackles, as if he\u2019s breathing heavily. \u201cWhy\u2019ve you never mentioned him before? Why\u2019d you never bring him to church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I subject anyone to our church?\u201d I say with a laugh. \u201cAnd like you said, I was too busy trying to stop Laura from burning my iPod to mention friends from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Tate and I never really talked much before Mom left. Was he lonely? Has our church always made him feel uncomfortable with who he is? Is that why he started hanging out with me? Did he think I\u2019d understand? I flip on my TV and start flicking through the channels, waiting for Tate to add something, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I decide to tell a little lie, to get the conversation going again. \u201cDrew said he thought you looked familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe you could look him up on Facebook?\u201d</p><p>I hear crackling again. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis last name\u2019s Bates. Drew Bates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m grinning as we hang up. I lie back on my bed and decide not to repaint my nails.</p><p>Sunday night is Veena Comes Over for Dinner, take two. Dad gave me a warning this time so I can cook something good!</p><p>I\u2019m using Gramma\u2019s hashbrown chicken casserole recipe, but I make it my own by switching out the Corn Flakes for Frosted Flakes. The sugar gives it a kick. I\u2019m making a salad to go with it, so I\u2019ll have something to eat after my small portion of casserole.</p><p>\u201cSmells good,\u201d Ryan says, coming into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He takes a glass from the cabinet and pours himself some water. \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>I rarely make this casserole, because it takes like two hours to put it together. \u201cDad\u2019s friend Veena is coming over.\u201d</p><p>Ryan pauses before sipping.</p><p>\u201cShe was really nice at dinner last week,\u201d I tell him, slicing into a cucumber. \u201cI bet you\u2019ll like her. She\u2019s a nurse over at Murfreesboro Regional.\u201d</p><p>My brother doesn\u2019t answer, but he sits down at the table while I work. It surprises me that he\u2019s willing to keep me company.</p><p>I prepare a plate of cheese and crackers, which I push in front of him, making him smile a little. \u201cBe right back,\u201d he says, disappearing. When he comes back, he\u2019s changed out of a T-shirt and into a navy blue polo shirt. If he\u2019d cut his shaggy hair already, he\u2019d look exactly like he did in high school, when so many girls liked him because he was so cute. I bet if Macy saw him in a polo shirt, she\u2019d probably recite some Nietzsche quote and go on about how third-world children sew them in sweatshops, and then say if Ryan wears one, he\u2019s the harbinger of the apocalypse.</p><p>Then the apocalypse truly happens: Ryan helps set the table.</p><p>When Veena shows up, Dad answers the door. I peek around the wall into the foyer, to see them laughing quietly and chatting as he takes her jacket. Dad leans down and gives her a peck on the lips, which makes me wonder what they did after we went to Crockett\u2019s Roadhouse last week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t stop smiling as we sit down to eat. Dad leads us in the Lord\u2019s Prayer, then we put our napkins in our laps and dig in.</p><p>\u201cThis looks really yummy,\u201d Veena says, forking up some casserole.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a home-cooked meal since I left New York.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs your family there?\u201d Ryan asks, salting his casserole.</p><p>\u201cMy parents, my sister and her husband, and my grandmother. And two nieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a nurse?\u201d Ryan asks her.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d she says, chewing.</p><p>\u201cDid you always know that\u2019s what you wanted to do?\u201d</p> <p>She smiles, thinking. \u201cI wanted to be an astronaut more, but I stink at math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my worst subject too,\u201d Ryan replies. \u201cBut I still want to go to med school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat programs are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanderbilt is one of the best, but I\u2019m not enjoying my undergrad classes there.\u201d</p><p>She nurses her iced tea. \u201cI didn\u2019t like mine either. I hated taking all those politics and English courses. And don\u2019t even get me started on art. But it\u2019s all a means to an end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that,\u201d Ryan says. This is the most I\u2019ve heard my brother speak in forever.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want, we can get together for coffee this week sometime and talk more. Or you can come by the hospital and talk to some of the other doctors about what their undergrad experiences were like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d Ryan replies, tapping his fork on his placemat.</p><p>Dad beams so hard he seems ten years younger.</p><p>It almost feels like a family, but I still wish Mom were here.</p><p>It\u2019s getting serious, yet it\u2019s staying the same. Every night this week I\u2019ve made out with Brian. Ryan and Dad notice nothing, obviously, so it\u2019s no problem for me to sneak out of my room and dart across the street to Brian\u2019s parked truck tucked behind the Dumpsters after eleven.</p><p>On Monday night, we just kissed.</p><p>On Tuesday night, he went up my shirt.</p><p>On Wednesday at school, I stopped by Coach Lynn\u2019s office during study hall. Brian\u2019s squatting there until he gets his own office next year.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Brian asked, slipping a pen behind his ear. He leaned back in his seat and wrapped his hands behind his head, smirking at me.</p><p>I waved a hall pass. \u201cI nicked this from Mrs. Perkins. I wanted to see what you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>He jumped to his feet, closed the door behind me, and locked it. I walked around the office, looking at Coach Lynn\u2019s things: silk roses in a vase, pictures of her family, the cat calendar on the wall.</p><p>\u201cLove what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart ass,\u201d he replied, following me as I weaved around the desk and chairs. I wiped a finger across the desk, pretending to check for dust.</p><p>I knew it was wrong. All of it. Kissing him, and wanting to kiss him again. But when his arms are around me, everything feels good. I feel safe and cared for. And the kissing is very, very okay.</p><p>\u201cSo why did you stop by again?\u201d He scratched the back of his neck and squinted.</p><p>I smiled mischievously. \u201cI was in study hall and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about last night.\u201d</p><p>He closed the blinds. He breathed heavily. He ran a hand through his hair. He loosened his Best Buy Geek Squad tie. Then his lips were on mine and he lifted me onto the desk. He pulled my hips to his and kissed me until I was so dizzy I could barely breathe. Brian began to grind against me and I was so drunk on him, I couldn\u2019t think at all.</p><p>Then someone knocked on the door and Brian rushed to answer it, but stopped for a second to control his breathing. He motioned at me to fix my shirt. I leaped into the chair across from his desk. He opened the door to find Sam, who had dropped by to say he wouldn\u2019t be at practice that day because his mom was sick and his dad was out of town.</p><p>As soon as Sam left, Brian exhaled, mussed his black hair, and grinned. He moved toward me. I was shaking like crazy. He swept me up in his arms and gave me a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cThat was insanely hot,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said with a tiny voice, trembling. Honestly? It was fun, but it filled me with shame. I hope God was looking the other way.</p><p>He went on, \u201cBut it can\u2019t happen again at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Goose bumps popped up on my arms. I shuddered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d He pressed his forehead to mine and squeezed my hips. \u201cYou\u2019d better get back to study hall before I give you detention.\u201d</p><p>Brian tried to joke it off, but I had seen the change on his face. What happened freaked him out too.</p><p>My face must\u2019ve been blazing red, but Sam didn\u2019t say anything when I saw him later in chemistry.</p><p>On Wednesday night, Brian went up my shirt again and unsnapped my bra, and ran his hands over my bare breasts. Him running his calloused fingers over my skin took some getting used to because I couldn\u2019t stop trembling. But when I calmed down, we fell into a rhythm. A rhythm that kept getting faster and faster until our shirts and my bra ended up on the floorboard of the truck. I touched his abs, which I\u2019m fairly certain are made of marble. His teeth sank into my shoulder, making me gasp. I discovered he has a tattoo on his shoulder blade. A symbol, but when I asked what it meant, he refused to tell me, saying it\u2019s private.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your tattoo?\u201d he teased, trying to peek under my waistband. I smacked his chest and we laughed. But I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that tattoo and what it means and why he couldn\u2019t share with me.</p><p>On Thursday night, he kissed my breasts and felt me through my jeans. I wasn\u2019t comfortable enough to touch him yet. But he took my fingers and put my hand there anyway.</p><p>A cold sweat tore over my body.</p><p>Then a cop knocked on the truck window and told us to move it along. I jumped out. Dashed into my house, to my room, panting and freaking out. My bra hung loose around my shoulders, and the top button of my jeans was undone. Brian called me when he got home. The whole thing upset him too.</p><p>But when I asked, \u201cCan we go to your place instead of parking? I don\u2019t want to risk getting caught again,\u201d he replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll find another place to park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we go to your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I live above my parents\u2019 garage. What if they see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have to know I\u2019m seventeen. Just tell them I\u2019m older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might know you from church. I would be embarrassed if they found out about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re embarrassed by me?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Just the situation would embarrass me. You\u2019re a student.\u201d</p><p>Even with my reputation, Will seemed proud of me at his church last Sunday. When he\u2019s lying on top of me, Brian seems pretty damned pleased with me.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re embarrassed by me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed exaggeratedly. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we go someplace else tomorrow night? Like dinner in Nashville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea. We could get in a shitload of trouble. Who knows who might see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut making out in the parking lot across the street from my house is a good idea?\u201d I really wanted to do something other than talk on the phone and make out in his truck. That used to be enough for me with other guys. But I\u2019m starting to want the whole shebang, and the whole shebang should include going someplace...even Foothills Diner.</p><p>At the same time, my friendship with Will keeps getting better and better. Sometimes we walk together between classes, and two times this week he called me after practice.</p><p>Wednesday night, I lay on my bed, listening as he told me a story about how when he was three, he was so smart he figured out how to unlock the gate at his preschool\u2019s playground and he waddled down the street to McDonald\u2019s, where he walked in, clapped his hands and yelled, \u201cHappy Meal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever date?\u201d I asked him quietly. Thinking of Drew, but also thinking of him. Him, and how my feelings for him were ballooning and floating off without my permission.</p><p>\u201cEhhhh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda silly, I guess. I never really felt like I knew who I was, and I was so into beating you at valedictorian, I didn\u2019t want that extra burden, especially considering my parents need help with Bo and the farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I see the guys on the football and baseball teams who have girlfriends, and it\u2019s like...it\u2019s like it\u2019s their whole lives. I guess I want to have my own life first and then meet someone who can be a part of it...but not fill it...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I replied, wiggling my toes at the ceiling. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Why don\u2019t you ever date?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorta seeing your baseball coach...\u201cNever wanted to get close to anyone. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you hook up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but so do you,\u201d I replied, baiting him.</p><p>\u201cOccasionally. But nothing serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean...?\u201d He hasn\u2019t done it yet?</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that until I\u2019m in a real relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a virgin too,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He paused for a long moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Then we went back to discussing the Prom Decisional. But it shocked me to know that Will, a hot eighteen-year-old baseball player and genius, was saving himself. It made me proud that I had saved myself too. Proud that I could tell him that.</p><p>During gym on Friday morning, Brian wouldn\u2019t even look my way as I ran around the track with Will. Whatever, I thought.</p><p>Brian blew his whistle. \u201cI know you can go faster than that, Whitfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up his ass today?\u201d Will asked, not bothering to speed up.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d I replied, even though I knew. Brian doesn\u2019t like seeing me with Will.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to him a lot, right?\u201d</p><p>I nearly stopped running, to freeze right there beside the goal post.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s nice to me,\u201d I said, trying to sound nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t bother you, I hope.\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand. \u201cNo, no. We talk about stats and the Braves and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Will stared over at Brian. Fear rushed through me. Had Sam mentioned finding us in Coach Lynn\u2019s office?</p><p>Back in the locker room, I overheard a couple girls saying that all I do in gym class is stare at Coach Hoffman, so I told myself not to look at him anymore.</p><p>But here I am on Friday night, making out with him in his truck. Dark and midnight. He touches me through my jeans and kisses me hard. The taste of bubble gum fills my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou make me so hot,\u201d he says, pulling my leg to wrap around his waist.</p><p>It all feels so weird. I want it, yet I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m not going to stop because it feels too good.</p><p>\u201cI want to take this further,\u201d he says, gasping, pressing his hardness against my thigh. \u201cBut we need to wait until your birthday. Probably until after you graduate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake this further how?\u201d I reply, nibbling on his ear, making him groan and breathe faster.</p><p>His hand sneaks up my shirt. \u201cYou know, sleep together.\u201d</p><p>Okay, (1) We\u2019ve only been making out for what, a week? (2) I\u2019m a virgin. (3) That\u2019s pretty presumptuous, to think I\u2019d automatically agree to sleep with him. Don\u2019t I get a say in any of this? We barely talk anymore. It\u2019s all kissing and disagreements, and while the kissing is yummy, my heart hurts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready for that,\u201d I whisper, clutching his shirt.</p> <p>He looks in my eyes before closing his. \u201cMost people I know do it on the second or third date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I can\u2019t even imagine that. Some kids at school casually fool around, but I don\u2019t understand how they can get so intimate so quickly. To me, it seems like sex should happen naturally after a long period of dating and love. Not something that automatically happens because it\u2019s the third date. I guess this means Brian\u2019s had sex. Tons of it, probably, but I\u2019m not gonna do the math.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to.\u201d I avoid his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he mumbles before starting to kiss me again. His stubble scratches my chin. \u201cCan we do something else, at least? For now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you...?\u201d He unzips his jeans.</p><p>He wants me to put my mouth on it. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I gasp, ashamed at the thought.</p><p>\u201cCan I touch you?\u201d he whispers, unbuttoning my jeans. He slides them down my legs and stares at my lacy white underwear. I\u2019ve never gone this far with a boy, and the look on his face is so sexy I tug on his jeans, revealing black boxer briefs. He pushes my panties aside, making me moan softly as he works a finger inside me.</p><p>Later I straddle him and he wraps his hands around my waist and we kiss and kiss, only thin cotton separating us. I get so caught up in wanting to know what this feels like with a man that I nearly forget he hasn\u2019t even taken me out on a real date yet.</p><p>\u201cNext week, can we please do something outside of your truck?\u201d I ask, delirious because of what he\u2019s doing to my neck.</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d he pants, slipping his hand back down my underwear.</p> <p>I want to tell him he can\u2019t kiss away these issues, but somehow I doubt he\u2019ll hear me. I push his hand away and sit up, lifting my hips and pulling my jeans back on. The door handle wedges into my back. It\u2019s painful.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep with you in your truck,\u201d I say, licking my lips. They\u2019re chapped from kissing so much.</p><p>He weaves his fingers in my hair and presses his forehead to mine. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do it in my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t let me go to your apartment now. Why will it be different in a month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go to my apartment. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d The windshield is fogged up.</p><p>He glances down at where my pants fasten, then leans back in. \u201cWe could go to a motel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real classy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be a jerk...it\u2019s just I\u2019m so scared about this.\u201d His breath feels hot against my face. His face wears a look of desperation. Like he wants me to follow his lead, no questions asked. \u201cAnd sometimes I get so wrapped up in you and feeling like I\u2019m young again, I forget about how much trouble we\u2019ll be in if anyone finds out.\u201d</p><p>I love that he\u2019s into me, but is he only into me so he\u2019ll \u201cfeel young again\u201d? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s ancient. It\u2019s like the minute we started hooking up, he got scared, and the fear has changed him.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019d take Coach Vixen back to your apartment,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou are Trouble, you know that?\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really into you, Park. I\u2019m not interested in Jenna, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go home.\u201d I start to open the door when Brian reaches out and pulls me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry...We\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019ll figure this out. You won\u2019t listen to a single thing I say.\u201d I try to disentangle myself from his arms, but he holds me tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d He leans his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for bed.\u201d I\u2019m so pissed, I don\u2019t bother with a good night kiss. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d He sighs and drags a hand through his hair, and I climb out and trudge toward my house. Right as I step up to my porch, Drew emerges from the shadows. I gasp.</p><p>\u201cCoach Hoffman? Really?\u201d He looks freaked out. \u201cYou could get in so much trouble. What if your dad finds out? Or the school?\u201d I hear Brian\u2019s truck squeal out of the laundromat parking lot.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You can\u2019t tell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never do that. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nod, closing my eyes. My body\u2019s shaking all over. Did Drew see us hooking up?</p><p>\u201cBut what about Corndog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d I open my eyes to find Drew regarding me warily. Looking at me like he doesn\u2019t even know who I am.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew...\u201d I clasp my hands. How do I tell him that even though Will\u2019s straight and will most likely never be interested in Drew back, I won\u2019t do that to him? I guess that\u2019s all I can say. \u201cI\u2019d never betray you. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d I step closer to him and hug him around the waist, breathing in the comforting smell of lemons and cotton.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cBut are you okay? I thought you just had a crush on him, but you\u2019re with him for real? Coach Hoffman? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop saying \u2018Coach Hoffman? Really?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did this even happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just did.\u201d My voice is tiny. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t deny that he\u2019s hot,\u201d Drew jokes. \u201cBut it\u2019s kinda pervy that he\u2019s into you.\u201d</p><p>I hug him tighter, but I\u2019m wishing I was hugging Will. I feel like I\u2019m gonna barf. \u201cLet\u2019s hang out tomorrow after the game, okay?\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I release Drew and kiss his cheek. He heads toward his trailer down the street and I go to my room. I slide my cell open to find a slew of text messages from Brian and Will.</p><p>Brian\u2019s texts are: Does Bates know? Can he keep a secret?</p><p>Will\u2019s texts are: You busy tomorrow night? I have to babysit. Would love your company.</p><p>I change into pajamas and wash my face, daydreaming about Will coming through my window tonight, to hug me and make me feel safe and special.</p><p>Back in my room, I crawl under the covers and send Brian a text: All\u2019s okay. Good night.</p><p>I send Will a text: I\u2019d like that.</p><p>A calm, cool response that doesn\u2019t betray Drew.</p><p>Even though it betrays my heart.</p><p>the mascot</p><p>30 days until i turn 18</p><p>Do I look different?</p><p>I\u2019m staring at myself in the mirror.</p><p>I let Brian touch me, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. It\u2019s not like I lost my virginity or anything, but I feel like I gave away part of me. I turn sideways and examine my figure, arching my back, making sure I look slim in my jeans and navy blue cotton long-sleeved shirt. Cute for today\u2019s game. But I\u2019m not sure who I\u2019m trying to look cute for. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s Brian anymore, and I shouldn\u2019t want to look pretty for Will. Honestly, I doubt Will would care that my lip gloss is perfect and my nails aren\u2019t chipped.</p><p>I drag a hand through my hair, my fingers shaking. Drew saw me with Brian...and I\u2019m not proud of it. I blow air out, trying to breathe evenly.</p><p>I\u2019m not totally sure why, I guess I got caught up in it\u2014in him, but last night after Brian touched me, I felt him too. He shut his eyes and leaned his head back against the seat while my fingers moved up and down. I could tell by the noises he made that he liked how I made him feel, but it was almost as if I could be anybody. It didn\u2019t matter who I was, it was only that somebody was giving him pleasure.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be just anybody.</p><p>I want to matter, to be loved. I want the real.</p><p>The Hundred Oaks Raiders just beat Winchester, six to five. It was a close call, but Will drove two runs in during the eighth, edging us ahead. I dropped the stats book on the dusty dugout floor and jumped up and down, screaming his name as he rounded first base. He stood on second and took off his batting gloves, grinning over at me.</p><p>I really did miss this game.</p><p>Now we\u2019re packing up our equipment and getting ready to leave.</p><p>A bunch of the guys are horsing around over at the concession stand. Sam asks if he can buy out their pizza supply for the bus ride home.</p><p>\u201cWe only have two pizzas available right now,\u201d the worker replies.</p><p>\u201cHow many slices is that?\u201d Will asks.</p><p>\u201cTwenty or so?\u201d</p><p>Will consults with Sam. \u201cMaybe we should get Coach to take us to Domino\u2019s, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate Domiblows,\u201d Sam replies.</p><p>\u201cHow about Papa John\u2019s?\u201d Will asks.</p><p>\u201cGag me with a spoon,\u201d Sam jokes.</p><p>While they argue, I clear my mind. The sun is blazing. It\u2019s not spring yet, but it feels very close, and I love standing here under the blue sky, thinking about how Mom\u2019s tulips will bloom soon.</p><p>That\u2019s when two guys from Winchester approach me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d one of them says, checking out my chest.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I reply, wishing I had a drink to throw in this guy\u2019s face. I look around. Will and Sam are still arguing about pizza, Drew is texting like there\u2019s no tomorrow, and Brian is chatting with the Winchester coach.</p><p>\u201cWant to hang out?\u201d the Winchester player asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say, stepping backward.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d He gives me a smile that\u2019s actually kind of cute. Too bad he already revealed that he\u2019s a jerk.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Brian coming toward me.</p><p>\u201cFine. Another time,\u201d Winchester guy says, and I\u2019m thinking that\u2019ll be the end of it, but now Will has seen Brian coming to my \u201crescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker?\u201d Will calls. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Sam begins taking his bat out of his bag (oh my God, he\u2019s so ridiculous!) and I\u2019m about to laugh at these guys making a big deal out of nothing. Testosterone is powerful stuff, I chuckle to myself. I love how these guys have become sort of like a family to me.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Paul Briggs shouts at the Winchester players. \u201cShe\u2019s ours. She\u2019s our team mascot!\u201d</p><p>Team mascot! Does that mean what I think it means?</p><p>Will glances at me as my eyebrows furrow. \u201cAll of you on the bus. Now!\u201d</p><p>The team rushes toward the parking lot. The two Winchester guys vanish.</p><p>Will grabs Paul by the jersey and says, \u201cYou owe Parker an apology. And if I ever hear you say something like that again, I\u2019ll make sure Coach benches you. Got it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Paul squeaks out. He must outweigh Will by about a gazillion pounds, but he looks freaked. I\u2019ve never seen Will Whitfield so pissed. Not even when I won valedictorian over him. When Dr. Salter called us into his office, to tell us the results, a sad knowing smile spread over Will\u2019s face. He shook my hand, said congrats, and that was that. Today, fury fills his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Paul mutters to me before escaping to the bus.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do with my hands. I bite on my pinky nail, chipping the polish, and rock on my heels. Brian\u2019s forehead wrinkles as he comes over.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d he whispers.</p> <p>No, I want to say. I feel alone. I thought you were different, but you\u2019re not treating me like an adult. Like someone who matters. You\u2019re treating me like a plaything. And assholes play both softball and baseball.</p><p>My eyes water. \u201cI need to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Brian squeezes my shoulder and nods. I brush his hand away from me and go into the bathroom to find a toxic warzone. Gross. No way I\u2019m using that. I step back out of the bathroom and see Brian and Will in a hushed conversation, so I decide to eavesdrop on them from around the side of the building. I tiptoe over.</p><p>\u201cYou showed great leadership today,\u201d Brian says to Will. \u201cTaking care of Parker like that. You\u2019re a good captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a nice girl. She doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did Paul mean when he called her the team mascot?\u201d</p><p>Will pauses. My heart pounds. \u201cUh, she\u2019s hooked up with a couple of guys on the team.\u201d</p><p>Holy mortification.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Brian asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Will says quietly.</p><p>\u201cBut not anymore, right? It wouldn\u2019t be good for the team if she\u2019s dating a player\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dating anyone,\u201d Will interrupts. \u201cShe told me herself.\u201d</p><p>Brian hesitates before asking, \u201cAre you into her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your coach. I should know if there could be any potential problems down the line.\u201d He\u2019s jealous.</p><p>\u201cNah. She\u2019s not my type. I\u2019m not interested in a girl like her.\u201d</p><p>My heart putters to a stop, and a clammy feeling rushes over me and settles in my stomach, hollowing it out.</p><p>Will Whitfield couldn\u2019t be interested in a girl like me...</p><p>Figures.</p> <p>I turn and sprint back to the bus, my Converses smacking the asphalt. I climb the steps and curl up in my seat. I slip earbuds into my ears, turn on my iPod, and let the Rent soundtrack steal my thoughts. Let it erase the hurt. As if it could. My chest heaves in and out. Someone taps my knee. I open my eyes to find Drew slipping into the seat next to me. I pull my earbud out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I turn to stare out the window, hating myself. \u201cEverything\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><p>Drew invites me over after the game. He makes himself a PB&amp;J. Sitting on a bar stool at the counter, I eat some celery with a bit of peanut butter.</p><p>He raps a knife on the counter like he\u2019s a woodpecker.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so nervous?\u201d I ask, biting into my celery.</p><p>\u201cI, um, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut with it,\u201d I say before swallowing.</p><p>\u201cTate asked me to play mini golf in Nashville tonight.\u201d</p><p>I squeal. \u201cReally? Did you say yes?\u201d</p><p>Drew bites into his sandwich and chews. He takes another bite, and my grin fades as I wait. I dip my celery into the peanut butter.</p><p>\u201cYou just double dipped your celery into my peanut butter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop evading the question,\u201d I reply, chewing and double dipping again.</p><p>\u201cI said yes,\u201d Drew says quietly. He studies his socks. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not Corndog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. So you and Tate have been talking...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly messaging on Facebook.\u201d He takes another bite of PB&amp;J. \u201cIt\u2019s good...it\u2019s good to know someone like me. It\u2019s good to have a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d I can barely sit still I\u2019m so happy for him. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re interested in anything more with him?\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s face goes all distorted. \u201cWhy are you so interested in what I think of Tate? Is it because of Corndog? Because if I don\u2019t like him, you can?\u201d</p><p>My chest hurts. My face flushes. \u201cDrew...please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmurs, opening the fridge and grabbing the milk to pour himself a glass.</p><p>I set my celery on my plate and try to ignore the guilt rushing through me. I vow not to tell Drew about baby-sitting with Will tonight, because he\u2019ll never believe it\u2019s a just-friends thing.</p><p>I can have a secret relationship that takes place in a Ford F150 with a guy who\u2019s six years older than me, or I can admit my feelings for Will, a boy who\u2019s not interested in a girl like me, and lose my best friend in the process.</p><p>Or I can be same ole, same ole.</p><p>I take a bite of celery sans peanut butter.</p><p>Will opens the front door, and the edges of his mouth slide into a grin. Those blue eyes drop to mine, and he invites me inside the farmhouse that\u2019s been in the Whitfield family for something like five generations. \u201cBo\u2019s finishing dinner,\u201d he says, taking my jacket to hang it in the closet. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>I wave a hand. \u201cI\u2019m good. Where are your other brothers?\u201d</p><p>Will leans against the doorframe. \u201cRory went to a movie, and Trey\u2019s at a friend\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s just me, you, and Bo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Come on.\u201d He grabs my hand and leads me to the kitchen, where Bo\u2019s playing with his food, dipping chicken nuggets into applesauce.</p><p>He scrambles out of his chair and into my arms. I bury my face in his neck, taking in his smell of crayons and juice. Will grins to himself and starts cleaning up Bo\u2019s dishes.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bo,\u201d he says. \u201cWant to show Parker your birthday party stuff?\u201d</p><p>I act surprised. \u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday?\u201d</p><p>Bo looks to Will for help.</p><p>\u201cYou turn five on April Fool\u2019s Day, right?\u201d Will says, and his little brother nods. \u201cWhen Mom called Dad to say she was in labor, he thought she was kidding and was way late to the hospital. I stayed in the delivery room until he rushed in at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d I reply, smiling, even though I\u2019m kinda envious of his family.</p><p>\u201cMy birthday\u2019s on April fifth,\u201d I tell Bo. \u201cOur birthdays are in the same week.\u201d</p><p>I leave Will washing dishes and follow Bo to his room, where it looks like his mom has been working on invitations. \u201cYou\u2019re having a baseball and dinosaur themed party?\u201d He nods, and shows me dinosaur streamers and baseball party favors. Cute.</p><p>Bo plops down on the rug to play with Matchbox cars, so I kneel with him and drive a yellow racecar up onto his bed and back to the rug and then up my legs and arms. His mouth forms an O as he watches me.</p><p>Will appears in the doorway. \u201cHow about a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want to do?\u201d I ask Bo, who nods. He sure does a lot of nodding. I read online that people with Asperger\u2019s usually have repetitive quirks.</p><p>Will brings apple slices and cheese, and I carry Bo down the steps to the basement and soon we\u2019re watching School of Rock, \u2019cause Bo loves the music. He likes to say \u201cgee-tar\u201d over and over.</p><p>Will sits on the cushion right next to me, and Bo wedges himself between us, and after eating his cheese and apple, he promptly falls asleep against Will\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s adorable,\u201d I say, gently mussing Bo\u2019s brown curls.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Will replies, focusing on the screen. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Bo lets out little snores. \u201cI can see why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the only people he\u2019s ever spoken to.\u201d</p><p>I touch Bo\u2019s tiny hand and study his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad are pleased he likes you.\u201d Will glances my way. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got you and you\u2019re great. That\u2019s gotta count for a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty great yourself,\u201d he murmurs, but I pretend not to hear. This afternoon, he told Brian I\u2019m not his type. Would he lie about that? He doesn\u2019t know about me and Brian. Could Drew have mentioned something about me and Brian, to keep Will away from me?</p><p>No. No way Drew would do that. I want to ask Will what he\u2019s thinking, but I can\u2019t betray Drew. So we sit here with only a little boy separating us. My life is a twisted pretzel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Vanderbilt, right?\u201d Will asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He chews on a thumb. \u201cRemember how you said on the way to church, how you wished we had been friends before now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did understand why you started ignoring me. I mean, I\u2019m a dork and you\u2019re beautiful but you were always so nice\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a dork.\u201d I take in his blue eyes. \u201cI stopped talking to you because of Laura. She liked you, and I didn\u2019t want to get in the way of that.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201cNaw, I know she didn\u2019t like me. Not really.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he\u2019s observant. \u201cWhat school are you going to?\u201d I ask, changing the subject. \u201cHarvard, right?\u201d</p><p>He kisses Bo\u2019s head. \u201cMy great-grandparents started a trust fund for me, before they died, but I\u2019m giving the money to my dad for Bo. So he can go to therapy and a special school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Can your parents, um, not affo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have been hard on the farm lately. Gas and water prices are up and sales have been down...It was a hard winter. I\u2019m going to college somewhere nearby where I can get a full ride instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right, Will Whitfield.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when he slides an arm across my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been giving Vandy serious thought. I\u2019d be close to the farm and my parents and Bo...and you\u2019d be there too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say before thinking, glancing at his face, which is focused on me. Holy seriousness. He must\u2019ve told Brian he\u2019s not interested in a girl like me because he doesn\u2019t want me to have to stop being manager. \u201cIt would be nice having a good friend on campus,\u201d I add quickly.</p><p>Will\u2019s hand is warm on my shoulder. He rubs the side of my neck with his thumb, and it feels so good I shut my eyes and concentrate on not making a sound. And then I\u2019m thinking about how he\u2019s a virgin and how I\u2019d love to learn what making love feels like with him, as friends, as partners, with someone who listens to me and cares. We\u2019d do it in our own time.</p><p>As soon as the movie ends, I make my excuses and ride my bike home, where I\u2019m alone except for text messages from Brian asking where I am and if he can come over.</p><p>The irony. I finally found a boy, Will, a boy I\u2019m willing to risk everything on, to risk breaking my heart, but I stay still. Unmoving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dad studied architecture at UT Knoxville, where Mom played softball.</p><p>When he was a boy, he loved poring over floor plans in house catalogs. He still loves reading those magazines today. He wanted to design homes and skyscrapers and bridges, but ended up working in the housing office at Franklin City Hall. And he\u2019s fine there, because they pay him pretty decently and he doesn\u2019t have to work terribly long hours. He had the opportunity to watch Ryan and me grow up. Mom got to stay home with us instead of having to work.</p><p>I remember taking a trip to Asheville, North Carolina, when I was twelve, and Dad was so excited to point out his favorite parts of Biltmore, this huge estate where the Vanderbilts once lived. He loves showing me diagrams of things like the Chrysler Building and the Shanghai Expo. His favorite building ever is the Pantheon in Rome, but he\u2019s never been there.</p><p>He\u2019s never been there because he saves all his money. He doesn\u2019t want Ryan to work while he\u2019s in college. He doesn\u2019t want me to either. Dad\u2019s made a lot of sacrifices for me and my brother.</p> <p>If there\u2019s one thing I want, God, it\u2019s for Dad to take a trip to Italy.

Maybe he\u2019s watching the Predators on TV?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of being in your truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I whisper, \u201cI deserve more than that.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates for a long time. \u201cI want more, but I don\u2019t know what I can give you right now.\u201d</p><p>Will, Will, Will. I want him. Just thinking of him makes my skin tingle, and I keep reliving that afternoon we spent napping in my bed. Wondering what might\u2019ve happened if we\u2019d kissed. I doubt we\u2019d be close like we are now. It\u2019s like relaxing during a long snow when the streets are so covered with ice, school closes. Things with Will have been sorta delayed. I\u2019ve gotten a chance to settle in, to get to know him for him, and him for me.</p><p>Wild to think that, a couple of weeks ago, I wanted Brian bad. And I\u2019m not sure I do anymore. Admitting this, I feel stress pulsing through me. And it\u2019s not only because of Will that I\u2019m thinking this way. It doesn\u2019t feel right.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we should be friends?\u201d I ask Brian, my voice shaking like crazy.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Park,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I summon some courage. \u201cI want you to listen to me when I talk. I want to do something other than sit in your truck. Am I even your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. I listen to the hockey game in the background. \u201cYou know I like you and want you, but we can\u2019t date for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well I guess that\u2019s it then. I\u2019ll see you at practice Monday,\u201d I say, and as Brian tries to interrupt, I quickly add, \u201cBye\u201d and hang up.</p><p>I\u2019m proud of myself for doing that.</p> <p>Aaron Pritchard and Matt Higgins and other guys had a thing for me, but I treated their feelings like they didn\u2019t matter, believing that guys don\u2019t mind one-night flings. I thought I liked Brian seriously. But the way he\u2019s treating me sucks. Shame fills my heart, when I think of the guys I used to prove that I\u2019m not like Mom.</p><p>On Sunday evening, Drew lets himself in the front door, carrying a bowl of popcorn and the Half-Blood Prince DVD. We decided to have a Harry Potter movie night at my house, because his mom recently started dating this guy, Otto.</p><p>Otto always wants to play dominoes. Drew and I have nothing against dominoes, but Otto takes the game very seriously and rolls his eyes when we start building fortresses and then knock them down with a catapult made out of a spoon and a salt shaker.</p><p>We curl up on the couch, and he lets me lean against him. Television light brightens the dim room.</p><p>\u201cGinny Weasley sure grew up to be a saucy minx, eh?\u201d Drew asks, shoving a handful of popcorn in his mouth.</p><p>I\u2019m grinning. \u201cSo did Neville Longbottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Neville Longbottom is a saucy minx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. He grew up to be kinda cute. So did Ron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think Draco is hot in an evil way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I say, shoving Drew with an elbow. \u201cHe must spend hours a day gelling his hair. I could never date a guy who spends so much time on his appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Coach Hoffman spends a lot of time on his hair. It always looks perfect, even if he\u2019s been wearing a cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating.\u201d</p><p>Drew turns to look at me, giving me a hard stare that says he doesn\u2019t believe me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cI asked if I was his girlfriend and he said we can\u2019t date for real. I guess he only wants to fool around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d What I want is a two-way relationship. \u201cI hung up on him last night after I basically said I\u2019m not hooking up again until he lets me have a say in what we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it sucks because I thought he really liked me.\u201d</p><p>Drew pauses the movie. \u201cSome guys are straight-up jerks. You can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a total jerk...\u201d He\u2019s confused and down and wants to stay young. Nothing wrong with that, but I wish he would consider my feelings more.</p><p>Drew puts an arm around me and whispers, \u201cDid you do it with him?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHe said he wanted to when I turn eighteen. But I\u2019m not ready for that. With anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d waited...To have sex, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou regret doing it with Amy?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. \u201cI love her. But I want to sleep with someone I\u2019m in love with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was mini golf?\u201d I\u2019ve been dying to know how Drew\u2019s date thing went last night. I couldn\u2019t get any details out of Tate this morning at church.</p><p>He stuffs a handful of popcorn into his mouth. He smiles a little. \u201cIt was good. I won by a landslide. I have no idea why someone so not athletic would want to play mini golf.\u201d</p><p>I snorggle. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why he wouldn\u2019t give me any details.\u201d</p><p>Drew glances at me sideways. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention me?\u201d</p><p>I get the feeling that, if not for Drew, Tate never would\u2019ve said anything to me about himself, about his life. He seems kinda private. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything. But he smiled when I brought you up. Are you going to see him again?\u201d I\u2019m excited for my friend.</p><p>\u201cWe want to get to know each other.\u201d He blushes. \u201cI haven\u2019t even told Mom about me yet...Hey, listen. Corndog looked at my article about if the Braves should make a trade for a new bat in the middle of the order. He said he loved it, but gave me some edits. Can you read it to see if you have ideas on how to make it stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no prob\u2014\u201d</p><p>The front door opens, and Dad walks in. He says hello to us and pats my head softly.</p><p>\u201cWere you out with Veena?\u201d I ask, turning to hang over the back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hot,\u201d Drew says, chomping on popcorn. \u201cI saw her out the window when she came over to your place last weekend.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s face turns pink. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see each other again.\u201d He says it matter-of-factly and makes his way toward the kitchen. Drew and I exchange looks.</p><p>I leap to my feet and follow Dad. \u201cWhat? Why? Did you have a fight?\u201d</p><p>He opens the fridge. Bright white light tumbles out. \u201cJack Taylor mentioned his wife is concerned about my relationship with Veena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Mrs. Taylor used to be Mom\u2019s friend; you can guess how that turned out.</p><p>Dad stares inside the refrigerator. \u201cShe and Jack don\u2019t think I should be off dating a younger woman when I should be taking care of you and your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? We don\u2019t care. We like Veena!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. This isn\u2019t the right time for me to try dating again.\u201d He sighs heavily, and rubs his eyes with a finger and thumb. He can\u2019t really believe that!</p><p>\u201cWe want you to be happy!\u201d</p><p>He pulls out the orange juice. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is such bullshit,\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Ryan appears in the doorway, wearing jeans and a T-shirt. He got a haircut yesterday and now looks a lot more like he did pre-Vanderbilt. I can\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you arguing about?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cDad broke it off with Veena,\u201d I reply slowly.</p><p>My brother is silent, but sadness takes over his face. He turns and leaves the kitchen. His bedroom door shuts.</p><p>I close my eyes, lean my head against the wall and pray to God, to anyone who might be listening, to please help me. Please help my family. Hasn\u2019t our church taken enough from us?</p><p>And now they have to take our new happiness too?</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why is Dad letting these people factor into his happiness so much? Why do we care? We can\u2019t control what those assholes say, but we can ignore them. If we were to just forget them and focus on God, would everything be better?</p><p>i\u2019m not that kind of girl</p><p>28 days until i turn 18</p><p>After Monday\u2019s practice, I\u2019m unlocking my bike when Brian comes jogging up. He flips his hat around backward. His cutoff sweatshirt sleeves hang lazily over his elbows.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I try to hide how annoyed I am.</p><p>\u201cWant to do something tonight?\u201d His eyes dart around.</p><p>Does he want to do dinner at Foothills? Or go to the Little Duck River again with Brandy? \u201cYou want to do something with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Can I drop by at around eleven?\u201d He gives me a sexy grin, a grin making it obvious what he wants. Which is not what I want.</p><p>I glance around the parking lot. Will and Drew are standing next to Drew\u2019s VW bug, staring over at me. \u201cI\u2019ll text you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a no?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I play with the hem of my sweater. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Brian reaches into his back pocket for a new piece of gum. \u201cCall me whenever you\u2019re ready to hang out, I guess. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I hop on my bike and pedal home, pissed at myself for letting him go down my pants. And to think I thought we had a real connection. We have a physical attraction, and friendship, and commonalities, but there\u2019s no romance. I want romance so much.</p><p>At my house, I lock my bike in the garage, then drag myself inside, all the while wishing the sweet and funny Brian I knew a few weeks ago would come back. I\u2019m on my way to my room when I notice a leg sticking out of the bathroom. Ryan\u2019s leg. I rush forward to find him sprawled out on the tiles, an empty bottle of Robitussin in his fist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit! Ryan!\u201d I yell, dropping to his side. I check for a pulse and listen for breathing. He\u2019s got both. I pull my cell phone out of my pocket and I\u2019m just about to call an ambulance when he lets out a moan.</p><p>He smacks his lips, and his eyes flicker open. His gaze meets mine.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I blurt. Tears drip down my face.</p><p>\u201cUgghhh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I cry, plucking the bottle from his hand and throwing it in the trash. \u201cWhy do you keep doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he moans.</p><p>I grab a washcloth from the closet, wet it, and begin dabbing at his forehead and neck. I\u2019m wondering if I should call Daddy Denial to ask if I should take Ryan to the hospital when the doorbell rings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I tell Ryan. \u201cDon\u2019t move, got it?\u201d</p><p>He shuts his eyes and keeps cleaning his face with the washcloth. I quickly check my appearance in the mirror\u2014I\u2019ve got red, puffy eyes.</p> <p>I peer through the peephole. Will\u2019s here, still in his jersey and baseball pants. He adjusts his cap. I pull open the door. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he replies, focusing on his cleats. \u201cCan we talk? I dropped by because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we talk later?\u201d I rush to ask.</p><p>His head pops up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He watches me wipe tears away. The smells of fabric softener and fried chicken threaten to make me sick.</p><p>He steps forward and wraps me in a hug. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>The story tumbles out of my mouth. Will releases me and charges through the front door, with me on his heels. He finds Ryan and kneels down next to him. Will does the same thing I did: checks his pulse and listens to his breathing.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s take him to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Ryan slurs.</p><p>\u201cI have never been so sure of anything,\u201d Will says, finding my eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re taking him in.\u201d</p><p>At the hospital, we\u2019re not allowed in the emergency room. Will paces around the waiting room while I pick at my orange nail polish.</p><p>Dad was on his way home from work when I called. He\u2019s rushing over to the hospital now.</p><p>\u201cCan you please sit with me?\u201d I ask Will. \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a slight smile and slides in next to me. Our hips touch, and he leans over and wraps his hands behind his neck. Nurses and orderlies zip back and forth in front of us. The paging system calls for Dr. Turner to report straight to the ICU. A woman with a broken leg rolls by in a wheelchair.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for bringing us,\u201d I tell Will quietly. \u201cAn ambulance would\u2019ve cost too much, and I don\u2019t drive often.\u201d I clutch my knees.</p><p>\u201cDoes this happen a lot? With your brother?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always high, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he ever ODed before?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot that I know of. I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad things happen sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s cool that Will is here supporting me, and not judging. If anyone from Forrest Sanctuary finds out about this, I can\u2019t imagine the grief the church will give my family. A few years ago, Tasha Reed drank too much at a field party and had to be rushed to the hospital, and everyone at church had a field day with that one for ages.</p><p>An orderly walks by pushing some medical contraption covered by cords. That\u2019s when I see Veena over by the nurse\u2019s station. She spots me. Her eyes narrow, and she tightens her ponytail, starting toward me. Her pink scrubs bring out her tan skin and brown curls, and I can\u2019t believe Dad would be so stupid as to let our church convince him to give her up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Veena asks, as Will and I stand to greet her.</p><p>\u201cHer brother\u2019s in the ER. We just brought him in,\u201d Will replies, and Veena\u2019s gone, running toward a set of double doors before I even get to say hello.</p><p>Will helps me to sit back down and this time, he puts an arm around me and talks about how Bo was in the hospital a lot when he was little. \u201cOne time last year, he had pneumonia. Dad was in the room with him and he accidentally fell asleep. I guess Bo saw someone walking by with a bag of Doritos, so he ripped the IV out of his leg, climbed out of the hospital bed and ran down the hall after the chips.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly and smile over at him. \u201cAll you Whitfield boys are such trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProud of it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Dad comes rushing into the ER and lifts me into his arms. Then he sets me down and beelines for the nurse\u2019s station. I ask them to page Veena, and sadness and confusion and hurt cloud Dad\u2019s face when she appears from behind those ominous double doors.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my son?\u201d he hurries to ask her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Veena tells Dad, placing a hand on his arm, to calm him. \u201cWe pumped his stomach, but there\u2019s no irreparable damage.\u201d</p><p>Veins bulge in Dad\u2019s throat. \u201cThank you,\u201d he tells her. \u201cFor taking care of him.\u201d Then Dad wraps a hand around the back of my neck and kisses the top of my head. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I reply. Veena averts her gaze, dabbing at her eye with a thumb.</p><p>\u201cDr. Matlock wants to keep Ryan overnight for observation,\u201d Veena says.</p><p>\u201cShould I call your mom?\u201d Will asks me, touching my elbow.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dad and I say at the same time. I don\u2019t think either of us can take that right now. It seems like he just noticed Will is here with me, because his back goes rigid and he briefly shakes Will\u2019s hand, avoiding his eyes.</p><p>Dad\u2019s going to stay overnight with Ryan, so Will says he\u2019ll give me a ride home. Dad eyes Will, his face suspicious. \u201cYou go straight home, and no visitors tonight, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply.</p><p>Will puts an arm around me, and as we\u2019re walking to the parking lot, Veena hurries after us. Her pink scrubs glow under the parking lot lights. She wraps her arms around herself to keep warm. \u201cParker, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Will gently touches my lower back before moving away.</p><p>Veena glances at him. \u201cHe\u2019s cute, huh?\u201d</p><p>I pinch my lip and nod.</p><p>\u201cAre you dating him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s just a friend.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a look. Nothing gets past her. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re hanging out with someone your age, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about what happened with Dad,\u201d I say, changing the subject.</p><p>She shakes her head and laughs to herself. She seems resigned. \u201cThe people around here don\u2019t make it easy to fit in, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d</p><p>She places a hand on my upper arm. \u201cBut are you all right? Do you need to talk? About anything?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think I am okay, no. \u201cEverything\u2019s cool,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well maybe I\u2019ll see you around sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be at church on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>She smiles sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going back to Forrest Sanctuary. But I get coffee all the time at the 41 Drive-In.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should look up Will\u2019s church. It\u2019s called Westwood. They\u2019re very nice there.\u201d Veena smiles and thanks me, and says she needs to get back inside. \u201cThanks for everything,\u201d I add, wishing so bad that she and Dad had worked out, and then I\u2019m buckled into Will\u2019s truck and we\u2019re heading back to my house in silence. Streetlights whiz by. I watch his dangling pine tree air freshener swing back and forth.</p><p>At home, he jingles his keys as he walks me to the door. We stand under the porch light as gnats buzz around our heads.</p><p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d I whisper, bowing my head. He puts two fingers under my chin, lifting it to where we can see each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d he replies, pulling me into a hug. I dry my eyes on his sweatshirt and he responds by giving me a quick kiss on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d I say, touching the patch of hair his lips just touched. My heart beats like crazy. \u201cWait. Can you come in for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he follows me inside and to my bedroom. The streetlamp outside my window cuts a beam of light across the rug. He stares down at me for a long time, like I\u2019m the only thing in the universe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go home,\u201d he says, clutching the side of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should go.\u201d I\u2019m praying that Drew doesn\u2019t notice Will\u2019s truck in the driveway. But mostly I\u2019m praying Will doesn\u2019t try to kiss me tonight, and fearing that he won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay until you\u2019re tucked in,\u201d he says, so I put on my pajamas while he waits in the hallway, then I let him back into my room.</p><p>\u201cWait. Why\u2019d you drop by again?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He smiles and shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not important tonight.\u201d He takes my hand, leading me toward my bed. I crawl under the covers and he pulls them up to my neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he says, sitting on my bed. He runs a hand over my head. His eyes bore into mine. He leans over and presses a kiss to my forehead, says good night, and leaves my room, looking back at me one last time.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been so easy to invite him into my bed.</p><p>But I don\u2019t want to be that kind of girl.</p><p>I miss the girl I used to be.</p><p>falling to pieces</p><p>25 days until i turn 18</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s bring it in, guys!\u201d Brian shouts to the team.</p><p>Thursday\u2019s practice just ended, so I dump ice out of two coolers onto the ground and lug them to the left field equipment shed, where I store them on a shelf. This is one of the first moments I\u2019ve had to myself in days, so I lean against the wall, inhaling the musky scent of worn leather. A fly buzzes past me. I dip my thumbs into my jeans pockets and shut my eyes.</p><p>This week has been too emotional. Too confusing. Ryan stayed in the hospital overnight and came home on Tuesday, but when I asked Dad if we\u2019re going to get him some help, Dad said he\u2019s not ready to make any decisions yet.</p><p>I checked our insurance. It doesn\u2019t cover counseling, or I\u2019d get him an appointment myself. Maybe Vanderbilt has some free services for students?</p><p>I suck in a breath, listening to the laughter coming from outside the shed. I\u2019m enjoying the peace when I hear a voice.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I twirl around to find Will standing in the doorway, the sun filling the air around his body with bright white light.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I give him a grin.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he asks. \u201cI want to tell you why I dropped by the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitches and he rubs his palms together. \u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d go to prom with me.\u201d</p><p>A big smile leaps across my face, but then I remember. Drew. I shouldn\u2019t. But I want this. I face the wooden wall. Catch my breath. \u201cI\u2019d really love that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we\u2019re on?\u201d He sounds excited.</p><p>\u201cI, um.\u201d I toe the basket of balls at my feet. \u201cBefore I can answer, I need to figure a few things out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I turn to find him furrowing his eyebrows. He\u2019s so sweet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with you,\u201d I say, even though it is.</p><p>He takes his cap off, stuffs it in his back pocket and steps toward me. \u201cDo you really want to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper, and swallow. I find his eyes. He takes a step closer. I take a step closer.</p> <p>\u201cSo let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><p>I glance at his lips, he smiles down at me and goose bumps pop all over my arms, telling me this is right, but it\u2019s wrong. The smell of apple wafts under my nose. His shampoo?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed getting to know you better and...I want to try for something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure at first, you know, if I wanted to pursue something serious with you.\u201d He moves a step closer\u2014so close his breath warms my cheek. \u201cBut I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>His hand slides onto my hip. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted. A relationship with a guy I can trust. A good friend. An equal. He makes my heart slam against my chest. I\u2019ve never wanted to kiss someone this much in my life. His other hand settles on my waist and I slide my fingers inside his loose sweatshirt sleeves, making him tremble. Our chests press together; I can feel his pulse.</p><p>Will leans in toward my lips, his hair flopping against my nose, and I want this to happen but it can\u2019t. I step back, and he stumbles forward.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this until I talk to Drew.\u201d</p><p>He rights himself, looking embarrassed, then confused. \u201cBates?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He scratches his nose. \u201cWhatever you need...but you\u2019re not messing with me, right? I wouldn\u2019t be a one-night thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no.\u201d I shake my head and look him straight in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve asked you out a long time ago, but I wanted to make sure we could have something real.\u201d His voice stumbles.</p><p>\u201cI want something real too, but I need to do some stuff first, okay? Trust me?\u201d</p><p>Will slides a hand onto my shoulder. \u201cI can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I slip my hand on top of his and squeeze. He begins to lean his forehead toward mine when I hear a loud cough.</p><p>I jerk away from Will to find Brian standing in the doorway, pursing his lips. He secures his bat under an arm.</p> <p>\u201cYou told me you weren\u2019t interested in her, Whitfield,\u201d Brian says. God, he looks so pissed.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on,\u201d Will says quickly.</p><p>\u201cNot sure I believe you, but anyway, I don\u2019t think this is the time or place for this, okay?\u201d He points from me to Will.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Coach,\u201d Will says.</p><p>\u201cCoach Burns told Parker that she isn\u2019t allowed to date players and still be a manager,\u201d Brian replies. \u201cYou\u2019re excused, Whitfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re excused.\u201d</p><p>Will glances at me, then walks out of the equipment shed. My heart pounds while Brian glares at me. He glances over his shoulder and shuts the shed door. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Park?\u201d he whispers, setting his bat against the wall.</p><p>\u201cWill asked me to prom.\u201d I wring my hands and bite my lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Brian asks softly, moving toward me.</p><p>\u201cNo. I said no. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d think about it.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a mean laugh and shakes his head. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting involved with someone your age. I should\u2019ve known you\u2019d never be mature enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to talk to you about what I want and what I need, and you never listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause nothing\u2019s at stake for you! My whole life is on the line here, Parker. For you! Because I like you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really liked me, you\u2019d listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really liked me, you wouldn\u2019t be cheating on me in the equipment shed with a guy named Corndog and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know we\u2019re in a relationship. You said we can\u2019t date for real, and I don\u2019t know what we are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re nothing.\u201d</p><p>I bow my head and try to swallow the lump in my throat. Doesn\u2019t work. I cough. I liked Brian. Things started off so well. He seems just as confused as I am.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happened with Will.\u201d I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m telling Brian this. It\u2019s none of his business. But I guess I want to show I can be a good person. A tear drips down my cheek. I wipe it away with the heel of my hand.</p><p>Brian gives me a look of sympathy and comes closer. He brushes my hair off my shoulder and leaves his hand there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>His mouth hovers next to my ear and I\u2019m thinking he\u2019ll kiss it, and I\u2019m about to tell him that I don\u2019t want this right now, that we rushed into this-whatever-it-is and we should get out while we can, before we both get hurt more or get in trouble or he really falls hard, like I\u2019m falling hard for Will, when the shed door opens.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod!\u201d Laura blurts, and slaps a hand over her mouth.</p><p>I step away from Brian. Try to get my breathing under control. I clutch my chest, staring my former best friend down. She turns and flies across the field.</p><p>Holy hell. What\u2019s she gonna do?</p><p>I\u2019m summoned to the principal\u2019s office at 8:16 on Friday morning. I\u2019m surprised it took that long.</p><p>Last night, Brian and I spoke briefly on the phone.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should call Laura,\u201d he said. \u201cTell her that she misunderstood what she saw.\u201d</p><p>I chipped all the soft pink polish off my nails. I couldn\u2019t stop shaking. \u201cShe hates me, Brian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are we gonna do then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend like nothing happened? If I call her up, it\u2019s as good as admitting guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Dr. Salter starts asking around, Bates might say something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t say anything. He\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure Whitfield doesn\u2019t know anything about me and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think he would\u2019ve invited me to prom if he knew about you?\u201d</p><p>Brian went silent for a minute. \u201cI would\u2019ve taken you to prom, if we had been in high school at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably would\u2019ve said no.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a perv! You chiseled through the concrete between the locker rooms and spied on girls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I could\u2019ve gotten you to say yes.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at my ceiling, liking that Brian and I were talking normally again. Everything got messed up the minute we started kissing. \u201cOkay, maybe I would\u2019ve said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019d look really beautiful in a gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>We hung up, and I curled under the covers. My phone buzzed. Mom texted: Good night. I love you.</p><p>Now I\u2019m thinking of her as I walk to the principal\u2019s office. When I was a little girl, I would tug on her skirts and dresses, to get her to smile down at me. I loved seeing her face. Friendly, tan, smooth, beautiful, loving. I wish I could see her now. I wish she had stayed with us. None of this ever would\u2019ve happened if Mom were here. She would\u2019ve noticed me sneaking out of the house late at night. She would\u2019ve spotted the small bruise on my collarbone where Brian kissed me too hard. She would\u2019ve noticed the condoms in my purse, the ones I bought just in case.</p><p>She\u2019d know, plain and simple.</p><p>But she\u2019s gone, and I need to face that. Just like I\u2019m about to face the principal. His secretary doesn\u2019t meet my eyes as she tells me to go on in, where I find my father and Dr. Salter chatting about graduation.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d I say, accepting a kiss on the cheek before plopping down in the seat beside him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Salter called and asked me to drop by before work. Is everything okay?\u201d The circles under his eyes have gotten worse since he decided not to pursue Veena. Since Ryan went to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I reply, squeezing my knees.</p><p>Dad and I turn our attention to the principal, who stares me down. He studies my face and my hands start trembling, but I will them to stop. I can\u2019t show any guilt. None.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Dad says.</p><p>Dr. Salter asks, \u201cParker, are you involved with Coach Hoffman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dad exclaims, sitting up straight.</p><p>I lie, choosing my words carefully. \u201cWe talk sometimes, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said too,\u201d Dr. Salter says. \u201cBut are you sure nothing ever happened with him? Romantically or otherwise?\u201d</p><p>I let my mouth fall open. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Dr. Salter talking about?\u201d Dad asks, resting a hand on my back. \u201cI thought you were dating that Corn Fritter fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Corndog, Dad. Not Corn Fritter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating Will Whitfield?\u201d Dr. Salter asks, picking up a glass paperweight. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be interested in that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The principal plays with the paperweight. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a nice human interest addition to the piece I\u2019m writing about our valedictorian and salutatorian for the Franklin Times. But Laura Martin\u2019s allegations are quite serious. She claims she found you with Coach Hoffman in the equipment shed. She said he was kissing your ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I blurt, shifting in my seat.</p><p>Dad\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura hates me,\u201d I say. \u201cShe\u2019ll lie about anything to make me feel bad\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dr. Salter holds up a hand. \u201cI should have already turned this over to the school board for a proper investigation, but you\u2019re such a good student, and you\u2019ve never been in trouble. And I\u2019d hate to ruin Coach Hoffman\u2019s career before it even starts.\u201d The principal coughs and averts his eyes, to concentrate on his inspirational calendar, which reads Confidence.</p><p>\u201cThere must be some mistake,\u201d Dad says. \u201cLaura couldn\u2019t have seen my daughter with Coach Hoffman. Parker is a good Christian girl, and she\u2019s dating a good Christian boy. He goes to Westwood, and we go to Forrest Sanctuary.\u201d Dad\u2019s face is red and his neck bulges.</p><p>I squeeze my hands between my knees and stare down. I can\u2019t believe I did this. Dad\u2019s lying for me, and he doesn\u2019t even know it. And now he\u2019s dragging poor Will into this. Please let this be enough for Dr. Salter. Please let it be enough. I promise you, Lord, I\u2019ll never do anything wrong again if you can help me out of this.</p><p>I can\u2019t ruin Brian\u2019s life. I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cCall Corndog down here,\u201d Dad insists. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Dr. Salter asks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pause. \u201cMy friend likes Will, so we\u2019re keeping it a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say. It\u2019s not my place to tell.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Salter uses his intercom. \u201cMarti, please summon Will Whitfield to my office.\u201d</p> <p>I shut my eyes and wish Mom was here. We sit in silence for three minutes until Will comes rushing in the door. He slows down when he sees me, and drops into the chair next to mine.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dr. Salter. Mr. Shelton.\u201d Will nods at them, then lays a hand on my arm. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I nod slowly, relieved that he\u2019s playing the part he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s cast in. I hate myself for this. Hate. Tears prick my eyes. I sniffle. Then I put pressure on Will\u2019s foot, giving him the only message I can. Help.</p><p>The principal starts, \u201cWill, I\u2019m sorry to bring you out of class like this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Dr. Salter the truth,\u201d Dad says. \u201cThat you\u2019re dating my daughter. Or maybe even doing more with her. I did catch you in her bed that day.\u201d</p> <p>My chin bobs against my chest, and I let out a low cry. Poor Will. He doesn\u2019t deserve this.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sleeping together. No, sir,\u201d Will says quietly. His face turns the pinkest pink.</p><p>I step on his foot harder.</p><p>\u201cBut yeah, we\u2019re dating,\u201d Will says, looking from me to the principal.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re keeping it a secret?\u201d Dr. Salter asks, rapping the paperweight against his desk. Jesus. The man should forget educating kids and become a detective.</p><p>Will glances at me. \u201cYes, sir. For a friend\u2019s sake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mutual friend is interested in me,\u201d Will says, then hesitates. \u201cBut it\u2019ll never work out. We don\u2019t want my friend to know yet.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say he or she. Will is a perceptive guy.</p><p>\u201cWell, your story matches Coach Hoffman\u2019s,\u201d Dr. Salter says to me.</p><p>I pull a deep breath through my nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat story?\u201d Will asks, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cLaura Martin claimed she saw Coach Hoffman and Miss Shelton interacting in an inappropriate manner in the baseball equipment shed yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe equipment shed?\u201d Will blurts. His voice squeaks.</p> <p>\u201cYes...\u201d Dr. Salter says, and Will laughs harshly. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>Will grabs my hand and kisses my knuckles. \u201cCoach Hoffman caught us in the equipment shed yesterday, and then he told me I was acting inappropriately and asked me to leave. Did Laura see you when Coach Hoffman was lecturing you?\u201d Will asks me. His blue eyes are hard. Angry.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in the equipment shed with Corn Fritter?\u201d Dad asks me.</p><p>\u201cCorndog,\u201d Will, Dr. Salter, and I say simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re through here for now,\u201d the principal announces, standing to shake hands with Dad. \u201cMiss Shelton? Can I talk to you and Coach Hoffman about your baseball managing duties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I say, watching Dad and Will file out.</p><p>The principal comes out from around his desk. He avoids my gaze and opens his side door to reveal Brian sitting in an armchair, rapping his foot on the floor. He stands and makes his way into Dr. Salter\u2019s office. We sit back down.</p><p>\u201cHi, Coach Hoffman,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Parker.\u201d</p><p>The principal runs a hand over his head, then sits behind his desk. He raps his paperweight. \u201cI said your stories add up, but I\u2019m afraid I still need to present this to the school board. I\u2019m required to report any accusations against active faculty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir\u2014\u201d Brian starts, looking freaked out.</p><p>\u201cBut Laura hates me,\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>Dr. Salter looks at Brian. \u201cIf you did nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about. They won\u2019t find any evidence...right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidence?\u201d I ask quietly.</p><p>\u201cIf the board does an investigation, will they find evidence that you and Coach Hoffman have spoken outside of school activities?\u201d Dr. Salter\u2019s eyes bore into mine. \u201cHave you talked on the phone? Over the Internet? Have you ever gone anywhere together?\u201d He pauses. \u201cIf you\u2019re telling me they\u2019ll find nothing, we\u2019ll remove the accusation from the coach\u2019s file. But if there is any reason they might believe something is going on between you two\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Brian says, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cWhat can I do to make this stop right here? I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>My eyes are watering. I sniffle. \u201cI\u2019ll give up being valedictorian.\u201d</p><p>Brian shakes his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>The principal looks from me to Brian, and I know he knows the truth. \u201cCoach, if you resign today, we\u2019ll consider this matter closed.\u201d</p><p>Brian doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>We go into the hallway, where I clutch Dad\u2019s elbow. My teeth are chattering. Will\u2019s hanging his head, and I think he might cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the mess,\u201d Dad says, shaking Brian\u2019s hand. \u201cI know your parents go to Forrest Sanctuary and that no son of theirs would ever do something wrong like this. My sincerest apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes, sir.\u201d Brian releases Dad\u2019s hand. Pain covers Brian\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if this misunderstanding embarrassed you and your family, Mr. Shelton.\u201d He heads down the hallway toward his office.</p><p>By resigning, Brian basically admitted guilt just now, and if and when people hear the rumors, I bet my family will be more embarrassed than ever.</p><p>Dad cups my neck with a hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure your being caught in the equipment shed with Corndog was a one-time occurrence. Right, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. A one-time occurrence,\u201d Will mutters, rubbing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pray about this and your brother later.\u201d Dad shakes his head at me, gives Will a dirty look, and ducks into the bathroom across the hall.</p><p>Gee, thanks for the support, Dad. I press a palm to the trophy case and wipe a tear from my face. Brian\u2019s resigning. Because of me. Jobs are hard to come by these days, and I ruined a good opportunity for him. And I lied. I sinned. I\u2019m a terrible person. I miss Mom.</p><p>God, where are you? I\u2019m sorry I keep doing these things. Can\u2019t you help me be a good person? Please.</p><p>Will\u2019s still standing next to me, silent.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you go to prom with me? The truth this time, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say no. I need to take care of some things, I told you that.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me sideways. \u201cWhat are these things?\u201d His voice is rough.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Tears are rolling down my face, and I don\u2019t know what hurts worse: my heart, or that Will isn\u2019t rushing to comfort me. He inches away from me, folding his arms.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat the principal said? About you and Coach Hoffman?\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder, to make sure no one\u2019s listening. Tears blur my vision. I don\u2019t say anything. That should be enough of an answer for Will, the smartest guy I know.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were someone else,\u201d he says. \u201cI came to the conclusion that you weren\u2019t who I thought you were\u2014a girl who gets around with every guy she sees. I thought I had it all wrong. But I guess I was right the first time. You messed with my friends. I don\u2019t know why I was so damned stupid to think I\u2019d be different\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are different\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Will shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I never kissed you. Or worse, lost it to you. What a waste that would\u2019ve been, huh?\u201d</p><p>I lean against the trophy case. Tears soak my shirt. I feel my makeup melting off. \u201cA waste?\u201d I whisper. I never wanted this for me.</p><p>And worse, I threw Will under the bus. For nothing. Brian had to resign anyway.</p><p>The bell rings, and students start moving through the halls. Will stays next to me but says nothing. People are pointing at me. That\u2019s when Drew comes rushing up. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to her, man?\u201d he asks Will. My best friend pulls me into his arms. I rest my chin on his shoulder. Will slams the glass door open and stalks toward the parking lot.</p><p>Dad exits the bathroom. \u201cParker,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI love you and care about you, but I don\u2019t want to be called away from work again because you got caught in the equipment shed with Corndog. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Drew whispers. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad,\u201d I say, sniffling, and he leaves, not looking back at me.</p><p>Drew\u2019s face falls. \u201cYou lied to me? You\u2019re really fooling around with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorndog only pretended that,\u201d I exclaim. \u201cTo cover for me. With Brian.\u201d I move to fall back into Drew\u2019s arms, but he scoots away from me. \u201cWe\u2019ve never hooked up or kissed or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were messing around with both of them? Did you use Corndog to cover up who you\u2019re really interested in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d I reach for him again, but he steps backward. \u201cWill lied. To help me. To help Brian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI stuck by you. Through everything. All your mood swings and cutting out the world. I told people you weren\u2019t a freak. I told them you were shy and cared about school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you my secret,\u201d he whispers. \u201cAnd then you took it from me.\u201d His big brown eyes go glossy.</p><p>\u201cDrew, that\u2019s not what happened. Can you list\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything with you is such bullshit. You probably got Tate to talk to me so you could have Will all to yourself. Right?\u201d</p><p>I tried to be a good friend...And now he won\u2019t even listen. I had a chance with Will. I turned down a date to prom. A real date with a real guy who truly wanted me. All for a friend who won\u2019t even hear me out.</p><p>I don\u2019t have anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, then,\u201d I whisper, and decide to skip school today. I leave to go home.</p><p>Wherever that is.</p><p>I run into Laura, Allie, and Mel on the way to the bike rack. They start whispering. So I start shouting.</p><p>\u201cThanks for turning me into Dr. Salter, Laura. I\u2019ll pray for you. Lord knows you\u2019d never do it for me because you\u2019re so jealous. Judge thy neighbor, eh?\u201d</p><p>They shut up and stare at me. I\u2019ve never said anything like that before. And you know what? I didn\u2019t get struck by lightning. I don\u2019t even feel guilty.</p><p>I tell my eyes to stop crying. Fat chance of that.</p><p>alternative spring break</p><p>21 days until i turn 18</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me again.\u201d</p><p>Will hung up on me.</p><p>When I called Drew, he sounded like he was choking on his tears. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you right now. I really can\u2019t. Bye.\u201d</p><p>When I called Brian, no answer.</p><p>He quit his job. Because of something I basically forced him into, something I was ready to give up the moment I had feelings for Will. Brian\u2019s right. I am immature. I try calling his cell, but he doesn\u2019t pick up. He\u2019s not on Skype, and he defriended me on Facebook! And after a couple of hours, he doesn\u2019t return any of my emails. It\u2019s after 6:00 p.m., so I open the church directory I stole and find his parents\u2019 address. I Google map directions, and I\u2019m on my bike and pedaling down the road in less than a minute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At his house, I locate the stairs leading to the apartment above the garage, then lean my bike against a tree.

I knock until my knuckles feel raw.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d a man calls out from down below. I recognize him from the Forrest Sanctuary church directory. Mr. Hoffman.</p><p>\u201cWhen will he be back?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The man lifts both shoulders. \u201cHe went to Birmingham to visit a friend. I\u2019m not sure when he plans to come back.

I pedal home, where I find Ryan curled up in a ball on the living room couch.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say to him.</p><p>\u201cYo.\u201d He rests his head on a cushion, not bothering to ask about my face. My tears.</p><p>Dad\u2019s sitting in his armchair, reading the Bible. He looks up at me and shakes his head, then goes back to reading. Bags hang under his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t given up on Veena so quickly,\u201d I tell Dad.</p><p>He jerks his head up and finds my eyes. \u201cWhat happened with Veena is none of your business. I prayed about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrayer doesn\u2019t solve everything, Dad. It\u2019s not going to solve Ryan\u2019s problems. Or mine. You had a good thing with Veena, but you\u2019re so damned stubborn, and you have to listen to everything the people at church say. You only gave up because they told you to. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ll keep on being lonely like this.\u201d</p> <p>Dad takes off his glasses and runs a hand over his Bible.</p><p>I focus on my brother. \u201cAnd Ryan? I\u2019m feeling shitty. Thanks for asking. And no, I\u2019m not making you dinner tonight. Make it your damned self.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><p>I stalk down the hall to my room, and without bothering to put on pajamas, I crawl under my covers and cry, cry, cry. Brian quit his job. Because of me. I might drown in the guilt. Neither Dad nor Ryan knocks on the door. I don\u2019t get any texts. Drew doesn\u2019t come over to read Cosmo with me. Will doesn\u2019t show up by way of a lawnmower.</p><p>\u201cPlease, God,\u201d I whisper. \u201cPlease. Tell me what to do. Please.\u201d I clear my head of all thoughts. I imagine how good it feels to swing at a pitch. To connect. To send a line drive over the second baseman\u2019s head.</p><p>God, please.</p><p>My cell beeps. I jump. Look at the text from Mom. It reads: I love you. Night.</p><p>Suck in air. Hesitate. I can do this. Squinting through my tears, I dial her number. It rings. She picks up.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I cry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>She sucks in a breath. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now. I can be there in three hours.\u201d</p><p>Mom wakes me the next morning.</p><p>Her light brown hair hangs loosely around her shoulders, and her lips are painted a pale pink. She\u2019s as beautiful as ever, but something\u2019s different. She\u2019s glowing. She\u2019s happy.</p><p>\u201cFrench toast?\u201d she asks, rubbing my shoulder.</p><p>I love the smells wafting into my room. Fresh coffee. Eggs. Bacon. \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I reply. I don\u2019t deserve French toast.</p><p>\u201cHow about you take a shower, and then we\u2019ll get you some breakfast before your game,\u201d Mom says, threading my hair between her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d I reply, focusing on her beautiful face. It makes me feel better already. \u201cHow\u2019d you know about the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother told me you\u2019re managing, and I found the schedule on the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know he and Dad noticed.\u201d</p><p>She pushes hair off my forehead. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you going to the game? I\u2019d love to come with you.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of baseball makes me remember Brian and Drew and Will and Laura, and that makes the tears start up again. I cry so hard and for so long Mom has to get a towel from the bathroom because Kleenex isn\u2019t doing the trick. She doesn\u2019t press me, doesn\u2019t do anything but rub my back and kiss my head.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring your dog? Annie?\u201d I ask, sniffling.</p><p>\u201cShe stayed home with Theresa. She\u2019s a real sweet puppy\u2014I hope you\u2019ll come meet her sometime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom? I\u2019m sorry...for how I\u2019ve acted. For not calling and all.\u201d</p><p>For judging you. For not thinking about your feelings.</p><p>Mom pats my knee. \u201cNo apology needed. I understand. I\u2019m glad you called,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI hate to think of you crying alone. What happened?\u201d</p><p>I sniffle. Mucus clogs my throat. \u201cWhen you hear what I did, you\u2019ll hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. Do you want to get out of the house and go for a walk before the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quitting managing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no quitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already quit softball, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you took a couple seasons off. Nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so forgiving. I\u2019m an awful person.\u201d I let out a sob.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the best people I know, Parker. You\u2019re compassionate and you love so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t change that much. You\u2019re still the same loving Christian girl I\u2019ve always known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you care about being a Christian after what happened with church? With what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod still loves me,\u201d Mom replies quietly. \u201cAnd He loves you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura and Brother John said that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing they\u2019ve ever said matters,\u201d Mom interrupts. \u201cAll that matters is your personal relationship with God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod hates me,\u201d I whisper, falling onto my pillow.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that, but you need to work that out on your own. And no matter what, no matter what you\u2019ve done, I\u2019ll never stop loving you, okay?\u201d</p><p>I look up at her. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quit going to church,\u201d Mom admits quietly, averting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can talk to God while I\u2019m walking the dog or running in the woods just the same as if I\u2019m at church.\u201d</p><p>I never thought of it that way. I guess it\u2019s true that I write to God all the time, He just doesn\u2019t listen. Or maybe He is, but He\u2019s telling me what I don\u2019t want to hear. I don\u2019t have to be at church to do that.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Dad say when you showed up?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHe said that you\u2019ve been \u2018engaging in inappropriate activities with a guy named Corn Fritter.\u2019\u201d Mom laughs silently and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cCorndog. Will Whitfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the boy who drives you crazy? Always trying to beat you in school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you dating him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Fresh tears stream down my face. Mom pulls me into her arms and rocks me. \u201cI wish I were though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he like you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did...but I did something stupid. But you can\u2019t tell Dad or anyone,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cI promise I won\u2019t say a thing.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s face never changes as I tell her about Brian and Will and Drew, but I can tell she\u2019s upset because she squeezes my hand harder during the bad parts, like how I got myself involved with the coach of the baseball team.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with him?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWe should get you a doctor\u2019s appointment anyway. You\u2019re old enough that you need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get you on birth control too.\u201d</p><p>Holy embarrassment. \u201cI won\u2019t be needing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be prepared, just in case. I was seventeen once.\u201d Mom\u2019s mouth twitches in amusement, then goes back to sadness. \u201cAnd you\u2019re sure Dr. Salter isn\u2019t planning a formal investigation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he wouldn\u2019t if Brian resigned. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d The tears won\u2019t stop. If I hadn\u2019t pursued Brian like I did...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Dr. Salter here in a bit to make sure nothing will fall back on you. Brian is an adult and should\u2019ve known better.\u201d Mom clutches my hand. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have taken advantage of you. This isn\u2019t all your fault, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI messed everything up,\u201d I cry. \u201cI lost Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Drew is angry with you because of Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But I\u2019m mad at him too. He wouldn\u2019t even listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you something that took me forty-two years to figure out.\u201d She traces the spiral pattern on my duvet. \u201cSometimes you gotta do what\u2019s right for you and forget about everybody else. All that matters is what you want. What you need.\u201d</p><p>What I had wanted was Brian, and look how that turned out. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem very Christian-like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. But you only live once, and if something feels right to you and you want it, you should go after it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you left us?\u201d I cry. If she hadn\u2019t left, things would be okay. Maybe Will and I would\u2019ve fallen in love.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to hurt you,\u201d Mom replies, sounding so sad. \u201cSometimes I wish I hadn\u2019t done what I did, because losing you was the worst punishment possible.\u201d Her eyes close.</p><p>Mom did what she felt was right for her. Maybe it\u2019s about knowing what you want and going after it\u2013\u2013and being willing to pay the consequences when everyone else thinks it\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lose me,\u201d I say, hugging her as tightly as I can. And if God\u2019s watching us, maybe he\u2019s saying, Sure, a bunch of shit had to happen, but a mother and daughter are back together. A mother can love her daughter even if she\u2019s been sinning like it\u2019s going out of style. A daughter can love her mother even if she acted selfishly.</p><p>\u201cI hurt Will so bad,\u201d I mumble, rubbing my face. It stings.</p><p>She pauses for a long moment. \u201cDo you like him a lot?\u201d</p><p>It felt like more than like. Something more, something real. Something like love. But now it\u2019s gone.</p><p>After I told Mom about Ryan\u2019s trip to the ER and what\u2019s been happening with him, her face went white, her eyes glossed over, and she stalked off to find Dad. They\u2019ve spent a good hour talking in the dining room, using hushed voices. Ryan and I are sitting in the living room, trying to eavesdrop, pretending to watch TV, glancing at each other from time to time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I miss Ryan. I wish he had noticed I disappeared with Brian, and had come to save me like that time I got lost at Opryland when I wanted to drive a Tin Lizzie. Ever since Mom left us, I\u2019ve cooked his meals. I\u2019ve done his laundry. He needed me to rescue him, while I kept waiting on him to save me again.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve called me!\u201d Mom says to Dad, and I see my brother cringe. He shuts his eyes. He never meant for this to happen, I know he didn\u2019t. Like me, he didn\u2019t know how to deal. He couldn\u2019t get the perfection back. So he changed for the worse. We both did.</p><p>I move from the love seat to the sofa where Ryan\u2019s sitting and wrap my arms around his neck and bury my face in his shoulder. He rubs my back and presses his face against my hair.</p><p>Nobody talks to me at school on Monday.</p> <p>Everybody\u2019s too busy talking about me.</p><p>As if I don\u2019t feel guilty enough.</p><p>When I walk through the hall between classes, I hear my name. Brian\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cI heard she was sleeping with him,\u201d says a younger guy I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cLaura caught them doing it in the equipment shed!\u201d says another.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost our coach because of her,\u201d Paul says to Jake Sanders. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re stuck with the damned music teacher the rest of the season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll mess around with anybody,\u201d Matt Higgins tells Kristen Markum.</p><p>Dr. Salter calls me to his office after third period. He\u2019s playing with his paperweight again. \u201cI\u2019ve asked the faculty not to discuss Coach Hoffman\u2019s resignation with the students, but I\u2019ve been hearing rumors all morning. Do you want to speak with the guidance counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I tell him, bowing my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any evidence anything actually happened...but I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say quickly, quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI hope this dies down before graduation. I\u2019d hate to have these rumors be the focus of graduation, rather than your valedictory speech and the other students\u2019 accomplishments.\u201d</p><p>When I peek up at his face, he swallows and looks out the window.</p><p>At lunchtime, I take a deep breath, and dragging my fingers across the white concrete walls, I head toward the cafeteria. I push the double doors open to find Will and Drew sitting together. I slowly walk to their table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Will scrunches his forehead, stands, and leaves the cafeteria without saying a word, abandoning his sandwich, chips, and apple.</p><p>I sit down across from Drew. He\u2019s still here. I hope that means he\u2019s willing to forgive me. Or at least let me explain that nothing was happening with Will.</p><p>\u201cDrew,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cI realize I\u2019ve hurt you, but I need you to know I didn\u2019t hook up with Will. I swear I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He starts tearing up his paper napkin. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t tell you that Corndog was interested in you.\u201d</p> <p>I close my mouth to swallow. \u201cYou knew and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you liked him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t my feelings matter as much as yours?\u201d Just because he came out, I\u2019m supposed to ignore everything I feel for Will? Is that what true friends do to each other? I touch my throat. \u201cI wish I\u2019d known he liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you had Coach Hoffman. You would\u2019ve just hurt Corndog. Like you\u2019d hurt our other friends.\u201d</p><p>So this is what friendship is?</p><p>I thought friends gave you the benefit of the doubt. I thought friends stayed beside you through everything. I stayed beside Drew. At least I think I did. At least I tried. He\u2019s acting like Laura did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you and your friends,\u201d I say honestly. I stand up. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>I move to leave the cafeteria, wondering if Drew will blurt, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I chose not to act on a relationship with Will for him. I wish Drew could\u2019ve listened. I\u2019m okay. It\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019m panting. I lean up against the wall next to the gym, shutting my eyes.</p><p>That\u2019s when I decide to make Spring Break plans. To begin to try to heal from this mess, if healing\u2019s even possible.</p><p>Dad is way old-fashioned, so when I was growing up, he never wanted Mom to work a job. He wanted to make ends meet so she could stay home with Ryan and me, to drive us to tee-ball practice and to piano lessons, to help us with our homework after school. To cart us to teeth cleanings.</p><p>Up until this year, Ryan and I were pretty great, and we\u2019ve always had excellent grades, so Dad did us right by asking her to be a homemaker. But I always knew Mom was itching for a job.</p><p>She loves gardening. Our front yard won the Franklin Beautification Award six years in a row, thanks to Mom\u2019s hedges and rose bushes. She wanted to learn topiary design but never got around to it because she was chauffeuring me to softball game after softball game.</p><p>I was so excited to find out that Mom recently got a job at a florist. It doesn\u2019t pay much, but she loves getting her hands dirty. The store\u2019s sales have skyrocketed since she started designing bouquets.</p><p>Mom and Theresa bought a place in Oldham, Tennessee, a tiny town smack dab in the middle of the Great Smoky Mountains. It\u2019s a close drive to Pigeon Forge, home of Dolly Parton and a buttload of outlet malls. It\u2019s also near Gatlinburg, where there\u2019s ice skating and great skiing. The cabin smells of cedar, and Mom made me a room here, with a cast iron twin bed and a shelf full of books.</p><p>She follows in behind me, carrying a short stack of towels. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything. I\u2019ll cook and clean\u2014all you have to do is relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say with a nod. I give her a hug, and it feels better than being in any boy\u2019s arms. \u201cWhere\u2019s Theresa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went to visit her sister this week. I wanted some time to hang out with just you.\u201d</p><p>I bite back my smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad. Not that I don\u2019t like Theresa. Um\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mom waves a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Annie the labradoodle follows me around as I check out the bathroom, kitchen, and dining room. I skip Mom\u2019s bedroom, because I\u2019m not ready for that yet.</p><p>Mom steams some vegetables and grills chicken for dinner. We sit on the back porch overlooking the mountains to eat. Annie lies across my feet. I cut my chicken breast in half and pick at it, and Mom comments that I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight.</p><p>I nod, avoiding her eyes, and eat a bigger piece of chicken. I decide to change the subject. \u201cDid you always know?\u201d I ask, popping a carrot in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cThat you were different. That you didn\u2019t love Dad.\u201d</p><p>She chews and wipes her mouth. She stares straight ahead at the mountains. \u201cI love your father. But yes, I think I\u2019ve known for a long time. You need to understand that I was raised to believe I needed to marry a man, raise a family, and go to church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I was raised.\u201d</p><p>Mom squeezes my hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you now that you should do whatever you want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound Christian. I want God to love me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod does love you, sweetie. What I\u2019m saying is, is if you want to be a Christian and have a relationship with God, you can do that. You have free will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there such a thing as too much free will? I shouldn\u2019t have gone after Brian. And look at Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Brian is not your fault, understand? He\u2019s an adult.\u201d Mom\u2019s face goes hard. Sad. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to worry about your brother right now, okay? It\u2019s up to me and your father to help him. I know you care about him, but you\u2019re seventeen and have so many exciting things to look forward to. Graduation. Prom.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not technically true. I can\u2019t think of anything to look forward to. I lost Will. I lost Drew. Brian left me and didn\u2019t look back. I have no friends.</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet Dad, anyway?\u201d I ask, spearing a piece of broccoli with my fork.</p><p>She smiles and sips her water. \u201cI met him on the first day of college. We lived in the same dorm, on the same floor. He helped me carry my boxes up three flights of stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you got together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no. We were best friends for two years before he asked me out on a date, and he asked me to marry him senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut something felt off?\u201d</p><p>Mom bows her head to think. \u201cYour father and I should\u2019ve stayed best friends instead of getting together. I still consider him my best friend now, even though I\u2019ve hurt him so much I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll never forgive me. I wish I had known back then that I had options. But my parents loved him. They still do. I thought marrying him would be enough for me.\u201d</p><p>I love the idea of having options and doing whatever I want, but do I have the courage?</p><p>The next morning while Mom takes a nap, when we should be at church, Annie and I run down a patchy dirt trail and through thick trees and alongside yellow daisies. I inhale the outdoors. Being out here in peace almost lets me forget about Will. I stop at a country market, where a little bell jingles against the glass door. I buy a bottle of diet lemonade, then walk back into the woods, sit down on a log, hug Annie\u2019s neck, and listen to a waterfall beating down on rocks.</p><p>\u201cPretty dog,\u201d I say, scratching her back. She pants and barks at a cardinal.</p><p>I pull the romance novel I brought out of my back pocket and settle in to read about lords and servants and corsets. This one duke guy is sleeping with the maid, but he can\u2019t marry her because she\u2019s the help, and aristocracy isn\u2019t allowed to have relations with the servant class, but no one knows she\u2019s really the Duchess of York or something. I hope she\u2019ll admit her heritage so they can get it on and have a legal marriage and all that jazz.</p><p>Annie rests her chin on my thigh, and I turn page after page, reading, but I can\u2019t stop thinking of Will. In these novels, all the problems could be solved if characters would talk to each other. I pull out my cell and send Will a text: I\u2019m staying with my mom for Spring Break. Maybe we can talk when I get back? I miss you.</p><p>I sit on that log and finish the novel. The duke and the duchess end up together (obviously\u2014the key to any good romance is a happy ending), but Will never texts back.</p><p>Dear God, I think, Please...will you give my story a happy ending?</p><p>I don\u2019t deserve a happy ending with Will after I used him to save Brian. To save me. But why hasn\u2019t he told Drew the truth? Have they talked about it?</p><p>I grab Annie\u2019s leash and trudge back to the cabin. Thinking of Will sucks, and it makes my eyes sting, but I\u2019m okay. I like being outside with the dog. Maybe at college, I\u2019ll study to become a vet. I\u2019d work hard for that. Annie looks up at me and barks, and I\u2019m glad that she likes me.</p><p>At Mom\u2019s cabin, before I put the romance novel back on the shelf, I study the cover, the duchess\u2019s sweeping blue gown. I want to wear Mom\u2019s white dress to prom, regardless if I have a date or not. My cell rings, and I pray it\u2019s Will calling to forgive me, or Brian calling to check on me, to find out if I\u2019m okay. To tell me he\u2019s okay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it\u2019s Tate.</p><p>\u201cI missed you today at church,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m spending some time with my mom.\u201d</p><p>We chitchat until he asks, \u201cHave you talked to Drew lately? He stopped answering my texts and emails.\u201d Tate sounds so sad.</p> <p>\u201cI messed up bad,\u201d I say, and explain everything that happened with Brian, Will, and Drew.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mess up bad. Sometimes things happen,\u201d he replies. \u201cPeople make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Drew\u2019s acting like this. Why won\u2019t he talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Tate says, \u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing\u2014explaining to everyone who you really are. I\u2019ve only told a couple of people.\u201d We stay silent for a bit before he speaks again. \u201cFrankly, I think it\u2019s kinda hot you seduced an older man. Can I have one, please?\u201d</p><p>I giggle, then go quiet. I stare down at the blue gown on the book cover and think about how much I want to wear my white dress. Maybe this is a chance for me to do what Mom said. Take care of myself. Do something for me.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Tate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go to prom with me?\u201d</p><p>Since Mom\u2019s still at the florist, I root around in the basement for more romance novels or a deck of cards, to play a game of Solitaire. It\u2019s Thursday of Spring Break, and nobody except for Dad and Tate has called. I\u2019m so bored, I might borrow Mom\u2019s bike and try to find a movie theater. The nearest one is probably twenty miles away. I drag my finger over piles of board games and nonfiction books and baskets of linens. That\u2019s when I see it.</p><p>Mom\u2019s glove.</p><p>Her old softball mitt is sitting on a shelf next to a dusty vase. I hesitantly pick up the glove and slip my hand inside. I hunt around for a softball and find one behind a box of CDs. I pull a deep breath and start pounding the ball into the glove, loving the release, loving the energy whipping through my muscles. I rush up the stairs, taking two at a time, and jog out into the front yard. Giving Mom\u2019s tulip beds a wide berth, I throw the ball up into the air as high as it will go, then catch it. I do this over and over again. It never gets old.</p> <p>Mom\u2019s car pulls into the driveway right when the sun begins to set.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to bring your glove?\u201d Mom asks as she steps out of the car.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She slides her tote bag onto her shoulder and comes to give me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I\u2019ve missed her doing that so much. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. We could\u2019ve played catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time.\u201d I smile at her, but it\u2019s a pained smile. I wish I hadn\u2019t quit the team last year. I wish I hadn\u2019t let my former friends influence everything I did. I wish I had understood that people will always interpret my actions in different ways.</p><p>\u201cThere are public batting cages not too far from here,\u201d Mom says, pulling her glove off my hand. She slips her hand into it and pounds a fist against the pocket. \u201cYou pay for rounds of balls. It\u2019s fun\u2014I go there sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d She beams. \u201cSometimes I even bat on the Major League Baseball setting. The balls come at you at 90 miles per hour.\u201d</p> <p>My mouth falls open. \u201cHow many have you hit? Balls going at 90 miles per hour, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple.\u201d She laughs softly and brushes her hair over her shoulder. \u201cI usually out-bat the men who go there. It makes them all upset. And then they hit on me.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me change into sweats.\u201d</p><p>We hit ten rounds of balls apiece, blowing way too much money. I even try the MLB setting, but I only manage a foul-tip. I\u2019m proud of it, though, considering how rusty I am.</p><p>Then Mom and I go out to this healthy buffet she likes, where we build giant salads full of tomatoes and squash and avocado to take home to eat in front of the TV. And for the first time in over a year, I watch a Braves game.</p><p>Dear Lord,</p><p>On Monday morning, when I get back to school, I\u2019m going to talk to Coach Burns and Dr. Salter. I want to see if they\u2019ll give me another chance to play softball this year. I pray you\u2019ll be there with me when I ask. I know that being on a team means acting like a team player, which I haven\u2019t been this year. I\u2019m the last person who deserves to play softball. But I want to. I want to try. And I hope I can help the team win some games.</p><p>Thanks for the great Spring Break.</p><p>Written on March 19 while overlooking the Great Smoky Mountains. Burned using a candle.</p><p>the prom decisional</p><p>2 days until i turn 18</p><p>Dr. Salter and Coach Burns had the team take a vote.</p><p>Fourteen girls voted yes to letting me back on the team, while eight said no.</p><p>Now when I show up at softball practice, I don\u2019t pay one lick of attention to Laura. I bat, I run, I field the ball. I dive when I have to, jump when I have to, take risks when I have to. I cheer for my teammates during games. I chew my gum and smile and enjoy the bright sky.</p><p>Rumors about Brian and me haven\u2019t stopped, but I try my best to ignore them. I really try. But I cried myself to sleep one night after hearing Jake Sanders and Paul wondering aloud if Brian and I had ever had sex in the equipment shed. I cried again after I saw Will talking to Kate Kelly. I know he didn\u2019t see me, but I saw him, leaning against his locker, smiling down at her. I wish he would smile at me like that again.</p><p>I cried because, even though things were over between us before we got caught, Brian left without saying good-bye.</p><p>But I love this game, and I\u2019m ashamed I ran away from it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a dinosaur invitation to Bo\u2019s party.</p><p>I didn\u2019t figure I would, but deep down I hoped. Still, I ride my bike over to Walmart, where I buy a package of baseball cards, some of those capsules that expand into animals in the bathtub, and a new Matchbox car. It\u2019s not much, and Will will probably think it\u2019s way over the top and that I\u2019m trying to get his attention in any way, but that\u2019s not true. I like Bo, and I have a feeling that no one but my parents will notice my eighteenth birthday next week, and I don\u2019t want Bo to ever feel that way.</p><p>When you turn eighteen, you\u2019re supposed to go buy a lottery ticket. You\u2019re supposed to buy cigarettes, even if you don\u2019t smoke. Go clubbing with girlfriends in Nashville. Instead, I\u2019ll probably have a quiet dinner at home with Mom, Dad, and Ryan. And that\u2019s fine.</p><p>But as much as I want to take Mom\u2019s advice and do things for me and only me, I\u2019m still lonely. I still need friends. When I go to college in the fall, I\u2019ll definitely be more social, but I will remain guarded. Was my connection with Brian real? Did we truly like each other? Does he miss me? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get the cojones to reach out to anyone again, but if I care enough about the person to risk it, I\u2019m open to the idea, and that\u2019s gotta count for something.</p><p>I pack the gifts in a bag and write To Bo, from Parker Shelton on it, then I ride my bike out to Whitfield Farms, loving the smell of cut grass floating on the warm spring air.</p><p>I pass a bunch of hay bales, then I stop at their mailbox, prop my bike up with one foot, and slip the gift bag inside. I stare at their house, remembering the Sunday lunch I had with them and the time Will had me over to baby-sit Bo. I softly touch the spot on my neck that he rubbed. My mind wanders to the time I nearly let him kiss me in the equipment shed, where everything fell apart, but I snuff it out of my mind. I jerk my head from side to side, telling myself to get over it.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried. He\u2019s gone. That\u2019s it.</p><p>I take a final glance at the farm and say good-bye to Will Whitfield, then I pedal home.</p><p>Friday\u2019s practice ends.</p><p>I hop on my bike and speed down the four-lane toward my house. The sky is edging into twilight. When it\u2019s safe, I hold both arms out like I\u2019m flying. The warm wind rushes over my body, and I\u2019m smiling.</p><p>I pedal past Dairy Queen and get a major hankering for a Dilly Bar. I do a U-turn and thrust my arms out again, pretending I\u2019m a bird. I\u2019ve really lost it, but I don\u2019t care. It feels good.</p><p>I lock my bike and head inside, where I find Will and Drew slumped in a booth, their trays piled high with food. They see me and stare. Will stops chewing. Drew doesn\u2019t bite into the hot dog he\u2019s holding. They look shocked. Probably because I\u2019ve voluntarily chosen a fast-food restaurant. My first instinct is to rush to my bike and peel out of here, but I want that Dilly Bar. I haven\u2019t had one in a couple years, and my taste buds are begging for the chocolate.</p><p>Heading to the counter, I avoid their faces. I don\u2019t even glance back at them while I\u2019m waiting for my order to come up. I smile to myself, glad that even with all the weird stuff that happened between Will and Drew, they\u2019re still hanging out together.</p><p>When the ice cream is in my hand, I peel back the paper wrapper and bite into the chocolate shell. It cracks, and vanilla ice cream flows onto my tongue. Don\u2019t groan, don\u2019t groan, I tell myself. But I can\u2019t hold back my smile.</p><p>On my way out, I sneak a peek at Will and Drew. Drew\u2019s focused on his hot dog, but Will is watching me, one side of his mouth lifted into a subtle smile. He quickly averts his eyes and sinks his teeth into his burger.</p><p>That sucks, but I\u2019ve got my ice cream and my bike and I\u2019m heading home to my family. Maybe Dad will want to take a walk with me.</p><p>I stand on the third base line with my hand pressed over my heart. The national anthem is playing before the announcer reads the Prom Decisional lineup.</p><p>Coach Burns hasn\u2019t let me start very many games this season since I hadn\u2019t paid my dues and all, but he told me I\u2019m definitely starting today.</p><p>Coach Burns never looks me in the eye.</p><p>The anthem ends, and the announcer says, \u201cThank you all for coming to the sixth annual Prom Decisional!\u201d The crowd claps and whistles. The smell of popcorn wafts through the air. \u201cIt\u2019s also Senior Night here at Hundred Oaks. Coach Burns asks that parents of seniors join the players on the field.\u201d</p><p>Players who aren\u2019t seniors go sit in the dugouts, and this horribly cheesy instrumental music spills from the loudspeakers. Mom and Dad stand up from their seats in the bleachers and make their way onto the field. Brother John and Mrs. Martin move to stand next to Laura, ignoring my family. Ms. Bates joins Drew, while Mr. and Mrs. Whitfield, carrying Bo, smile and wave at me on their way to stand with Will. I guess they didn\u2019t hear the rumors about me.</p><p>Dad squeezes my neck, and Mom holds my hand. The announcer calls each senior\u2019s name, and Dr. Salter shakes our hands and gives each of us a little bouquet of roses. I invited Theresa to come, to stand next to Mom, but she graciously declined. And truth be told, that relieved me a bit. But I\u2019m glad I asked her. I know Mom was glad too.</p><p>The bright lights shine down as we take the field. The boys are batting first. Sam steps up to home plate, taking a few practice swings. I bend over onto my knees, focusing on him, chewing my gum. Laura winds up and pitches a strong fastball right down the center. Sam watches it go by.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Laura!\u201d Jordan yells from the stands. \u201cStrike him out!\u201d</p><p>Sam smirks and takes another practice swing. JJ punches Jordan in the shoulder, and she shoves him. I stare Sam down. This time he swings and flies out to center field. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice!\u201d I say, smacking my glove. \u201cThree up, three down, Laura.\u201d</p><p>The next batter up is Travis Lake. Laura takes a deep breath and gets ready to pitch. He hits a groundball to me, and I easily make the grab and hurl the ball to Allie at first. Two down.</p><p>Drew bats third, slamming a line drive over Mel\u2019s head. He stretches it into a double. Will bats cleanup but doesn\u2019t manage to clean anything up. He hits a line drive to Laura, and she catches it for out number three.</p><p>Coach has me leading off. Since I\u2019ve shed a lot of weight, I\u2019ve gotten way fast\u2014fast enough to bat first. Jake Sanders pitches the softball overhand, which is kinda weird. I let the first pitch pass. On the second, I bunt and sprint down the first base line faster than Paul can pick up the ball and bomb it. Mom and Dad yell my name and clap. Mel is up next. She smacks the ball over the shortstop\u2019s head, and I hurl myself around second toward third. The left fielder launches the ball to Will at third. I slide into the bag right as Will tags my leg.</p> <p>\u201cOut!\u201d the ump says.</p><p>I pull myself to my feet and brush the dirt off my pants. I give Will a quick smile before jogging to the dugout.</p><p>Our teams stay tied at zero-zero over the next three innings. In the fifth, Sam slams a homer over the left field wall. He showboats around the bases, dancing and acting up.</p><p>One-zero, Boys.</p><p>In the sixth inning, I hit a triple, knocking two runs in, and Allie also earns two RBI. In the same inning, Will hits a homer and brings Drew home. Before the eighth, the crowd sings \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game.\u201d I\u2019m having a great time, even if I\u2019m not really speaking to anybody and nobody\u2019s speaking to me. As usual. It\u2019s just fine. I love this game.</p> <p>In the top of the ninth, we\u2019re still up four-three with one out. Tim Keale hits a line drive straight into the hole. I lurch left and snatch the ball, then chase Will back toward second base. I outrun him, tagging his back.</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d the ump yells.</p><p>We win!</p><p>My team rushes toward the pitcher\u2019s mound, screaming and hollering and jumping in circles. I smile to myself and pound the softball into my mitt.</p><p>\u201cGood game,\u201d Will says, clapping my back and hustling toward the dugout. The guys I used to manage are packing up their equipment, acting like the game meant nothing. I can tell their pride is hurt. Will says something to the guys, and then they walk back onto the field. They start shaking hands with the girls and say, \u201cGood game.\u201d</p><p>Sam asks Laura, \u201cSo what\u2019s the prom theme gonna be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDisney,\u201d she replies, making everyone groan. And I mean everyone.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Will says, adjusting his cap.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Allie says. \u201cWe need to discuss this as a team.\u201d</p><p>The girls huddle together, but I stay on the outskirts, not really caring. They\u2019re arguing, calling out all sorts of ridiculous themes. \u201cTitanic!\u201d \u201cChristmas in May!\u201d \u201cParis!\u201d \u201cVegas!\u201d \u201cCowboys and Aliens!\u201d</p><p>Sam slips two fingers in his mouth and whistles. \u201cParker made the winning play. Let\u2019s hear what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAncient Rome,\u201d I say, grinning, thinking about the theme Sam has been jockeying for. \u201cThe decorations can be fake columns and gold lights and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that idea,\u201d Allie says, and Mel nods.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Disney?\u201d Laura asks, bouncing on her toes.</p> <p>\u201cI dressed as Sleeping Beauty when I was, like, five,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cIt\u2019s been done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we pick Ancient Rome, we\u2019ll all get to wear beautiful white gowns and crowns of ivy,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cI love that!\u201d Allie says.</p><p>\u201cI can wear my gold strappy sandals,\u201d Mel replies.</p><p>\u201cI have a white chiffon dress,\u201d Chelsea Clark says.</p><p>And the guys can show up in togas. I grin to myself.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Allie says. \u201cThe theme is Ancient Rome.\u201d</p><p>He gapes and says in mock horror, \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea.\u201d Under his breath, he says to me, \u201cNice one.\u201d</p><p>Will lets out a laugh and gives me a quick smile, revealing the dimple I haven\u2019t seen in weeks.</p><p>I grab my bat bag and head toward my parents, running into Mr. and Mrs. Whitfield on the way. Bo\u2019s curled up in his mom\u2019s arms, playing with her necklace and sucking his thumb.</p><p>Mr. Whitfield shakes my hand. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you made that double play. It was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to come over for dinner sometime soon,\u201d his wife says. \u201cIt was so nice of you to give Bo a birthday present. Do you have something to say to Parker?\u201d Mrs. Whitfield asks him.</p><p>He takes his thumb out of his mouth. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, then deposits the thumb right back where it was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201d It surprises me that the Whitfields are speaking to me, considering all the rumors flying around about what happened with Brian. I move to walk off but Mrs. Whitfield speaks again.</p><p>\u201cWe miss seeing you around,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cWill hasn\u2019t said as much, but he\u2019s been down.\u201d</p><p>I give her a quick smile. \u201cI miss him too,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>Trey is yanking on his mother\u2019s jeans and yelling something about a trip to McDonald\u2019s, so I excuse myself and go meet Dad and Mom. Her hug feels like the warmest blanket on the coldest night. Thanks, God, for giving her back.</p><p>going the distance</p><p>18 years old</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>I pull the dress out of the box and hold it in front of my body. It\u2019s covered in blue and white flowers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a vintage ballerina dress. From the 1950s,\u201d Mom says, taking the full-bodied skirt between her fingers. \u201cI figure you can wear it to graduation. We\u2019ll probably have to get it altered.\u201d</p><p>Dad looks pleased. He sips his coffee. I carefully place the dress back in its box.</p><p>\u201cThis is from me,\u201d Ryan says, pushing a gift bag across the table.</p><p>I dig through the pink tissue paper to find an envelope containing a gift certificate for a mani-pedi at Elizabeth Arden. \u201cThanks! It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>A smile flits across his face. I open Dad\u2019s present next. It\u2019s a new iPhone, something we can\u2019t even begin to afford.</p><p>I\u2019m grinning like crazy. \u201cDad, this is too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2014your mom and I went in on it together.\u201d I jump out of my chair to give both of my parents a hug. Ryan lets me hug him too, and I\u2019m happy that my family\u2019s together again. Maybe not in the way I wish we were together, but it\u2019s close enough.</p><p>\u201cCake and ice cream?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I reply, thinking I might eat the entire piece. I\u2019m still not used to big portions, but I\u2019ll try. I blow out the candles, and the four of us dig into Mom\u2019s red velvet cake with cream cheese icing.</p><p>I hear a rap on the door. I swallow a bite of cake and go to answer it. I find Drew standing there. He hasn\u2019t knocked in years; he always lets himself right in.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, stepping onto the porch. Moths flit around the porch light.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d he says, passing me a gift wrapped in silvery paper. It makes me happy that he remembered.</p><p>\u201cIs this from you?\u201d I ask, hardly believing he got me a birthday present.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He takes a step back and hops to the grass, avoiding my face.</p><p>\u201cShould I open it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the gift. I glance up at him. \u201cThank you. I\u2019d better get back inside.\u201d I point over my shoulder at the house.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Good night.\u201d I step inside as he says, \u201cWait. I know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth about what?\u201d I reply, facing him again.</p><p>He slips his hands into his pockets. \u201cThat nothing had happened between you and Corndog. He told me the truth.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly and bite on my lower lip, running my fingers over the silver wrapping paper.</p><p>\u201cI just needed some time...to process everything, you know?\u201d he says, glancing at my face.</p><p>I sit down Indian-style on the top stair of our stoop and slice open the envelope. Drew grabs a seat on the bottom step.</p><p>Before I read the card, I think about how Drew left me a couple weeks ago when I needed him most. How I\u2019ve gotten stronger. He acted just like Laura did, and I\u2019m not sure I want to have another friendship like hers, where the friend dictates everything. But Drew stayed with me when Mom went away. He only left me when his feelings were hurt terribly. I could\u2019ve handled it better. Now he\u2019s back, and that sort of counts for everything.</p><p>The card reads, It\u2019s not a real safari on the Serengeti, but it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got. Drew</p><p>I take a breath. I slowly unwrap the silver paper to find a wooden kaleidoscope. I angle it toward the light and twist it, watching the red, purple, orange and blue spiral and mesh together. Animal shapes fill my field of vision. A giraffe, a hippo, and a turtle.</p><p>Maybe all friendships don\u2019t fizzle. Maybe, like the kaleidoscope, the colors just change.</p><p>In the library, I use the first part of lunch to Google Brian\u2019s name. Nothing new comes up, even if I restrict the search timeline down to the past month. Where is he? Did he find a job? Does he think of me? Does he hate me for the part I played in him losing his job? The part I played in the rumors? I think if I had one sign that Brian\u2019s doing okay, the guilt might dissipate a bit. But for now it\u2019s raging in my blood.</p><p>I look at the picture of him from when he played ball for Georgia Tech. Smile at his smile. Wherever he is, I hope he\u2019s happy.</p><p>I exit out of Google.</p><p>I go sit in the magazine room and start eating ham and Swiss on whole wheat, openly reading this awesome regency romance about gay dukes who have a thing for each other. I should loan it to Drew and Tate.</p><p>The idea brings a smile to my face. That\u2019s when Allie slowly approaches me, tangling her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I flash the paperback\u2019s front at her. I don\u2019t care who the hell sees. I love romance novels. She raises her eyebrows at the two shirtless buff men.</p><p>\u201cCan I join you?\u201d she says, gesturing at the chair across from me.</p><p>Months ago, I would\u2019ve killed for her to ask that. But now? Eh. I care more about the two dukes than her. I do want friends. But I want friends who didn\u2019t abandon me when I needed them most.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather read alone,\u201d I tell her. \u201cRain check?\u201d</p><p>She chews on her lip. \u201cDefinitely. Yeah. See you.\u201d She trudges off, peeking over her shoulder at me, and I go back to my sandwich and book and drown myself in nineteenth-century London.</p><p>Best lunch date I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>Dad wakes me up on Sunday morning by pounding on my door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I blurt, burying my face in the pillow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s church time.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, suit yourself.\u201d He kisses my forehead, then pauses. \u201cI sent Veena an email asking if she\u2019ll come back to church.\u201d</p><p>I smile into the pillow, where Dad can\u2019t see. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea. Wish I\u2019d thought of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSmart aleck,\u201d Dad says with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cDid she write back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I peek up and tell him I love him.</p> <p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he replies, then disappears out the door.</p><p>I snuggle deeper under my covers. Dad respected my decision not to go. I can\u2019t believe it. I still have no idea why Dad continues to go to church. None. But he has a reason, and I should be okay with that, whatever it is. I hope Veena shows today\u2014Dad\u2019s email is kind of a big deal. I bet it took a lot of courage to write to her like that. It kinda reminds me of the times Tate would call, to see why I wasn\u2019t at church. It\u2019s funny\u2014I doubt his parents would care that much if he quit attending services and Sunday school. He must go for his own reasons. Maybe he likes hanging out on the playground and eating stale doughnuts. Maybe he likes organ music. Maybe he likes stained glass windows.</p><p>Maybe he likes praying silently.</p><p>Or hanging out with me.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I yell, hopping out of bed and yelling down the hall. \u201cDad, give me two minutes! I\u2019m coming with you!\u201d</p> <p>Spending time with Tate, who became a real friend when I wasn\u2019t even watching, is a good reason to go. And I need to tell him about the pre-prom dinner reservations I made at Parthenon.</p><p>Plus, it\u2019ll make Dad happy, and that makes me smile.</p><p>The gym is decorated with fake Corinthian columns and lots of ivy and gold leaves and whatnot. Sam Henry\u2019s wearing a toga that sparkles \u00e0 la Edward Cullen. His girlfriend, Jordan, is carrying a spear, and a bronzed shield is slung over her shoulder. Her blond hair is pulled up into a high ponytail. I can\u2019t believe she dressed up as a gladiator!</p><p>Bunches of dead Romans are probably rolling over in their graves.</p><p>\u201cMan, our prom sucked compared to this,\u201d Tate says.</p><p>\u201cYou just wanted to wear a toga,\u201d I reply.</p> <p>Tate grins. \u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>I smile down at him. \u201cPunch?\u201d</p><p>He takes my hand, and we make our way to the refreshments table, not caring a lick about the people staring at us. He\u2019s four inches shorter than me, and he\u2019s wearing gold Converses to match his gold wreath and bracelets. Tate went all out.</p><p>He uses a ladle to pour me some frothy red punch, and then we go sit down at a table together. \u201cThanks for bringing me,\u201d he says, leaning close to my face. I notice him glancing around the gym.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for Drew?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He nods, sucking on his lip. \u201cThere\u2019s Will,\u201d Tate says, elbowing me.</p><p>He comes into the gym, wearing a ring of ivy on his head, straightening his crisp white toga. His arms are muscular and tan. He nearly trips over the long folds of cloth. I bring my fingers to my lips to cover my giggles.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t bring a date?\u201d Tate asks. He puts a hand on my forearm.</p> <p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d I sip my punch, hoping he didn\u2019t bring Kate Kelly. An ache fills my chest. From across the gym, his eyes meet mine. I remember Mom\u2019s words: All that matters is what you want. What you need. But I\u2019m not sure that I deserve him. I hurt him bad.</p><p>Bottoms up. I gulp down my punch. \u201cWill you excuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you excuse me?\u201d he asks, focusing on Drew, who\u2019s dancing with Amy.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I lift my skirts and edge around couples slow-dancing, keeping my breath steady as I head toward Will. I stop a few feet away and play nervously with my hair.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say.</p><p>He nods once and stares at the band. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see Sam Henry? His toga is sparkly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Will gets up on tiptoes and scans the crowd. A look of revulsion crosses his face. \u201cHe never ceases to surprise me.\u201d</p><p>I rock on my feet. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing Jordan puts up with his silliness.\u201d</p><p>He lifts a shoulder. \u201cShe loves him.\u201d</p><p>Sam has his arms wrapped around her from behind. He\u2019s whispering in her ear and she looks so pissed, but it\u2019s a game they play all the time. Whatever he said makes her whip around and threaten him with her spear, then they\u2019re kissing softly and dancing. The way they\u2019re so natural together makes me envious.</p><p>I say, \u201cLove makes you stupid sometimes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure does.\u201d Will\u2019s tone is harsh.</p><p>I give him a tiny smile. \u201cI just wanted to say hi. Have a great prom, and I\u2019ll see you at graduation, \u2019kay?\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. \u201cOkay. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Pain rocks my chest. I leave him there and look for Tate. I find him talking with Drew. They\u2019re sitting at a table together, alone except for the flickering candles surrounding them. I fold my arms and smile, hoping they\u2019ll figure out if they like each other enough to risk being together. To risk facing all their friends and family and the church and the world. If he and Tate fall for each other, I\u2019ll be happy for Drew, and that\u2019s enough for me.</p><p>I pull my cell out of my purse and send Tate a quick text. Have fun. I\u2019ll be outside. Then I send Mom a text. Join me at prom?</p><p>She came to town this morning, to help me get ready. We spent the afternoon at a spa in Nashville. It was the most fun I\u2019ve had in a long time. We both got French manis and pedis, and Mom said she thought I look beautiful. I think I do too.</p><p>Outside the gym, I sit on the steps and admire an oak tree, its leaves rustling in the warm wind. I prop my chin on my knees. Watch the fireflies. Listen to the crickets. I never imagined I\u2019d come to senior prom to sit alone outside on hard concrete steps. I think about the whole world and wonder if anyone is out there for me. I shut my eyes and pray.</p><p>God, I don\u2019t want anything from you. I\u2019m only saying thanks for giving me my mom back. Even though now I know she was never gone. And neither were you. I\u2019m not happy that you had to test my faith this way, but you showed me what I needed most: Mom. Thanks for that.</p><p>A couple minutes later, she drives up and parks by the curb, then hops out of the car, sporting slim jeans and a white tank top. Her brown hair hangs long around her shoulders. She looks happy and beautiful. She sits down beside me and hooks her arm in mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I just wanted to see you.\u201d I clutch her arm and check out the stars.</p><p>She rests her head against mine. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to Drew. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s no one else you want to hang out with in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Well, maybe Will, but I need to move on...It sucks that everything probably would\u2019ve worked out with him, you know, if I\u2019d acted normal after you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d gotten to know him before this happened,\u201d Mom murmurs.</p><p>My stomach grumbles.</p><p>\u201cIce cream?\u201d she asks with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWe should buy a banana split to share.\u201d</p><p>Mom stands and puts out a hand. I get to my feet and wipe the dirt off my dress, then lift my head to find Will standing here watching me.</p><p>I rush to ask, \u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>He cracks his knuckles. \u201cA while.\u201d</p><p>I smooth my dress, and Mom slips an arm around my waist, but doesn\u2019t move to introduce herself or speak.</p><p>But Will, ever the gentleman, extends a hand to her. \u201cMa\u2019am, you might not remember me. I\u2019m Will Whitfield.\u201d</p><p>Mom shakes his hand, not smiling. \u201cI\u2019m Christy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting ice cream,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you arou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he blurts. \u201cI wanted to see if you\u2019ll dance with me...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to your date. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a date.\u201d</p><p>Mom pats my back and goes to lean against her car. Leaving me alone. With him.</p><p>\u201cYou brought a date, huh?\u201d he asks, jerking his head toward the gym.</p><p>\u201cI brought him more for Drew\u2019s sake than mine.\u201d</p><p>Will moves a step closer. His blue eyes focus on mine. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr at least, I tried to be a good friend.\u201d I choke the words out.</p><p>\u201cI know you did,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t a better friend to you. I was messed up. The whole situation was messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d He steps so close I can smell the Downy Mrs. Whitfield must\u2019ve used when she washed his toga.</p><p>\u201cBut you gotta know,\u201d I say, \u201cI started falling for you that night you walked me home from that party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>I whisper, \u201cBecause that night Drew told me he liked you.\u201d</p><p>Will drops his head.</p><p>I say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to him. Not after what he\u2019d just told me. He\u2019s my best friend.\u201d I\u2019m shaking my head and covering my mouth now. Wishing Mom would come take me by the arm and force feed me ice cream.</p><p>\u201cI get why you needed to wait to talk to Drew,\u201d Will says. \u201cAbout me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that you were hurt about Brian and me, but I wish you could\u2019ve trusted me and let me have the time to figure that stuff out. I was going to say yes to prom. I wanted to go with you so bad.\u201d</p><p>His expression fades to soft. There\u2019s a long pause before he says, \u201cAbout that dance?\u201d He rubs his palms together.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at Mom. \u201cJust a sec,\u201d I tell him. Gathering my skirts up in my hands, I zip over to her. \u201cHe wants to dance. Can we get ice cream tomorrow instead?\u201d</p><p>She fluffs my hair. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting up. I\u2019ll want all the details, understand?\u201d She gives me a mischievous smile and a hug.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I whisper into her shoulder.</p><p>I break away from her to find Will crossing his arms over his stomach and a rush of shame washes through me because I hurt him so much. But all I can do is try to be the best me I can be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to dance,\u201d I say.</p><p>We don\u2019t touch each other until we reach center court in the gym, where it feels like hundreds of eyes are focused on us. But I shut them out. This is my dance, and they can\u2019t stop me from enjoying it. A Kenny Chesney song is playing as I stretch my arms around his neck. He sets his hands on my hips, and like in eighth grade, his hands are trembling. We sway back and forth, finding a beat (which is hard \u2019cause his toga is basically a dress and his legs keep getting tangled). I inch closer and closer to him, to rest my head against his partially-covered chest. His hands shake. I pull my arms from around his neck, and he scrunches his eyebrows at me before I place my hands over his, on my waist, to still them. Our eyes meet. I run my fingers up his arms to his neck.</p><p>I catch Drew and Tate checking us out. Drew waves at me, a meek, sincere smile on his face, and goes back to chatting with Tate.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I whisper to Will.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d A smile edges on his mouth.</p><p>\u201cCan we go outside? I don\u2019t want Drew to have to watch us dancing together.\u201d</p><p>He takes my hand and leads me out back into the school parking lot, behind the gym. \u201cYou\u2019re a sweet girl. And a good friend.\u201d Under the street lamps, beside the Dumpsters, he pulls me into a clumsy waltz, the best he can do in his silly toga. He gets a grossed out look on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He glances around at the pavement. \u201cI was wondering where exactly Henry found that hot pink dildo.\u201d</p><p>I slap his chest, making him laugh, and we move closer and closer.</p><p>When we stop, I say, \u201cI kinda lied.\u201d</p> <p>He loosens his grip on me, and begins to pull away, looking hurt, so I get up on tiptoes and lightly peck his lips.
