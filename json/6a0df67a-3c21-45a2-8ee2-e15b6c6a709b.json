My skin feels tight, my blood too hot, and my heart is beating too fast. The smile on my face though? It feels like it will never leave. Never\u2014not once\u2014did I ever think this would be reachable. When I pictured my future, it was always with the acceptance that I would just be cool Uncle Greg, and maybe if I were lucky, I would find someone compatible enough to spend my life with. I didn\u2019t expect love. I had given up that hope years ago.</p><p>Then I met Melissa, and everything I could have settled for went flying out the window. Poof\u2014in an instant, I met my future. I crave her. The feelings she gave me and the love I knew would come from her was all that mattered.</p><p>We haven\u2019t had an easy time of it. There was the time when we almost lost Cohen that I thought I would once again end up with nothing. When I first met Melissa\u2019s nephew, Cohen, that boy had me wrapped around his little awesome finger. Melissa and her mom had raised him since his mom\u2014her sister\u2014had passed away. He was her boy. And now? Now he\u2019s our boy. </p><p>We both went through a tough time after Cohen\u2019s kidnapping. Not only was there a period when I didn\u2019t know if I would get him back, but in the mess of things, we also lost Melissa\u2019s mom.</p><p>But my girl is strong. We overcame together. My girl... My wife, and our beautiful little boy. And now? Now we have a bright future ahead of us. Nothing could top those two in my life. Not a damn thing.</p><p>Until last weekend.</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget the day she came home from visiting her sister and mother\u2019s graves. Normally, that would be something all three of us would do together. Cohen likes to spend time talking to his angels, and I know it gives Melissa some peace to have a place where she feels they are. Somewhere tangible so she can still be with them.</p><p>I watch out the corner of my eye when I hear a car pulling into the driveway. Cohen and I were kicking some serious ninja ass, rolling around in the front lawn, and just enjoying some man time. Melissa has been gone for a while now, so I know before even looking at her beautiful face that she\u2019s home.</p><p>I finally detach Cohen\u2019s small body from where we just conquered our last \u2018bad guy.\u2019 Somehow, that fight had turned into a wrestling and tickling match. Hell, I don\u2019t care what the reason is. If my little dude is laughing, that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>Finally getting loose, I turn and spy Melissa through the windshield. She\u2019s been sitting in her car, just watching us with her blinding smile fully in place. My heart picks up speed when I look into her eyes so full of love for her men.</p><p>\u201cLife doesn\u2019t get any better than this, C-Man.\u201d</p><p>Cohen turns, his big brown eyes twinkling with happiness. \u201cYeah it does. If we had some pizza!\u201d</p><p>I laugh but turn my attention back to Melissa when I hear the car door shut. Cohen doesn\u2019t say anything else, but hell, even he gets stunned silent when she walks into our path.</p><p>She takes her time walking over to us. When she gets close enough, Cohen jumps up, runs and gives her a big hug before he starts dancing around the yard in a battle only he understands. His little arms flap around, his legs kick out, and the biggest grin spreads across his face. She doesn\u2019t even pause. Instead, she walks right up to me and plops her fine ass down in my lap. My arms wrap around her body, and I pull her against my lap, fighting the urge to throw her down and take her hard.</p><p>She laughs, wiggling against my growing erection. Yeah, she knows exactly what she\u2019s up to. She turns, her smile lighting up her face, and leans in and kisses me.</p><p>Resting her forehead against mine, her eyes still holding her smile, she whispers softly words that touch me to my very soul.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a girl, maybe we can come up with something to honor both our sisters.\u201d</p><p>A statement. Not a hypothetical \u2018if we have one in the future\u2019 kind of statement.</p><p>I come out of my daze, my smile wide enough that my face hurts, and get ready to climb out of my truck. I know that the second that I step foot into the office the guys will take one look at me and know. They may not know what\u2019s got me smiling like an idiot, but they will know something significant has happened. It\u2019s not easy keeping something so life changing to myself. But with news like this, I can\u2019t wait to share. Hell, I would be screaming from the rafters, taking out ads in the local paper, maybe even a few billboards if I could.</p><p>I lock up the truck, and before I can even take a step, I hear him.</p><p>\u201cGregory!\u201d</p><p>I smile at Sway and walk over to where he\u2019s standing outside of his shop.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Sway?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019What\u2019s going on,\u2019 he says? Oh nothing much, you gorgeous man. Just sitting here, minding my own business, when I see you pull in, park, and just sit there with that delicious smile happening. That\u2019s what is happening, Gregory! Blinding me with all that yumminess all the way into my salon.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s standing there, hands on his hips, tapping one red leather-booted foot, his long blond hair falling over his shoulder and the ever-present naughty gleam in his eyes. No shame at all in the fact that I\u2019m pretty sure he just took all my clothes off as I walked across the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking about me naked, Sway,\u201d I guffaw. \u201cI got some good news this weekend. You can\u2019t wipe this smile off if you tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gregory... That sounds like an invitation to try.\u201d We both laugh, but truth be told, I doubt there is anything that can knock me off my high. \u201cWell? Are you going to tell Sway what has you all happilicious?\u201d</p><p>Happilicious? The hell?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re something else, Sway.\u201d I laugh, shaking my head. \u201cMelissa told me this weekend that we\u2019re pregnant. Well...she\u2019s pregnant, but you know what I mean.\u201d Even saying it out loud brings a fresh round of pure fucking joy to flush through my system.</p><p>My girl. Pregnant.</p><p>\u201cOhhhhh! A baby!\u201d Sway starts going on and on about Uncle Sway this, baby showers that, and that is when I take my cue to leave.</p><p>Right when I open my mouth to tell him bye, I hear it. Clapping coming from behind me. Turning, I find them. Axel, Beck, Coop, and Maddox are all clapping like demented seals with smiles front and center. Even Maddox has a grin on his normally stoic face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCongratulations, brother. Didn\u2019t know it was possible with all those holes and rings you have through your dick,\u201d Beck spouts.</p><p>\u201cWould have thought with as many as he\u2019s rocking, that those little swimmers wouldn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d laughs Axel.</p><p>I start to chuckle until I hear a gasp of pleasure coming from behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat! Gregory, what is this?\u201d I turn to see Sway dramatically fanning his face, his eyes zoned in on my crotch.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t this just lovely. I was apparently wrong; there is something that could wipe the smile clear off my face.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Sway,\u201d I say, trying my best for a stern voice while leveling the four morons with my hardest \u2018shut the fuck up\u2019 look.</p><p>\u201cGregory Cage, do you have piercings?\u201d he practically pants.</p><p>Shit. \u201cThanks a lot, jackasses,\u201d I grind out. They all laugh. Even Maddox is laughing so hard that he has tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow far of a stretch is it that you\u2019ll forget you heard that?\u201d I ask Sway.</p> <p>\u201cOh, darling. I\u2019ll forget that juicy piece of yum the day that pigs learn to fly. And to think, I thought you were the straight-laced one of the bunch. Who knew you were hiding all of that?\u201d His eyes roam over my body before landing right on my crotch again.</p><p>Jesus Christ. </p><p>\u201cSway, I\u2019m a married man now. Stop thinking about my dick.\u201d</p><p>Really, as annoyed as I am with the idiots still laughing by the door to our office, Sway\u2019s face really is comical. A mix between shock and awe.</p><p>\u201cPlus, Maddox has one too. Lust over him. He\u2019s single.\u201d I laugh before pushing my way through the group. They\u2019re all laughing even harder now\u2014except for Maddox.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh! Congratulations, Greg!\u201d Emmy screams when I walk through the front lobby. She politely ignores the fact that the whole state of Georgia may know about my piercings now. \u201cI bet you, Melissa, and Cohen are thrilled!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Em. We couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d I give her a warm smile and hug. We chat for a few minutes before I continue down the hall. It doesn\u2019t take long before the four amigos are filing in. I should have seen it coming. No way they would leave it all at the door. Literally.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Coop asks.</p><p>\u201cWell, what, asshat?\u201d I throw back before dropping down in my chair.</p><p>\u201cCongrats, man. Izzy told me last night,\u201d Axel interrupts, at least having the decency not to mention my junk again.</p><p>\u201cWell what, my ass. All the shit you have jammed through your dick and you still knocked her up?\u201d My answering growl is enough to have Coop shut his mouth and hold his hands up. \u201cJust asking, dude. I thought Dee was full of shit when she mentioned all that party you are rocking in your pants.\u201d He laughs and wags his brows at me.</p><p>\u201cYou really need to learn how to shut up. Or maybe buy a filter,\u201d Beck says in a loud whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Can you honestly tell me you aren\u2019t the least bit interested in why he has all that going on?\u201d</p><p>Beck just shakes his head at Coop, choosing to ignore his ridiculous question.</p> <p>Smart man.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I don\u2019t make it a habit of thinking about his dick at all.\u201d Axel laughs, sitting in one of the chairs next to my desk and picking up a stress ball. \u201cBut while we\u2019re on the topic, what in the hell compelled you to do that shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we really going to do this? Should we whip them out and compare sizes while we\u2019re at it?\u201d I run my hand through my hair in frustration. Ever since word of my piercings got out, I\u2019ve had a feeling that this would be coming.</p><p>Maddox finally chimes in, a wicked grin forming. \u201cNo need for that! I know mine trumps all you little boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d Coop mocks and stands, making to unzip his pants.</p><p>\u201cIf you pull that shit out in my office, I will cut you.\u201d</p><p>He wisely sits back down when I reach for my scissors.</p><p>\u201cAll right. If you really need to know, I lost a bet. An old friend of mine bet me I wouldn\u2019t do it, then stepped up the bet that I wouldn\u2019t get more than him. So I got wasted, and the rest is history. Melissa loves them, so all in all it\u2019s the best bet I ever lost. The end.\u201d</p><p>They all just look at me. Maddox is the first to break the silence. \u201cYou guys should take notes. As funny as you think it is, the ladies love it. Congrats on the baby, brother.\u201d And with that, he leaves the room.</p><p>I get a few more mumbled congratulations before Beck and Coop get up and leave. Axel never moves from his seat, still just throwing that damn ball up in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can tell you have something to say.\u201d I lean back and get ready to hear him out.</p><p>\u201cDid you really have to put ideas in Izzy\u2019s head? She now has some brilliant idea that I need some... What did she call it? Oh yeah, \u2018Trifecta of vaginal bliss.\u2019 What in the hell does that shit mean?\u201d</p><p>I throw my head back and laugh so hard my sides cramp up. \u201cDo those women tell each other everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so. And, Greg, I don\u2019t want to hear about your dick anymore.\u201d</p><p>We talk for a while before he gets serious again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you. For all three of you. I know you, and I know this wasn\u2019t ever even on your radar. But, brother, this looks good on you.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, my heart feels full to capacity, my skin feels tight, and that damn smile that\u2019s so big it hurts comes rushing back to the surface.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I may not have ever dreamt of this life for myself, but I finally feel like I have everything. There isn\u2019t anything that can take this feeling from us.</p><p>Chapter 2\u2014Greg\u2014Six Months Later</p><p>\u201cDaddddy!\u201d</p><p>Ah. And now the fun begins.</p><p>I left Cohen sitting on my bed, harmlessly watching some ridiculous cartoon so that I could jump in the shower. We\u2019re running late, but that\u2019s pretty typical when Melissa leaves us to our own devices. What does she expect? The \u2018bad guys\u2019 won\u2019t kill themselves, blanket forts can\u2019t be constructed in a split second, and Lego fortresses won\u2019t build themselves. My boy needs to have some one-on-one time with his dad, and with the twins fast approaching we\u2019re squeezing in every second of \u2018man time\u2019 that we can. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile, drying off as quickly as possible before grabbing my boxer briefs. The last time I made the mistake of forgetting to grab some before I jumped in the shower, I swear Cohen spent an hour talking about wiener-rings after that. Melissa thinks it\u2019s hilarious, but I keep envisioning my little dude going to school and announcing to his class that he wants to have earrings in his wiener because his daddy does. That shouldn\u2019t make pick-up awkward.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Daddy, DADDY!\u201d</p><p>When I step out of the bathroom the first thing I see is Cohen jumping on the bed, his little arms flapping wildly and his ever-present cape flying behind him. With a smile, I hook his little body around the waist with my arm and toss him in the air. Pretty soon he\u2019s not going to be small enough for me to toss around, and just the thought of him growing up too quickly makes my chest tighten.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, little dude?\u201d</p><p>His tiny hands cup my face, pulling me closer until our noses touch. \u201cDaddy,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I bring my hands up and frame his head, rubbing our noses slightly. \u201cCohen,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>He giggles, his smile growing larger. \u201cMommy has a funny belly now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, little man, she sure does. But, Mommy has your sisters in her funny belly, and pretty soon they\u2019re going to be here and she won\u2019t have that belly anymore.\u201d</p><p>His brows crinkle for a second while he processes this. It doesn\u2019t take long before he asks the question I\u2019ve known was coming.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCohen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is mommy going to get my babies out of her funny belly?\u201d</p><p>Shit. This isn\u2019t something Melissa covered. </p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>His face loses all traces of confusion and his crooked little smile takes its place.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know! I\u2019m going to ask Dilbert! Dilbert knows everything, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>Damn, Sway! There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m going to let Sway\u2014also referred to by his given name, Dilbert, by only Cohen\u2014give my son sex-ed. I can picture it now. Sway would have Cohen out of his cape and into a wig and heels in no time.</p><p>\u201cCome here, son.\u201d I take a seat on the bed and hold my arms out, waiting for Cohen to crawl into my lap. His little knees almost take out my dick a few times, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve lost my nuts. He finally settles, sitting on his shins with his knees pressed painfully into my thighs and his tiny hands holding on to my shoulders. \u201cAll right, little man. When Mommy has your sisters, the doctor is going to give her a shot so she doesn\u2019t feel anything. Then she\u2019s going to lie down, and the doctor will carefully take your sisters out. It\u2019s all big doctor secrets, and no one will tell Daddy. They even put up a special blue wall that makes it invisible.\u201d</p><p>With every word I speak, his mocha-colored eyes grow larger and larger. His mouth is hanging open, and the look on his face is nothing short of amazed. Yeah, I know Cohen, and there isn\u2019t anything he loves more than a big mystery.</p><p>\u201cYou with me, C-Man?\u201d I laugh, tickling his sides. </p><p>He giggles, jumps down with a large chant of excitement, and takes off to find the magical invisible wall.</p><p>\u201cCohen, get your shoes on! I promised your mommy we wouldn\u2019t be late.\u201d I can hear him banging around the house, hopefully on the way to his shoes.</p><p>It takes Cohen and me forever, as usual, to get out of the house. He couldn\u2019t find his sneakers, so my kid is rocking his red cape, jeans, a tee, and bright orange rain boots. It hasn\u2019t rained in Georgia in what feels like years, but Cohen\u2019s wearing those damn boots with pride. When we walk into the restaurant where we\u2019re meeting everyone, my eyes immediately take in my beautiful wife so that I don\u2019t miss a second of her reaction to our boy\u2019s outfit.</p> <p>As she\u2019s mid-sentence with Asher, her eyes grow as wide as her beautiful belly, and her hand shoots up to cover her mouth. I can clearly see the laughter shining bright in her eyes from across the dimly lit room. It\u2019s not abnormal for Cohen to end up looking like a misfit when I\u2019m in charge of getting him ready. At least it\u2019s better than last weekend\u2019s bathing suit, tank top that said \u2018my uncle is cooler than yours\u2019\u2014thank you, Maddox\u2014his cape, and a damn sombrero.</p><p>Cohen takes off the second he spots Nate, Axel and Izzy\u2019s son, sitting at the end of the table next to his mother. Even with almost two years between those two, they are thick as thieves. I laugh when Cohen immediately starts flailing his arms around and moving around in the wild movements he\u2019s so fond of. Nate lets out a laugh so loud that a few diners around the table look over with smiles.</p><p>I greet the table, getting friendly welcomes from the ladies in the group and the normal chin lifts and grunts from the guys. </p><p>I walk over to Melissa, gently pull her into my arms, and hold her close. I can feel my girls rolling around in her belly when she presses closer.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d she says, her lips a breath away from mine, just begging for me to close the distance.</p><p>\u201cHey back.\u201d I pull her close and savor the taste of her on my tongue. I feel her lips tip up, and her moan tingles against my lips. Yeah, my girl missed me today.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, just a wild guess here, but maybe those two will remember we aren\u2019t in their bedroom, the porn music isn\u2019t playing on a loop, and it probably isn\u2019t the wisest move to start molesting each other in the family restaurant?\u201d</p><p>I break away from Melissa\u2019s lips, licking my own when I see the fire burning bright in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ash,\u201d I growl and give my wife one more chaste kiss before helping her take her seat again.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Shut up, Ash,\u2019 he says. No, \u2018thank you, Ash, for reminding me that I can\u2019t drive the boat into the canal in the middle of family dinner\u2019?\u201d</p><p>It takes me a second. For one, I can\u2019t stop looking at him as if he\u2019s lost his damn mind, but mainly he sounds so much like Coop right now that I have to remind myself who is speaking to me.</p><p>\u201cHA! You just called his...hotdog a boat!\u201d Dee starts laughing so hard she\u2019s bent over, banging the table with her fist.</p><p>Beck just shakes his head with a smile, looking at his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s actions.</p><p>\u201cI bet it\u2019s more like a tugboat!\u201d Izzy chimes in, gaining Axel\u2019s and Chelcie\u2019s laughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeriously? A tugboat?\u201d I should have known better than to let them get the best of me, but really, my pride wouldn\u2019t let me sit there with them calling my dick a tugboat. Melissa\u2019s hand rubs my leg, trying to keep me from giving these fools what they want.</p><p>\u201cNo, no...you\u2019re right. I was too generous with the boat analogy. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re still paddling around with something more like a canoe, right?\u201d Ash smirks before taking a big gulp of his beer.</p><p>\u201cFucking canoe,\u201d I grumble under my breath.</p><p>\u201cCanoe might be giving him a little too much. Don\u2019t they make starter kayaks? Nice and short. Not much girth to those suckers!\u201d I gape at Dee, only making her laugh louder.</p> <p>Melissa laughs under her breath. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we really sitting around, discussing the size of my wiener?\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s eyes get as large as saucers before she covers her mouth with her hand and bursts out laughing. It takes me a second to figure out why the hell she\u2019s joining in with a table full of laughter at me calling my dick a wiener because I\u2019m too busy looking at her belly bouncing with each giggle that escapes.</p><p>\u201cDaddy! You said wiener!\u201d My head shoots over to Cohen, who is currently standing in his chair and pointing at me with a big smile on his face.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure that every single person in the restaurant is looking over at us now. The whole situation gets even more ridiculous when two-year-old Nate starts banging his sippy cup on the table, chanting, \u201cWiener, wiener, wiener!\u201d over and over.</p> <p>\u201cJesus Christ, kill me now.\u201d I cross my arms over my chest and wait for everyone to stop laughing so we can get this dinner over with and I can take my wife home.</p><p>Melissa leans over, kisses my cheek and whispers in my ear, \u201cI love you\u2014and your tugboat.\u201d</p><p>Turning my head before she can lean back in her seat, I frame her face in my hands and bring her lips back to mine in a kiss hot enough to burn the building down. Pulling back, I look into her dazed eyes, let a smile full of wicked promise take over, and growl when her face goes soft and her eyes shine bright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you tonight just what kind of machine I\u2019ve got between my legs, Beauty.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flame, she closes her eyes on a moan, and right before she turns back to the table, I hear her mutter, \u201cBeast\u201d under her breath.</p><p>We\u2019ve been lucky with her pregnancy so far. According to her doctor, we can continue our sex life\u2014just a little more carefully. Thank Christ. I\u2019m not sure I could last seeing her like this and not be able to sink deep inside her body.</p> <p>The rest of the dinner passes by with more laughter\u2014not at my expense\u2014loud conversation, and a whole lot of love. These are the moments with my family and friends that I remember just how blessed I am.</p><p>I look around the table, feeling a pang in my heart from knowing that we\u2019re missing some important people. After we lost Coop, we decided there wouldn\u2019t be a week that passed without having a family dinner at least once. It wasn\u2019t easy at first. The first few months, Asher was more or less a ghost, sitting there and drinking his dinner in whatever he could grab. He\u2019s come a long way, but I can still see the fire to avenge his brother burning deep within him.</p><p>Maddox has been to a few here and there, but he\u2019s made it clear that until he can get Emmy back home he won\u2019t be around. It\u2019s been about two weeks since he took off after her, and last I heard, things weren\u2019t going well. Having both of them gone has left a large void in our group.</p><p>And of course I can\u2019t forget Sway, who is usually always at our family dinners. Tonight he\u2019s taking Davey out on their first date, and he explained, with way too much detail, why he wouldn\u2019t be joining us tonight.</p><p>Looking around the table again, catching Axel\u2019s and Beck\u2019s eyes as they make their own sweep of the table, I know that they\u2019re thinking the same thing. So much has changed within our tight-knit group over the last few years. Even with the added members in our \u2018family,\u2019 the loss of the ones who aren\u2019t here is very much still felt.</p><p>I tip my chin at the guys, grabbing my drink and holding it up briefly before taking a long swallow. Even with the parts of this last year that have tried each and every one of us, I can\u2019t help but pray that the worst is behind us. I\u2019m not sure if this group can handle another loss.</p><p>Melissa\u2019s soft laughter brings me back from my thoughts and I look over to see her smiling at Asher. Of course, the playboy has his charms on bright tonight. He needs a shock collar to remind him not to flirt with my woman.</p><p>I throw my arm around the back of her chair and pull her closer to my side, leveling Asher with my darkest look before speaking, \u201cMine.\u201d</p> <p>He throws his head back and laughs, drawing more attention from the surrounding tables. \u201cGot it, Fido. Would you like to piss all over her now too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, you beast.\u201d Melissa laughs.</p><p>\u201cCalm down? Melissa, I hate to break it to you, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever going to calm down when it comes to you.\u201d I look over at Izzy, smiling my thanks for her rational thinking.</p><p>\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t it adorable?\u201d</p><p>My head shoots back to Melissa. Adorable? Puppies are adorable. Babies are adorable... I am not adorable.</p><p>Bringing my lips to her ear, I lick and pull her lobe in my mouth before whispering softly and reminding her just how much my adorable tugboat can\u2019t wait to get her home, naked, and screaming in pleasure.</p><p>Fucking adorable.</p><p>Chapter 3 \u2013 Greg</p><p>\u201cDeeper... Harder, please.\u201d</p><p>I pull back slowly, feeling her walls clamp down on my dick before pushing forward again. Not as hard as she wants, but deep enough that I can feel her womb kiss the tip of my dick.</p><p>Looking down at my dick as it slowly pushes in and out of Melissa\u2019s soaked pussy has my balls drawing in tight, begging for release.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Greg, I need it deeper.\u201d I ignore her begging, continuing my slow and torturous ministrations. God, I love the feeling of her walls hugging my dick. Feeling her body take mine is the most incredible sensation in the world. Having her slick walls clamp down when she\u2019s as close as she is right now, the wetness from her arousal coating both of us... Yeah, it doesn\u2019t get any better than this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With one more push, I bury myself to the root, rolling my hips and groaning when I feel a surge of wetness. She\u2019s close. I could end this right now. I\u2019m that close to finding my own release, but I want to make her scream again before I take mine.</p><p>I move my hands, which were tightly holding her hips, and run them up her spine. The feeling of her silky smooth skin under my fingertips has me rocking my hips, grinding against her body. I\u2019ll never get enough of this woman. My hands finish their journey when I reach her shoulders, curling my fingers, letting her know that I want her to come up off her elbows.</p><p>We don\u2019t need words anymore. Our bodies know each other so well that all it takes is a few touches, and the rest follows. She comes up on her knees, bringing her arm over her head and grabbing the back of my neck to bring my mouth to hers. Our kiss is nothing short of brutally crazed. Our tongues and teeth nip and lick in a fierce battle of control. Our tongues duel in a dance that sends tingles straight down my spine and wraps a claw-like vise around my balls.</p><p>I bring one arm around her chest, palming one perfectly full breast and tweaking her tight nipple with my thumb. My other arm snakes around her middle, caressing her belly lovingly before trailing down her tight skin until I hit her slick heat and her wetness leaks around my fingertips. Giving her a few quick thrusts, I feel myself glide into her welcoming body effortlessly, causing a growl to rumble from deep within my throat.</p><p>\u201cNothing feels better than your pussy soaking my dick.\u201d</p><p>She moans against my lips, whimpering when I pull out again. \u201cPlease, baby, take me harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I know what she wants, and I also know that it\u2019s killing her not to try and take control. I put the brakes on our rough lovemaking almost two months ago. I don\u2019t care what the doctors say. There is no damn way I\u2019m going to chance taking her too roughly and hurting my girls. No. Won\u2019t happen. It\u2019s been the only sore spot between us the last few weeks. Melissa wants it hard, and I won\u2019t... I can\u2019t give that to her.</p><p>\u201cGreg...\u201d She tries to push back, but my arms hold her firm.</p><p>\u201cHush, Beauty, and let me love you.\u201d</p><p>I continue to love her, pushing in with an achingly slow pace before pulling out almost to the point of falling free from her body before repeating the process. I know that she\u2019s enjoying it. I can feel the proof running down my shaft. Her moans don\u2019t lie. She might crave a rough roll in the sheets, but as long as I can make her scream, I\u2019m still doing it right.</p><p>\u201cGreg...killing me... Need you...hard.\u201d She gasps between thrusts, her cunt gripping me tight with each begged word that crosses her lips, testing my patience like none other.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The rumble of her protest vibrating against my chest is the only warning I get before she stuns me to my ass. Literally.</p><p>She pushes back hard, her ass hitting my hips and my dick falling from her warm body. In a move that shouldn\u2019t look that easy for a seven-months-pregnant woman\u2014with twins, no less\u2014she has her body turned around and her small hands pushing against my chest until I fall to my back. Right there in the middle of our king-sized bed, I watch as my woman comes to life above me.</p><p>We\u2019ve been as conservative as it gets the last month or so of her pregnancy. The bigger the girls get, the harder almost every position gets. It\u2019s pretty much down to me taking her from behind, standing beside the bed so that I don\u2019t crush the girls, or lying there while she rides me the best she can with the weight of her belly throwing her off balance. You won\u2019t hear me complain. I\u2019ll take it however she wants to give it to me. Except for the one way she\u2019s been begging to for the last three weeks.</p><p>My girl wants me to fuck her brains out. No more of this slow and torturous lovemaking. Not for Melissa. No, she wants me to fuck her raw, and it scares the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of you treating me like I\u2019m spun from glass. News flash, Greg Cage\u2014I\u2019m not going to break. Your massive dick isn\u2019t going to thump a baby on the head, scar her for life, or poke a hole in her head. But what your dick is going to do is get the hell inside me and fuck me hard!\u201d</p><p>I stare up at her as she climbs onto my body. Her face flushed, tits full and swaying with her movements, and her gorgeous body ripe with pregnancy, as she moves over my throbbing dick and impales herself roughly. She throws her head back, her hands going to my thighs and her pussy clenching and rippling around my straining erection.</p><p>\u201cShit...\u201d I hiss, my hands shooting to her hips to help steady her movements. She doesn\u2019t even notice me, her body using mine for everything she\u2019s been craving.</p><p>I watch, fighting my body to not come instantly as she lets loose and takes what she wants. Her body rides me with ease. With each downward grind, she rolls her hips, and I feel her walls quiver. It doesn\u2019t take long before I can feel her cream leaking out and running down my balls, her movements becoming choppier. Her breathing speeds up and her rhythm falters. I quickly take over so that she doesn\u2019t overdo it.</p><p>Holding her hips steady, I begin pumping my hips with the powerful thrusts she\u2019s been begging for. Her arms shoot forward, bracing her weight against my chest when she can no longer hold herself up without help. Her fingers curl, and her nails break the skin, instantly my balls start to pull tight at the blinding pleasure her pain causes.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me. Let me feel you suck my dick deep with your tight pussy. Come on... Give it to me, Beauty.\u201d</p><p>She sucks in a shallow breath, her eyes locking with mine for a second before she throws her head back and screams her pleasure. I pull her against my dick, her wetness soaking me as I erupt deep within her tight body. </p> <p>I move us so that we\u2019re both lying on our sides, my dick still hard and hugged by her body, and enjoy the way she comes back from a hard orgasm. Her glossy eyes struggle to focus, her mouth is open slightly, and her tits rub against my body with each deep pull she takes.</p><p>\u201cI love you, my Beauty.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, her hand coming up to my cheek before pressing a kiss to my lips. \u201cAnd I love you, my Beast.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that she isn\u2019t far from falling asleep, I pull her in tight and enjoy the feeling of her in my arms and her swollen belly pressed against my abdomen. Feeling each roll and kick my girls offer brings a smile to my face. With all my girls in my arms, I fall asleep with a full heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 4 \u2013 Melissa</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I\u2019m going to piss myself if I can\u2019t figure out how to get out of Greg\u2019s arms soon. He sleeps like this every night, with my body pulled tight to his and my back against his chest. His arm is around my belly, and his palm is holding firm against the girls. Even in his sleep, he\u2019s protecting us. I would smile and think about how it\u2019s the sweetest, most loving gesture ever if his heavy-ass arm wasn\u2019t pressing against my body in a way that has my bladder, which is already fighting for prime real estate, threatening to burst.</p><p>Yeah, this would all be the best in the world\u2014if I weren\u2019t about to wet the bed.</p> <p>Maybe I need some Depends? God, soon I\u2019m going to be walking around in adult diapers with the way the girls are growing. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much more room left for them to grow! Greg loves my pregnant belly, and I bet if he had his way, he would keep me pregnant year round. As much as I love being pregnant, I\u2019m ready for this to be over.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, there isn\u2019t an end in sight for at least another two months. Even with as uncomfortable as I am, and as much as I wish I knew what my damn pussy looked like, I\u2019m happy to bake my little princesses for as long as I can.</p><p>\u201cGreg, wake up, baby. I need to pee.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move. His arm doesn\u2019t let up.</p><p>\u201cGreg, please. I need to go.\u201d</p> <p>Squeezing my legs together, praying that I can hold it, I try and wiggle free with no luck. His arms pull me closer and my already screaming bladder starts blaring the warning alarm.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d I try moving his arm again, but he grumbles something about tugboats and yachts before pulling me even closer. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t going to be pretty if I can\u2019t get up in the next minute. I try to wake him up gently a few times with no luck. Finally, left with no other option, I pull my arm up before bringing my elbow down, driving it back into his gut. He jumps up with a shout, his feet tangling with the sheets before he falls flat on his ass over the side of the bed. I don\u2019t even have time to enjoy the hilarity of the situation before I\u2019m over the edge and wobbling to the bathroom in a sprint that I\u2019m sure makes me look like a penguin running a marathon.</p><p>I close my eyes and moan with the pleasure of an empty bladder. I lean back against the toilet and rub my belly while I finish my business. When I finally finish and open my eyes, I see that I\u2019ve gained an audience.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t try a simple wake-up, babe?\u201d</p><p>I cock my brow, ignoring him while I finish up in the bathroom. He just stands there, no shame in his mouthwatering nakedness, rubbing his stomach while his eyes take in every inch of my body.</p> <p>\u201cGod, you look good enough to eat.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, washing my hands before turning around and closing the distance between us. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible. The next time I spend ten minutes attempting to wake your ass up while you try to hold my body captive, I\u2019m just going to piss all over you.\u201d I smile sweetly at him, laughing when his eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you talk dirty to me, wife.\u201d He smiles down at me, pulling me closer before lowering his mouth to mine. Our kiss is slow and teasing. I can feel his length hardening against my belly, my hands wrapping around his body before gripping his firm ass in my hands and squeezing him closer. He doesn\u2019t waste a second before pulling me back to the bed and showing me how good slow and lazy lovemaking can be.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>By the time we finally fall asleep, the sun is starting to peek through the blinds, and I thank my stars that Dee and Beck took Cohen home with them last night. </p><p>I fall asleep with a smile on my face and my husband\u2019s arms wrapped tightly around his girls again.</p><p>Only to wake up ten minutes later, fighting free of his hold before I wet the bed...again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for today?\u201d I ask Greg when he walks into the kitchen later that morning. His worn jeans are hugging his ass perfectly, and his arms stretching the limits of the University of Georgia football tee he\u2019s wearing. I\u2019m half tempted to drag him back to bed.</p> <p>\u201cFigured I would run over to grab Cohen, but Beck just called and said they wanted to take him to the aquarium today and they would have him home before dinner. You\u2019re stuck with me, woman.\u201d He bends down and gives me a quick kiss before walking over to the coffee maker.</p><p>\u201cGood. You have a full day of putting the girls\u2019 cribs together then.\u201d I beam up at him when he groans. We\u2019ve been putting off the assembly of the girls\u2019 cribs for a few weeks now. Greg took one look at all the \u201cdamn little pieces\u201d and put it aside for another day.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose you plan on helping with this adventure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I have a full day at the spa. Remember, Sway gave it to me for a baby shower gift? All the girls\u2014well, and Sway\u2014are coming. I\u2019ll be gone all day, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpa?\u201d He folds his thick arms across his chest, and my mouth waters from watching his shirt stretch tight against his arms.</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah.\u201d I clear my throat, looking up into his knowing eyes. \u201cManicures, pedicures, a pregnancy massage... The normal spa type stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMassage?\u201d The edge to his voice clues me in to just where his mind has drifted.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go all caveman on me, Greg. It\u2019s perfectly fine for pregnant women to get massages. No one is going to touch me like you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want a massage then we can go back upstairs and I\u2019ll give you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, but I\u2019m going, and I\u2019m going to enjoy the hell out of Lars rubbing my stiff muscles.\u201d I shouldn\u2019t joke, but he really makes it too easy.</p><p>\u201cFucking Lars.\u201d He takes two powerful steps towards me before gently pulling me up from my chair. \u201cFucking Lars better not touch any part of your body. Lars better go ahead and go to another state while you\u2019re inside that spa. No way in hell do I want Lars anywhere near your body. This is my body, Melissa. If anyone is going to rub your stiff muscles, it will be me.\u201d His deep voice grinds out the words, causing my panties to flood with my wetness and my pussy to clench. I shouldn\u2019t provoke him, but hell, this is so hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut, Greg, they say his hands are magic.\u201d I bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing when his growl rumbles around me. His blue eyes darken to the navy color I love, the color that means my beast isn\u2019t far from the surface. I\u2019ve got him right where I want him. My pregnancy hormones are making me almost ravenous with my sex drive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you magic.\u201d I yelp when he clears the table with one swipe of his arm. He drops down to his knees and makes quick work of my jeans. Luckily, another plus of maternity clothes\u2014those elastic waistbands. Before I even have time to take a breath, my bare ass is propped up on the edge of the table and my husband\u2019s mouth is feasting between my thighs.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t waste a second. His lips suck and lick every inch of my pussy but ignore the only spot I want his mouth to be. I don\u2019t even recognize the sounds coming from my mouth, while I\u2019m holding my body up with one arm behind me and the other is holding his head against me as I ride his mouth. The second he brings his fingers into the mix, finger-fucking me to one mind-blowing orgasm after the next, I\u2019m screaming the walls down.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even feel him stop, my body still coming down from the power of my release, but when I feel the cool steel of his Prince Albert against my opening, my eyes open and lazily drink him in. His jeans are pushed down to his knees, and his long, thick cock is ready to plunge into my body. His eyes are hooded, alight with desire.</p> <p>I bring my hand between us, wrapping my fist as far as I can around his velvet skin, and help him guide himself into my wet heat. There isn\u2019t anything sweet and slow about our coming together. He finally takes me how I\u2019ve been begging him to take me. His balls smack against my ass, and his fingers dig into my hips when he drags me closer to the edge of the table. I can hear how wet I am when he thrusts into my body, the sound intensifying the feelings that are racing through my veins.</p><p>When he brings his thumb and presses against my clit, I shoot off in another orgasm so powerful that my hand slips out from behind me and I almost fall to the table. He grunts and pauses in his thrusting to help me keep my balance before powering into my body, the new angle causing each one of the three piercings I love so much to hit all the right spots. I throw my head back and come all over him.</p><p>I hear him moaning and grunting before I feel his release bathe my walls.</p><p>After a few minutes, both of our breathing returns to normal and I look up at his smug grin.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that for magic?\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s why I love poking the beast.</p><p>Chapter 5 \u2013 Greg</p><p>Melissa has been gone for a few hours now, and I\u2019m still struggling to put the twins\u2019 cribs together. You would think that something as simple as a bed for a baby wouldn\u2019t be so complicated, but damn.</p><p>Throwing the directions that, of course, are only in German, I jog down to the kitchen to grab a beer. Propping my ass against the counter, I get lost in my thoughts, remembering when Melissa and I found out we were about to have two little ones and not just one.</p><p>There are moments in your life when you know that a higher power is at work. That someone is hard at work making sure that all the bad you\u2019ve ever felt in your life is cashed in for something so incredibly perfect it almost doesn\u2019t seem real.</p><p>For me, just finding out that Melissa was carrying my child is a moment I will never forget. We had become a family the day we officially adopted Cohen, and even though I love that boy as if he were my own, there\u2019s something to be said about creating a life with the woman you love. Knowing that Cohen is just as excited as we are is just icing on the cake.</p> <p>Complete. This is what it must feel like to own the whole world.</p><p>\u201cGreg? Are you even listening to a thing I\u2019m saying?\u201d Melissa laughs from the passenger seat.</p><p>I look over and smile when I see her stomach. I would never tell her this, but I swear she grew again overnight. She started showing early and never really slowed down. At almost four months, I swear she looks further along. Her doctor explained that this was just because she is so small to begin with. Every day, her body changes more, and it\u2019s sexy as hell to watch.</p><p>\u201cGreg?\u201d she prompts.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that goofy grin is anything to go by, it\u2019s nothing about our baby and more about your insatiable hormones.\u201d She laughs and rubs her belly some more.</p><p>Reaching over I place my hand right above hers and drum my fingers softly. \u201cAre you excited?\u201d I ask, rubbing her stomach a few times before taking her hand in mine and lacing our fingers together. When she told me that we could find out what we\u2019re having before her twenty-week appointment, I jumped all over that.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes! I can\u2019t wait to find out if we\u2019re having a boy or a girl. Cohen told me this morning on the way to daycare that he thinks he\u2019s having a sister.\u201d</p> <p>This has been an ongoing discussion. Cohen and I both think it\u2019s a girl, but Melissa thinks it\u2019s a boy. I couldn\u2019t care less as long as our baby is healthy.</p><p>\u201cYou still going with the whole \u2018there is no way I would be this big if it isn\u2019t a boy\u2019 argument?\u201d Her line of reasoning even sounds ridiculous to me, but hey, I\u2019m not going to argue with her.</p><p>She looks over at me with a big smile. \u201cSeriously, look at you, Greg! You\u2019re huge. There is no way this is a girl. I bet you our son comes out with little baby muscles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby muscles? Maybe we just have a really healthy baby,\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou should just admit that your men know everything now and save you the let-down when the doctor confirms it.\u201d</p><p>She smacks me on the arm and laughs. We continue to the doctor\u2019s office in a comfortable silence, holding hands and enjoying the moment.</p><p>Pure happiness.</p><p>Once we get all checked in and back into the dimly lit room for the ultrasound, I start to get a little nervous. Even though I can tell my girl is pregnant, it still feels so much more real when I look at the monitor and see the life we created. Every one of her appointments has made me feel this way.</p><p>The first time I heard our baby\u2019s heartbeat, I thought I was going to turn into a blubbering fool. When we got our first ultrasound picture confirming the pregnancy, I felt like I was having a heart attack. There really is no way to explain the overwhelming love I feel for this baby and Melissa. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, good morning, Cage family!\u201d Melissa\u2019s doctor comes in and starts asking her all the routine questions before measuring her stomach and pushing it all over the place. I hate this part. Melissa grabs my hand and just smiles up at me, reminding me that the doctor isn\u2019t hurting her.</p><p>\u201cWill we be able to determine the gender today, Dr. Nicholson?\u201d Melissa asks softly.</p><p>I squeeze her hand out of reflex. We\u2019ve both been looking forward to this since the day she told me she was pregnant, but more importantly, we have a little dude at home anxiously awaiting the news on his new sibling.</p><p>\u201cYes, Melissa dear. Sixteen weeks on the dot, perfect gestational age to take a look and see.\u201d He smiles down at her, his weathered face clearly happy to be a part of this. I swear this man is never in a bad mood. \u201cAre you ready, son? This is a big day for you, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir. We can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and pats me on the back before getting Melissa ready for her ultrasound.</p><p>When he places the wand on her bump and starts spreading the gel around, I look up at his face. I don\u2019t know why I was focusing on him and not the monitor, but I notice immediately when his bushy white brows pull together and his lips purse in thought. I immediately get worried. I know that Melissa senses that something is off because she\u2019s looking at his face too.</p><p>\u201cDoc?\u201d I question, not even ashamed of the slight quiver that gives my fear away.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh...yes, everything is okay. Just wasn\u2019t expecting... that.\u201d he says softly. Almost as if he\u2019s questioning himself.</p> <p>\u201cDoc, I don\u2019t mean any disrespect here, but you\u2019re kind of freaking us out.\u201d Melissa whimpers softly, and I know that she\u2019s barely holding it in. I lean down and lightly kiss her before turning my attention back to Dr. Nicholson.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Melissa, Greg... I was just making sure...\u201d He trails off and turns the monitor towards us before placing the wand back on her stomach. \u201cAll right, you see here? This is the first head, and you see here? This is the second. Quite tricky. You have a little hider!\u201d He laughs.</p><p>Melissa hasn\u2019t said anything. She\u2019s just looking at the doctor in complete shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? My baby has two heads!?\u201d I practically scream. Why is everyone so calm? My baby is going to be born with two heads!</p><p>My outburst seems to clear Melissa of her fog. Before I can get another word out, she reaches up and smacks the side of my head.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Greg?\u201d She laughs, joining the already laughing doctor.</p> <p>What the hell is so funny? Aren\u2019t they at all worried about my two-headed baby?</p><p>\u201cOh dear, I\u2019m very sorry. I should have been more clear, Greg. This,\u201d he says, pointing at the monitor again, \u201cis Baby A\u2019s head, and this one is Baby B\u2019s. Congratulations. It appears as if you are having twins, and sneaky ones at that. Hiding this whole time. And... Oh yes, very clear. Do you two want to know the genders?\u201d He looks at Melissa first, who I assume nods her head. I\u2019m still stuck back at my two-headed baby.</p><p>No, not two heads.</p><p>Twins.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. We\u2019re having twins?\u201d I whisper, looking down at Melissa. She\u2019s smiling her beautiful, blinding smile at me. Tears slowly roll down her cheeks. \u201cBeauty, we\u2019re having twins!\u201d</p><p>She laughs as I cover her mouth in a passionate kiss. After a few seconds, she pushes me back, reminding me where we are. When I look up at Dr. Nicholson, he\u2019s just smiling at the monitor.</p><p>\u201cPlease, we would like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much. Quite a shock, but a happy one. And now that they have decided to let us know their little secret, they aren\u2019t being shy at all.\u201d He pulls the wand away and turns to us with a smile. \u201cCongratulations again. Your twin daughters look perfectly healthy.\u201d He continues to talk to Melissa while I stare at the picture in my hand of my babies.</p> <p>Twins!</p><p>I don\u2019t let her hand go once on the way to pick up Cohen. When we pull up at his daycare, I run in with a big smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Before I even have the door to his classroom open completely, his small body is barreling towards me. \u201cDaddy, did you see it? Was I right? Is it a girl? Does it have a wiener? What is Mommy going to do if it has a wiener? She can\u2019t look at them. Did you see it?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and pull him up into my arms. \u201cWell, hello to you too, C-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy. Do I have a sister? Is she pretty like Mommy? Do you think she can fight ninjas?\u201d When I don\u2019t answer, his small hands grab my cheeks and pull my face towards his. Nose to nose, smile to smile. God, I love this kid. \u201cWas I right?\u201d he asks with all the seriousness a four-year-old can muster.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t tell you yet. You know that wouldn\u2019t be fair to Mommy. She wants to see your handsome face when we tell you the news.\u201d I kiss his nose and continue out the door, waving to the teachers on the way.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m right, Daddy, but I\u2019ll still be happy for Mommy so she thinks she got a secret.\u201d He snickers a few times before waving at Melissa from across the parking lot.</p><p>Cohen continues his questions during the whole fifteen-minute ride home. I think I\u2019ve heard the word wiener more times than I knew possible to fit into one conversation. Melissa just continues to smile at him and holds off his questions.</p><p>By the time we pull up at the house, he is bouncing in his seat. The second the car shuts off, he takes off running around the driveway. I help Melissa out, and we make our way inside, Cohen still asking a million questions behind us.</p><p>\u201cCohen, baby, calm down.\u201d Melissa laughs, pulling him closer.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t!\u201d he screams with a big smile. \u201cI gotta know! Was I right? Am I going to have a sister? I have to know so I can practice. I gotta protect my sister!\u201d</p><p>I sit down next to Melissa and pull him into my lap. \u201cAll right, buddy. You know how we got to use that special camera today to see inside Mommy\u2019s belly? Well, we found out something else today. The doctor said that there isn\u2019t just one, but two babies in there, and you were right. You are getting a sister, only now you\u2019re getting two sisters.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? How did the other sister get in there? Is she magic? Do I have a magic sister?\u201d</p><p>I can feel Melissa\u2019s body shaking with silent laughter, and I know there will be no help from her here. \u201cUh, well...the doctor said she was playing hide and seek.\u201d</p><p>Cohen starts smiling and nods his head. \u201cThis is good, Daddy. I knew my angels would give me sisters. I asked them.\u201d</p><p>Melissa stops laughing and grabs my hand. \u201cWhat do you mean, baby?\u201d she asks on a whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI asked Nana, Mommy Fia, and Auntie Grace to give me a sister. I said I wanted a sister more than anything in the world so I can look out for her like Daddy looks out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cohen. You\u2019re such a special little man.\u201d she says, kissing his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI know what I want to name my sisters.\u201d he says, clearly proud of himself for his prediction and making Melissa happy.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d I lean back, intertwine my fingers with Melissa\u2019s, and wait. I don\u2019t realize I am holding my breath until his soft voice speaks the names.</p><p>\u201cI want my sisters to have my angel\u2019s names. Lillian Sofia for Nana and Mommy Fia, and Lyndsie Grace for Daddy\u2019s mommy and Auntie Grace.\u201d</p> <p>My breath comes out in a rush, and I can feel Melissa breathing heavily next to me. Cohen just looks at us with his little smile and bright eyes, waiting for the moment when we confirm that he\u2019s allowed to name his sisters.</p><p>\u201cLillian Sofia and Lyndsie Grace? Cohen, I think those are perfect names for your sisters. You\u2019re already such a wonderful big brother.\u201d she whispers.</p><p>He gives us a big hug before leaping off my lap and running through the house. We can hear him talking to his \u2018angels,\u2019 telling them about his new sisters. I pull Melissa closer, resting my lips against her temple and my hand against her stomach. With all my girls in my arms and a full heart, I enjoy the moment of life coming full circle.</p><p>It\u2019s times like this that I remember just how far I\u2019ve come in the last few years. After losing my sister, I questioned my path in life. I questioned every single relationship I had. I wondered if having other people in my life was worth the pain if I was going to lose them. It wasn\u2019t until Melissa and Cohen came into my life, that I realized living in fear is almost the same as slowly dying.</p><p>From the day I met her, I knew I would fight every day to be the man worthy of her love.</p><p>Hearing my cell ringing from another room, I shake off my daydreams and follow the sound.</p> <p>I let out a relieved breath when I see Axel\u2019s name across the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d No sense wasting time. If I don\u2019t have these cribs together when Melissa gets home, there will be hell to pay.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was enjoying breakfast in bed, but when your ass wouldn\u2019t stop calling, Izzy made me stop. So, thanks for that, jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, yeah...sorry about that, but welcome to my world. Just wait until Nate is a master at cockblocking like Cohen. I swear, when that boy is home, he has some sort of sensor that goes off when I\u2019m about to enjoy Melissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already started. Last night, just sunk into Iz and he\u2019s screaming about turtles. Do you have any idea what a two-year-old screaming about turtles will do to your sex life? Iz started laughing so hard that my dick got the message loud and clear.\u201d He lets out a breath full of frustration, and the smile on my face grows. Yeah, sounds like a normal day in the Cage house.</p><p>\u201cAs much fun as this little chat is, I need you to come over and help me get these damn cribs together. I hold one end up, but then the second I go to attach something, the damn thing falls on my head. If I want to enjoy my wife tonight, I have to get this shit done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Poor guy.\u201d He starts laughing; I\u2019m sure he\u2019s picturing me in a mess of crib parts.</p><p>I let a laugh out remembering how the last bang on the head must have looked. \u201cLaugh all you want. The directions are in German, Ax. Luckily I can read the damn things, but it\u2019s been a few years, and my German is rusty at best. It\u2019s a shame Maddox isn\u2019t here. Damn fool would have this shit done by now,\u201d I bait, knowing Axel won\u2019t be able to resist the challenge of being better than Maddox.</p> <p>\u201cThe hell with that. I\u2019m on the way. Be there in ten.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, throwing the phone down when I hear him disconnect in my ear.</p><p>Maybe if I\u2019m lucky, he\u2019ll do all the hard work and I can sit back and enjoy a beer.</p><p>Chapter 6 \u2013 Melissa</p><p>Exhausted.</p><p>That is the only way I can explain what I feel like being halfway through my seventh month of pregnancy. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I love almost everything about being pregnant. Even the stuff I don\u2019t love about carrying around an extra forty\u2014cough, fifty\u2014pounds of baby still brings a smile to my face every time I feel one of my girls kick my kidney, squeeze my bladder, or stick a head in my ribs.</p><p>Yeah, I love carrying around my girls.</p><p>The best part, the part that keeps that smile on my face even when I feel as though my body is about to split in two, is knowing that these two little princesses are a product of the love I share with their daddy.</p><p>There isn\u2019t a single day that goes by that I don\u2019t thank God that Greg was set in my path. I was living a life that was half empty, and now, my glass is overflowing.</p><p>I finally pull my car into the driveway and smile when I see that the lights are on, flooding the yard with their warmth.</p><p>\u201cDaddy isn\u2019t going to be happy we\u2019ve been gone all day, little ladies,\u201d I whisper to my belly, running my hand across my hard abdomen, and smile when I feel my girls give some solid kicks.</p><p>It takes me longer than normal to pull my body out of the car. I was driving around Greg\u2019s truck until it became too hard to get in and out of the cab. I miss driving that monster around, but it was impossible to heave my weight into the driver\u2019s seat anymore. I hate this damn car. I feel like I sit so low to the ground that I\u2019ll be run over by every vehicle that comes near me. Luckily for me\u2014or unluckily, considering I never pictured myself owning a mini-van\u2014Greg promised we would go car shopping soon.</p><p>\u201cWell, well... It looks like my wife decided she still loves her men after all.\u201d I smirk when I hear my husband\u2019s deep voice coming from behind me. I don\u2019t turn; instead, I spend a second relishing in the soothing tones that wash over my tired body, firing alive every single inch. Even with his teasing tone, my body recognizes its mate, causing my skin to pucker with tiny goose bumps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTurn around, Beauty.\u201d</p><p>I visibly shutter when his demand hits my ears. Slowly, I turn and take in all six foot three inches of solid male perfection. His dark brown hair is all over the place, a sure sign that he\u2019s been playing with Cohen and running his fingers through his silky locks. I avoid his eyes and let mine travel slowly down his body. A tight black tee hugs every single inch of his chest, arms, and abs. I can literally see each and every muscle outline through the thin cotton. Letting my eyes wander lower, I have to bite my lip when I can see his thick erection straining the front of his sweats, just begging for my touch.</p><p>It isn\u2019t until I hear his groan that I look up to meet his blazing eyes. The beautiful blue eyes I love so much have darkened to the point that I know he\u2019s hanging on by a thread.</p><p>My tongue slips past my lips, rolling against my bottom lip before pulling it between my teeth. His eyes flash with warning, and the energy in the garage hits new levels of desire.</p><p>\u201cIf our boy weren\u2019t sitting in the next room, ready to cook his mom dinner, I would have you spread out on the top of that damn car. Fuck. Melissa, baby, you have no idea how much I wish I could sink into your body right now.\u201d He crosses the space that separates us, takes my purse from my hands, and lets it fall to the floor before pulling me close. \u201cMy cock is begging, baby, weeping to be inside your tight, slick pussy.\u201d He lets out a tortured moan before shoving his head into the crook of my neck.</p><p>\u201cGod, Greg. You can\u2019t go all Beast mode on me when you know there isn\u2019t anything we can do about it for hours! Hours, Greg. My hormones are going insane right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone isn\u2019t being very patient.\u201d I can feel his lips tipping up against my neck before he presses small, hot kisses against my skin. \u201cDoes my woman want my dick? Huh? Do you want me to take it slow, letting each one of my piercings rub against you, rub inside of that wet pussy until it hits that spot that always makes you fly through the roof? Hmm?\u201d His lips keep kissing. Tiny, wet, closed-mouth kisses against my shoulder and neck. With each word he speaks, I feel as if my body were being set on fire. My clit is throbbing against my soaked panties. \u201cOr do you want me to take you hard, letting my balls slap against that perfect ass of yours?\u201d</p><p>When his hands snake around my body and roughly squeeze my cheeks, I swear I come. Right then and there, with just his words, I feel the waves of my orgasm crashing over me. His head shoots up and his eyes question, but the cocky smile on his face tells me that he knows exactly what his words caused.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe we should just pour some tea and talk?\u201d</p><p>Arrogant jerk.</p><p>I playfully smack his chest before I drop my forehead to his chest. Yeah, those pregnancy hormones I mentioned also turn me into a complete basket case. I don\u2019t do embarrassed, but with flushed cheeks and desire still racing through my veins, I start bawling. Not cute tears and soft sniffles. No, these are body-shaking, breath-gasping, puffy-face, and snotty-nose emotions.</p><p>\u201cHey, what the hell, baby?\u201d His hands cup my cheeks and bring my head up so that my eyes meet his. \u201cMelissa? What\u2019s this all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... so sor\u2014sorry.\u201d I hiccup. </p><p>\u201cWhy on earth are you apologizing?\u201d</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s worried. His eyes are almost panicked from trying to figure out what set his crazy, hormonal wife off this time. He pulls me away just far enough so that he can look down my body and check for some visible reason for me to be losing my mind.</p><p>\u201cI wah-wah-was hoping yo-you would take me.\u201d</p><p>His thumbs wipe my tears away, the worried look still very much present. \u201cTake you where, Beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTay-tay-take me... on the car!\u201d I wail. Oh, God. He\u2019s going to think I\u2019m some sexy-crazed loon.</p><p>With wide eyes, I watch the fear bleed from his face and his cocky smile returns. \u201cYou need me, Beauty?\u201d That voice. That full-on Beast-mode voice. That is exactly what makes me go from zero to ready to be taken hard.</p><p>\u201cEvery second...of every day.\u201d</p><p>His smile grows at my words, and then his lips press roughly against mine and his arms wrap around my body, pulling me as close as he can without pushing too hard against my belly.</p><p>Just like always, he knows how to deliver every promise to come in just one kiss. A kiss that is so powerful and all-consuming that I\u2019m climbing right back up that peak and about to tumble over into another orgasm.</p><p>\u201cEw! Daddy! Mommy is touching your butt!\u201d</p> <p>I groan against Greg\u2019s lips when Cohen\u2019s voice comes from the doorway to the house. I pull my lips away, give Greg a heated look, and then step around my husband to wrap my arms around Cohen.</p><p>\u201cShh, C-Man. He had ants in his pants, and I had to make sure I got them all.\u201d</p><p>He giggles, kisses my cheek, and then presses two kisses against my stomach before running back into the house. \u201cCome on, Mommy! We\u2019re having sketty!\u201d</p><p>Hours later, I am just coming down from my third orgasm in a row. My body is slick with sweat, and my heart is still racing. My toes may be permanently curled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t move my legs.\u201d </p><p>Greg laughs from where he is lying\u2014or more like collapsed\u2014next to me. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t move anything.\u201d</p><p>I turn to my side to relieve the pressure my growing belly is putting on my back. I look over at his profile. His are eyes closed, hair wet with perspiration, and his chest is still moving rapidly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper so softly I didn\u2019t even think he would be able to hear me.</p><p>His eyes open and he turns towards me giving me all of his attention. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>My cheeks heat briefly before I answer. \u201cFor loving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that is one thing you never need to thank me for. Beauty, do you even have a clue to how much I love you?\u201d He shifts, moving so that he can pull me against his side. I rest my head against his chest while one of his hands wraps around my shoulders, holding me close and his hand resting against my belly. \u201cMelissa, I tell you daily\u2014many times\u2014how much I love you. Knowing that you\u2019re my wife, that the perfect little boy asleep down the hall is my son because of you, and these little angels are a gift our love made... Those are just some of the things you have given me that makes my life worth living.\u201d He pauses, removing his hand from my stomach long enough to lift my chin up so he can look into my eyes. \u201cYou never need to thank me for loving you, Melissa. You make it effortless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I close my eyes, letting the tears that had been pooling tip over and run down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cGod, Baby... Don\u2019t cry. There isn\u2019t anything in our lives that warrants those tears. As far as I can tell, we\u2019re about one step from perfect. Once Lillian and Lyndsie get here, there isn\u2019t much of anything that could make our world any better. That is, unless you want to give me more babies.\u201d</p><p>I smile at his attempt at bringing the crazy hormones back down. \u201cDo you ever worry? Things have been going so well that I\u2019m almost afraid to believe that it\u2019s finally time for us to have our happily ever after.\u201d He snorts, and I know that he\u2019s thinking about all the books I always have my nose stuck in. \u201cDon\u2019t you make fun of me, Greg Cage.\u201d</p><p>His laughter quiets, and he looks down into my eyes. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a damn thing in this world that can keep us from our happily ever after,\u201d he vows before kissing me sweetly. \u201cSleep, Beauty. Tomorrow\u2019s going to be crazy enough, so you need to rest while you can.\u201d</p> <p>I cuddle as close as I can get, letting the sound of his heartbeats lull me to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 7 \u2013 Greg</p><p>Of course, the one day I promise Melissa that I won\u2019t do anything work related, I get a call from Axel about an issue at the office. A damn \u2018issue\u2019 is the last thing I want to deal with today, especially knowing that it more than likely has to do with Mrs. Hutchins, our newest and most aggravating client.</p><p>Mrs. Hutchins first came to us about a month ago, convinced that her older husband was sleeping with every female around. She calls constantly. She stops by the office daily. There isn\u2019t a damn thing we can say to convince the woman that her husband is very much faithful. She doesn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m starting to get the impression that she is only comes around because she has her eyes on Asher.</p><p>During the first meeting we took with her, she all but offered to pay Axel and me to sleep with her. Even if I weren\u2019t the happiest damn married man around, there isn\u2019t a check large enough that would convince me to sleep with her. She has something evil scratching the surface, and I want that as far away from me as possible.</p> <p>If only Asher could see things the same way. I know that he hasn\u2019t yet, but he\u2019s thinking about it, and I know that if he sinks into that woman, she will leave him with something he can never wash off.</p><p>Shaking off the creepy-as-hell feeling Mrs. Hutchins always leaves me with, I jog up the stairs in search of my wife. I can hear her and Cohen\u2019s laughter coming out of our bedroom and head that way.</p><p>\u201cWhy do my angels have a party when they\u2019re still in your belly? They can\u2019t open any presents when they\u2019re in your belly. Do you think we\u2019ll get cake? I love cake. Will Dilbert be there?\u201d</p><p>I smile, walk over to Melissa, and wrap my arms around to rest against her swollen belly as Cohen continues his random questioning.</p><p>He finally stops talking and jumps off the bed. Without even a word, he takes off running out the bedroom door.</p><p>Melissa and I both laugh at the tornado that is Cohen Cage. Damn, I love that kid.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I wonder if he just talks because he likes the sound of his voice. You know, almost every time he starts on his twenty questions, they end in him running off without even having one answer.\u201d</p><p>I laugh because she isn\u2019t wrong. But Cohen is a boy full of energy, and if asking a million questions and fighting imaginary villains is what it takes, then hey, I can work with that.</p><p>Melissa turns with her smile beaming. I thought I was being careful to mask my expression, but she must have noticed that my mood was off because her smile slips and she looks at me with wide, hopeful eyes.</p><p>\u201cBeauty...\u201d I start.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you Beauty me, Greg. You promised you would make it clear to Axel that you weren\u2019t doing anything work related today. It\u2019s my baby shower, and while I know this isn\u2019t something you have any interest in attending, it means something to me. Everyone is excited. Cohen is through-the-roof excited. And I was excited until I realized that you\u2019re not going to be there.\u201d</p><p>She takes a breath, but before she can continue, I interrupt her. \u201cMelissa, if it were any other client, I wouldn\u2019t even think about it. I need this woman taken care of before our girls get here. Axel can\u2019t deal with her alone, Beck can\u2019t deal with her at all, and Asher isn\u2019t allowed to deal with her. With Maddox gone, it\u2019s only me.\u201d I lean my forehead against hers and take a deep breath. \u201cShe\u2019s one of our highest-paying clients, Melissa, and even though we live a comfortable life, I can\u2019t help my worries with our girls coming. We\u2019re going from a family of three to one of five overnight.\u201d</p><p>Her face softens and her eyes lose their wounded look. I know she wants me there\u2014hell, I want to be there\u2014but I\u2019m not lying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that terribly nasty trophy wife, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>She may think she has me fooled with that bored tone, but I know she and the other girls secretly plot ways to make Mrs. Hutchins disappear.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Beauty. It\u2019s her.\u201d I brace for it because I know it\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u201cI hate that plastic, home-wrecking, troll-trotting, skank bitch,\u201d she seethes.</p><p>She isn\u2019t unjust with her hatred either. Between her, Izzy, and Dee, each of them has witnessed her attempt at getting their men to stray. We joke about it, because they know we would never even think about it, but when it comes down to it, we all want her out of our lives.</p><p>\u201cI know, and you aren\u2019t alone. We agreed a few weeks ago that we wouldn\u2019t take meetings with her alone anymore. She threw herself at Beck, which is why he flat-out refuses to even be near her. Asher is out of town so he can\u2019t help. It\u2019s just me, and baby, as much as I hate it, I can\u2019t let Axel deal with her alone.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head in understanding, \u201cI know. I get it, I really do, but that doesn\u2019t mean I like it.\u201d She hugs me close, and I rest my chin on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there before you even open your first gift or play your first game. Promise.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, though it doesn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. \u201cI know you will. Now, go get Cohen dressed, please. No rain boots with shorts though!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After getting Cohen dressed and waiting until Melissa was finally ready to go, I helped her buckle Cohen into her car before pulling her into my arms and giving her a deep kiss. </p><p>\u201cBefore the first gift, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d I remind her, hating that I\u2019m letting her down, even just a little.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she smiles. \u201cI\u2019m not upset, I just wish you didn\u2019t have to go. I love you and everything you do for us. Missing a baby shower really isn\u2019t a big deal. I\u2019m sorry I made you feel bad earlier, but my hormones are all over the place.\u201d She laughs, and the blush she seemed to adopt when she got pregnant spreads across her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI love you and your crazy hormones.\u201d</p> <p>She smiles and gives me another deep kiss. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d Laughing, she folds herself awkwardly behind the wheel.</p><p>I make a mental note to go straight to the dealership before the week ends and get her the minivan we\u2019ve been talking about for a while now.</p><p>\u201cBut, Greg, isn\u2019t there something else you can do? I just know that Harry is sleeping with that woman. I saw the way she looked at him. There is no way that a woman who hasn\u2019t seen him naked would look at him like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Cage, Mrs. Hutchins, and as Mr. Reid has gone over with you already, there is no evidence that points to any infidelity on your husband\u2019s behalf. We\u2019ve been watching him closely since the day you walked into our office for the first time. There hasn\u2019t been a single grain of proof that we could even offer to you. I\u2019m positive that this is a good report, correct?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve been playing this game for the last thirty minutes. I keep checking my watch, knowing that Melissa should be at the country club that the girls are using to host her shower by now. If I plan on keeping true to my promise, I need to get this woman out of our building as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly, Greg. I told you to call me Alison,\u201d she purrs. Literally purrs. Axel rolls his eyes from his perch across the room. He\u2019s about to blow, and I\u2019m not far behind him.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hutchins, how about this? We will put the cameras back up inside your home as well as his office for another two weeks and then reevaluate at the end of that time?\u201d</p><p>She instantly brightens when I confirm that we aren\u2019t cutting her loose. Shit. Axel\u2019s going to flip.</p><p>\u201cDarling, that is just perfect.\u201d She makes a move to touch my arm and I pull back roughly.</p><p>After another five minutes of bullshit, she finally agrees to a time for us to come and reinstall the equipment in her home. Another pain in the ass, but this time I wouldn\u2019t make the mistake of showing up alone.</p><p>\u201cSwear to Christ, I\u2019m ready to just say to hell with the ridiculous amount of money she\u2019s paying us and cut her loose. She\u2019s like a fucking parasite.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh at Axel and flip the lock on the front door. \u201cGive her another two weeks of babysitting her monk of a husband and that\u2019s it. If I weren\u2019t in a rush to get to the baby shower the girls are throwing Melissa, I wouldn\u2019t have even given her that.\u201d</p><p>Axel follows behind as I make my way down the hallway and into my office to grab my keys and the files I need to go over at home tomorrow for the upcoming week.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t telling me anything I don\u2019t know. Izzy almost took off my head when I told her I would be late for the shower,\u201d he laughs, palming his keys and following me out the door. \u201cThat woman actually offered to \u2018service\u2019 me before you showed up. It\u2019s a shame it isn\u2019t the husband who hired us. Wouldn\u2019t even take five minutes before we had a stack full of proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain in the ass. That\u2019s all she is. But right now, I couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d I chuckle, pausing my steps off the sidewalk when my phone starts ringing. My brow pulls tight when Axel\u2019s own cell starts ringing too. \u201cPopular, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He snorts and we both pull our phones out.</p><p>\u201cIzzy,\u201d he smiles.</p><p>Looking down and seeing Dee\u2019s name across my screen has my stomach dropping. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that something isn\u2019t right as I stare at Dee\u2019s smiling face on my phone.</p><p>I swipe my thumb across the screen to answer, but before I can speak, I notice Axel\u2019s look of pure terror as he stands a few feet in front of me with his phone pressed against his ear.</p> <p>That look alone is enough to have my body locking tight in stone-cold fear. Something is definitely very wrong.</p><p>\u201cCage,\u201d I answer almost robotically.</p><p>\u201cGreg! Oh, God. Greg...\u201d She starts sobbing, and it takes every ounce of strength in my body to keep myself up and not crumpled into a mess on Sway\u2019s golden sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cDee,\u201d I gasp. There\u2019s a simple reason for her to be upset. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.</p><p>\u201cHold...hold on. Let me...\u2014let me put Beck on.\u201d Her words wobble and her breath hitches a few times before I hear Beck take the phone.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, brother.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head even though I know he can\u2019t see me. My whole body is about to shut down. I just look at Axel and beg him to make my fears unwarranted. His normally tan skin is pale, and his eyes are concerned and... full of agony.</p><p>NO! No, oh God... NO!</p><p>\u201cGreg, I\u2019m going to tell you something and I want you to keep your shit together, no matter how hard this is going to be. Axel\u2019s ready to help you. Let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d I plead.</p><p>\u201cThere was an accident, Greg. Melissa and Cohen... Jesus, Cohen was taken by ambulance to the hospital. From what little I was able to get from one of the first responders on the scene, he\u2019s not badly injured.\u201d </p><p>I close my eyes. I know that my son is okay, but that relief is short-lived when I realize he\u2019s stopped talking and hasn\u2019t mentioned how my very pregnant wife is.</p><p>\u201cJohn Beckett, you tell me right now that my wife, my fucking heart, is okay. Tell me right now that Melissa, Cohen, and my girls are okay!\u201d I don\u2019t even attempt to wipe the tears that are falling down my face. Axel clamps his arm down on my shoulder, offering his support.</p><p>\u201cShe had to be airlifted out, Greg. You need to let Axel get you to the hospital as soon as you can. It...it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I drop the phone, hearing it shatter against the sidewalk, and it isn\u2019t until I\u2019m sitting in Axel\u2019s truck while he speeds down the interstate that I realize those terrifying wails I hear are coming from me.</p><p>Chapter 8 \u2013 Melissa \u2013 Two Hours Earlier</p><p>I hate that Greg won\u2019t be with me for the shower. I know he said that he would try his best, but knowing why he got called in is making me crazier. Or I should say who is behind the reason he was called in. Everyone knows how that terrible Mrs. Hutchins is. She has her sights on all the men at Corps Security. I wouldn\u2019t even be shocked if she has tried to get some action from openly gay Davey. Greg\u2019s told me over and over how frustrating she is, and I know he\u2019ll be there longer than he wishes.</p><p>I don\u2019t pretend to understand why they keep her on as a client, but I trust my husband, so I\u2019ll give him the support he needs, even if I wish he were by my side right now.</p> <p>I pull up to the intersection, adjusting my belt so that it doesn\u2019t keep digging into my belly, and take a deep breath. It doesn\u2019t do me any good to stress over a situation I can\u2019t control. I know it\u2019s my hormones making me insane. Seriously, I know that Greg doesn\u2019t have any interest in a baby shower. Hell, if I weren\u2019t the one with enough emotional crazy rushing through my veins right now, I would probably laugh at a husband being dragged to a shower for his pregnant wife. I know he doesn\u2019t care; he\u2019s just doing this because I want him there.</p><p>\u201cMommy, will I get presents too?\u201d</p><p>I look away from the light a few cars ahead of me, still red, before looking up and focusing on Cohen\u2019s reflection in my rearview mirror.</p><p>I smile from just looking at his messy brown hair a few weeks past due for a cut, tousled just the way Greg\u2019s always is these days. His brown eyes, always bright with unshed energy, and that crooked smile never fail to melt my heart. I instantly want to start sobbing with the strength of my love for this little guy.</p><p>\u201cMommy, your face looks funny like it does when you cry. Are you going to cry? I don\u2019t have to get presents. I can wait till my birthday if you forgot them. Will Aunt Izzy have cake? I like leopards. Can we get my girls some leopards to match their sheets in their beds?\u201d His smile gets bigger and he shakes his head rapidly.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, you know that?\u201d I ask, smiling at him one more time before returning my eyes to the road when I see the light turn green.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you sure are.\u201d I laugh, waiting for the car in front of me to go. I swear, traffic is a mess today. Apparently everyone and their mothers have somewhere they have to be.</p><p>\u201cCan we buy a boat? I hope Aunt Izzy got a big cake. I\u2019m going to eat it all up and get big like Maddox Locke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCohen, you are so silly. Why don\u2019t you just call him Maddox?\u201d Cohen\u2019s been calling Maddox by his full name for so long now that it\u2019s almost slipped out from my own lips a few times. Everyone thinks it\u2019s the cutest thing ever, but honestly, it\u2019s just another weird little piece of Cohen logic that helps make him the coolest kid around.</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Maddox Locke is cooler, and it makes me smile. Maddox Locke is funny. He told me that one day I\u2019m going to be a big boy and I need to watch how Daddy acts so that I can be the bestest man in the whole world, just like Daddy. He says it\u2019s the key to being a superhero. Maddox Locke keeps his secrets all locked up. He told me that. But sometimes he unlocks his secrets and tells me some. So he\u2019s my Maddox Locke.\u201d</p><p>I have to take my eyes off the road and look at him. I\u2019ve never noticed him and Maddox having conversations long enough for all that. Maddox is, for the most part, quiet and pensive. I\u2019ve always known that he holds some deep pain, and while it\u2019s no secret with the girls that he\u2019s got a seriously secret soft side, this is the first I\u2019ve heard of him and Cohen bonding like this.</p><p>\u201cYou know, he might be onto something there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I smile, focusing my attention back on the road when we finally start making some progress through the intersection that\u2019s been backed up for a while now.</p><p>\u201cUh, they need to do something about all this traffic,\u201d I mutter under my breath. They\u2019ve been working on this intersection for what seems like years. The light that was a last-ditch effort to relieve some of the congestion seems to be making it worse. No one pays attention to anything.</p><p>Right when I\u2019m about to cross over the intersection, I hear a loud horn followed by Cohen\u2019s scream in the backseat. Checking the car in front of me, seeing that it\u2019s a good distance ahead, I don\u2019t even get my eyes to the rearview to check the one following before I see it.</p> <p>Just out of the corner of my eye, I see the flash of red before I hear the twisting, bending, moaning, and screaming sounds of metal and glass colliding. I can feel the tiny pieces of glass that fly from my window piercing my skin. My seatbelt pulls tight and digs into my skin. Every inch of my left side is on fire, burning in a way that makes my vision dim.</p><p>It takes only a second, but in that second, I think about the little boy in the backseat, praying that he\u2019s okay and unharmed. I pray that the little girls still growing in the safety of my belly aren\u2019t affected. And I think about the handsome man who isn\u2019t going to be okay if anything happens to his family.</p><p>\u201cCo-hen...\u201d I gasp when the car stops moving. My brain fights to understand where I am and why I can\u2019t open my eyes. Fighting every single fiber in my being that tells me to just let go and fade away.</p><p>I struggle to stay awake; I try to fight the pain and the fear. I beg my body to move, to stop just lying here and get to Cohen. He needs me, and I need to know he\u2019s okay.</p><p>I know it isn\u2019t going to be long now. I can feel my body slowly going numb, and the overwhelming pain starts to wash away when each part of my body becomes a stranger to me. My eyes keep rolling around in my head like they aren\u2019t attached anymore. My vision fades from color to black and gray, the webs of nothingness closing in and pulling me away.</p><p>\u201cNo... Co...hen...love.\u201d</p><p>Right before I feel the numbness crawl into my head, I hear the sweetest sound in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hear Cohen return my love. And even though he\u2019s crying, I know he\u2019s alive and that he knows that I love him.</p><p>Chapter 9 \u2013 Greg</p><p>The ride to the hospital is a complete and total wash. I don\u2019t see a single mile. I don\u2019t feel anything except soul-crushing pain. My family, my reason for living, is beyond my reach, and I wasn\u2019t there when they needed me.</p><p>My mind passed rational thinking about ten miles ago. Beck\u2019s words still echo like a badly scratched CD through my mind.</p> <p>Accident.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t look good.</p><p>Airlifted.</p><p>I can feel the fear taking over. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times I beg and plead, pray and beg some more, I feel like I lost a piece of myself when he spoke those words.</p><p>Not knowing and fearing the worst but grasping on to that sliver of hope that keeps bursting through the darkness is the only thing keeping me from crumbling.</p> <p>That and knowing that Cohen\u2019s going to need me...and I\u2019m going to need him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, brother.\u201d</p><p>Axel doesn\u2019t need me to respond. Hell, I\u2019m not even sure if I could at this point.</p><p>The second I see the turn off for the hospital, I sit a little straighter in the seat. When I see the brick of the building pop through the trees, I lift my hand to the door handle. The second I feel his truck slowing, I unsnap my belt. And right when I see the doors to the emergency room, my door\u2019s released and I jump from the cab.</p><p>Luckily, Axel had already been slowing when I leaped from his moving truck, so there wasn\u2019t any resistance when I landed and took off at a dead sprint for the glass doors.</p><p>I can hear Axel screaming and cursing behind me, but I don\u2019t even pause. My body is driving me since my mind refuses to think. The only thought I\u2019m capable of at this point is finding my boy and then my wife.</p> <p>The little old lady sitting at the desk visibly shrinks back when I all but break down the wall to get into the hospital. Her eyes widen for a second before she catches herself and wipes her expression clear.</p><p>\u201cCan I help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa and Cohen Cage. My family...please,\u201d I gasp, not even giving her the time to finish. I can feel the cool air on my wet cheeks, my tears once again flowing freely.</p><p>She looks down, glancing back up at me quickly before returning her eyes to her computer.</p><p>\u201cSir, I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>I sag with relief when Axel speaks from my side. \u201cMelissa Cage, ma\u2019am. Brought in by helicopter approximately fifteen minutes ago. Her son, also his son, Cohen Cage, should be arriving by ambulance either shortly after her or soon. Please, make the call and find out where he can find his family.\u201d</p><p>Even with his hand grasping my shoulder again, I can\u2019t feel it. That solid strength that he\u2019s trying to pass through to me is completely lost to my panic. I look around, praying that I\u2019ll see Melissa and Cohen in one of the many chairs around the room. Praying that this is some sick joke and my family is okay.</p><p>\u201cGreg, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I look over at Axel\u2019s concerned expression, realizing that I missed the rest of his conversation.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Cohen\u2019s already here being seen and this nice nurse here, Lucy, is taking us to where he is.\u201d He points over to the nurse who\u2019s standing next to the desk, looking at me with the same expression of concern that Axel has on his face.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have to tell me twice. The second I hear that I am about to hold my boy, I feel my heart start beating a little faster. Knowing that they wouldn\u2019t be taking me to him if he were badly injured is helping my fear recede some.</p><p>I watch the young nurse\u2019s ponytail sway with each rapid step she takes. I keep wanting to run past her and scream Cohen\u2019s name until I find him, but each time my pace gets too heavy, Axel clears his throat and grabs my arm. I feel like punching him in his goddamn arm for making me walk at this ridiculous pace. We should be running\u2014hell, sprinting\u2014through the halls.</p><p>\u201cRight in here, Mr. Cage,\u201d Nurse Lucy states, opening the door to one of the emergency rooms.</p><p>I take a step toward the curtain that\u2019s pulled closed. I can hear movement, but I haven\u2019t heard my boy. I still feel the adrenalin pumping rapidly through my body, demanding that I rush, but now that I\u2019m faced with not knowing what\u2019s on the other side of this blue barrier, I\u2019m paralyzed in fear.</p><p>\u201cGo. Now. I\u2019ll find someone who can give you some information on Melissa and go back out to the waiting room to see if anyone else is here yet.\u201d Axel gives me a shove before walking back down the hallway we just came down.</p><p>With a deep breath, I reach out and open the curtain. I couldn\u2019t have helped the sob that bubbles out audibly if I tried.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d His voice wobbles, and his chin quivers.</p><p>With one word, my body wakes up and I all but fall to his side. The nurse standing at his side jumps out of my way and allows me to fall to my knees next to the hospital bed that is all but swallowing his small body whole.</p><p>\u201cOh, God... Cohen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can hold his right hand, sir. We\u2019re just about done with his left side.\u201d</p><p>I pull my eyes from Cohen\u2019s for the first time since opening the curtain and notice another person in the room working on stitching up part of his forearm. I can\u2019t see much more because of the angle, but I can see the amount of blood surrounding him, and it feels like a knife has just shot through my heart.</p><p>I don\u2019t even look up at the other nurse I almost ran over. I pick Cohen\u2019s hand up and press it to my lips, breathing in his scent.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help Mommy.\u201d His hand squeezes mine tight, his body shaking so hard that he\u2019s vibrating the bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. It\u2019s okay. Mommy\u2019s tough. She\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d</p><p>Looking into his eyes, which are normally so full of life, and seeing the pain, fear, and stark, cold terror, I know he doesn\u2019t believe a word out of my mouth. If I\u2019m honest with myself, I know that I sound more like I\u2019m begging than I am reassuring.</p><p>\u201cMiss? Is there any way I can get some information on his mother? My wife? She was in the accident as well.\u201d I look into Cohen\u2019s scared eyes, thankful that he\u2019s here and keeping me from tearing this hospital to the ground until I find Melissa. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t have any information on the other person in the vehicle.

From what I can see, the worst of his injuries seem to be the millions of little cuts on almost every open surface of skin on his left side. He seems tired but otherwise just really banged up.</p><p>I take the first real breath I\u2019ve breathed since I got Beck\u2019s call earlier.</p><p>Now I just need to know that Melissa and the girls are okay.

I know it\u2019s the crash from the adrenalin and the pain medication that they gave him, but I hate it. I want to be able to see his eyes and know that he\u2019s okay.</p><p>I keep one hand around his and the other placed lightly on his stomach so that I can feel his breaths causing it to rise and fall.</p><p>And I wait.</p><p>I almost jump out of my skin when the door finally opens again and a forty-something doctor enters. His expression doesn\u2019t give anything away as he walks farther into the room, stopping at the foot of Cohen\u2019s bed. I stare into his dark blue eyes, both praying for the best and fearing the worst.</p><p>It isn\u2019t until I look down and notice \u2018OBGYN\u2019 on his white jacket that I feel something akin to terror crawl down my spine.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Cage?\u201d</p><p>I nod, afraid to speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Lowery. I know you\u2019re asking about your wife, and I apologize that I don\u2019t know more. About two hours ago, I performed an emergency Cesarean section on your wife. My job was to quickly deliver both of your daughters safely, and the last I heard, your wife is still in surgery. Both of your daughters are stable and in the NICU. Mr. Cage, I know you and your wife were told about the possibility that she wouldn\u2019t make it to term, but it\u2019s going to be a long road ahead for your daughters.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, feeling my despair fall one tear at a time down my face. I listen to every word that Dr. Lowery speaks. Steroids, feeding tubes, antibiotics, nasal CPAP, and monitors. I hear the words, but I don\u2019t understand them. My girls shouldn\u2019t be here yet, and no matter what he said earlier about Melissa being in surgery, the only thing that I can focus on is that if my girls had to be removed from their mother early, how badly is she injured?</p><p>\u201c... see your daughters shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I have to force myself to look back up into his knowing eyes.</p> <p>He smiles kindly and takes another step into the room. \u201cI spoke with your son\u2019s doctor before coming in. He\u2019s lucky, and they\u2019ll be discharging him within the hour. We\u2019ll get you up to see your daughters shortly, Mr. Cage.\u201d</p><p>I just nod my head and watch him turn and leave. My mind is refusing to make sense of everything that\u2019s happening around me. The only thing keeping me from running through this whole damn building until I find Melissa and my daughters is the little banged-up boy sleeping in front of me.</p><p>With a deep breath and another silent prayer, I wait again.</p><p>With every minute that passes and still no word on Melissa, I feel more and more of my soul being stripped from my body. That hope I had earlier has become so small that I almost can\u2019t feel it anymore.</p><p>In the last hour, I\u2019ve had nurses come in to check Cohen and Axel come back to update me on who is here and to tell me the same thing each time\u2014no one will tell him anything. I\u2019ve filled out a million and one pieces of paper, and now I just keep staring at the two bracelets the last nurse attached to my wrist.</p><p>I finger the bracelets, watching them spin around my wrist, and once again fight the urge to take off on a hunt for my family.</p><p>My daughters... My girls are here and fighting in some cold and sterile room. They\u2019re fighting to live and there isn\u2019t a damn thing I can do to protect them. Every instinct in my body is telling me to go into protector mode.</p><p>My wife, my beautiful and loving wife, is somewhere within these walls, and the unknown is tearing me apart.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Cohen\u2019s soft whisper has me dropping my hands and looking over at him. \u201cWill Mommy be okay?\u201d His chin starts to tremble slightly.</p><p>\u201cC-Man, can I tell you a secret?\u201d He nods his head, a few tears slipping past his lids. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you a trick. Remember when I told you that we always protect the women we love? Well, Mommy and your sisters need a special kind of protection. They need us to keep strong and share our strength with them. Every time you think about your mommy, you give her just a little more strength. And when you tell her you love her, it\u2019s even stronger. So right now, we\u2019re going to sit here and we\u2019re going to talk about every single thing we love about your mommy. And when we finish with that, we\u2019re going to talk about every single thing we can\u2019t wait to show your sisters. Then it won\u2019t be long before they have so much strength that they just can\u2019t help but get better.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s just what we do. I hold his little hand and we talk about every single thing we love about Melissa until they finally release Cohen from their care. </p><p>I hold it in, but deep down, I feel the bone-deep fear that I have no control over the outcome.</p><p>With my son in my arms, we walk out of the exam room and follow the nurse up to the NICU, where I\u2019m told a doctor will find me shortly with news on the babies and Melissa.</p><p>My heart is somewhere in this hospital, and I can only hope and pray that everything will be okay.</p><p>Chapter 10 \u2013 Greg</p><p>\u201cMr. Cage?\u201d I jump when I hear my name being whispered. When I look around, it takes me a second to remember where I am, but when I do, it all comes crashing down at once.</p><p>Melissa.</p><p>The accident.</p><p>My girls, born and fighting for their lives.</p><p>Cohen, safe and scared.</p><p>Everything I thought set in stone for our happy lives together is hanging by a thread.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d She smiles weakly, giving me a chance to get my bearings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t realize I had fallen asleep.\u201d</p><p>I look around, noting that Axel and Izzy are still in the same spot across the room. Dee\u2019s moved and is now lying with her head in Beck\u2019s lap. Asher is pacing, no doubt having a hard time being in the hospital so soon after losing his brother. Sway and Davey are seated in chairs, silently holding hands and waiting for the nurse to start talking.</p><p>Fortunately, Chelcie took Cohen home with her. It had been almost impossible for me to let him go, but I know he needs to be able to sleep and I need to be able to be here for Melissa.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come and see your daughters? I apologize for not being out here sooner. We\u2019ve had a few other emergencies come in within the last hour that have kept me tied up.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time since I got the call from Beck earlier, I feel a little bit of hope wash over my body.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d I clear the emotions threatening to bubble over the top with a cough. \u201cYes, please. I need to see my girls.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and asks me to follow her. I take one more look around the room, meeting the eyes of my friends who have proven time and time again that we are just a big family. We love together, we fight together, and most importantly, we\u2019re there when one of us hits rock bottom with no hope of getting up again without support.</p><p>When we finally stop walking she asks me to put on a gown, a mask, and some stupid hat to cover my hair. I don\u2019t even question her. Knowing that my girls are just beyond the doorway has me rushing through all of her instructions.</p><p>The second I finish scrubbing what feels like every inch of my skin, I turn to her and wait. I try and calm my breathing, but knowing that I\u2019m seconds away from meeting my daughters is making that next to impossible.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed by all the wires. They really are more intimidating than anything. Right now, they\u2019re doing remarkably well for being born this early. I was just looking at their charts before I came to find you. The doctor will go over it in more detail, but those two little girls are some strong little fighters.\u201d</p><p>I give her a weak smile, unable to express how much that means to me right now. Hearing that my girls have their mother\u2019s spirit helps that little seed of hope to grow a little larger.</p><p>Right before we step into the room I stop her, asking the one question I desperately need an answer to. \u201cMy wife, please... I need to know how she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you in here to see your girls and I\u2019ll go chase down her doctor for you, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, take a deep breath, and get ready to see my girls.</p><p>There is nothing in this world that can prepare you for the helplessness you feel at seeing your tiny babies with tubes and wires connected all over their small bodies. Everything about them terrifies me. But seeing them in their plastic incubator, the machines telling me that they are very much alive, gives me a small sliver of peace. I would give anything to be able to hold my girls, but for now I\u2019ll settle with the small hole I\u2019m allowed to stick my hand through to feel their skin against my own.</p> <p>I listen intently when the nurses explained everything they have attached to them and their care plan. Knowing that they have a long road ahead of them is made easier by knowing that there is a clear path to get to the finish line.</p><p>I spend the next thirty minutes in there looking at my princesses and stroking their tiny arms and hands, both just a little over three pounds of perfection, and giving my heart over to two more people.</p><p>I can\u2019t take my eyes off them, but when I hear a throat clear behind me, I finally allow myself to step away from my girls.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cage.\u201d</p><p>I look down at his lab coat. \u201cDr. Walsh.\u201d I turn to give my girls another look, bending forward and whispering softly to each of them through their incubator, \u201cBe strong, my little warriors. Daddy loves you.\u201d</p><p>Once we step into the hall, Dr. Walsh turns to me and doesn\u2019t waste any time. \u201cIf you could follow me, I\u2019ll take you to your wife\u2019s room, Mr. Cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...she\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. He just looks at me with his expressionless eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you, Mr. Cage. Your wife is lucky to be alive. She\u2019s suffered extensive head trauma and has three broken ribs, a broken arm, and a broken leg. There was some internal bleeding that we were able to get under control rather quickly. Her head injury is the most important thing we\u2019re monitoring right now. We need to make sure we prevent the possibility of a secondary injury that could arise from here on. Your wife was unconscious when she arrived, and at the moment, we have her placed in a medically induced coma. We\u2019ve discovered significant swelling of her brain as well as slight bleeding. So, like I said, that is our main concern right now. Our neurosurgery team will be monitoring the pressure in her brain with a bolt that was already placed and that will help guide the therapy as needed. We\u2019ve started her on a medication called Keppra to prevent any seizures. I can only tell you that she\u2019s in good hands, Mr. Cage. We will be able to tell you more in the coming days, as the next twenty-four hours are the most critical.\u201d</p> <p>My mouth opens, but no words came out. Trying to process all the medical vomit he just spewed all over me is taking too much energy. I grasp on to the only thing I can\u2014knowing she\u2019s alive and that the rest will fall in place. I keep picturing her beautiful face telling me that she loved me earlier today. Or was it yesterday?</p><p>Silently, I nod my head and wait for the doctor to take me to my wife. With every step, I beg God to let me take her place.</p><p>Chapter 11 \u2013 Greg</p><p>I thought I knew what it was like to live a nightmare.</p><p>When I lost Grace, I felt a pain that I hoped never returned.</p><p>When Cohen was kidnapped, I felt a hopelessness that crushed my soul.</p><p>When I saw my little girls, so achingly small, fighting for each breath, I felt a fear I\u2019d never known I could possess.</p><p>When I walk into Melissa\u2019s hospital room and see her hooked to machines, bruised and battered... I feel a little piece of myself die.</p><p>I\u2019m living a nightmare that I can only pray I wake up from.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to put into words how you feel when you see the love of your life like that. I watch her chest rise with each breath, giving me the reassurance that she\u2019s still with me, but looking at her so obviously broken has my knees buckling before I had make it more than five feet into the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel the doctor pause, waiting to see if he needs to assist me, but I wave him off. Dropping my hands to the floor and letting my head hang, I pray. I scream and plead, once again, for God\u2019s mercy. I can\u2019t lose Melissa. There\u2019s no other alternative for me. She\u2019s mine, and I won\u2019t let anyone take her.</p><p>I pull in a deep breath, holding it while I get my courage back together before picking myself off the floor and walking over to the side of her bed.</p><p>And that\u2019s where I stay, holding her hand and caressing her soft skin while I listen to the doctor go on and on about her injuries. I try to understand what he is telling me, but with each word that passes his lips, I realize just how very real this is.</p><p>His heavy hand settles on my shoulder, but I can\u2019t look away from her beautiful face, I\u2019m trying to see past the swelling and bruises to glimpse the woman I kissed goodbye hours before.</p> <p>\u201c... time will tell, Mr. Cage. For now, we will monitor your wife closely for changes.\u201d</p><p>I look up when I hear him leaving, the door closing softly behind him, and I sit there in the dim light of Melissa\u2019s hospital room and start singing. At first, it\u2019s anything I can think of that she might like, but after a few songs, I just start the humming familiar melody Adele\u2019s \u2018Make You Feel My Love\u2019 over and over. The words start to flow without thought while my thumb rubs in small circles against her wrist, my tears rolling down my face unchecked.</p><p>God, what the hell do I do now?</p><p>Chapter 12 \u2013 Cohen</p><p>I don\u2019t like this place. It smells funny, and everyone looks sad. I just want my mommy and daddy. Aunt Izzy told me this morning that it\u2019s okay to be scared and that she was there if I needed a hug. I don\u2019t need a hug. I\u2019m a big boy.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been sitting here for a really long time, long enough to watch three shows on Uncle Axel\u2019s phone. I hope Daddy comes to get me soon.</p><p>The doctors and nurses always run around here like they forgot to turn the oven off. Mommy always does that a lot. Uncle Axel and Aunt Izzy are here watching me, but Nate stayed home with Dilbert and Davey. Aunt Izzy said that Nate is too little to be here. Uncle Beck and Aunt Dee went to go get me some breakfast, but I didn\u2019t want to go with them because I\u2019m waiting on my daddy to come and get me. I\u2019m going to see my mommy soon.</p><p>I heard Aunt Izzy on the phone this morning when Daddy called. She didn\u2019t think I could hear her, but she was being loud like Aunt Dee gets when she talks about her silly shoes. She told Daddy that I\u2019m being such a good little boy and that she would take me to him if he really wanted her to. It\u2019s been almost two weeks since my mommy went to sleep and Daddy started sleeping at the hospital with her. I don\u2019t know how long that is, but that\u2019s what Aunt Izzy said. It feels like a really long time.</p><p>I miss them, but I don\u2019t tell anyone because I\u2019m being strong like Daddy.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I wouldn\u2019t want to go to my daddy. He makes everything okay. I want to yell at Aunt Izzy when she calls me a little boy. I\u2019m not a little boy. I\u2019m a big boy, and I\u2019m going to use all of my powers to make everything better.</p><p>Last night I came to see Daddy and I really didn\u2019t want to leave. My side still hurts, and I\u2019m itchy where they had to tie my skin with little strings after Mommy\u2019s car broke. Mommy would have made it not hurt anymore. Aunt Izzy doesn\u2019t kiss my boo-boos like Mommy does.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m sitting here in the stinky hospital, waiting on my daddy to come and take me to see my girls. No one will tell me where my sisters are. Aunt Izzy says that they have to sleep in a special clear box like Snow White did so that the germs don\u2019t hurt them while they get healthy. I don\u2019t like my girls sleeping in a box. They need to get better so I can teach them everything I know.</p><p>I\u2019m going to teach them how to fight the bad guys, find the best rocks, where Mommy keeps her chocolate, how to paint and color, all the things that make Mommy and Daddy smile, and all the things that make Mommy and Daddy really laugh. Yup, they need to get better so I can teach them everything I know!</p><p>I kick my legs some more, letting them swing really fast, and think about how I can make my girls\u2019 box better.</p><p>\u201cHey, C-Man.\u201d I jump when I hear the deep voice, but I smile when I see who it is.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me, Maddox Locke.\u201d Daddy said that he\u2019s been chasing Aunt Emmy and he\u2019s going to bring her back to us, so I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s here. I don\u2019t like the way he keeps looking at me either. Everyone keeps looking at me like they don\u2019t know what to do with me.</p><p>\u201cBrought you something, Cohen.\u201d</p><p>I look up and see some red stuff in Maddox Locke\u2019s hand. I can\u2019t wait to get a present. This place doesn\u2019t have anything fun to do. When he unfolds it, I see a cape just like the one the ambulance man cut off of me the other day. I want to smile.</p><p>I haven\u2019t smiled since Mommy fell asleep when that truck hit her car. I don\u2019t want to smile. But now I can. I have my power back, and I can help my mommy and my girls.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Maddox Locke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Cohen Cage.\u201d</p><p>He sits down next to me and helps tie my cape around my neck. It feels good to have my magic back. When I didn\u2019t have my cape and my mommy wasn\u2019t there, I got really scared. I didn\u2019t tell Daddy, but I didn\u2019t like being scared.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at him. \u201cI know Daddy is at the hospital because Mommy is sleeping and my sisters are out of her belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, C, and right now your daddy needs to be there for them because they need him real bad. I know you\u2019re really strong so they\u2019re going to need you too, but little dudes can\u2019t sleep at hospitals so I\u2019m going to stay with you for a little while. If that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I still get to see Daddy and our girls?\u201d</p><p>Maddox Locke smiles and I smile back, but I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah, buddy. Your daddy will be out here after he finishes talking to the morning doctor and then we can see about seeing your girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay! Thank you, Maddox Locke. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re home.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel better now. I pull the sides of my cape over my shoulders and close my eyes when I feel it tighten across my back. Taking a deep breath, I open my eyes and wait for Daddy so we can take care of our girls.</p><p>We don\u2019t get to see my girls right away. Daddy comes out and hugs me for a really long time. I see him every day, and every day he hugs me like this. Sometimes he squeezes me so hard it hurts just a little, but I like it. Daddy\u2019s hugs always make my sad stop.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, do I get to see my girls today?\u201d</p><p>He smiles big, but he still looks sleepy. If Mommy wasn\u2019t sleeping she would make him take a nap so he didn\u2019t turn into a grump.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, C-Man. I bet we can make that happen today. I\u2019m going to go up and see them in a little while, so I\u2019ll ask the doctor if we can work something out. Do you think it would be okay for Maddox to sit with you while you visit with Mommy today? Just while I run up to see your sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Daddy. I\u2019ll take good care of Mommy while you go see Lila and Lyn.\u201d I really want to see my sisters, but I want to spend some time with Mommy.</p><p>\u201cLila and Lyn, huh?\u201d He smiles and for the first time in a lot of days, his smile doesn\u2019t look sad.</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d</p><p>He hugs me again and then picks me up to take me to see my mommy.</p> <p>Maddox Locke got really bored while I talked to Mommy, so I let him play Flappy Birds on my iPod. I laughed really hard when he got so mad that he threw my iPod. Especially when he called Aunt Dee and asked her to stop at the store to buy me a new one. </p><p>\u201cSorry I broke your toy, Cohen, but Dee\u2019s going to bring you a new one in just a little while... Hey, why don\u2019t we keep this between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaddox Locke, you\u2019re lucky my mommy didn\u2019t see you throw a fit or you would be in time out for a reallllly long time.\u201d I laugh when his face turns red like Mommy\u2019s does when Daddy says stuff in her ear.</p><p>\u201cRight. Wouldn\u2019t want to be in time out, little dude. I\u2019m going to step into the bathroom, remember not to touch any of the cords, okay?\u201d</p><p>I wait until he steps into the bathroom before I look back at Mommy. She looks so pretty when she sleeps, even if she still has some bumps and cuts. She\u2019s still the most beautiful mommy in the whole world.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mommy. You\u2019re going to wake up and be so proud of Daddy and me. I\u2019ve been eating all my vegetables and cleaning up my messes. I stay with Aunt Chelcie some. Just when Aunt Izzy has to work and stuff. I don\u2019t know why because Aunt Izzy just plays on her computer. Aunt Chelcie doesn\u2019t really know what to do with me all the time. She cries a lot too, but says it\u2019s horn moans. I haven\u2019t heard of those before, but I hope I never get them. I wish you would wake up, Mommy.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t wake up.</p><p>I keep wishing she would though.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see my sisters soon. Daddy said they are really small, but I\u2019m still going to love them.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, scoot really close to Mommy without touching her cords, and start whispering the words I know will make her happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you singing, Cohen?\u201d</p><p>I heard Maddox Locke come back in from the bathroom when I was in the middle of my song, but I couldn\u2019t stop. Mommy needs to hear all the words to get better.</p><p>\u201cSinging Daddy\u2019s song. He sings it to her every single day. He told me that Mommy can hear him singing and she will know how much he loves her, so I\u2019m singing Mommy his song so she knows how much I love her. Did you know that our love is going to make her all better?\u201d I smile big at Maddox Locke, because I know I\u2019m right. Soon she\u2019s going to wake up and it\u2019s going to be because of our love.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re onto something, little dude. Why don\u2019t you teach me the words so I can help you out?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how long we sit here, but Maddox Locke helps me sing Daddy\u2019s song to Mommy so many times I get so tired I fall asleep.</p><p>Chapter 13 \u2013 Greg</p><p>I have to stop at the door of Melissa\u2019s room before entering when I hear Cohen\u2019s words to Maddox. It never fails to amaze me just how perfect my son is. I can\u2019t imagine how he is feeling through all of this. Not only with Melissa\u2019s situation, but with having to stay with Izzy and Axel, sometimes with Chelcie, for the last two weeks. He hasn\u2019t complained, not one damn word, but deep down I know he\u2019s scared. Hell, I\u2019m scared out of my fucking mind. If I could keep him here with me every second I would, but between Melissa and the girls, I\u2019m stretched thin. There are two floors between us, but it feels like an ocean.</p><p>This morning I got the best news I have received since this nightmare began. The swelling on Melissa\u2019s brain is completely gone. The doctors keep telling me that we\u2019re in the home stretch. All her scans look great, her vitals are getting stronger and stronger daily, and her other injuries are healing well. Now we\u2019re just waiting for her to wake up.</p><p>I miss her more than I ever thought was possible. I\u2019ve only left her side to go see the girls. It\u2019s like having my chest split open each and every time I have to leave Melissa to go to the girls, and it\u2019s just as bad when I leave the girls to come back to Melissa. She wouldn\u2019t want them up there alone, and as much as I want to stand by her bedside and guard her sleeping body, I know where I\u2019m needed the most right now.</p><p>My girls need me, but I know they need their mother more.</p><p>Lillian is such a champ; she definitely takes after Melissa with her fighter\u2019s spirit. She\u2019s been the one I know, in my gut, I don\u2019t have to be concerned about. Even in this short time, I can see little differences in her. She doesn\u2019t look as tiny and breakable as she first did. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. She\u2019s still so little I\u2019m afraid to breathe around her, but she\u2019s a born fighter.</p><p>Lyndsie, on the other hand, worries me. I can feel her pain, her struggles, and I crave the ability to take them from her, to heal her. Like her sister, her lungs aren\u2019t developed. A few days after she was born, she had to be placed on a CPAP machine because one of her little lungs collapsed. I didn\u2019t sleep one wink that night. She\u2019s been able to come off of it now, but that still doesn\u2019t stop my fears of something else going wrong. Luckily, she seems to be turning a corner. Our most recent struggle is her reflux and her inability to gain weight. This morning I had more good news from the doctors when they said that Lyndsie hadn\u2019t had any episodes, and kept all her feedings down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thank Christ.</p><p>I do what I can. I stay strong when all I want to do is break down. I visit all three of my girls. I hold Melissa\u2019s hand while I sing and talk to her. I reach through the girls\u2019 incubators and run my finger across their silky skin, avoiding all the wires, singing softly to them and telling them how much we love them.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I look up from where I was staring at my feet, and meet Maddox\u2019s hard but sad eyes. He\u2019s never been one to show his emotions, but he would have to be completely heartless to be unaffected by this whole situation.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? And don\u2019t give me any shit, Greg. There isn\u2019t any way in hell that you\u2019re this calm on the inside.\u201d He props up against the wall next to Melissa\u2019s door and just waits.</p><p>I could ignore him like I\u2019ve ignored everyone else but Cohen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m falling apart, brother. I\u2019ve had to keep my shit locked so tight I feel like someone locked me in a cage and threw away the key. Part of me wants to let loose, uncage the beast I can feel pacing inside me. I want to run through the halls, demanding answers and quick fixes. Goddamn, I just want my girls better and all of this to just be one big nightmare.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say much for the longest time. He just presses his lips into a thin line. If it weren\u2019t for the rapid drumming of the veins in his neck, I would think he\u2019s the picture of calm and collected. But I know better. I know how much it costs him to just be inside a hospital. </p> <p>\u201cYou remember how it was after I got hurt? You can\u2019t rush these things, Greg. And as much as I wish you could... Well, she\u2019ll wake up when her body is ready. Doctors are telling you her brain is ready, scans are showing she\u2019s ready, but mentally she\u2019s locking herself up tight until she is ready. I don\u2019t talk about what it was like for me all those months in the hospital after the attack. You know because you were on my team, but the only reason I pulled through was because I thought I had a reason to wake up. Keep talking to her and remind her why she needs to come back.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t heard Maddox speak about the bombing that essentially ended his military career for years. Hell, it\u2019s probably been close to ten now, but damn if it doesn\u2019t give me a spark of hope.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know how you always know the right shit to say, but thank you. I\u2019ve been struggling, Mad. Struggling so hard I don\u2019t even know how to get past this bump in the road. I feel like I\u2019m letting everyone down. Even Cohen. God, Maddox...he\u2019s been so brave, and I can\u2019t even offer him any kind of promise that his mother and sisters will be okay. How the hell am I going to get past this shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the easy part. Hike your goddamn big boy panties up and you be the hero that little boy knows you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>I jump slightly when I hear Cohen\u2019s voice, my brows creasing in concern when I hear his tone, but the second I see his eyes shining with hope, I push myself off the wall and drop down onto my knees in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cHey, C-Man. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d he whispered so softly that I almost didn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>\u201cCohen?\u201d I question, starting to panic slightly.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Tears begin to pile in his lids, causing my heart to beat at a pace so rapid I fear it might pop right out of my chest.</p><p>I feel Maddox move past me into Melissa\u2019s room but keep my eyes focused on Cohen.</p><p>\u201cIt happened,\u201d His body starts shaking with his gasping breath, and I wrap my arms around him, pulling him into my arms.</p><p>\u201cCohen, please talk to me. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d I don\u2019t get to finish my thought because I am interrupted when Maddox rushes back into the hallway. One look at his face and I know something has happened.</p><p>I scoop Cohen up in my arms and rush past a stunned Maddox, my feet almost too heavy to pick up, but when I get to into the room, I stop dead in my tracks.</p> <p>My chest burns; it burns so badly. I don\u2019t even attempt to stop the tears that are rapidly falling down my face. I don\u2019t even notice Cohen squirming to get down until Maddox pulls him out of my hold. It isn\u2019t until I feel his weight leave my body that I drop to the floor with a howl of relief so loud I swear the windows shake.</p><p>I quickly pick myself off the floor and keep my eyes locked on the hospital bed my wife is lying on still. When I see Melissa\u2019s beautiful blue eyes staring sleepily back at me, I rush to her side, pressing kisses all over her forehead and sobbing like a baby.</p><p>The next thirty minutes are a rush of activity. Doctors and nurses run in and out of the room. Her vitals are checked and rechecked. They move cords, unhook machines, and give her more medication. The whole time, her eyes never leave mine. I can see the worry, fear, and confusion all rolling around behind her eyes. I want to hurry to her side, but I keep my feet rooted to the floor where the doctor demanded I stand.</p><p>I nod my head when they explain to me what is going on, I grunted when answers are demanded, and the whole time I keep her gaze. I never leave her line of sight; it is just the two of us in a room full of chaos.</p><p>\u201cGreg,\u201d she whispers, her voice low, gravely, and unused.</p><p>I can tell it caused her pain to even talk, so I move quickly to her side, grabbing her hand and dropping my head against the bed next to her hip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Beauty. God, I\u2019m here. I love you. I love you so damn much. Thank you for coming back to us.\u201d My body is shaking with the force of my emotion. I can feel her fingertips lightly moving against my cheek. Even though her body is drained of energy, she\u2019s still trying to fight through the darkness to comfort me.</p><p>There is no way in hell I deserve this woman.</p><p>\u201cBabies,\u201d she rasps again. \u201cMy... bab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, now. The girls... God, the girls are perfect. Just like I knew they would be. They look just like you, Beauty. Just like you. Perfectly perfect.\u201d</p><p>Tears leak from the corners of her eyes, sliding silently down her face. She smiles weakly before she closes her eyes and her breathing deepens.</p><p>I frantically look around before my eyes settle on a young nurse standing at the foot of her bed. Her eyes are wet, and she\u2019s holding her hand against her chest like she\u2019s in pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease! Help her! She can\u2019t... Why isn\u2019t she awake?! Help, please!\u201d My panic is starting to consume me, and the little burst of joy that just flooded my system is dying.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Mommy is just taking a nap now. Doctor said so. He said Mommy would be tired and her body needed more sleep. That\u2019s silly though because Mommy\u2019s been asleep for a million days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, brother. It\u2019s time to release that breath you\u2019ve been holding for a million days.\u201d</p><p>I laugh when Maddox stops talking. I laugh for the first time in weeks. It sounds rusty, and I\u2019m sure I look like a complete fool. But I laugh. I keep laughing as Cohen climbs into my lap and laughs with me.</p> <p>And then I take that breath that I\u2019ve been holding since this all started.</p><p>I take that breath, pull my son close, and let the floodgates fly open. Every ounce of fear I\u2019ve had consuming my body comes rushing to the surface so that the joy I\u2019m feeling has room to take its place.</p><p>Chapter 14 \u2013 Cohen</p><p>Mommy is awake now.</p><p>I\u2019ve been really scared, but I\u2019ve been a big boy and didn\u2019t tell anyone. I didn\u2019t want anyone to know.</p> <p>But I used my magic and sang Mommy her song and it worked.</p><p>It worked!</p><p>Now it\u2019s time to use my magic on my girls.</p><p>I just know it\u2019s going to work too, because my girls know. They know that I\u2019m their big brother and I\u2019ll never ever ever let anything hurt them.</p><p>\u201cDaddy. I need to see my girls now. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Daddy looks at me with a really funny face. I\u2019ve never seen him do that face before, but it\u2019s really funny. It\u2019s the face that Uncle Axel always makes when Dilbert is running around in those really tall shoes that Aunt Dee wears. They look like they hurt really bad, but Dilbert is always running around like a funny man. Uncle Axel makes that face, kinda like he swallowed a fly and he doesn\u2019t know how to get it out.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy. We need to go now.\u201d</p><p>He looks at Mommy again and then up at Maddox Locke before he looks back at me. \u201cRight now, C-Man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy. Right this minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then. Let\u2019s go see if we can get them to open the curtain for you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like the sounds of that. I don\u2019t want to look into the curtain anymore. I want to touch my sisters so they can feel my magic, but I guess I can figure out another way.</p><p>I jump down from Daddy\u2019s lap and hold my hand out for him. He shakes his head, and I smile when he holds my hand, stands, and gets ready to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find me if she wakes up before we get back?\u201d he asks Maddox Locke.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>I turn back and look at Maddox Locke; he smiles big and winks at me. I smile back, really big, because Maddox Locke doesn\u2019t smile a lot, but when he does, it\u2019s really cool.</p><p>\u201cCohen, what are we doing?\u201d</p><p>I finish untying my cape from around my neck. It\u2019s not the same as my old one, but I know it has my magic on it because I haven\u2019t taken it off once since Maddox Locke tied it around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fix my sisters.\u201d</p><p>I know Daddy doesn\u2019t understand, but I just smile and hand him my cape.</p><p>\u201cUh, okay?\u201d He looks down at me. His face is funny again. And then he looks at my cape in his really big hand. \u201cWhat do you want me to do with this, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girls need it. But you have to tell them that it\u2019s from their big brother. They have to know that it\u2019s from me or the magic won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCohen, son... I need you to clear it up for me because I\u2019m a little confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you have to stay with me here.\u201d He laughs, but I keep going. This is important. \u201cYou need to take my magic in there. My girls are in their box and they need my magic!\u201d</p><p>Why doesn\u2019t he understand? If I could go in there and do it myself, I would, but they won\u2019t let me in there. They say I have to stay out here because I might have germs.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Cohen... Let me see what I can do.\u201d He waves over the nice nurse lady who always smiles at me. I can\u2019t hear what they say when she steps out of the room my girls are in, but I really don\u2019t like her funny face.</p><p>I want to yell when Daddy hands her my cape, but I keep quiet and watch her walk back into the room. I can see my girls sleeping in the same box. I hate them in that glass box.</p><p>He picks me up and holds me high so that I can see in the room a little better. I keep watching as the nurse weaves through the stuff in her way until she reaches my girls.</p><p>The nurse looks over and smiles at us again. I hold my breath when she takes my cape and lays it across my girls\u2019 glass box. She smiles again, waves, and gives me a thumbs up.</p><p>I look over at Daddy. His face looks funny again, but this time his eyes are wet. That\u2019s okay; I won\u2019t tell anyone that he cried. I smile again because this time I know that everything is going to be just perfect.</p><p>Chapter 15 \u2013 Melissa</p><p>Soft singing pulls me from my dreams\u2014that beautiful, deep baritone I\u2019ve heard in my dreams for what seems like ages. The feeling of love drips from each word, instantly warming my soul and easing my mind.</p><p>It takes me a few minutes to understand where I am and why I hear my husband singing to me about going to the ends of the earth, and it makes me feel his love. Why my eyelids feel as if they weigh a hundred pound each, my body is sluggish to my commands, and almost every inch of my body hums with pain.</p><p>I briefly remember opening my eyes earlier and seeing Greg in a hospital room. It\u2019s hazy, but I remember him, Cohen, and Maddox standing right inside the doorway...and then nothing else.</p><p>In those minutes, I noticed one thing with stark clarity. I didn\u2019t feel my babies. The pressure and dull pain I had become accustom to over the course of my pregnancy, the rolling of their bodies, the jabs and kicks\u2014all of it was gone. I can feel my panic starting to peak, knowing that there is something gravely wrong if my babies aren\u2019t here.</p><p>Oh, God!</p><p>In little flashes, like a projector playing slides of my last moments of consciousness, I remember.</p><p>Cohen being Cohen, making me laugh with his innocence and wonky train of thought. Looking up in the mirror to meet his smiling eyes. Driving through the green light and that terrible sound of horns and colliding metal. Screams from my boy and his sobbing voice telling me he loves me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then it all fades to black.</p><p>Cohen! My sweet boy! Where is my sweet boy?</p><p>Oh, God... My girls. It\u2019s too early for them to be out. They still need time!</p><p>My ribs burn when my panic starts to escalate. I hear beeping speed up, and those words that were singing earlier stop abruptly.</p> <p>Then I feel him.</p><p>His hands hold my head between them, his warm breath fanning across my face when he speaks, calming me instantly.</p><p>\u201cBeauty, my sweet Beauty, calm yourself. Everything is going to be fine. Everything and everyone... You\u2019re all safe, my love.\u201d His lips press against mine for a second before he\u2019s gone.</p><p>I try to open my eyes, but they burn. I try to speak, but my throat feels like I\u2019ve been eating dirt and glass. I try to move my arm, but it drops worthlessly.</p><p>\u201cShh. Let the nurse look at you, and I\u2019ll be right here,\u201d I hear Greg say from far away, his voice reassuring but thick with emotion.</p> <p>I slow my breathing and try to calm down my body. He said that everyone is fine. He wouldn\u2019t have said that if something had happened to our children.</p><p>But where are they?</p><p>Movement continues around me. My body is poked and moved around. I painfully answer all of her questions and try to remain calm until I feel my husband\u2019s hands on my skin again.</p><p>I need him.</p><p>I need his touch.</p><p>And I need his love.</p> <p>It feels like an eternity, but it\u2019s probably only ten minutes before I am given some small sips of water and moved to a more comfortable position. My vision is still blurry, but I can see him. The second I see his face, that perfectly handsome face I love so much, I feel a sob bubble out. It hurts\u2014oh it hurts more than I could have fathomed. Not just my screaming ribs, but low on my abdomen, the muscles feel unused and pulled tight.</p><p>I see his smile, and even with the tears running silently down his face, that smile never dims. I can tell that he hasn\u2019t slept\u2014his eyes look tired, rimmed red, and swollen. His clothing is wrinkled and stained. He looks...terrible, and it\u2019s the most incredible sight I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cYou look like crap,\u201d I rasp, smiling up at him as he walks over to the side of my bed.</p><p>He laughs, although it comes out more like a sob. \u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t your wife iron your clothes?\u201d I joke weakly.</p><p>His tears stop, and the fear leaves his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, she likes me better naked.\u201d</p><p>The nurse I wasn\u2019t aware was still in the room snickers from where she\u2019s standing while she enters data into the computer connected to the wall.</p> <p>\u201cLucky woman, that wife of yours,\u201d I whisper, my voice still gravelly in a painful way, but I feel my smile grow when he dips and moves his face closer to mine.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m lucky one, my beautiful wife.\u201d His lips close the distance again, pressing against mine and peppering loving kisses against my lips and face.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t make a move to deepen the kiss. He just keeps raining his love across my face.</p><p>When he pulls away, he wipes my tears away with his thumbs. I try to move my hand again, but I break eye contact when I feel the solid weight surrounding it. I see the cast just seconds before I notice my very obvious empty belly.</p><p>And I\u2019m right back to where I was minutes before.</p><p>\u201cOh, God! Greg... Cohen and the babies!\u201d My panic rises again.</p><p>\u201cHey... Melissa, calm down. Please. You don\u2019t need to be working yourself up so soon. They\u2019re okay. I promise you. Cohen is with Axel and Izzy. He\u2019ll be back as soon as visiting hours start in the morning. It got too late for him to stay, so they took him home to get some sleep. The girls, both of them... They\u2019re okay and close by in the NICU.\u201d</p><p>It takes a few seconds for his words to bleed into my panic-fog, but when they do, I fall back against the mattress and pillow and sob.</p><p>The tears fall rapidly. I gasp for breath, causing sharp pains to shoot from my ribs and abdomen. And through it all, Greg continues to whisper his love and reassurance.</p><p>My children are alive.</p><p>Everything is going to be okay.</p><p>I\u2019ve got my husband with his arms around me, pouring every ounce of strength he possesses into my body while he kisses my forehead and whispers softly in my ear. My son isn\u2019t hurt and being cared for by people we trust. And my daughters are here, safe and alive!</p><p>\u201cI need to see them, Greg. I need to see our babies!\u201d I have no idea if he can understand me, but he nods and promises me that as soon as the doctors allow it he will take me to our girls.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it, Beauty, but they look just like you. So tiny, but absolutely the most precious and beautiful babies in the world.\u201d He pulls out his phone and holds it so that I can see picture after picture of our daughters. When he gets to one of him holding one of their tiny bodies against his naked chest, his whole hand almost swallowing her small body, I lose it again.</p><p>\u201cHey, they\u2019re okay. This is Lyndsie. She\u2019s had the harder time between the two of them, but every time I\u2019m able to hold her skin to skin, she eats better. She hasn\u2019t been able to suck well, and she has some reflux problems, but she\u2019s doing great, Beauty. I held her earlier for a while just like this. Lillian, oh baby\u2014she is a warrior. The doctors think she\u2019ll go home before Lyndsie because she\u2019s breathing on her own now and eating well. She\u2019s gaining weight quickly. I bet she\u2019s a chunk before we know it.\u201d</p><p>I suck up each word he speaks while he flips through hundreds of pictures of our little girls. I can hear the pride in his voice when he speaks about them. I push back the jealousy I feel when he talks about holding them. I need to see my babies, to feel my babies, so I know that they\u2019re okay.</p><p>\u201c... so good, Beauty. You did so good.\u201d He drops the hand holding his phone, and I look over to him, smiling when I see the happiness in his eyes. \u201cI was so scared, Melissa. So scared that I would never get this. Every day you slept, I worried more and more. The doctors kept telling us that you would wake up when you were ready, but God...I was so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d It feels like I just went to sleep hours ago, but the way he speaks, it\u2019s been a lot longer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo weeks.

I need my family home.\u201d</p><p>We spend the rest of the night and into the morning whispering softly to each other in between small bouts of my sleeping. Every time I wake up, he\u2019s still sitting in the same chair, his crystal blue eyes just watching me sleep.</p> <p>Finally, sometime when the sun is creeping into the sky, I open my eyes from another nap to see his head against my thigh and hear soft snores echoing through the room.</p><p>Chapter 16 \u2013 Melissa</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so nervous.\u201d I look over at Greg, who is standing against the wall of the elevator as it climbs the two floors that will take me to my girls. \u201cSo damn nervous,\u201d I whisper again.</p><p>\u201cStop, Melissa. Once you see those two little princesses, all of those nerves will just wash away. When you feel their soft skin against your own, look at their small faces that are little mini versions of your own...all of that will just vanish, and the love you\u2019ll feel take its place is like nothing you have ever felt.\u201d</p><p>I have to blink away the tears that his words cause. My nose burns with the force of my emotions.</p> <p>The doors open and Greg takes his place behind my chair, pushing me onto the floor where my girls are. With every step he takes, my wheelchair moving closer and closer, I feel like I can sense my girls. Like my body knows that I\u2019m nearing my daughters.</p><p>We stop so that he can help me wash what feels like my whole body and push my arms through the gown I have to wear. It\u2019s hard with my cast to get everything situated, and by the time we finish, my frustration is strong. I just want to see my babies. I\u2019m so close to my girls.</p><p>\u201cI can see your mind working. We\u2019ll be in there in just a minute, but we have to follow the steps to make sure they are safe, Beauty.\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s right, but that doesn\u2019t stop the irrational mama bear that just wants her little cubs in her arms.</p><p>We finally get situated and he helps wheel me into the room. I know which incubator holds my girls before we\u2019re even all the way into the room. I see Cohen\u2019s bright red cape with its royal blue trim like a flag waving me home draped across one of the incubators.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted his magic in here. You should have seen him, Melissa. He had so much determination to get that in here so that he could save his sisters with his powers. That boy is something else. He\u2019s been amazing the last two weeks. So strong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds just like him.\u201d I smile but never move my eyes from the flash of red in the otherwise very dull room.</p><p>He pushes me closer until I\u2019m eye level with the two little babies nestled close to each other inside the small incubator. I don\u2019t even realize I am crying until I feel Greg wiping the tears from my face.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful,\u201d I whisper in awe.</p><p>\u201cThey sure are.\u201d</p><p>I just keep looking at them, taking in every single feature on their bodies as I feel the instantaneous love take over my nerves\u2014just like Greg said it would.</p><p>\u201cI need to feel them, Greg. I need to hold my babies.\u201d</p><p>He nods his head before he walks over to the nurse who is standing not that far from us and speaks softly. I can\u2019t hear what he\u2019s saying to her and I honestly don\u2019t care as long as it gets my babies in my arms.</p><p>We spend a while trying to figure out how to maneuver things so that I am able to hold my daughters. With my cast, it isn\u2019t possible to hold them both at the same time, so Greg helps the nurse place Lillian in my arms. The first time I feel her against my skin, I weep. I try to keep it together, but when that featherweight is pressed against my chest... I lose it. Greg stays close, keeping one hand against Lillian\u2019s back and the other arm draped across my shoulders.</p> <p>I hold her for about ten minutes before Greg takes over and the nurse helps move Lyndsie into my arms. Just like with Lillian, I bawl. Completely lose it. Greg pulls one of the rockers next to my wheelchair and sits next to me while he cradles Lillian against his strong chest.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so small, Greg. You swear they\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, Beauty.\u201d</p><p>I smile.</p><p>He smiles back, leans in, and kisses me lightly.</p><p>I place a kiss on Lyndsie\u2019s downy head, locking eyes with Greg as he does the same to Lillian.</p><p>We sit there a little while longer until the nurse comes up and asks if we would like her to take a picture for us.</p><p>And with my girls safe in our arms, my husband by my side, and a love big enough to smother you, we take the first picture with our daughters.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get one of those with Cohen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon?\u201d</p><p>Greg looks over at my question, that big smile from last night back on his face. \u201cSoon,\u201d he vows.</p><p>Epilogue \u2013 Greg \u2013 Three Months Later (Christmas)</p><p>\u201cDaddy! Daddy! DADDY!\u201d Cohen\u2019s warm breath hits my ear and his whisper is loud enough to wake the dead.</p><p>I groan, knowing that there is no way Cohen\u2019s going to sleep anytime soon. I feel like I just fell asleep seconds ago, which isn\u2019t far from the truth.</p><p>\u201cC-Man, what are you doing awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot things to do, Daddy!\u201d Jesus, he\u2019s starting to sound more and more like Maddox daily. Ever since they bonded when the girls were in the hospital, I feel like my son is turning into a Locke clone.</p><p>\u201cSon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy.\u201d</p><p>Melissa snickers next to me, and I know she gets a kick out of our four-year-old turning into some little mini alpha boy.</p><p>\u201cCohen, why don\u2019t we go to sleep for just a few more minutes?\u201d Or hours, I silently add.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnnnd why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d I finally peek my eyes open and jump when I realize how close he is to my face. \u201cJesus, son, do you have to sneak up like that?\u201d</p><p>He giggles softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t sneak up on you. I was just talking to you, Daddy. We have to go... Go now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I throw back the covers, remembering a second too late that I\u2019m still naked from taking Melissa just a few hours before.</p><p>\u201cHA! Daddy has his wiener rings in! Daddy, your wiener is funny looking with Mommy\u2019s earrings in there!\u201d He starts dancing around the room, chanting about my goddamn wiener rings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Melissa sits up and starts laughing uncontrollably. I look over at her and notice that the sheet has pooled around her waist about the same time Cohen does. I hold my breath...waiting for it.</p><p>\u201cMommy! Boobies! Mommy has boobies. Boobies. Boobies! Ha ha ha! I want Lucky Charms for breakfast! Let\u2019s go! I\u2019ll go get my girls!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to laugh now. Melissa is blushing about ten shades of red, and I\u2019m standing in the middle of the bedroom, naked as the day I was born, laughing at my wife.</p><p>As hectic as my life is between Cohen and all his crazy fun, two little girls who seem to do nothing but wake and eat with a little sleep sprinkled in there, and a full-time job, it\u2019s moments like this that make me realize just how lucky we are and just how blessed we are to be here.</p><p>It hasn\u2019t been easy. Melissa had to stay in the hospital for two weeks after she woke up. The doctors wanted to make sure that she was completely cleared before they would release her, and I was okay with that.</p><p>Lillian was able to come home with Melissa, exactly a month after she was born. She\u2019s such a strong little girl. Taking Melissa and Lillian home was bittersweet. In one hand, it felt so good to have them home, but I think we all felt the hole from that not having Lyndsie home with us left.</p><p>It was for almost three weeks full of daily hospital visits later that we were able to take Lyndsie home. She had issues with her reflux that just kept setting us back, but finally, almost two months after she was born, we were able to bring her home and complete the Cage family.</p><p>Cohen took to his sisters instantly. He helps with everything he can. He holds the bottles while we feed them; he talks to them and sings to them. And every night he tells them everything he\u2019s going to teach them when they get older.</p><p>I love watching them interact. Knowing that he feels the need to protect his sisters makes me smile. Those poor girls are going to love when they get older and have two shadows over them. There\u2019s no way in hell that Cohen or I will let anything happen to our two princesses.</p><p>Melissa finally got her casts off both her arm and leg removed about a month ago. She\u2019s had some issues with gaining her full strength back, but she keeps at her physical therapy, determined to heal.</p><p>It hasn\u2019t been the easiest of times, but we\u2019re together, and I\u2019ll take a bumpy road over the alternative any day.</p><p>Melissa and I get ready in a comfortable silence, listening to Cohen chatter in the girls\u2019 room through their baby monitors.</p><p>\u201cCome on, my Beast. Let\u2019s go get that crazy boy out of the nursery before he wakes up the girls. Good thing they can sleep through anything.\u201d</p><p>She starts walking out of the room, only limping slightly, and my mouth waters when I see the yoga pants she\u2019s put on hugging her perfect ass.</p><p>Ever since we got the go-ahead from the doctors, we\u2019ve been almost insatiable. Doesn\u2019t take a doctor to tell me that I\u2019m channeling my fear from almost losing her into sex. Melissa isn\u2019t complaining. If my diving into her sweet body daily gives my mind peace, she\u2019s more than happy to help out there.</p><p>I have to give myself a few minutes to calm down before I can follow her out of the room. Just one glance at her tight body and I\u2019m ready to lock the door and throw her back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cohen. Let the girls sleep some more.\u201d I smile when her voice comes over the monitor, before I finally walk out of our bedroom and down into the kitchen to start breakfast.</p><p>They follow not long after I started cooking, and even though Cohen starts to fuss over Lucky Charms, he eats the eggs, bacon, and pancakes quickly before asking for seconds.</p><p>\u201cDaddy! Did you see? I looked out my window this morning and there\u2019s a gigantic trampoween out there! Santa brought it. I knew he would! Can I have a motorcycle when I get older? Maddox Locke has one!\u201d</p><p>Jesus, it\u2019s hard to follow his train of thought sometimes.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about that when you\u2019re old enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Can I get wiener rings yet?\u201d</p><p>Melissa sputters out a snort-like laugh. Of course she would leave the answering to me.</p> <p>\u201cCohen, we talked about this the last time you asked for...wiener rings. Let\u2019s wait until you\u2019re older\u2014way older\u2014before we talk about that one, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Can I have a monkey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we stick to the trampoline before we start bringing in zoo animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Can we wake up my girls now so we can open up our presents?\u201d He\u2019s literally bouncing in his seat.</p><p>\u201cHow about this? The girls are so small that they aren\u2019t going to miss anything if you start, and they can join us when they wake up. How about we go open some of your presents or at least go see what Santa brought before we go wake them up?\u201d</p><p>His brow crinkles and he tilts his head to the side before speaking. \u201cWhy would I do that? My girls need to be with me. I can wait.\u201d</p><p>How did I get so lucky?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one awesome big brother, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d</p><p>We finish up our breakfast. Cohen helps Melissa clean up the dishes, and I go check on the girls. I am just about to step through the threshold of their room when I hear my phone ringing from the office down the hall.</p><p>Knowing it\u2019s either work related or one of the guys, I groan and head off to my office.</p><p>\u201cCage,\u201d I bark in the phone.</p><p>\u201cMy, aren\u2019t we happy this morning,\u201d Axel laughs in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou try having two newborns and a kid who thinks waking up before the roosters is a brilliant idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got one of those kids. Nate was up at five this morning. He isn\u2019t even old enough to know what the hell is going on, but I swear that kid ran right into the living room and started tearing shit open.\u201d</p><p>We laugh and continue talking for a few minutes before he gets silent.</p><p>\u201cSo...Izzy gave me my gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d He trails off, and I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m supposed to say here. Obviously he\u2019s calling because he wants to tell me what she got him, but I\u2019m not sure what it could be that warrants a call at seven in the morning.</p><p>\u201cI reckon next year I\u2019ll get a taste of the early rising kid while trying to keep a baby asleep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s early, but it\u2019s not early enough that I don\u2019t catch his meaning.</p><p>\u201cNo shit? Congratulations, brother! Another little Reid, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest feeling in the world, Greg. Once Izzy held those little angels of yours in her arms, she dragged my ass home and told me she wanted another baby immediately. So I guess in some weird way I should say thanks for turning my wife into a baby-craving sex maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHA! Well, I\u2019m happy I could help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Feels good, you know? Having our kids so close together. Going to make for one hell of an interesting future, seeing these kids grow up together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you keep reminding Nate to stay away from my girls, we should all just be fine.\u201d</p><p>We joke back and forth before hanging up. I take off back down the hall and into the girls\u2019 bedroom. Looking over the crib they\u2019re still sharing. I see identically beautiful faces staring up at me. It causes my heart to skip a beat and a smile to pull at my lips.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lovely little ladies! I just talked to your Uncle Axel, but don\u2019t you worry. I reminded him that you aren\u2019t ever going to be dating so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s talking to Nate right now about that.\u201d</p><p>They keep looking up at me, and I smile, rubbing their heads before going about our routine. It takes me longer than Melissa, mostly because I don\u2019t have that magic touch it seems only mothers possess. I keep reminding them that they aren\u2019t ever going to date and they\u2019re going to stay daddy\u2019s little girls for the rest of their lives.</p><p>It isn\u2019t until later that night that I think about Axel and Izzy\u2019s new little baby coming, and I smile when I wonder about the chances that they would have a girl. Knowing Axel and his extreme protectiveness over Izzy, it\u2019s going to be funny as hell to watch him with a daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for bed?\u201d Melissa drops down next to me and reaches over to turn off the news.</p><p>\u201cBeauty, if you\u2019re coming with me, then hell yeah. Way I see it, I\u2019ve got about two hours before someone is waking up for more food. That\u2019s a lot of time to spend between these legs.\u201d</p><p>She smacks my arm but doesn\u2019t waste a second, jumping up and rushing to our bedroom.</p><p>I don\u2019t get two hours that night. Nope, my girls decide to sleep a little longer. I spend the next four hours worshiping my wife and remembering each and every time just how lucky I am to have this life.</p><p>15 Years Later \u2013 Cohen</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving tomorrow. At least Lyn and Lila are driving now, so it won\u2019t be so bad not having you around to take us places.\u201d Danielle looks over at me from the other side of the couch, giggling softly and knowing damn well she\u2019s going to miss more than my driving them around.</p><p>I throw the game controller down next to me and look over at her. God, she really is beautiful. I should feel guilty feeling these thoughts about her. She\u2019s my little sisters\u2019 best friend, practically family. Hell, her brother IS my best friend. It\u2019s a line I shouldn\u2019t cross. God, that makes me feel like such a sicko. I feel like all I do lately is remind myself I shouldn\u2019t be lusting after her. She\u2019s just about to turn fifteen and I\u2019m leaving to start my freshman year at the University of Georgia.</p><p>But I can deny it all I want. There\u2019s a connection I\u2019ve always felt between us\u2014wanted or not.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing normal about what I feel for Danielle Reid.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s all I am to you? Huh, Dani? Just a ride from point A to point B?\u201d</p><p>She blushes, and I swear I feel it all the way to my dick. I should be ashamed for feeling this way about it. For craving this girl as much as I do. I should be out running around town and sinking inside of all the chicks who want to send me off to school in style.</p><p>Hell, I\u2019m no damn saint, which really makes me feel like I\u2019m never going to be good enough for Dani.</p><p>Plus, her father would kill me.</p> <p>Not just kill me. He would kill me and my family would never find the body.</p><p>Yeah, Axel Reid is a man who I\u2019ve always known would tear apart anyone who tried to touch his daughter.</p><p>\u201cNo, Co... You\u2019re more than that. A lot more than that.\u201d She blushes again and looks away quickly.</p><p>Uh, say what?</p><p>\u201cDani? I\u2019m no good at reading between the lines. I might have two little sisters, but unfortunately they never taught me much about how y\u2019all\u2019s minds work.\u201d</p><p>She looks over at me, her green eyes bright with emotion, and clears her throat a few times, pushing her long raven hair behind her ears before talking. I can see the nervousness rolling off of her tiny body.</p><p>\u201cCan I be honest with you, Cohen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh course, Dani. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen when she hears my sisters start yelling from upstairs. It won\u2019t be long before they fly down the basement stairs to where we\u2019re sitting like two twin tornados of sass.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want those two overhearing you, now would be a good time, Dani.\u201d</p><p>She blushes more. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Cohen. I know you don\u2019t look at me like I look at you, but one day, you\u2019re going to come back and I\u2019ll still be waiting for you. Waiting for you to see me like I see you. Mark my words, Cohen Cage. One of these days, you\u2019re going to be mine. And until you\u2019re ready...I\u2019ll be here. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>Before I can even get a breath in my lungs to respond, Frick and Frack come running into the room, talking about who knows what. I just sit there frozen, my jaw slack and my eyes on Dani. Before I know it, they\u2019re pulling Dani off the couch and running out the back of the house.</p><p>What the hell just happened?</p>  </body></html>"]
