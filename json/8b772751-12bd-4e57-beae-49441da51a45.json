THERE WERE SEVEN bridesmaids, seven groomsmen, three ushers, two altar boys, three lectors, and enough firepower inside the church to wipe out half the congregation. All but two of the groomsmen were armed.</p><p>The federal agents weren\u2019t happy about the crowd, but they knew it would be pointless to complain. The father of the groom, Judge Buchanan, wasn\u2019t about to miss such an auspicious occasion, no matter how many death threats he received. The judge was in the midst of hearing a racketeering case back in Boston, and the federal agents assigned to protect him would continue their detail until the trial was over and a decision had been rendered.</p><p>The church was packed to capacity. The Buchanans were such a large family that some of the groom\u2019s relatives and friends spilled over to the bride\u2019s side. Most had traveled to the little town of Silver Springs, South Carolina, from Boston, but there were several Buchanan cousins who had come all the way from Inverness, Scotland, to celebrate the marriage of Dylan Buchanan and Kate MacKenna.</p> <p>The bride and groom were deliriously happy, and their wedding was a joyous occasion, but it never would have happened if it weren\u2019t for Dylan\u2019s sister, Jordan. Kate and Jordan were best friends and had been roommates in college. The first time Jordan took Kate to her family\u2019s home on Nathan\u2019s Bay, all the siblings had gathered to celebrate their father\u2019s birthday. Jordan certainly had no intention of matchmaking, and she definitely wasn\u2019t aware at the time that there had been a spark between Kate and her brother Dylan, so years later when the spark ignited into a flame and the two became engaged, no one was more surprised\u2014or thrilled\u2014than she.</p><p>Every last detail of the happy event had been meticulously planned. Like Kate, Jordan was a great organizer, and so she was given the responsibility of dressing up the church for the occasion. Admittedly, Jordan had gotten a little carried away. She\u2019d put flowers everywhere, both inside and outside the church. Raspberry pink roses and creamy white magnolias lined the stone walkway, their lovely scent greeting guests as they arrived. Pink and white roses delicately intertwined with baby\u2019s breath in large wreaths with wide, lace-trimmed satin ribbons hung down on each side of the old weathered double doors. Jordan had actually considered giving the doors a fresh coat of paint but at the last minute had come to her senses and left them alone.</p><p>Kate had also asked Jordan to take care of the music, and Jordan had gone a little overboard on that assignment too. She\u2019d started out with the notion of hiring a pianist and a singer for the ceremony and ended up with an orchestra. There were violins, a piano, a flute, and two trumpets. Seated in the balcony, the musicians played Mozart to entertain the gathering celebrants. When the groomsmen lined up in front of the altar, the music was to stop; the trumpets would then sound, the crowd would rise to their feet, and the pomp and splendor would begin.</p><p>The bride and bridesmaids waited in a dressing room just off the vestibule. The time had come. The trumpets should now be playing to begin the ceremony, but they were silent. Kate sent Jordan to find out what the delay was.</p><p>Mozart\u2019s lovely notes covered the noise of the door squeaking as Jordan peeked inside the church. She spotted one of the federal agents standing in an alcove on the left side of the church and tried not to think about the reason he was there. The bodyguards weren\u2019t really necessary, she thought, considering all the law enforcement professionals in her family. Of her six brothers, two were FBI agents, one was a federal attorney, one was a Navy SEAL in training, one was a cop, and the youngest, Zachary, was in college and hadn\u2019t yet decided which side of the law looked more appealing to him. Also standing at the altar would be Noah Clayborne, a close friend of the family and yet another FBI agent.</p> <p>The agents assigned to her father didn\u2019t care how many others there were. Their job was clearly defined, and they wouldn\u2019t be distracted by the celebration. Jordan finally decided that they were a comfort, not a hindrance, and she should focus on the wedding and stop worrying.</p><p>She spotted one of her brothers slowly making his way toward the back of the church. It was Alec, Dylan\u2019s best man. She smiled as she watched him approach. Alec had gone all out for the wedding. He worked undercover, but he\u2019d cut his hair for the occasion, an impressive consideration on his part to be sure. His job usually required that he dress and look like a deranged serial killer. Jordan had barely recognized him when he arrived at the rehearsal the night before. Now Alec stopped to speak to one of the bodyguards. She waved to get his attention and motioned for him to step out to the vestibule.</p><p>As the door closed behind him, she asked in a whisper, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we starting? It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan sent me back to tell Kate that we\u2019ll start in a couple of minutes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Alec\u2019s collar was partially inverted, and she reached up to fix it. \u201cYour collar\u2019s folded over,\u201d she said before he could ask. \u201cQuit squirming.\u201d</p><p>When she had finished with the collar and straightened his tie, she stepped back. Alec cleaned up nice, she thought. The funny thing was, Regan, his wife, loved him however he looked. Love did weird things to people, Jordan decided.</p> <p>\u201cIs Kate worried that Dylan will take off?\u201d Alec asked with a glint in his eye that told her he was joking. They were only a couple of minutes late now.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Jordan answered. \u201cShe left five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot funny,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. You still haven\u2019t explained why we\u2019re waiting. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying. Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d He was about to go back inside but suddenly stopped. \u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look nice.\u201d</p><p>It would have been a lovely compliment from a brother who never gave compliments if Alec himself hadn\u2019t looked so surprised by his observation.</p> <p>She was about to return the favor when the outer church doors flew open, and Noah Clayborne came rushing inside tying his tie.</p><p>The man never failed to make a strong impression. Women loved him, and Jordan had to admit she could understand his appeal. Tall, athletic, outgoing, handsome\u2014he was a man\u2019s man and a woman\u2019s fantasy. His sandy blond hair was always slightly in need of a trim, and his piercing blue eyes sparkled with mischief whenever he gave one of his devilish grins.</p><p>\u201cAm I late?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s good,\u201d Alec said. \u201cOkay, Jordan, we can start now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked Noah, exasperated.</p><p>Rather than answering, he gave her a quick once-over, smiled, and followed Alec inside. Jordan felt like throwing her hands up. He\u2019d been with a woman, she decided. The man was incorrigible.</p><p>She should have been peeved, but instead she laughed. To be that free, that uninhibited...Jordan couldn\u2019t imagine what that would feel like. But Noah certainly knew the feeling.</p><p>Jordan hurried back to the waiting room, pushed the door open, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Kate motioned for Jordan to come to her. \u201cWhat was the hold-up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNoah. He just got here. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say he was with a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a guess,\u201d Kate whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s a given. I had no idea what a playboy he was until I saw it for myself. He disappeared from the rehearsal dinner last night with three of my bridesmaids, and all three looked like they hadn\u2019t slept when they got to the church this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jordan crossed her arms as she looked around the room, trying to decide which of the bridesmaids had disappeared with Noah. \u201cShame on him,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t all his fault,\u201d Kate replied. \u201cThey went willingly.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s aunt Nora announced that they weren\u2019t going anywhere until they heard the trumpets, and then she began to line everyone up.</p><p>Kate motioned Jordan closer. \u201cI need to ask a favor. It\u2019s kind of a tough one.\u201d</p><p>Difficult or not, it didn\u2019t matter. Kate had been there through thick and thin for Jordan, and Jordan would do anything she could to help her.</p><p>\u201cYou name it. I\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWould you please make Noah behave?\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe not anything. Jordan took a breath and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re asking the impossible. Trying to control him is laughable. It would be easier to teach a bear to use a computer. Give me that assignment, and I promise I\u2019ll give it my all. But Noah? Come on, Kate...\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s just Isabel I\u2019m concerned about. Did you see the way she glued herself to his side at the rehearsal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you paired me with him in the wedding? To keep your little sister away from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after seeing Isabel in action last night, I\u2019m glad I did. I can\u2019t blame her. Noah\u2019s adorable. Aside from Dylan, of course, I think he\u2019s one of the sexiest men I\u2019ve ever met. He oozes charisma, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Isabel to become another NCG,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want any more of my wedding party to disappear suddenly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is an NCG?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kate grinned. \u201cA Noah Clayborne Groupie.\u201d</p><p>Jordan burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know who seems to be immune to his charms. He treats you like a sister.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Nora clapped her hands. \u201cOkay, everyone. It\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>Kate grabbed Jordan\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m not budging until you promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>The trumpets sounded again. Since Jordan was to be the first to walk down the aisle, she was nervous and clutched her bouquet to her waist with both hands. She\u2019d always been known as the family klutz, but she was determined not to trip over her own feet today. She would pay attention and concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other.</p><p>She waited in the center of the doorway until she heard Aunt Nora whisper, \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and started walking. The aisle seemed a mile long. Standing in front of the altar, Noah waited. When she was halfway there, he came toward her, looking amazing in his tuxedo. She relaxed. No one was paying her any attention. Every eye\u2014at least every female eye\u2014was on Noah.</p><p>She concentrated on his smile and took hold of his arm. For a brief second she looked into his eyes and saw the mischievous glimmer.</p><p>Oh, Lord, she had her work cut out for her.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>THE CEREMONY WAS BEAUTIFUL. TEARS ROLLED DOWN JORDAN\u2019S cheeks when her brother and her best friend exchanged vows. She thought no one had noticed her red eyes, but when she took hold of Noah\u2019s arm while walking out of the church, he leaned down to her and whispered, \u201cCrybaby.\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d noticed. He never missed anything.</p><p>After additional photos were taken, the attendants were separated, and Jordan ended up riding to the reception with the bride and groom. She could have been riding on the hood of the car, for all they noticed. They only had eyes for each other.</p><p>Kate and Dylan had entered the country club ahead of everyone else, and Jordan stood outside on the steps waiting for the rest of the wedding party to come up the circle drive to join her.</p><p>It was a beautiful evening, but there was a slight chill in the air, which was unusual for this time of year in South Carolina. The ballroom\u2019s French doors were opened to the side terrace. Tables had already been prepared with long white linen tablecloths topped with candles and centerpieces of roses and hydrangeas. Jordan knew the reception was going to be fabulous, the food exceptional\u2014she\u2019d gotten to taste some of Kate\u2019s selections\u2014and the band superb. Jordan didn\u2019t plan on doing much dancing, though. It had been a long day, and she was running out of steam. A cool breeze swept across the veranda and made her shiver. She rubbed her bare arms to ward off the chill. She loved the pale pink strapless gown she was wearing, but it definitely wasn\u2019t designed to keep a body warm.</p><p>The cold wasn\u2019t the only thing bothering her. Her contact lenses were driving her crazy. Fortunately, she\u2019d tucked her glasses into Noah\u2019s tuxedo jacket along with her lens case and lipstick. Too bad she hadn\u2019t thought to shove a cardigan in there.</p><p>She heard laughter and turned just in time to see Kate\u2019s younger sister, Isabel, take hold of Noah\u2019s arm and lean into his side. Oh, brother, here we go.</p><p>Isabel was a blond, blue-eyed beauty, but then so was Noah. Isabel\u2019s coloring was quite similar to his, and though he towered over her, they could have been related. Now that\u2019s a creepy thought, Jordan decided, since Isabel was blatantly flirting with him. She was such an innocent. Noah wasn\u2019t. Kate\u2019s sister was a very young nineteen, and from the way she was staring up at Noah with such adoration in her eyes, it was apparent she was already under his spell. To his credit, Noah wasn\u2019t encouraging her. In fact, he wasn\u2019t paying much attention to her at all. Instead, he was intently listening to Zachary, the youngest Buchanan.</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>Jordan hadn\u2019t heard anyone approaching and flinched in reaction. Her brother Michael poked her in her side and was now standing beside her grinning like an idiot. When he was a child, he loved to sneak up on her and their sister, Sidney, and scare the be-jesus out of them. He had lived for a good scream back then. She thought he\u2019d outgrown the horrid behavior, but apparently he sometimes regressed when he was around her. Come to think of it, all of her older brothers regressed when they were around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>\u201cWaiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much is obvious. Who or what are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other bridesmaids, but mostly Isabel. I\u2019m supposed to keep her away from Noah.\u201d</p><p>Michael turned and took in the scene at the bottom of the steps. Isabel was practically glued to Noah. He grinned. \u201cHow\u2019s that working out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far so good.\u201d</p><p>He laughed while watching Isabel. She\u2019d finally managed to get Noah\u2019s full attention. Her face was flushed.</p><p>\u201cWhat we have here is a three-way,\u201d Michael surmised.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at them,\u201d he said. \u201cIsabel\u2019s all starry-eyed over Noah; Zachary\u2019s all starry-eyed over Isabel; and from the scary look on that woman over there watching Noah like a cougar waiting for dinner, I\u2019d have to say she\u2019s a mite more than starry-eyed.\u201d Michael shrugged as he added, \u201cActually it\u2019s a four-way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is not a three-way, a four-way, or a ten-way,\u201d Jordan argued.</p><p>\u201cI believe ten-ways would be called orgies. Ever heard of those?\u201d</p><p>She was not about to let him bait her. Zachary had her full attention now. He was doing his best to get Isabel to notice him. Jordan wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if he\u2019d started doing backflips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just sad,\u201d Jordan said, shaking her head.</p> <p>\u201cZack?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t blame him,\u201d Michael said. \u201cIsabel\u2019s got the whole package. The body, the face...without a doubt, she is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen, Michael. She\u2019s nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. She\u2019s too young for Noah and me, and she thinks she\u2019s too old for Zachary.\u201d</p> <p>A car carrying their parents pulled up to the entrance to the club. Jordan noticed that a bodyguard made sure he was directly behind the judge as they made their way toward the stairs. Another bodyguard rushed up the stairs ahead of him.</p><p>Michael nudged Jordan and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be worrying about the bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little. The thing is, the trial\u2019s gone on for so long now, I\u2019ve gotten used to our father with his shadows. It will all be over in a couple of weeks after the sentencing.\u201d He nudged her again. \u201cPut all that out of your mind tonight, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay,\u201d she promised, even as she wondered how she was going to do it.</p><p>\u201cYou should start celebrating,\u201d he said when she continued to look worried. \u201cYou\u2019re footloose and fancy-free now that you\u2019ve sold your company and made all us stockholders rich. You can do anything in the world you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t know what I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out in time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably stay in computers, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t know what she would do. She supposed she would be wasting her degrees if she didn\u2019t continue working with computers in some capacity. She was one of a very few women to excel in computer innovation. She had started out with a large corporation, but she\u2019d ended up forming her own company, and with her family\u2019s investment, she\u2019d turned it into a huge success. She had spent the last several years working nonstop. However, when another company offered to buy her out at a phenomenal price, she didn\u2019t hesitate to sell. She was restless and ready for a change.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do some consulting work,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve had a lot of offers,\u201d Michael said, \u201cbut take some time, Jordan, before you jump into something else. Kick back and relax. Have some fun.\u201d</p><p>Tonight was about Dylan and Kate, she reminded herself. She could worry about her future tomorrow.</p><p>Noah was taking forever to walk up the stairs. He kept getting waylaid by family and friends.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go inside?\u201d Michael urged. \u201cAnd stop worrying about Noah. He knows how young Isabel is. He\u2019s not going to do anything inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Michael was right about Noah, but Jordan couldn\u2019t say the same for Isabel.</p><p>\u201cGo and get her, will you? Bring her inside.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to ask twice. Her brother was halfway across the veranda before the doorman had opened the door for her.</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t have to be a watchdog after all. Noah was a perfect gentleman, just as Michael had predicted he would be. However, there were several rather persistent young women who couldn\u2019t keep their hands off him, and he certainly didn\u2019t seem to mind the attention. Since they were all over the age of twenty-one, Jordan figured they knew what they were doing.</p><p>Noah\u2019s virtuous behavior freed her from her responsibilities, and she actually began to enjoy herself. By nine o\u2019clock she had had it with her contacts though. She found Noah, who still had her glasses and her lens case in his jacket pocket. He was on the dance floor with a platinum blonde swaying to the slow music. Jordan interrupted long enough to get her lens case and then headed for the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>There was a commotion in the foyer. The strangest-looking man was arguing with the country club\u2019s security detail. They in turn were strongly urging him to leave, but he was having none of it. One of the federal agents had already patted him down to make certain he wasn\u2019t carrying a weapon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unheard of to treat a guest the way I\u2019m being treated,\u201d he blustered. \u201cI\u2019m telling you Miss Isabel MacKenna will be happy to see me. I\u2019ve misplaced my invitation, that\u2019s all, but I assure you I was invited.\u201d</p><p>He spotted Jordan walking toward him and gave her a bright smile. One of his front teeth crossed over the other and protruded just enough to make his upper lip catch whenever he spoke.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether she should interfere. He was acting so peculiar. He kept snapping his fingers and bobbing his head as though he were agreeing with someone, but no one was talking to him now. His clothing was bizarre too. Though it was the shank of the summer, the stranger wore a heavy wool tweed blazer with leather elbow patches. Needless to say, he was sweating profusely. His unruly beard was soaked through. There were streaks of gray in his beard, but she honestly couldn\u2019t judge how old he was. He was clutching an old leather folder to his chest, and there were papers sticking out every which way.</p><p>\u201cMay I be of assistance?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you with the MacKenna wedding party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened as he tucked the thick folder under his arm and dug into his plaid wool vest pocket. He pulled out a wrinkled and stained card and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Professor Horace Athens MacKenna,\u201d he proudly announced. He waited until she had read his name on the card and then snatched it away from her and tucked it back in his vest pocket. He patted the pocket several times as he continued to smile at her.</p><p>The security detail had backed away but were warily watching him. No wonder\u2014Professor MacKenna was a bit odd.</p><p>\u201cI cannot tell you how thrilled I am to be here.\u201d He extended his hand and added, \u201cThis is a momentous occasion. A MacKenna marrying a Buchanan. It\u2019s stunning. Yes, stunning.\u201d He chuckled as he added, \u201cI imagine our MacKenna ancestors are twisting and turning in their graves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a MacKenna,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Jordan Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t rip his hand away from hers, but he came close. His smile disappeared, and he seemed to recoil. \u201cBuchanan? You\u2019re a Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cAll right then. It is a wedding of a MacKenna to a Buchanan. Of course I would be meeting Buchanans. Stands to reason, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She was having trouble following. Professor MacKenna\u2019s accent was thick and most unusual, a combination of a Scottish brogue and a southern drawl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did you say the MacKenna ancestors would be turning in their graves?\u201d she asked, certain she\u2019d misunderstood.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I said, dearie.\u201d</p><p>Dearie? He was getting stranger by the second.</p><p>\u201cI imagine the Buchanans would be doing a fair amount of tossing in their unholy graves too,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feud, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feud? I don\u2019t understand. What feud?\u201d</p><p>He whipped out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his brow. \u201cI\u2019m getting ahead of myself. You must think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that was exactly what she was thinking.</p><p>Fortunately, he didn\u2019t require a response to his statement. \u201cI\u2019m parched,\u201d he announced. He tilted his head toward the ballroom she had just exited. \u201cI could use some refreshment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Please, come with me.\u201d</p><p>He latched on to her arm and glanced suspiciously over his shoulder as they walked. \u201cI\u2019m a history professor at Franklin College in Texas. Have you heard of Franklin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fine school. It\u2019s located just outside Austin. I teach medieval history, or at least I did until I came into some unexpected money and decided to take some time off. A sabbatical of sorts. You see,\u201d he continued, \u201cabout fifteen years ago I began researching my family history. It\u2019s been a most invigorating hobby for me. Did you know that there\u2019s bad blood between us?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cBad blood between the Buchanans and the MacKennas, I mean to say. This wedding should never have taken place if history tells us anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of a feud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, dearie.\u201d</p><p>Okay, it was official, she decided. The man was wacko. She was suddenly thankful the agent had checked him for hidden weapons, and she was uneasy about taking him into the ballroom, especially if he was intent on making a scene. On the other hand, he did seem harmless, and he did know Isabel...at least he said he did.</p><p>\u201cAbout Isabel,\u201d she began, determined to find out how the professor knew Kate\u2019s sister.</p><p>He was too caught up in his story to listen.</p><p>\u201cThe feud has been going on for centuries, and every time I think I\u2019ve gotten to the root of it, lo and behold, I find another contradiction.\u201d He vigorously nodded several times and then darted another quick glance behind him as if fearful that someone would sneak up on him. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve tracked the feud all the way back to the thirteenth century,\u201d he boasted.</p><p>As soon as he paused to take a breath, Jordan suggested they find Isabel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be thrilled to see you,\u201d she said. Or appalled, she thought silently.</p><p>They continued along the corridor and entered the ballroom just as a waiter was passing by with a silver tray of champagne flutes. The professor took a glass, gulped the drink down, and hurriedly reached for another.</p><p>\u201cMy, that\u2019s refreshing. Is there food?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Come, we\u2019ll find you a seat at one of the tables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t budge. \u201cAbout Miss MacKenna...\u201d His gaze circled the ballroom as he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t actually met the woman. In fact, you\u2019ll have to point her out to me. I\u2019ve been corresponding with her for some time now, but I have no idea what she looks like. I know that she\u2019s young and that she\u2019s in college,\u201d he added. He gave Jordan a sly look and said, \u201cI imagine you\u2019re wondering how I found her in the first place, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, he shifted the fat folder from one arm to the other and motioned to a waiter to bring him another drink.</p><p>\u201cI make it a habit to read every newspaper I can get my hands on. I like to keep current,\u201d he explained. \u201cOf course, I read the major papers on the Internet. I read everything from political events to obituaries, and I do retain most of what I read,\u201d he boasted. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I never forget anything. It\u2019s how my brain works. I\u2019ve also been tracing my family history, and tied to my history is the ownership of Glen MacKenna. I found out through court records that Miss MacKenna will inherit the magnificent land in just a few years.\u201d</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Isabel\u2019s great-uncle left her a sizable peace of land in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just any land, dearie, Glen MacKenna,\u201d he scolded. He sounded like a professor now, lecturing one of his students. \u201cThe land is tied to the feud, and the feud is tied to the land. The Buchanans and the MacKennas have been at war for centuries. I don\u2019t know what the exact origin of the dispute was, but it has something to do with a treasure that was stolen from the glen by the vile Buchanans, and I\u2019m determined to find out what it was and when it was taken.\u201d</p><p>Jordan ignored the insult to her ancestors as she pulled out a chair for the professor at the nearest table. He dropped his folder down, and said, \u201cMiss MacKenna has shown quite an interest in my research, so much so that I\u2019ve invited her to come and see me. I couldn\u2019t possibly bring everything with me, you see. I\u2019ve been doing this research for years.\u201d</p><p>He looked expectantly at her. She assumed he wanted some sort of response, and so she nodded and asked, \u201cWhere do you live, Professor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of nowhere.\u201d He grinned after making the statement and explained. \u201cBecause of my financial situation...my inheritance,\u201d he corrected, \u201cI\u2019ve been able to move to a peaceful little town called Serenity deep in Texas. I spend my days reading and researching,\u201d he added. \u201cI enjoy the solitude, and the town is really an oasis. It would be a charming spot to retire to, but I will probably go back to where I was born, Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019re going home to Scotland?\u201d Jordan scanned the room for Isabel.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I want to visit all the places I\u2019ve read about. I don\u2019t remember them.\u201d He pointed to the folder. \u201cI\u2019ve written down some of our history for Miss MacKenna to read. Most of the heartache the MacKenna clan has had to endure has been the fault of the Buchanan clan,\u201d he said, wagging his finger in her face. \u201cYou might want to have a peek at my research too, but I\u2019ll warn you, chasing these legends and trying to get to the bottom of things can become an obsession. On the other hand, it is also a delightful distraction from the humdrum of everyday life. Why, it could even become a passion.\u201d</p><p>Passion indeed. As a mathematician and a computer engineer, Jordan dealt with facts and abstracts, not fantasy. She could design any business plan and the computer software to go with it. She loved solving puzzles. She couldn\u2019t think of anything that was more of a waste of time than chasing down legends, but she wasn\u2019t about to get into a lengthy discussion with the professor. She was going to find Isabel as quickly as possible. After settling Professor MacKenna at a table with a plate of food in front of him, she started her search.</p><p>Isabel was outside and just about to sit down when Jordan grabbed her.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she said. \u201cYour friend Professor MacKenna has arrived. You get to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here? He came here?\u201d Isabel looked astonished.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Then she changed her mind. \u201cWait. I might have invited him, but not formally. I mean he wasn\u2019t on the list. We\u2019ve been communicating with each other, and I mentioned where the wedding and reception were being held because he wrote that he was touring the Carolinas and would be in this area around this time. He actually showed up? What\u2019s he like?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordan smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s difficult to describe. You\u2019ll just have to see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Isabel followed Jordan inside. \u201cDid he tell you about the treasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the feud? Did he tell you about the Buchanans and the MacKennas fighting all the time? The feud\u2019s been going on for centuries. Since I\u2019m inheriting Glen MacKenna, I want to know as much as possible about the history.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound enthusiastic,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019ve already decided I\u2019m going to be a history major, and I\u2019ll minor in music. Did the professor bring any of his research with him? He wrote that he had boxes and boxes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a folder with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the boxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d</p> <p>The professor showed better manners with Isabel. He stood and shook her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to meet the new owner of Glen MacKenna. When I get to Scotland I will be certain to tell my clansmen that I\u2019ve met you, and that you\u2019re as bonny a lass as I thought you would be.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Jordan then and said, \u201cI\u2019ll also be telling them about you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what he said but how he said it that pricked her curiosity.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Buchanans,\u201d he corrected. \u201cYou do know that Kate MacKenna married beneath her.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d raised her ire with that remark. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy, the Buchanans are savages. That\u2019s why.\u201d He pointed to the folder and said, \u201cIn here is just a sample of some of the atrocities against the peace-loving MacKennas. You should read it and then you\u2019ll understand how fortunate your relative is to be married to a MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor, are you intentionally insulting Jordan?\u201d Isabel asked, shocked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Buchanan,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m simply stating the facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how accurate is your research?\u201d Jordan folded her arms across her chest and frowned at the rude man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a historian,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI deal in facts. I\u2019ll grant you that some of the stories could be...legends...but there\u2019s quite a bit of research to make the stories credible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a historian you believe you have proof that the MacKennas are all saints and the Buchanans are all sinners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds slanted, but the proof is indisputable. Read it,\u201d he challenged once again, \u201cand you can only come to one conclusion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat the Buchanans are savages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cThey\u2019re thieves as well,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve chipped away at the MacKenna land until Glen MacKenna is barely half the size it used to be. And of course they stole the treasure too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe treasure that started the feud,\u201d Jordan said, letting her irritation show.</p><p>He gave her a sly grin and then dismissed her as he turned to Isabel. \u201cI couldn\u2019t travel with all the boxes, and I\u2019ll have to put them in storage when I leave for Scotland. If you want to look through them, you\u2019d best come to Texas within the next two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving in two weeks? But I start school, and I...\u201d She stopped, took a breath, and blurted, \u201cI can miss the first week.\u201d</p><p>Jordan stopped her. \u201cIsabel, you can\u2019t miss an entire week. You\u2019ll need to get your class schedule and your books...you can\u2019t go running off to Texas. Why can\u2019t the professor e-mail the research files to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of my research is handwritten, and I\u2019ve only put a few dates and names on my computer. I could send those, and I will as soon as I get back home, but without my papers, none of it will make sense to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about mailing the boxes?\u201d Jordan suggested.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I could never do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe expense...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pay for shipping,\u201d Jordan offered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust the mail. Those boxes could get lost, and that\u2019s years of research. No, no, I won\u2019t risk it. You\u2019ll have to come to Texas, Isabel. Perhaps when I come back...although...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Isabel asked, thinking he had come up with a solution.</p><p>\u201cI might decide to stay in Scotland, depending on my finances, and if I do, my research materials will stay in storage until I\u2019m ready to return for them. If you wish to read what I\u2019ve accumulated, it\u2019s now or never,\u201d he asserted.</p><p>\u201cCould you have someone photocopy the files?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no one to do it for me, and I simply don\u2019t have the time. I\u2019m getting ready for my trip. You\u2019ll have to make the copies yourself when you come.\u201d</p><p>Isabel let out a huge sigh of frustration, and Jordan, seeing how important this was to her, felt sympathy for her dilemma. As irritated as she was that the professor had created a biased record against her ancestors, she was sorry that Isabel wouldn\u2019t get to learn more about the history of her land.</p><p>\u201cI might decide to do a little research on my own,\u201d Jordan said as she stood to leave Isabel and the professor to finish their discussion.</p><p>The obnoxious man had gotten under her skin, and she was determined to dig up a few facts to prove him wrong. The Buchanans were all savages? What kind of a history professor would make such a blanket statement? Just how credible was he? Was he really a history professor? Jordan was definitely going to check him out.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll prove the Buchanans were the saints,\u201d she asserted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly possible, dearie. My research is impeccable.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder as she walked away. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>IT WAS AFTER TEN BEFORE JORDAN FINALLY HAD A CHANCE TO remove her contacts. She walked back to the ballroom and stood near the entrance trying to spot Noah in the crowd on the dance floor. He still had her glasses in his pocket.</p><p>Professor MacKenna had left the reception an hour before, and Isabel had apologized profusely for his rude behavior. Jordan told her not to worry, that she hadn\u2019t been offended, and she left Isabel fretting about the boxes of research. Jordan thought about offering to help her out but changed her mind. Even though she was, as Michael reminded her, fancy-free these days and was curious to read some of his likely bogus research, doing so meant she would have to suffer more of the professor\u2019s company. No, thank you. Nothing was worth spending even one hour with that man.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you frowning?\u201d</p><p>Her brother Nick asked the question as he sauntered over to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not frowning. I\u2019m squinting. Noah has my glasses. Do you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s right in front of you.\u201d</p><p>She focused in, spotted him, and then did frown. \u201cLook at those silly women panting all over your partner. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d she replied. \u201cPromise me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever act like that, you\u2019ll shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe happy to,\u201d Nick promised before laughing at her.</p><p>Noah had excused himself from his fan club and walked over to join them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan wants me to shoot her.\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced down at her, and for a second or two she had his full, undivided attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he offered</p><p>There was a little too much glee in his voice to suit her. She had just decided to walk away from the two of them when she spotted Dan Robbins heading her way. At least she thought it was Dan. He was too blurry to be sure. She\u2019d had one dance with Dan earlier in the evening, and no matter what music was playing, whether it was a waltz, a tango, or hip-hop, Dan bounced to his own tune in something that resembled a spasmodic version of a polka. Jordan changed her mind and stayed put. She moved a little closer to Noah and smiled at him. The ploy seemed to work. Dan hesitated and then turned away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know why she wants me to shoot her?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI already know why,\u201d Noah said. \u201cShe\u2019s bored.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her hand into his pocket, found her glasses, and put them on.</p><p>\u201cI am not bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>He was looking over her head when he spoke to her. She suspected he did it on purpose just to irritate her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Nick said. \u201cYou have to be bored. All you had was your company, and since you sold everything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t like the same things you two do doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m bored or unhappy. I have a wonderful social life and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah cut her off. \u201cDead people have a better social life.\u201d</p><p>Nick agreed. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have much fun, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I enjoy reading and...\u201d</p><p>They were both grinning at her. They were obnoxious clowns, and she was about to tell them so when Nick said, \u201cYou do like a good book. What was it you were reading a couple of days ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. I read lots of books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Noah said, his voice gratingly cheerful. \u201cNick and Dylan and I had just gotten back from fishing, and you were sitting on the deck reading the complete works of Stephen Hawking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was riveting.\u201d</p><p>They had a good laugh over her defensive comment. \u201cStop making fun of me and go away. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Her timing could have been better. As soon as she told them to leave, she spotted Dan approaching her again. She grabbed hold of Noah\u2019s arm. She was sure he knew what she was doing and why\u2014he\u2019d have to be blind not to notice Dan strolling toward them\u2014but he didn\u2019t say anything about it.</p><p>\u201cYour sister lives in a box,\u201d said Noah.</p><p>Nick agreed. \u201cJordan, when was the last time you did anything just for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do lots of things for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me qualify that question. When did you do anything fun that didn\u2019t involve computers or computer chips or software?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to answer and then closed it. She couldn\u2019t think of anything, but surely that was only because she was under pressure.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done anything impractical?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the logic in that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Noah turned to Nick. \u201cIs she serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cBefore my sister would ever consider doing anything on the spur of the moment, she would have to first analyze all the data, then figure the statistical probabilities of success...\u201d</p><p>The two men were having a fine time tormenting her and would have continued if their employer, Dr. Peter Morganstern, hadn\u2019t joined them. He carried a plate with two pieces of wedding cake.</p><p>Morganstern had become a good friend of the family and wouldn\u2019t have missed the wedding for anything in the world. Jordan liked and admired him. He was a brilliant forensic psychiatrist who ran a highly specialized unit within the FBI. They called it the lost-and-found department. Her brother Nick and Noah were part of Morganstern\u2019s program. Among their responsibilities was finding lost and exploited children, and Jordan believed they were a substantial reason for the program\u2019s success.</p><p>\u201cYou three seem to be enjoying yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you stand working with them?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are moments when I question my sanity. Especially with this one,\u201d he said, tilting his head toward Noah.</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry you and your wife got stuck at the same table with our aunt Iris,\u201d Nick said. \u201cDid she find out you were a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIris is an obsessive hypochondriac,\u201d he explained to Noah.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds the doctor would get stuck sitting next to her?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Everyone turned toward Morganstern\u2019s table where Aunt Iris sat.</p><p>\u201cOne chance in one hundred seventy-nine thousand seven hundred,\u201d Jordan answered before she could stop herself.</p><p>The men turned back to look at her.</p><p>Astonished, the doctor asked, \u201cIs that an exact number or a guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn exact number based on six hundred guests,\u201d she said. \u201cI never guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she do this kind of stuff all the time?\u201d Noah wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Nick answered.</p><p>\u201cJust because I have a mind for math\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut with no common sense,\u201d Nick finished.</p><p>\u201cI could certainly use you on my team,\u201d Morganstern said. \u201cIf you ever consider a change in careers, come work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Noah said at the same time.</p><p>The doctor turned his head toward Jordan and gave her a conspiratorial wink. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put her in the field right away. Like you two, she would need extensive training.\u201d He looked as though he was pondering the possibility for a second or two, and then said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a good feeling about Jordan. I believe she\u2019d be an asset to the unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, isn\u2019t there a rule against two members of the same family working together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that rule,\u201d Morganstern said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make her go through the academy. I\u2019d train her myself.\u201d</p><p>Noah looked appalled. \u201cSir, it still isn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d he insisted while Nick vigorously nodded agreement.</p><p>Exasperated, Jordan turned to Noah and said, \u201cListen, Mister Buttinsky. This isn\u2019t your decision. It\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>The doctor seemed fascinated by Noah\u2019s reaction to his proposal.</p><p>\u201cWould I get to carry a gun?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA gun is out of the question,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too uncoordinated and you\u2019re blind as a bat,\u201d Noah interjected. \u201cYou\u2019d shoot yourself,\u201d he predicted.</p><p>She smiled at Morganstern. \u201cIt was lovely talking to you. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019d like to get away from these two cretins.\u201d</p><p>Noah grabbed her arm. \u201cCome on. Dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Since he was already dragging her toward the dance floor, she felt it would be pointless to argue. The bride had coaxed her sister into singing. Isabel had the most wonderful voice, and when she began to sing Kate\u2019s favorite ballad, a hush fell over the crowd. Young and old, they were all mesmerized by her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah pulled Jordan into his arms and held her tight against him. She had to admit it wasn\u2019t completely unpleasant. She did like the feel of his hard body pressed against hers. She liked his scent too. Whatever he was wearing was ruggedly sexy.</p><p>He was looking over the top of her head when he asked, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really consider working for the doctor, would you?\u201d</p><p>He actually sounded a little worried. She couldn\u2019t resist provoking him just a little. \u201cOnly if I get to work with you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he shook his head. \u201cNot gonna happen. And you can\u2019t really be serious, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider working for Doctor Morganstern. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always happy.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Oh, brother. The ego. \u201cBy the way,\u201d she said, \u201cDoctor Morganstern wasn\u2019t serious. He was teasing to get a rise out of you and Nick. It worked too. You did get riled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor never teases, and I never get riled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, even if he wasn\u2019t teasing, I still wouldn\u2019t consider working for him.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed a smile, and for a fleeting second she forgot how irritating he could be.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would be interested.\u201d</p><p>Annoyed, she asked, \u201cThen why are we having this conversation? If you knew the answer, why did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust making sure. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>They swayed to the music for a good half a minute, and she was actually feeling relaxed when he ruined it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be terrible at it, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know if I\u2019d be good or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live in a comfort zone. That\u2019s how I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bite. What\u2019s a comfort zone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where you live. You never step outside your safe environment, your comfort zone,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou stay in the shadows.\u201d Before she could object, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve never done anything in your entire life that was spontaneous, or taken any risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken plenty of risks in the past year alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Name one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI sold my company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a calculated decision and you netted a huge profit,\u201d he countered. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of running. I thought I\u2019d try for the Boston Marathon next year,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a regimen, requires discipline. Plus, you do it to stay fit,\u201d he argued.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t looking over her head now. He was staring into her eyes, and he was making her extremely uncomfortable. For the life of her, she couldn\u2019t think of a single spontaneous action or risk she\u2019d ever taken. Everything she did was well thought out and planned down to the last detail. Was her life really that boring? Was she that boring?</p><p>\u201cHaving trouble coming up with one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being careful.\u201d Great, now she sounded like a ninety-year-old.</p><p>He looked like he was about to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing wrong with being careful.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed because she had only just realized how dull she was, and guessing that he had already figured that out about her as well, she hurriedly changed the subject to get the focus off of herself. She blurted out the first thought that came into her mind.</p><p>\u201cIsabel has a great voice, doesn\u2019t she? I could listen to her all night. Did you know she\u2019s been hounded by agents wanting to make her a star? She\u2019s not interested though. She\u2019s only a freshman, but she\u2019s already decided she wants to be a history major, then get her master\u2019s and teach. Interesting, don\u2019t you think? She\u2019s giving up fame and fortune. I think that\u2019s amazing, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Noah gave her a piercing smile that went right through her, but he looked puzzled as well. No wonder. She was babbling like a toddler. She knew she should stop talking, but she couldn\u2019t seem to make herself close her mouth. Thanks to his scrutiny she had a bad, bad case of nerves.</p><p>For the love of God, Isabel, wind it up. Enough already.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you know that in a few years Isabel is going to inherit land in Scotland? It\u2019s called Glen MacKenna,\u201d she rushed on. \u201cShe invited the strangest little man to the wedding and the reception. I just met him, and he has all the information he\u2019s collected in boxes in Texas. He\u2019s a professor, you see, and he\u2019s done quite a lot of research on a feud that he says has existed for centuries between the Buchanans and the MacKennas. According to the professor, Dylan and Kate should never have gotten married. There\u2019s a legend about a treasure too. It\u2019s fascinating, really it is.\u201d</p><p>She finally had to pause to take a breath or she\u2019d pass out.</p><p>He stopped dancing for a few seconds and then asked, \u201cDo I make you nervous?\u201d</p><p>Duh.</p><p>\u201cWhen you stare at me you do. I\u2019d appreciate it if you would go back to being rude and stare over my head when you speak to me. That is why you do it, isn\u2019t it? To be rude?\u201d</p><p>His face lit up. \u201cAnd to irritate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works. You do irritate me.\u201d</p><p>Would Isabel never finish the song? She was taking forever. Jordan smiled nonchalantly at the couples gliding by as she wished for the dance to end. It would be rude to just walk away, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>Noah nudged her chin up with his index finger and looked squarely at her. \u201cMay I make a suggestion?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cSuggest away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to think about getting into the game.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhat game would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife.\u201d</p><p>Apparently he wasn\u2019t through giving her suggestions on ways to improve her dull existence.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the difference between you and me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI can think of more than a thousand differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI eat the dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly that life\u2019s too short. Sometimes you just have to eat dessert first.\u201d</p><p>She knew where this was going. \u201cI get it. I watch life while you live it. I know you think I should do something spontaneous instead of always planning everything out, but for your information, I\u2019m already doing something spontaneous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked, and the challenge was there in his voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpontaneous,\u201d she stalled.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>She knew he didn\u2019t believe her. Come hell or high water, she was determined to do something spontaneous, even if it killed her. The satisfaction of wiping that arrogant know-it-all grin off his face would be worth any sacrifice, even if it wasn\u2019t logical.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Texas,\u201d she said, enforcing her decision with a nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I going to Texas?\u201d She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea at first, but fortunately, she was a quick thinker. Before he could say another word, she answered her own question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on a treasure hunt.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>PAUL NEWTON PRUITT LOVED WOMEN. HE LOVED EVERYTHING about them: their soft, smooth skin; their feminine scent; the luxurious feel of their silky hair brushing over his chest; the erotic sounds they made when he touched them. He loved their infectious laughter, their stimulating screams of delight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t discriminate. The color of their hair or the color of their eyes or their skin\u2014he loved them all. Tall, short, thin, fat. It didn't matter. They were all wonderful, and to him, each one was so very unique.</p><p>Admittedly, he had a special fondness for the way some of them smiled at him. It was a smile he couldn't possibly describe. He only knew that one glance his way and his heart raced. The lure was that powerful. He simply couldn't resist, couldn't say no. Beguiling and enticing. That certain smile never failed to captivate him.</p><p>Before he\u2019d had to shape up and change his behavior in order to survive, he\u2019d been quite the ladies\u2019 man. And that wasn\u2019t his ego talking. It was just the way it was. He\u2019d been irresistible back then.</p><p>But things were different now.</p><p>In his old life, if he grew bored, he would say his good-bye with expensive gifts so there wouldn\u2019t be any ill feelings toward him. He could not bear to think that even one of his women would ever hate him. Only when he knew for certain that he had pleased them could he move on to the next lovely, sometimes enchanting, woman. And there was always another one.</p><p>Until Marie. He had fallen in love with her, and his life had changed forever. The life he knew was gone. Paul Newton Pruitt was gone. A new name. A new identity. A new life. No one would ever find him.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>SHE HAD TO BE OUT OF HER EVER-LOVING MIND. A TREASURE hunt? What had she been thinking? Apparently she\u2019d been more interested in proving to Noah Clayborne that she wasn\u2019t a complete bore than in using common sense.</p><p>Jordan knew she had no one to blame but herself for her present circumstances, but she still wanted to blame Noah, simply because doing so made her feel better.</p><p>She leaned against her dilapidated rental car on the side of the beat-up, two-lane highway in the middle of nowhere, Texas, while impatiently waiting for the engine to cool down so she could pour more water into the coolant reservoir. Thank goodness she\u2019d stopped awhile back on the interstate to pick up a couple of bottles of drinking water for the rest of her trip. She was fairly certain the radiator had a leak, but she\u2019d need to keep the engine running long enough to get to the next town to have a mechanic look at it. It was at least a hundred-ten in the shade, and of course the car\u2019s air conditioner had bit the dust about an hour ago, along with the super-duper satellite system the rental agency had thrown in as a consolation prize for messing up her reservation and knowingly dumping a lemon on her.</p><p>Sweat trickled down between her breasts; the bottoms of her sandals were melting into the pavement, and the sunscreen she\u2019d lathered on her face and arms was giving up the fight. Jordan had dark auburn hair but a redhead\u2019s complexion, and it didn\u2019t take much sun for her to burn and freckle. She supposed she had a choice. She could either sit in the car and die of dehydration while she waited for the engine to cool down, or she could stay outside and be slowly cremated.</p><p>Okay. She was being a little overdramatic. That\u2019s what the heat will do to you, she thought.</p><p>Fortunately, she had her cell phone with her. She never left home without it. Unfortunately, since she was temporarily stranded in the middle of the vast flatland, she couldn\u2019t get a signal.</p><p>Serenity, Texas, was fifty or sixty miles away. She hadn\u2019t been able to find out much about the town, only knew that it was so small the name warranted only the smallest typeface on a map of Texas. The professor had called Serenity a charming oasis. But when she\u2019d met him he\u2019d been wearing a heavy wool, tweed blazer in the summer heat. What did he know about charming?</p><p>She had checked the professor out before leaving Boston, and although he was strange and eccentric, he was the real deal. The man was multidegreed and certified to teach. An assistant in the Franklin College administration building, a woman named Lorraine, had raved about his teaching abilities. According to her, the professor made history come to life. His classes were always the first to fill up, she said.</p><p>Jordan found that nearly impossible to believe. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, yes. The students don\u2019t mind his accent, and they must be hanging on every word because no one ever fails his classes.\u201d</p><p>Ah, now Jordan understood. An easy grade.</p><p>The woman also mentioned that he\u2019d taken early retirement, but she hoped he would reconsider and come back.</p><p>\u201cGood teachers are so hard to come by,\u201d she had remarked. \u201cAnd on the salaries they\u2019re paid, most can\u2019t afford to retire at such an early age. Why, Professor MacKenna is barely in his forties.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine obviously didn\u2019t mind divulging personal information about a past faculty member, and she hadn\u2019t even asked Jordan why she was so interested. Granted, Jordan had lied and told the woman she was a distant relative, but Lorraine hadn\u2019t required any verification.</p><p>She was a talker, no doubt about that. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you thought he was much older, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did too,\u201d she said. \u201cI could look up his birthday for you if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Good heavens, she was accommodating. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Jordan answered. \u201cYou said he officially retired? I thought he\u2019d taken a sabbatical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he retired,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWe\u2019d be thrilled to have him back. I doubt he will ever teach again though. He received such a nice inheritance,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe told me he had no inkling that he was getting it, that the money was quite a surprise. He made the decision then and there to buy some land far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. He was doing research into his family\u2019s history, and he wanted a place where he could work in peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>Looking around her now, Jordan imagined the professor had found his peace and quiet. There wasn\u2019t a soul in sight, and she had a feeling that Serenity was just as stark as the surrounding landscape.</p><p>A half hour passed, the engine cooled, and she got back on the road. Since there wasn\u2019t any air-conditioning, she kept the windows down, and the blistering hot air felt like blasts from a furnace on her face. The terrain was as flat as one of her souffl\u00e9s, but once she drove around a yawning bend and saw the fences on either side of the road, the area seemed less desolate. At least there were signs of habitation. A rusted barbed-wire fence that looked like it had been constructed about a century ago enclosed empty pastures. Since she didn\u2019t see a single crop growing, she assumed the fences were for horses and cattle.</p><p>The miles rolled by, but the scenery didn\u2019t change much. Finally, she drove up a couple of gentle slopes, and then the road curved. Around a sharp bend she spotted a tower off in the distance. A sign on the side of the road announced that Serenity was just a mile away. As she made the turn, she picked up her cell phone and saw that she had a signal. The road dipped and then topped a hill. There, spread out before her, was the west side of Serenity.</p><p>It looked like a place too tired to die.</p><p>The speed limit dropped to thirty miles per hour. She passed several small homes. A rusted pickup truck sat on blocks in the front yard of one house. The tires were missing. Another house had a discarded washing machine in a side yard. What little grass there was among the weeds was untended and burned out. A block farther on she passed an abandoned gas station with one pump still standing. Vines grew up the side of the vacant building, and she could only guess what sort of critters could be living in it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat am I doing here? I never should have sold my company,\u201d Jordan whispered.</p><p>Pride. That\u2019s what got her into this ridiculous adventure. She didn\u2019t want Noah Clayborne mocking her. \u201cComfort zone,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with wanting to be in my comfort zone?\u201d</p><p>She thought about driving on through Serenity to the next big city, returning the rental car with a few choice words, and getting on the first flight to Boston, but she couldn\u2019t do that. She\u2019d promised Isabel that she would meet the professor and then call and tell her what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>Admittedly, Jordan was a little curious about her own ancestors as well. She certainly didn\u2019t believe that all of her Buchanan ancestors were savages, and she wanted to prove it. She also wanted to know what caused the feud between the Buchanans and the MacKennas in the first place. And what about the treasure? Did the professor even know what the treasure was?</p> <p>Jordan drove on and reached the main street. The houses looked lived-in, but the lawns were parched and brown, and the shades were drawn.</p><p>Serenity was as inviting as purgatory.</p><p>The red light on her dashboard began to flash, indicating the engine was overheating again. She found a small convenience store a couple of blocks away and pulled in. It was so hot she felt like her back was glued to the seat. She parked in the shade, turned the motor off so it would cool down, then pulled out the notepad with the professor\u2019s phone number and dialed.</p><p>On the fourth ring, his voice mail picked up. She left her name and number and was putting her phone back in her purse when it rang. The professor must have been screening his calls.</p><p>\u201cMiss Buchanan? Professor MacKenna here. I have to hurry. When do you want to meet? How about dinner? Yes, dinner. Meet me at The Branding Iron. It\u2019s off Third Street. Just head west and you\u2019ll run into it. There\u2019s a nice motel right across the street. You could check in, refresh yourself, and meet me at six. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p> <p>He hung up before she could say a word. He\u2019d sounded nervous, worried maybe. She shook her head. There was something about him that made her uneasy. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was simply because he was such a nervous man, always looking over his shoulder as though he expected someone to pounce on him, or if it was something else that bothered her, something she couldn\u2019t quite define. No matter the reason, her philosophy was simple: better be safe than sorry, and so she would only meet him in a public place.</p><p>An air-conditioned public place, she qualified. She was hot and sweaty and trying hard not to be miserable. Think positive, she told herself. After she peeled off her clothes and took a nice shower, she\u2019d feel much better.</p><p>She still wished she could keep on driving so she could get back to Boston sooner, but that was out of the question. The car she was driving had a high probability of breaking down on the road, and just picturing herself stranded in the middle of the night made her shudder. No, that was definitely out of the question. Besides, she\u2019d promised Isabel, and she couldn\u2019t go back on her word. And so she would meet Professor Weirdo, talk to him about his research over dinner, get photocopies of his research, and leave Serenity first thing in the morning.</p><p>Good, she was already feeling better. She was determined now, and she had a plan.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The plan crashed and burned when she pulled into the motel parking lot and got a good look at the hellhole Professor MacKenna had recommended. She was pretty sure Norman Bates ran the place.</p> <p>The driveway was a gravel pit all the way up to each of the units. There were eight in all, slapped up against one another like warehouse boxes. The white paint was chipped, and the single window in each of the rooms was coated with grime. She couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine how awful the rooms must be. Bedbugs would run from this place. They had higher standards.</p><p>But she could handle it for one night. Right?</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>Surely she could find something better, a place where she wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid to take a shower.</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t consider herself pampered or a snob. She didn\u2019t care if the motel was a bit run-down, but she wanted it to be clean and safe. And this place didn\u2019t measure up to either one of her basic standards. Since she had no intention of spending the night, she didn\u2019t need to see the rooms.</p><p>Jordan put the car in park and leaned out the window to get a good look at the restaurant across the street. She made the mistake of resting her arm on the hot edge of the window. She flinched and jerked her arm back inside the car.</p><p>The Branding Iron reminded her of a train because the building was long and narrow with a barrel-shaped roof. On the side of the road was a billboard with a purple neon horseshoe. She presumed it was meant to look like a branding iron.</p><p>Now that she had her bearings and knew where the restaurant was, she pulled out of the lot and drove on. She was almost certain that the car rental agency didn\u2019t have a branch in Serenity, which meant that she was stuck with this lemon until she drove to a larger city, the closest being over a hundred miles away. Jordan decided that once she checked into a motel for the night, she\u2019d notify the rental company, then she\u2019d find a mechanic to patch up the radiator, and she would be sure to buy a dozen gallons of water before she headed out of town. Just thinking about driving into the middle of nowhere with a malfunctioning car made her nervous. Mechanic first, she told herself. Then decision time. She might leave the car here and take whatever form of public transportation was available. Surely there were buses or trains or something.</p> <p>She soon came to a wood-plank bridge with a sign announcing that she was crossing Parson\u2019s Creek. The creek didn\u2019t have a drop of water in it, and as she clattered across, she read a warning posted on the railing that the bridge was impassable during high water. Not much of a concern today, she thought. The creek was as dried up as the town appeared to be.</p><p>On the other side of the bridge, a wooden sign painted forest green with bold white letters greeted her: WELCOME TO SERENITY, GRADY COUNTY, TEXAS. POPULATION 1,968. In smaller, hand-painted letters were the words, \u201cNew home of the Grady County High School Bulldogs.\u201d</p><p>The farther east she drove, the larger the homes became. She pulled to a stop at a corner, heard children laughing and shouting, and turned toward the sound. On her left was a neighborhood swimming pool. Finally, she thought. She didn\u2019t feel like she was in a graveyard anymore. There were people and noise. Women were sunbathing while their children played in the pool, and the life-guard, baking under the sweltering sun, sat on his perch half asleep.</p><p>The transformation after crossing the bridge from one county to another was astonishing. On this side of town, people watered their lawns. The area was clean, the houses well kept, the streets and sidewalks new. There were actual signs of commerce with shops open on either side of the main thoroughfare. On the left, a beauty shop, a hardware store, and an insurance office, and on the right, a bar and an antiques shop. At the end of the block, Jaffee\u2019s Bistro had tables and chairs set outside under a green-and-white awning, but Jordan couldn\u2019t imagine anyone wanting to sit outside in this heat.</p><p>The sign on the door said \u201cOpen.\u201d Her priorities immediately shifted. Air-conditioning sounded like heaven at the moment, and so did a nice cold drink. She\u2019d find a mechanic and a motel later.</p><p>She parked the car, grabbed her purse and her satchel with her laptop, and went inside. The blast of cold air made her knees weak. It was blissful.</p><p>A woman sitting at one of the tables rolling silverware into napkins looked up at the sound of the door opening.</p><p>\u201cLunch hour\u2019s over and dinner isn\u2019t being served yet. I can do you up a nice tall glass of iced tea if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. That would be lovely,\u201d Jordan replied.</p><p>The ladies\u2019 room was around a corner. After she washed her hands and face and ran a comb through her hair, she felt human again.</p><p>There were ten or twelve tables with checkered cloths and matching cushions on the chairs. She chose a table in the corner. She could see out the window, but the sun wasn\u2019t in her face.</p><p>The waitress returned a minute later with a frosty glass of iced tea, and Jordan asked her if she could borrow a phone book.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for, honey?\u201d the waitress asked. \u201cMaybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find a mechanic,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd a clean motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy enough. There are only two mechanics in town, and one of them is closed until next week. The other one is Lloyd\u2019s Garage, and that\u2019s just a couple of blocks from here. He\u2019s kind of difficult to deal with, but he\u2019ll get the job done. I\u2019ll get you the phone book, and you can look up his number.\u201d</p><p>While she waited, Jordan pulled out her laptop and set it up on the table. She\u2019d made some notes the night before and a list of questions to ask the professor, and she thought she\u2019d look them over again.</p><p>The waitress brought her a thin phone book open to the page with the listing for Lloyd\u2019s Garage.</p><p>\u201cI went ahead and called my friend Amelia Ann,\u201d she said. \u201cShe runs the Home Away from Home Motel, and she\u2019s getting a room ready for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely place. Amelia Ann\u2019s husband died several years ago and didn\u2019t leave her anything, not one dime of life insurance, so Amelia Ann and her daughter, Candy, moved into the motel and started managing it. They\u2019ve made it real homey. I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>Jordan called the number for the garage on her cell phone and was curtly informed that no one could look at her car until tomorrow. The mechanic told her to bring it in first thing in the morning. \u201cFigures,\u201d Jordan said with a sigh as she flipped her phone shut.</p><p>\u201cAre you just passing through Serenity, or did you get lost?\u201d the woman asked. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d she hurriedly added.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind you asking. I\u2019m meeting someone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey. It isn\u2019t a man, is it? You didn\u2019t follow a man here, did you? Tell me you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s what I did. I followed him all the way from San Antonio. It didn\u2019t work out though, not for long anyway, and he up and moved on.\u201d She shook her head and made a tsking sound. \u201cNow I\u2019m stuck here until I can earn enough money to move back home. My name\u2019s Angela, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Jordan introduced herself and shook the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, and no, I didn\u2019t follow a man here. I am meeting a man for dinner, but it\u2019s business. He\u2019s bringing me some papers and information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing romantic then?\u201d</p><p>She pictured the professor and almost shuddered. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t have that accent, at least not much.\u201d</p><p>Jordan wasn\u2019t sure if the comment was good or bad, but Angela was smiling. She had a lovely smile and seemed to have a sweet disposition. In her younger days she\u2019d been a sun worshipper, Jordan guessed, because she had deep creases in her face, and her skin looked a bit like dried leather.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you lived in Serenity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to eighteen years.\u201d</p><p>Jordan blinked. The woman had been saving for eighteen years and still didn\u2019t have enough to move back home?</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going to meet this businessman for dinner?\u201d Angela asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me. I\u2019m just curious is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having dinner at The Branding Iron. Have you ever been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as good as the food here, and it\u2019s located in a bad part of town. The restaurant\u2019s a local landmark, so it stays open, and they do a real good business on weekends. It\u2019s not safe after dark. Your businessman must be a local, or maybe a local told him about the place. No one outside of Serenity would even know to suggest The Branding Iron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is MacKenna,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a history professor, and he has some research papers for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met him,\u201d Angela said. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t know everyone in town, but I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s new to the area.\u201d Angela turned to leave. \u201cYou go ahead and enjoy your tea, and I\u2019ll leave you alone. Everyone thinks I talk too much.\u201d</p><p>Jordan knew the waitress was waiting for her to disagree. \u201cI don\u2019t think you do.\u201d</p><p>Angela turned back, a big smile on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t think I do either. I\u2019m just friendly, that\u2019s all. Too bad you can\u2019t have dinner here. Jaffee\u2019s making his special shrimp dish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the professor suggested the restaurant because it\u2019s right across the street from a motel he recommended.\u201d</p><p>Angela\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cThe Lux? He suggested The Lux?\u201d</p><p>Jordan smiled. \u201cIs that what the motel\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThere used to be a big old sign that lit up. The word \u2018luxury\u2019 flashed off and on all night. Only the first three letters still light up, and that\u2019s why folks call it The Lux. They do a good business at night...all night as a matter of fact.\u201d Her voice dropped to a whisper as she added, \u201cThe creep that runs the place charges by the hour. Get my drift?\u201d</p><p>She must have thought that Jordan didn\u2019t understand because she hurriedly explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a whore place is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jordan said, nodding so the waitress wouldn\u2019t feel the need to explain what a whore was.</p><p>Angela thrust her hip out and leaned against the table. She kept her voice low. \u201cIt\u2019s also a firetrap if you ask me.\u201d She darted a quick look to her left and then her right to make sure no one had crept into the empty restaurant to eavesdrop, then said, \u201cIt should have been torn down years ago, but J. D. Dickey runs the place, and no one dares mess with him. I think he runs some of the whores too, if you ask me. J. D. is a real scary one, all right. He\u2019s got a mean streak a mile wide.\u201d</p><p>Angela was a wealth of information and wasn\u2019t the least bit shy about telling everything she knew. Jordan was fascinated. She almost envied Angela\u2019s openness and friendly candor. Jordan was the complete opposite. She kept things bottled up. Bet Angela can sleep at night, she thought. Jordan hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in over a year. Her mind was always racing, and there were nights when she paced the floor of her apartment while she worried about one problem or another. In the morning light, none of those worries seemed all that important, but in the middle of the night, they became monumental. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the fire department or the police closed the motel? If it\u2019s a fire hazard...\u201d Jordan wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd prostitution is illegal in Texas...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she agreed again before Jordan could continue. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter much. You don\u2019t understand how things are around here. What we have is a different county on each side of Parson\u2019s Creek, and they\u2019re run as different as night and day. Right this minute you\u2019re sitting in Grady County, but the sheriff in charge of Jessup County is one of those folks who thinks he can turn a blind eye to what\u2019s going on. You get my drift? Live and let live. That\u2019s his motto. If you ask me, he\u2019s afraid to go up against J. D., and you know why? I\u2019ll tell you why. The sheriff of Jessup County is J. D.\u2019s brother. That\u2019s right. His brother. Isn\u2019t that something?\u201d</p> <p>Jordan nodded. \u201cWhat about you? Are you afraid of this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, anyone with a lick of sense would know to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>J. D. DICKEY WAS THE TOWN BULLY. HE HAD A NATURAL TALENT: he didn\u2019t have to work hard at all to get people to hate him. Building his reputation as a badass was a job he thoroughly enjoyed, and he knew for a certainty that he\u2019d accomplished his goal when he strolled down the main street of Serenity and people hurried out of his way. Their expressions said it all. They were afraid of him, and in J. D.\u2019s mind, fear meant power. His power.</p><p>J. D.\u2019s full name was Julius Delbert Dickey Jr. He didn\u2019t much care for the name though, thought it was too girly-sounding for the tough-as-iron image he was going after, and so, while he was still in high school, he began to train the residents of his hometown to call him by his initials. Those few who resisted were subjected to his special, though unsophisticated, form of behavior modification. He beat the daylights out of them.</p> <p>There were two Dickey brothers, and both of them grew up in Serenity. J. D. was firstborn. Randall Cleatus Dickey came along two years later.</p><p>The Dickey boys hadn\u2019t seen their father in over ten years. A federal prison in Kansas was providing the Senior\u2019s room and board for twenty-five to life for an armed robbery that, as he explained to the sentencing judge, had just gone bad. Looking back, he told the judge, he realized he probably shouldn\u2019t have shot that nosy guard after all. The man was only doing his job.</p><p>The boys\u2019 mother, Sela, stayed around until J. D. and Randy graduated from high school. Then she decided she had had enough of motherhood. Tired and worn as thin as a broomstick trying to keep her rambunctious sons out of trouble, and failing miserably at the job, she packed her clothes and snuck out of town in the middle of the night. The boys figured she wouldn\u2019t be coming back anytime soon because she took with her all of her large cans of Extra Super Hold Aqua Net hairspray. Their mother\u2019s hair grooming products were her only luxury, and she always kept at least five or six cans on hand.</p><p>They didn\u2019t miss her or her chronic complaining about having to do without, and since J. D. was pretty much running things anyway, life didn\u2019t change much after she left. They had been dirt poor growing up, and they were still dirt poor, but J. D. was determined to change that. He had big plans, but his plans required money. Lots of money. He wanted to own a ranch. He had his eye on a nice little piece of land located just thirty miles west of town. The land was small by most Texans\u2019 measure at just over five hundred acres, but J. D. figured that once he was firmly established as a gentleman rancher, he\u2019d be able to gobble up all the land around him. The ranch he meant to have was prime land with several good watering holes for the cattle he was going to buy as soon as he figured out a good way to get his hands on some money. There was a nice fishing lake too, and brother Randy loved to fish.</p><p>Yes sir, he was going to become a cowboy. He felt like he was already halfway there. He owned the boots and the hat, and he\u2019d worked on a ranch two full summers in a row while he was in high school. The pay stunk. The experience was invaluable.</p><p>J. D.\u2019s dream was put on hold for five years with good behavior. He\u2019d killed a man in a bar fight and got five years for manslaughter. There were extenuating circumstances. According to witnesses, the stranger had started the fight and had gotten in some pretty good cuts with his switchblade before J. D. knocked him out. He hadn\u2019t set out to take the man\u2019s life, but he punched him hard, and as bad luck would have it, the stranger struck his head on his way down.</p> <p>J. D. boasted to his brother that he would have gotten more time behind bars if he hadn\u2019t given each one of the jurors the evil eye as he was leaving the courtroom.</p><p>Randy\u2019s take on the incident was different. In fact, his brother\u2019s incarceration opened his eyes, and he saw for the first time that the real power was on the side of the law. So, while J. D. was serving his sentence, Randy was changing into a law-abiding citizen, and within a few short years he managed to influence enough people to get himself elected sheriff of Jessup County.</p><p>J. D. couldn\u2019t have been happier for his brother. Randy\u2019s new title and his new status in the community were achievements to celebrate. After all, having a sheriff in the family could come in real handy.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>JORDAN CHECKED INTO THE HOME AWAY FROM HOME MOTEL and was given a spacious room in the back of the courtyard. The door had solid double locks. The room was square shaped and clean. A king-sized bed faced the door and a desk and two chairs sat against the wall facing the window. No laptop hookup or Internet access, she noticed, but she could do without for one night.</p><p>Angela\u2019s friend, Amelia Ann, made her feel like an honored guest. She brought her extra little soaps and fluffy towels fresh out of her dryer.</p><p>After Jordan unpacked, she stripped out of her clothes and took a nice, cool shower. She washed and dried her hair, put on a skirt and blouse, and had just enough time to head back to The Branding Iron. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d eaten dinner at six, but since she hadn\u2019t had anything to eat since breakfast, she was actually hungry.</p><p>Dinner was unforgettable...but not in a good way. As it turned out, Professor MacKenna was quite an appetite suppressant.</p> <p>Though it was just six o\u2019clock, the parking lot of The Branding Iron was full. A waitress met her at the door and showed her to a booth tucked way in the back dining room.</p><p>\u201cWe have better tables, but the guy you\u2019re meeting wanted privacy. I\u2019ll show you where he is. Stay away from the fish tonight. It smells funny,\u201d she whispered as she led the way. \u201cI\u2019ll be serving you,\u201d she added with a smile.</p><p>Professor MacKenna didn\u2019t stand when Jordan reached the table, didn\u2019t even bother to nod as she took her seat across from him. His mouth was stuffed with bread, and he should have waited until after he had swallowed to speak to her, but he didn\u2019t. He talked around a wad of bread the size of a golf ball that was half in and half out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said, his voice garbled by food.</p><p>Since it was only a few minutes past the hour, she didn\u2019t feel the need to apologize or respond to his ridiculous criticism. She picked up a linen napkin, unfolded it, and placed it in her lap. His napkin was still on the table, she noticed. Jordan tried desperately not to look at his mouth while he chewed. Had he not been so vulgar, he would have been comical.</p><p>The urge to bolt almost overtook her. What in God\u2019s name was she doing here? Hadn\u2019t she been perfectly happy and content before the conversation she\u2019d had with Noah at the wedding reception? Now look at her. Having dinner with Professor Uncouth. Lovely, she thought. What a lovely adventure.</p><p>Okay, new plan, she told herself. Get through this dinner as quickly and as painlessly as possible, get the research papers, and leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already ordered my dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cHave a look over the menu and pick something.\u201d</p><p>She opened her menu, ordered the first item that caught her eye, a spicy chicken dish, and sparkling water. The waitress brought her her drink, gave her a sympathetic look with a meaningful glance toward the professor, and hurried to another table, pretending not to notice that he was waving an empty breadbasket at her.</p><p>Jordan waited until his mouth was empty before speaking. \u201cAs a history professor,\u201d she began, \u201csurely you know the Buchanan clan couldn\u2019t be all bad. Over the centuries I\u2019m sure there...\u201d She stopped talking when he vigorously shook his head. Then she asked, \u201cYou really believe they were all horrible men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. They were despicable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me an example of something despicable the Buchanans did to the sainted MacKennas,\u201d she challenged.</p><p>His behavior and his attitude changed the second he started talking about his research. Thankfully, he wasn\u2019t chewing when he began his history lesson...his one-sided, slanted history lesson.</p><p>\u201cIn 1784 the magnificent Laird Ross MacKenna sent his only daughter, Freya, to the clan Mitchell. She was pledged to marry the Laird Mitchell\u2019s oldest son, who everyone knew would become laird just as soon as his esteemed father passed on. According to my documents, there was a terrible attack en route to the Mitchell holding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Buchanans attacked?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, not the Buchanans. It was the clan MacDonald who attacked. The Laird MacDonald was against the alliance between the MacKennas and the Mitchells because he believed it would make them too powerful. The ambush occurred on the bank of the great loch, and in the skirmish, the fair lass, Freya, fell in.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to acknowledge what he\u2019d told her, and so she nodded. \u201cDid she drown?\u201d she asked, wondering how he would pin her death on the Buchanans.</p><p>\u201cNo, and it was written that she could swim, but the rain began, and the loch was stirred into a frenzy. Suddenly there was a great shout, and one of the MacKennas looked across the loch just in time to see a Buchanan warrior pull Freya out of the water. The lass was still alive, for her arms were flailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that is a good story about the Buchanans,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019ve just told me that a Buchanan warrior saved the woman\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>The professor\u2019s eyebrows lowered. \u201cThe lass Freya was never heard of or seen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Buchanan took her. That\u2019s what happened. He saw her, he wanted her, and he took her.\u201d</p><p>She thought the professor expected her to be shocked, and she knew he wouldn\u2019t appreciate her laughter. \u201cWas there only one witness to this...kidnapping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne reliable witness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must agree that the story might have been exaggerated so that the Buchanans would be held responsible.\u201d Before he could argue with her conclusion, she asked, \u201cCan you give me another example...with documented proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to,\u201d he said.</p><p>Unfortunately, his salad arrived, and he began his story while digging into his plate. Jordan looked down at the table so she wouldn\u2019t have to watch.</p><p>He stabbed at his lettuce as he said, \u201cLook in your history books, and you\u2019ll read that in 1691, King William III ordered all the clan chiefs to sign a loyalty oath by January 1, 1692.</p><p>\u201cThe MacKennas were the most honored and respected clan in all of Scotland. William MacKenna, as head of the MacKenna clan, headed for Inverary in November with a band of clansmen to sign it. On the way he was met by a messenger who told him that the king was making changes to the oath and that they were to return home until they received word. When they arrived back at their holding, they discovered their livestock had been scattered, and many of their buildings had been set afire. By the time they were able to establish order again, the deadline had come and gone.</p><p>\u201cIt was then that they learned that the messenger had been a liar and not from the king at all. The loyalty oath had not been postponed.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another one of his glowering glares. Uh-oh. She knew where this story was heading.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she prodded. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what happened.\u201d He dropped his fork and leaned forward. \u201cKing William was furious with the MacKennas for disobeying his order. As punishment he made the MacKennas pay a heavy toll and relinquish a good portion of their land. Worse, they fell out of favor with the monarchy for decades to come.\u201d Nodding, he picked up his fork and stabbed a tomato wedge. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt who sent the messenger and who wreaked havoc on the MacKennas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. The Buchanans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, dearie. The despicable Buchanans.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d raised his voice and nearly shouted \u201cdespicable Buchanans\u201d at her. Other diners in the restaurant were watching and listening. Jordan didn\u2019t care if he wanted to make a scene. She\u2019d keep up.</p><p>\u201cWas there actual proof that the Buchanans sent the messenger or attacked the MacKenna lands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no proof needed,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cWithout actual documented proof, this is all hearsay and fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Buchanans were the only clan underhanded enough to want to discredit the revered MacKennas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says a MacKenna. Did it ever occur to you that maybe the story\u2019s been reversed, and the Buchanans had at some point been attacked by the MacKennas?\u201d</p><p>The wicked look on his face told her she\u2019d punched all of his buttons. His fist hit the table. \u201cI know my facts. Don\u2019t forget, the Buchanans started it all. It was they who stole the MacKenna treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what was this treasure?\u201d Jordan asked. This was the subject that had piqued her interest in the first place.</p><p>\u201cSomething very valuable and that rightfully belonged to the MacKennas,\u201d he answered. Suddenly he sat upright in his chair and scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re really after, isn\u2019t it? You think you\u2019ll discover the treasure...maybe even find it for yourself. Well, I can assure you the centuries have hidden it well, and if I haven\u2019t discovered it, you certainly won\u2019t be able to stumble upon it. All of the atrocities committed by the Buchanans over the generations have obscured the origin of the feud. It\u2019s likely that no one will ever find it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she was letting him get her all riled up, but she was suddenly determined to defend her family name. \u201cDo you know the difference between fact and fantasy, Professor?\u201d</p><p>Their conversation became more heated. The two of them barely managed to keep their voices below a shout, even though Jordan did get a little carried away with a few choice names for his clan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All conversation ceased as soon as dinner arrived. Jordan couldn\u2019t believe the huge hunk of nearly raw meat that was placed in front of the professor. Next to it was a giant baked potato fully loaded. Her little chicken dish looked like a child\u2019s portion in comparison. The professor\u2019s head went down, and he didn\u2019t come up for air again until he had devoured every bite. There wasn\u2019t a piece of gristle or fat left on his plate.</p><p>\u201cWould you like more bread?\u201d she asked calmly.</p><p>In answer he shoved the bread basket at her. She was able to get the waitress\u2019s attention and politely requested more. From the waitress\u2019s wary expression, Jordan assumed she\u2019d witnessed the argument, and she smiled to assure the woman that all was well.</p><p>\u201cYou have a great passion for your work,\u201d Jordan complimented. She decided that if she didn\u2019t start humoring him, he might leave without letting her see his research, and the trip would be completely wasted.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you admire my dedication,\u201d he answered and then launched into another tale about the dastardly Buchanans. He stopped long enough to order dessert, and by the time it arrived, he\u2019d worked his way back to the fourteenth century.</p><p>Everything in Texas was big, including food. She stared at the top of the professor\u2019s head as he devoted himself to inhaling every bite of the huge wedge of apple pie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream.</p><p>A waiter dropped a glass. The professor looked around and noticed how crowded the room was becoming. He seemed to shrivel up in the booth as he kept a close eye on who was coming and going.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like crowds.\u201d</p> <p>He took a sip of his coffee and said, \u201cI\u2019ve stored some data on a flash drive. It\u2019s in one of the boxes for Isabel. Do you know what a flash drive is?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, he said, \u201cAll Isabel has to do is slip the flash drive into her computer. It\u2019s like a disk, and it can store volumes of data.\u201d</p><p>His condescending tone irritated her to no end. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she gets it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He told her the price of the flash drive and said, \u201cI assume you or Miss MacKenna will reimburse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d He pulled a receipt from his pocket and stared expectantly at her, obviously wanting payment right this minute, and so she got the money from her billfold and handed it to him. He wasn\u2019t the trusting sort. He counted the money before tucking it into his wallet.</p> <p>\u201cAs to my research...I have three large boxes. I\u2019ve spoken at length with Isabel, and against my better judgment I have decided to let you take them to make photocopies for her. She has assured me that she takes full responsibility, and so I will rely on her integrity as a MacKenna. I\u2019ll know if anything is missing. I have a photographic memory. Once I\u2019ve read something, it stays with me.\u201d He paused to tap his forehead. \u201cI remember names and faces of people I met ten, twenty years ago. It\u2019s stored up here. The important and the unimportant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do I have to make the copies?\u201d she asked, wanting to move the conversation along.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so busy getting ready for my trip. I\u2019m leaving sooner than I originally planned. You\u2019ll have to stay in Serenity and make your copies here. It shouldn\u2019t take you more than two days at the most. Maybe three,\u201d he allowed.</p><p>\u201cIs there a print shop in town with copy machines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut there\u2019s a machine at the grocery store, and I\u2019m sure there are others around town.\u201d</p><p>After two more cups of coffee, he requested the bill. As the time for their parting grew closer, every minute seemed to drag. When the check came, he pushed it toward her. At this point she wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>Her brother Zachary had always been able to gross her out. He was much better at it than any of her other brothers, but tonight the professor had usurped his title as the king of gross. Professor MacKenna wiped his mouth with his napkin, which had lain folded on the table throughout the meal, and scooted out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cI want to get home before it gets dark.\u201d</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be dark for at least another hour. \u201cDo you live far from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the car and transfer the boxes. You\u2019ll take good care of them? Isabel spoke highly of you, and I\u2019m trusting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of them,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Ten minutes later the bill had been paid, the boxes had been transferred to her car, and Jordan was, for the time being, rid of the professor.</p><p>She felt liberated.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>JORDAN WAS UP BRIGHT AND EARLY THE FOLLOWING MORNING. She drove the car over to Lloyd\u2019s Garage and was parked and waiting for him to open his doors.</p><p>She hoped to get the car patched up, then drive to the grocery store she was told had a copy machine. If all went well, she could get one box finished and maybe half of another. Two of the boxes were filled to the top, and, fortunately, the professor hadn\u2019t written on both sides of the paper because the pen he\u2019d used on some of them had bled through.</p><p>The garage doors opened ten minutes after eight. After popping the hood and looking at the engine for about thirty seconds, the mechanic, a brute of a man about her age, leaned against the fender, crossed one ankle over the other, and gave her a slow and definitely creepy once-over while he wiped his hands on an oily rag.</p><p>He must have thought he\u2019d missed something in his rude inspection because he gave her the once-over again, and then again. Honest to Pete, her car hadn\u2019t gotten this much attention.</p><p>She was going to have to put up with the jerk because he was the only mechanic in town until next Monday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty certain the radiator has a leak,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what do you think? Can you patch it up?\u201d</p><p>The mechanic had his name, Lloyd, printed on a strip of masking tape and stuck to his shirt pocket. The edges were curling up. He turned away, tossed the dirty rag on a nearby rack, and then turned around again.</p><p>\u201cCan I patch it? Depends,\u201d he drawled. \u201cIt\u2019s egregious is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know...salivient.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd obviously liked to use big words whenever possible, even when those words didn\u2019t make sense. Salivient? Was that even a word?</p><p>\u201cBut you can fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost beyond repair, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Sweetie? I don\u2019t think so. She silently counted to five in an attempt to keep her temper under control so she wouldn\u2019t blow up. It wouldn\u2019t do to alienate the man who could get her car running.</p><p>Good old Lloyd had worked his way down to her feet and was on his way back up when he said, \u201cWhat we have here is a serious situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d Determined to get along no matter how irritating the man was, she nodded. \u201cYou said it was almost beyond repair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Almost.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms and waited for him to finish another trip down her legs and back. He should have them memorized by now. \u201cWould you care to explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour radiator has a leak.\u201d</p><p>She felt like screaming. She\u2019d already told him that.</p><p>\u201cI could probably repair it temporarily, but I can\u2019t guarantee it would hold,\u201d Lloyd continued.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take you to repair it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what I find under the hood.\u201d He raised his eyebrows meaningfully, and when she didn\u2019t immediately react, he added, \u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>She knew exactly what he meant. Lloyd was a real degenerate. Her patience ended. \u201cYou\u2019ve already looked under the hood,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Her obvious anger didn\u2019t appear to faze him. He must be used to rejection, she decided. Either that or he\u2019d stood outside in the sun too long and had fried his brain.</p><p>\u201cAre you married, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried. Are you married? I need to know who to bill,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cBill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being hospitable. You don\u2019t need to snap at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will the repair take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA day...maybe two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand until she walked around him and opened the car door.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re leaving with a leak...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou won\u2019t get far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d</p><p>He thought she was bluffing until she started the engine and began to back out of the garage.</p><p>\u201cI could maybe fix it by noon,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, for sure by noon,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t charge you much.\u201d</p><p>She put the brakes on. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty-five, maybe seventy, but no more than eighty. I don\u2019t take credit cards, and since you\u2019re from out of town, I won\u2019t take a check. You\u2019ll have to give me cash.\u201d</p><p>Lured by the promise that she could have her car back by noon, she agreed, and handed the keys over to Lloyd.</p><p>She walked back to the motel but stopped in the lobby to speak to Amelia Ann.</p><p>\u201cI have several boxes of papers I need to photocopy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe grocery store near the Parson\u2019s Creek bridge has a copier, but it\u2019s quite a walk from here and I was wondering if there are any copy machines closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do some checking for you while you go have some breakfast. I think maybe I can find one for you.\u201d</p><p>The Home Away from Home Motel had a closet-sized coffee shop. Jordan was the only customer. She didn\u2019t have much of an appetite and ordered toast and orange juice.</p><p>Amelia Ann came looking for her. \u201cI only had to make a couple of calls,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in luck. Charlene over at the Nelson Insurance Agency has a brand-spanking-new copy machine. The company put it in last week, and it\u2019s on trial, so they don\u2019t care how many papers you have to copy just as long as you pay for the paper you use. Steve Nelson carries the insurance on this motel, so he\u2019s not going to mind doing a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind helping out when I can. Charlene said to tell you the machine has a feeder, so it will copy lickety-split.\u201d</p><p>The news just kept getting better. The insurance agency was only three short blocks away from the motel, and the copier was in a room all by itself, so Jordan wouldn\u2019t bother Charlene or her boss while she worked.</p><p>The copy machine was an absolute dream, and she made quick progress. She was interrupted only once when a client of the agency, Kyle Heffermint, stopped by to get some figures. While Charlene was gathering them for him, he spotted Jordan in the copy room and took it upon himself to act as the welcoming committee for the town of Serenity. He leaned against the wall and chatted as Jordan continued to feed pages into the machine. Kyle was a pleasant man, and she enjoyed hearing all about the history and politics of the community, even though his habits of repeating her name and punctuating his comments by raising one eyebrow were a bit annoying. After she declined his fourth offer to \u201cshow her around,\u201d Charlene came to the rescue and ushered him to the door.</p><p>Jordan had copied two full boxes before noon. Staggering under the weight, she carried the first and the second box of originals back to her motel room and then returned for the copies. She stuffed some of the pages in her tote bag with her laptop so she could start reading while she had lunch.</p><p>It was a quarter to twelve when she arrived at Lloyd\u2019s Garage to find the coolant reservoir and most of the engine lined up on a tarp.</p><p>Lloyd was sprawled out in a metal chair, fanning himself with a folded newspaper, but the second he spotted her in the doorway he tossed the paper aside and jumped to attention. He put his hands up as though to ward off a blow and blurted, \u201cNow don\u2019t get yourself in a roar.\u201d</p><p>The radiator hose was draped over the coolant reservoir in the center of the tarp. She stared at it while she casually asked, \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParts...belongs inside your car. I ran into a few problems,\u201d he continued. He couldn\u2019t quite look her in the eye. \u201cI was wanting to make sure it was a leak in the radiator and not something else, so I pulled the hose to check for a tear and there wasn\u2019t any, and then I decided to check the clamp, and it was okay, and then I decided I might as well check a couple of other things too. And what do you know...the leak turned out to be in the radiator after all, just like I suspected. Better safe than sorry, don\u2019t you think? And I\u2019m not charging extra for the extra work. A thank-you will be fine. Oh, and one more thing,\u201d he added in another rush. \u201cI\u2019ll get it fixed by tomorrow noon, like I promised.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cYou promised it would be fixed by noon today.\u201d She was so furious she\u2019d been played, her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cNo, you made an assumption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised noon today,\u201d she repeated forcefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, I never said today. That\u2019s where the assumption part comes in. I just said noon. I didn\u2019t say noon today or noon tomorrow.\u201d And without pausing for breath, he asked, \u201cSince you\u2019re going to have to stay in town another night and don\u2019t know a soul, how about having dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>Lloyd apparently lived in another dimension.</p><p>\u201cPut it all back. Put it all back now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I want you to put everything back where it belongs. Do it now, please.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd must not have liked the look in her eyes because he took a hasty step back. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got another job to finish first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Then you weren\u2019t taking a nap when I walked in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t napping. I was taking a break.\u201d</p><p>She knew it would be pointless to argue with him. \u201cWhen will my car be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cSee what just happened here? I said noon tomorrow, so I can\u2019t get out of it. Once I say something, it\u2019s said.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. What in heaven\u2019s name was that supposed to mean? Maybe she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly. \u201cOnce you say something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s said,\u201d he repeated with a nod. \u201cAnd that means I can\u2019t take it back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would like you to put it in writing,\u201d she said. \u201cGuarantee the time the car will be ready and the price,\u201d she added. \u201cThen sign it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he promised as he turned and went inside the shop. He came back out a minute later with a pad and a pen. He leaned against the car as he wrote and signed the guarantee. He even dated it without being asked.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d he asked after he\u2019d given her the paper and she\u2019d read it.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be back here at noon tomorrow. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do? Hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d She started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cHold on now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to eat sometime. What about having dinner with me?\u201d</p> <p>She attempted to be gracious as she declined his invitation. She even went so far as to thank him for inviting her. He seemed placated when she left him.</p><p>Her steps slowed as she walked over to Jaffee\u2019s Bistro. It was beastly hot. By the time she got there, she was dying from the heat and the humidity. How did the residents of Serenity stand it? The temperature on the thermometer outside the restaurant registered ninety-eight.</p><p>Angela was carrying a plate to one of the tables when Jordan walked in.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Angela.\u201d Good Lord, now she was beginning to sound like a local. The realization made her smile.</p><p>\u201cYou want your usual table? Let me just clear it for you.\u201d</p> <p>The restaurant was nearly full, and all the customers watched her as she made her way to the corner table. They were obviously curious about outsiders.</p><p>\u201cAre you in a hurry, or can you do with iced tea for a little bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait, and tea would be great.\u201d</p><p>Angela brought the drink right away and then went back to helping the other customers while Jordan looked over the menu. When she had decided on a chicken salad, she put the menu down, opened her laptop and turned it on, and then spread out some of the research papers so she could start reading.</p><p>She made notes while she read so she could check the professor\u2019s research when she got back to Boston.</p><p>\u201cYour fingers are flying over those keys,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAm I interrupting your train of thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d she said, glancing up from the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had been making notes, but just now I was merging my calendar with a spreadsheet. Nothing important,\u201d she added as she closed the laptop.</p><p>\u201cSo you must know a lot about computers...you know, how they work and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cI work with computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaffee\u2019s got to meet you. He\u2019s got a computer, but it won\u2019t work right. Maybe you could answer a couple of questions for him after you have your lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help,\u201d she said.</p><p>The restaurant had emptied by the time she finished her salad. Angela came out from the kitchen with the owner. She made the introductions, and Jordan complimented him on the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a charming place,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s named after me of course,\u201d he told her with a grin. \u201cMy first name\u2019s Vernon, but everyone likes to call me just plain Jaffee. I like it too,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhere are you from, Jordan Buchanan?\u201d Jaffee had a wonderful twang in his voice, like a guitar string being plucked.</p><p>\u201cBoston,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhat about you? Did you grow up in Serenity, or are you a transplant like Angela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransplant,\u201d he replied, flashing a smile. \u201cFrom another tiny town you\u2019ve probably never heard of. I did a spell in San Antonio. That\u2019s where I met my wife, Lily. She worked at the same restaurant, and you know...we kind of clicked. We\u2019ve been married fourteen years, and we\u2019re still clicking. What\u2019s the weather like in Boston? Does it get as hot as it does here?\u201d</p><p>The conversation about the heat lasted a good ten minutes. Jordan didn\u2019t know anyone, aside from a meteorologist, who was more interested in the weather than Jaffee.</p><p>\u201cMind if I sit with you a spell?\u201d he asked as he pulled out a chair across from her and sat down. \u201cAngela said you wouldn\u2019t mind answering some questions about computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you like your salad? City girls always like salads, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThis city girl does.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee was such a nice man, and he was definitely in the mood to chat.</p><p>\u201cI had quite a crowd here for breakfast. Always do. I don\u2019t have half that many for lunch. Truth is, I barely break even in the summer months, even serving dinner, but come fall I do a real nice business. My wife has to come in and help out then. My chocolate cake is famous around here. I expect folks will come dribbling in later this afternoon for a slice or two. Don\u2019t you worry though. I already put back a slice for you.\u201d</p><p>She thought he was going to get up when he shifted in his chair. She reached for one of her folders so she could read another outrageous story about the saintly MacKennas and the demonic Buchanans.</p><p>Jaffee wasn\u2019t going anywhere. He was merely getting comfortable. \u201cChocolate cake is how I ended up owning this coffee shop.\u201d</p><p>She put the folder down and gave him her full attention. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrumbo Motors,\u201d he said. \u201cDave Trumbo to be exact. He owns a dealership in Bourbon, which is about forty miles from here. Anyway, Dave and his wife, Suzanne, were vacationing in San Antonio, and they had dinner in the restaurant where I was working. I\u2019d made my chocolate cake, and boy oh boy, did he take to it. He had three slices before his wife made him stop.\u201d He laughed then. \u201cHe\u2019s got a real love for chocolate, but Suzanne won\u2019t let him have it very often. She worries about his cholesterol and such. Anyway,\u201d he continued, \u201cDave couldn\u2019t get that cake out of his mind, and he sure didn\u2019t want to have to drive all the way to San Antonio, which as you know is quite a trek from here. So what did he do? He made me an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse. First of all he told me about Serenity and how there wasn\u2019t a good restaurant to speak of, and then he told me he went to his good friend Eli Whitaker. Eli\u2019s a rich rancher who\u2019s always looking for a good investment. Dave convinced him to give me start-up money. Eli owns this building, but I don\u2019t have to pay rent until I start making a big enough profit. He\u2019s what we call a silent partner. He rarely looks at the books, and some months when I get my bank statement, I see there\u2019s been a deposit made into the account. He won\u2019t own up to it, but I know he or maybe Trumbo is putting the extra money in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound like good men,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, they are,\u201d Jaffee replied. \u201cEli\u2019s a bit of a recluse. He comes in here a lot, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s left Serenity since he settled here fifteen years ago. You just might get to meet him this afternoon. Dave\u2019s bringing him his new truck. Eli buys a new one every year.\u201d</p><p>Jordan thought Jaffee was about to get up, so she reached for the folder again.</p><p>\u201cDave\u2019s our best advertisement. The man loves his chocolate, and lots of folks come in because Dave told them how good the food is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Trumbo Motors have a good mechanic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sure do. More than one.\u201d Jaffee chuckled. \u201cI heard Lloyd was giving you a hard time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou did? How did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a small town, and people like to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ve been talking about me?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the surprise out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cOh my, yes. You\u2019re the talk of the town. Beautiful woman like you coming here, not putting on any airs at all, talking to ordinary folks.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine whom he was talking about. She certainly didn\u2019t feel beautiful. And what ordinary folks had she talked to, and what did he mean by ordinary?</p><p>\u201cYou look flabbergasted,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s different here than Boston. We like to think we\u2019re more friendly, but the fact is we\u2019re nosy. You get used to it, everyone knowing everyone else\u2019s business. I\u2019ll tell you what, when Dave gets here with Eli\u2019s truck, he\u2019ll come in for cake, and I\u2019ll introduce you. I\u2019ll bet good money he already knows about your car situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said he lives in another town...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d he said. \u201cHe lives in Bourbon, but everyone in Serenity buys their cars and trucks from him. He\u2019s got the best dealership around. I keep telling him he ought to go on television to advertise like those city fellas do, but he says no, he doesn\u2019t want his picture taken. He\u2019s camera shy I guess, and he likes dealing with the local folks. He\u2019s always coming over to Serenity. His wife gets her hair and nails done over here too, so she hears the latest news from the other ladies in the beauty shop.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee finally got around to his computer questions, and when Jordan explained what various commands were for, he seemed satisfied. He went back to the kitchen to start a sauce, but Jordan kept thinking about life in a small town. It would drive her nuts if everyone knew what everyone else was doing. Then she thought about her family, and she realized she already lived that life.</p><p>All six brothers were loving, sweet, and horribly intrusive. Maybe they had learned to interfere because of their jobs. Four were in law enforcement, though she probably shouldn\u2019t count Theo because he worked for the Justice Department, and unlike Nick and Dylan and Alec, Theo didn\u2019t carry a gun all the time. They were used to snooping into other people\u2019s lives\u2014but then again, as far back as she could remember, they always made sure they knew what she and her sister were up to. They used to scare the heck out of her high school dates. She would complain to her father, but that never did any good, and she thought that secretly he was on her brothers\u2019 side.</p><p>Big families were just like small towns. No doubt about it. Just like the Highland clans she was reading about. According to the professor\u2019s research material, the Buchanans were always interfering. They seemed to know every little thing the MacKennas did, and every little thing made them mad as hornets. They never forgot a slight. Jordan couldn\u2019t imagine how they kept track of all the feuds going on.</p><p>Papers were spread out all over the table. She was trying to decipher some notes the professor had made in the margins. They didn\u2019t make sense\u2014numbers, names, dollar signs, and other symbols randomly scribbled. Was that a crown? Some of the numbers could be dates. Had something important happened in 1284?</p><p>She heard Jaffee laughing and looked up just as he came out of the kitchen. A man followed carrying a dinner plate with a huge slice of chocolate cake. Had to be Dave Trumbo.</p><p>The big man strode toward her with an air of self-confidence. His face was hard, as though each feature had been carved in stone. His shoulders were broad, and from the way he was dressed in a crisp white shirt, striped tie, dark gray pants, and black loafers, she knew he took time and care with his appearance. Trumbo was what her mother would call dapper. He removed his designer sunglasses and chuckled over something Jaffee had said.</p><p>He had a winning smile and an easy way about him. He looked her right in the eye as he shook her hand and told her how nice it was to meet her. Oh, he was smooth all right. She didn\u2019t have to ask if he\u2019d lived in Texas all his life. Dapper Dave had a slow Texas drawl. Noah was born in Texas and would occasionally slip into that drawl too, she remembered, especially when he was being flirtatious.</p><p>\u201cJaffee told me you were having some trouble with Lloyd, and I\u2019m real sorry to hear it. If you want, I could have a talk with him. If he doesn\u2019t cooperate, I\u2019ll tell you what. I could have your car towed over to Bourbon and one of my mechanics could put it back together for you. It\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t just trade it in for a new car. I\u2019ve got a deal on a brand-new Chevy Suburban no one could turn down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer car\u2019s a rental, Dave,\u201d Jaffee reminded him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know it is. That\u2019s why I said it was a shame she couldn\u2019t trade it in. You ought to go after the people who rented you that vehicle. It\u2019s not right, doing business that way.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee told Dave that she was from Boston, and she answered several questions about her city. Dave hadn\u2019t been there yet, but wanted to take his family there for a vacation.</p><p>\u201cDave\u2019s got a boy and a girl,\u201d Jaffee interjected.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI sure do. It\u2019s why I have to work so hard. I best eat this cake in the kitchen in case my wife happens by. She\u2019s coming to town sometime this afternoon to get something or other done to her hair. She\u2019s perfect the way she is, but she likes to keep up she says with the latest styles she sees in the magazines. If she sees me eating this cake, she\u2019ll have a fit. She has me on a low-carb, low-fat, low-taste diet.\u201d He patted his stomach. \u201cI am getting a little thick in the middle, but this cake is worth a couple of extra miles on the treadmill.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look thick, he looked trim and fit. He wouldn\u2019t stay that way though if he continued eating so much sugar. She spotted what she thought was the top of a chocolate bar wrapper sticking out of his shirt pocket. Dave did love his chocolate.</p><p>Jaffee turned to look out the front window. \u201cEli\u2019s parking his truck across the street,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks brand-new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a year old this month,\u201d Dave said. \u201cWhich is why he\u2019s trading it in. Eli can afford any car he wants, and Lord knows, I\u2019ve tried to get him to buy a luxury sedan, but he keeps on ordering the same pickup, just a new model, every year. He won\u2019t even choose a different color. Always black.\u201d</p><p>Jordan could see the rancher crossing the street. Eli Whitaker was a good-looking man\u2014tall, dark, and admittedly handsome. She\u2019d expected a rancher to be wearing cowboy boots and a Stetson, but he was dressed in jeans, a polo shirt, and tennis shoes.</p><p>He gave her a broad smile when Jaffee introduced her, and his hand felt warm when he shook hers. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Jordan,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jaffee quickly filled him in on the reason she was in town.</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear about your bad luck, but if there\u2019s a good place in the country to get stranded, I think you\u2019ve picked the right one. You\u2019ll find the people around Serenity just about as hospitable as they come. You let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been very helpful. My car should be ready tomorrow, and I\u2019ll be on my way again.\u201d</p><p>The three men stood at her table and continued to chat for a few more minutes, though they did most of the talking and she did most of the listening.</p><p>Finally Dave Trumbo said, \u201cWell, it was a pleasure visiting with you, Jordan Buchanan, and next time you\u2019re in this area, you be sure to drop by Trumbo Motors. No one undersells me,\u201d he boasted. He threw his hand over Eli\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cYou want a piece of cake, Eli? Let\u2019s go back to the kitchen and let this young lady get back to her homework.\u201d</p><p>Get back to her homework? Did he think she was in summer school?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not homework, Dave,\u201d Jaffee said. \u201cThose are stories she\u2019s reading about her relatives in Scotland. Stories from way back when. She came all this way to read these papers from some professor. Isn\u2019t that right, Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s Professor MacKenna\u2019s research.\u201d</p><p>Dave peered over her shoulder at what she was reading. \u201cYou understand all that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cI\u2019m trying. Sometimes it\u2019s not very clear,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cLooks like homework to me. I\u2019ll let you work in peace.\u201d He turned and, with his hand still on Eli\u2019s shoulder, headed toward the kitchen with Jaffee close behind.</p> <p>Time got away from Jordan, and it was almost four o\u2019clock when she gathered up her papers. Jaffee stood in the doorway watching her slip her laptop into her bag. He scratched the back of his neck and said, \u201cListen, about those commands...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not working. We\u2019re kind of computer illiterate in Serenity, but we\u2019re trying to catch up with the rest of Texas and the world. All the young kids learn about computers over in the consolidated schools, but we\u2019re not quite there yet in Serenity. The town\u2019s beginning to grow and we just got our first high school built, so we\u2019re hoping to get some good teachers in here soon. Maybe they can even teach some of us old folks. I\u2019ve got a nice big computer in the back, but it\u2019s not responding to any of the commands you gave me. I did something...I don\u2019t know what, and I ruined it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cRuined it? Unless you took a sledgehammer to it, it\u2019s difficult to ruin a computer. I\u2019ll be happy to look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sure appreciate it. I\u2019ve put in several calls to computer technicians over in Bourbon, but they\u2019re dragging their feet getting here.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been so nice to her, letting her hang out in his restaurant all day, it was the least she could do. She grabbed her bag and followed him into the kitchen. Jaffee\u2019s office was in a little nook by the back door. The computer was archaic by today\u2019s standards. There were cables running every which way. Most of them weren\u2019t necessary.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Jaffee asked. \u201cCan you save her and get her running again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sometimes call her Dora,\u201d he admitted sheepishly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t laugh. His face was turning red, and she knew it was embarrassing for him to admit he humanized the machine.</p><p>\u201cLet me see what I can do.\u201d She figured she had plenty of time to get back to the insurance agency and finish copying the papers in the last box. There wasn\u2019t that much left to do, so if the agency closed, she could always finish in the morning.</p><p>Jaffee returned to his work in the kitchen, and she went to work rebuilding the computer. She removed every cable, tossed out two of them, and unscrambled and rerouted two others. Once that was done, it didn\u2019t take her any time at all to get the computer running. Next she tackled the programs someone had installed for him. They too were archaic. Jaffee was trying to run three different ones, and all of them were complicated. Had she had the time and the equipment, she would have written a new program for him. She would have had fun doing it too, and oh, God, what did that say about her? She swore then and there that if she ever named her computers and humanized them, she\u2019d pack it in.</p><p>Since she couldn\u2019t install new software, she decided to try to simplify one of the existing programs.</p><p>The next time Jaffee checked on her he was thrilled to see the blue screen.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it working again. Oh, thank goodness. But what\u2019s all that gibberish you\u2019re typing?\u201d</p><p>It would take too long to explain. \u201cDora and I are having a little chat. When I\u2019m finished, the program will be easier for you to run.\u201d</p><p>After the last customer had left at eight-thirty, Jaffee closed the restaurant and sat down with her to go over the changes she\u2019d made.</p><p>She spent an hour helping him familiarize himself with his computer. He made copious notes on Post-its and stuck them on his wall. She had already programmed in her e-mail address so he could write to her with questions if he got into a bind, but he asked that she also give him her cell phone number just in case he couldn\u2019t get the e-mail to work.</p><p>She thought she was finished, but he handed her a stack of e-mail addresses and begged her to put those in his address book. Eli Whitaker was at the top of the list. Dave Trumbo came next. She smiled when she read his e-mail address. DangerousDealer-Dave. She added it without comment and went on to the next one.</p><p>When everything was complete, Jaffee insisted on walking her back to the motel.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not that far and we\u2019ve got streetlights, but I\u2019m going to walk with you just the same. I want to stretch my legs anyway.\u201d</p><p>It was still hot outside, but the temperature had dropped a little with the setting of the sun. When they reached the drive that led to the motel entrance, Jaffee wished her a good night and strolled on.</p><p>Jordan walked into the lobby thinking she could take a shortcut to her room. The lobby was packed with women.</p><p>Amelia Ann rushed forward to greet her at the door. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Jordan responded.</p><p>Amelia Ann\u2019s daughter, Candy, sat at the front desk. She printed Jordan\u2019s name on a pink name tag and hurried over to stick it on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re happy you can join us,\u201d Amelia Ann bubbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I joining?\u201d Jordan asked, smiling at all the women staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving Charlene a late-night bridal shower. You remember Charlene,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cShe let you photocopy your papers at the insurance agency where she works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Jordan searched through the smiling faces for Charlene\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice of you to invite me, but I don\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Amelia Ann protested. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan lowered her voice. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy to fix,\u201d Amelia Ann said. \u201cHow about giving her a place setting of china? Charlene chose a real pretty pattern. Vera Wang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be happy to\u2014\u201d Jordan began.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing. I\u2019ll order it tomorrow, and I\u2019ll add it to your bill. Candy? Go wrap another gift card and write Jordan\u2019s name on it.\u201d</p><p>Jordan met all twenty-three women and was thankful that they were wearing name tags too. For the next hour, she watched the unwrapping of the gifts while she drank sweet punch and ate mints and white cake with thick, gooey icing.</p><p>By the time she returned to her room, Jordan was on a sugar high. Then she crashed.</p><p>She slept hard that night, returned all of her phone calls the next morning, and didn\u2019t leave the motel until after ten. Her plan was to walk over to the insurance agency to copy the rest of the papers, bring them back to the motel, and then run over to Lloyd\u2019s Garage and wait there for Lloyd to finish the repairs. And he would finish them, she decided, even if she had to stand behind him and prod him with a crowbar. One thing was certain: she wasn\u2019t going to put up with any more delays or surprises.</p><p>Her plan didn\u2019t work out. Charlene gave her the bad news. \u201cThey picked up the machine and hauled it off about an hour after Steve told the salesman he wasn\u2019t going to buy it. Did you have a lot more to copy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple hundred pages,\u201d she answered</p><p>She thanked Charlene again and retraced her steps to the motel. Okay, new plan. She\u2019d get the car, check out the copy machine at the grocery store, and if that machine didn\u2019t have the capability of feeding the pages in, she\u2019d look for another one.</p><p>Lloyd was pacing in front of the garage. The second he spotted her he shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s ready. All ready to go. Early too. I told you I\u2019d fix it, and I did. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He was a nervous twit. His hand trembled when he thrust the itemized bill at her. He was obviously in a hurry to get rid of her, for he didn\u2019t even count the money she gave him.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he rushed out. \u201cYou can be on your way now.\u201d Without a backward glance, he hurried back into the garage.</p><p>She put her purse and her laptop on the passenger seat next to her and started the engine. Everything seemed to be in working order. Lloyd, she decided, ranked up there with Professor MacKenna for weirdness. She was happy she didn\u2019t have to deal with him any longer.</p><p>She drove directly to the grocery store and was elated to find a modern copy machine with all the bells and whistles. She was back in business. She thought she could have everything done in a couple of hours if she hurried. Then she\u2019d call the professor and get his boxes back to him.</p><p>Better safe than sorry, she reminded herself. To be prepared in case the car acted up on the road again, she bought water and planned to stop at a filling station to buy some antifreeze for the radiator if it sprang another leak.</p><p>She carried four gallons of water, two in each arm, out of the store. The parking lot was deserted. No wonder. No one would choose to go grocery shopping in the god-awful heat of the day. Today was already a scorcher. She squinted against the sun bouncing off the cement. She felt like she was getting sunburned just walking across the lot. She placed the containers on the ground next to the trunk of the car. While she was digging through her purse for the keys, she noticed a piece of clear plastic protruding from the seam of the trunk and thought it was odd that she hadn\u2019t noticed that before. She tried to pull it free, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>She found the key, slid it into the lock, and the lid sprang upward as she stepped back. Jordan looked inside...and froze. Then she very gently lowered the lid.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be.\u201d She shook her head in denial. She was just seeing things, that was all. Her mind was playing tricks on her. It was all that sugar she\u2019d eaten...and the heat. Yes, that was it. The heat. She\u2019d had a terrible heat stroke and just didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>She opened the lid again. She felt as though her heart had just stopped beating. There, curled up like a tabby cat inside the biggest Ziploc bag she\u2019d ever seen, was Professor MacKenna. His lifeless eyes were open, and he seemed to be staring at her. She was so stunned she couldn\u2019t breathe. She didn\u2019t know how long she stood there staring down at the man, two seconds, maybe three, but it seemed an eternity before her mind would let her body react.</p><p>Then she freaked. She dropped her purse, tripped over one of the gallons of water, and slammed the trunk lid closed. No matter how desperately she tried, she couldn\u2019t convince herself that she hadn\u2019t seen a dead body in her trunk.</p><p>What in God\u2019s name was he doing in there?</p><p>Okay, she was going to have to look again, but oh, Lord, she didn\u2019t want to. She took a deep breath, turned the key again, and mentally braced herself.</p><p>Oh, God, he was still there.</p><p>She left the key in the lock, ran to the side of the car, and all but dove through the window to get her cell phone from the front seat.</p><p>Who should she call? The Serenity Police Department? County or local? The sheriff? Or the FBI?</p><p>Jordan knew two things for certain. One, she was being set up, and two, she was in way over her head. She was a law-abiding citizen, damn it. She didn\u2019t carry dead bodies around in her trunk, and she, therefore, didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what to do with it.</p><p>She needed advice\u2014and fast. The first person she wanted to call was her father. He was a federal judge, so of course he would know what to do. But he was also a worrier, like most fathers were, and he had enough on his plate now with the explosive trial under way in Boston.</p><p>She decided to call Nick. He worked for the FBI, and he would tell her what to do.</p><p>The phone suddenly rang. The sound so startled her she let out a yelp and nearly threw the phone down.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She sounded as though she were being strangled.</p><p>Her sister was on the line. She didn\u2019t seem to notice the hysteria in Jordan\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to believe what I found. I wasn\u2019t even looking for a dress, but I ended up buying two of them. They were on sale, and I almost got one for you too, but I thought our tastes are so different you might not like it. Should I go back and buy it anyway? The sale won\u2019t last long, and I could always return it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, God, Sidney, what are you talking about? Never mind. Are you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anyone else home with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhy? Jordan, is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She wondered how Sidney would react if she told her the truth. Yes, something\u2019s wrong. There\u2019s a dead body in the trunk of my car.</p><p>Jordan couldn\u2019t tell her. If Sidney did believe her, she\u2019d only become upset, and there really wasn\u2019t anything she could do about it from Boston. Besides, as dear as her younger sister was, she could never keep a secret, and she\u2019d immediately find their mother and father and tell them. Come to think of it, she\u2019d tell anyone who\u2019d listen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to call Nick now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What about the dress? Do you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jordan disconnected the call without answering the question and quickly dialed Nick\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>Her brother didn\u2019t answer. His partner, Noah, did.</p><p>Dear God in heaven, she couldn\u2019t catch a break to save her life.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jordan. Nick can\u2019t talk right now. I\u2019ll have him call you back. You still in Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Noah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat state, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in trouble.\u201d</p><p>The panic in her voice came through the phone loud and clear. \u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d he asked quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dead body in the trunk of my car.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>Could he have been more blas\u00e9? \u201cHe\u2019s in a Ziploc bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d felt the need to add that extra bit of information, but at the moment it seemed vitally important that he know about the plastic.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s wearing blue-and-white-striped pajamas. No slippers though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, take a breath and calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down? Did you hear what I just said? Did you catch the part about the dead body in the trunk of my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard what you said,\u201d he replied, his voice maddeningly unruffled. He sounded as though her news wasn\u2019t such a big deal, which of course was ridiculous, but even so, the fact that he was so calm helped her get a grip.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor MacKenna,\u201d she said. She took a deep breath and lowered her voice. \u201cI met him at Dylan\u2019s wedding reception. I had dinner with him last night. No, that\u2019s not right. Two nights ago. I thought he was disgusting. He ate like a wild animal. It\u2019s horrible to talk about the dead like that, isn\u2019t it? Except he wasn\u2019t dead...\u201d</p><p>She realized she was rambling and stopped in mid-sentence. A minivan pulled into the lot and parked near the front door. A middle-aged woman got out, squinted at Jordan, and then went inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get rid of him. Right? I mean it\u2019s pretty obvious I\u2019m being set up for murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, where are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a grocery store parking lot in Serenity, Texas. It\u2019s so small it\u2019s barely on the map. It\u2019s about forty miles west of Bourbon, Texas. Maybe I could dump the body there. You know, find an isolated spot and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to dump the body anywhere. Here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to call it in, and so will I,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m also going to get a couple of FBI agents over there within an hour, two tops. And Phoenix isn\u2019t that far away. Nick and I will get there real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am being set up, aren\u2019t I? Oh, God, I hear sirens. They\u2019re coming for me, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, hang up now and call it in before they get there. If you\u2019re arrested, you ask for a lawyer and don\u2019t say another word. Got that?\u201d</p><p>The wailing of the siren indicated the police were just a couple of blocks away when the 911 operator answered Jordan\u2019s call. She quickly explained what the emergency was and then gave her name and location.</p><p>The operator was giving her instructions to stay where she was when a gray sedan came careening into the lot.</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff\u2019s car just pulled in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff?\u201d The operator sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s printed on the side of the car, and I\u2019m sure you can hear the siren through the phone.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan couldn\u2019t hear the operator\u2019s next question. The car screeched to a stop about twenty feet away, and a man jumped out of the passenger side of the front seat. He wasn\u2019t wearing a uniform.</p><p>He ran toward her, a chilling look on his face. She saw something flying at her and instinctively turned away trying to protect herself, but the blow caught her on her right cheek and she went down.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>THE ARGUMENT WAS OVER JURISDICTION. JORDAN HEARD raised voices and opened her eyes just as a paramedic placed an ice pack on her cheek. She tried to push it away. She was dazed and disoriented.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked in a whisper as she struggled to sit up. The cement was burning her arm.</p><p>One of the paramedics, a young man dressed in a blue uniform, took hold of her arm to help her. Still feeling light-headed, she leaned against him.</p><p>\u201cYou got hit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened. When Barry and I pulled up, the Dickey brothers were here. We heard Sheriff Randy yelling at his brother, J. D., because J. D. jumped out of the car and lit into you. He stopped yelling at him, though, when he saw me sprinting across the lot. Now he and his brother are arguing with Serenity\u2019s chief of police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they arguing about?\u201d she asked. Her head was pounding, and her jaw felt as though it had come unhinged.</p><p>\u201cJ. D. insists that you were resisting arrest and that he thought he was helping his brother out when he hit you to restrain you so Sheriff Randy could get his handcuffs on you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan grew more and more clearheaded by the second. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it isn\u2019t,\u201d he whispered so the Dickey brothers wouldn\u2019t hear him. \u201cBarry and I heard your 911 call, and we got here as quick as we could, which really wasn\u2019t any time at all because our little clinic is only three blocks away. We knew something had happened to you. One second we could hear you talking as clear as a bell, and the next second we hear what sounded like a half shout. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knocked the phone out of my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe smashed it to bits is what he did. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to buy yourself a new one. Right now they aren\u2019t arguing about your phone though. Sheriff Randy is saying that you were in his county when you took off and headed over here. You\u2019re in Grady County now,\u201d he explained. \u201cRandy Dickey is sheriff in Jessup County, and how he ended up sheriff is a mystery none of us can figure out. He must have made a lot of promises. Anyway, Sheriff Randy\u2019s jurisdiction ends at the foot of the bridge that crosses the creek. Once you get on that bridge, you\u2019re in Grady County. We have a sheriff too, but he\u2019s in Hawaii on vacation with his wife and kids, and we only see him once in a blue moon because he lives way east in Grady\u2019s county seat.\u201d</p><p>Barry, the other paramedic, had been listening to their conversation. He popped a toothpick into his mouth, parked it in the corner, and strolled over.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason Sheriff Randy comes around here is because his brother lives in Serenity. He likes to go fishing with him. Del, you ought to make her keep that ice pack on her cheek. It\u2019s already swelling under her eye. I think we need to take her to the clinic and get an X-ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. I don\u2019t need an X-ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make you go with us,\u201d Del said. \u201cIf you refuse treatment, there\u2019s nothing we can do, but if you start feeling sick to your stomach or dizzy, you tell us, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I ask you something?\u201d Del asked. \u201cWhat was it like finding a body in your car? It would have given me a heart attack. Barry and I figure you didn\u2019t have anything to do with the murder because, if you did, you sure wouldn\u2019t have called 911, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re hurting,\u201d Barry said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019ve just got a little headache, that\u2019s all, and I don\u2019t want to take anything that might dull my anger. I swear to heaven\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, it\u2019s not good to get all upset,\u201d Barry said. \u201cEspecially after taking such a hit.\u201d</p><p>Del motioned Barry closer. \u201cIf Maggie Haden could get away with it, she\u2019d hand her over to Sheriff Randy and his brother in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Barry agreed. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t lose any sleep over it either,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Maggie Haden?\u201d Jordan asked. She was trying to see what was going on with the chief and the Dickey brothers, but the paramedics were blocking her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her there. She\u2019s the chief of police,\u201d Del answered. \u201cThe chief and Sheriff Randy have a history. You know what I\u2019m talking about? Everyone in town knows he got her the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have gotten the job,\u201d Barry grumbled. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t qualified. Just because she was on the police force over in Bourbon doesn\u2019t mean she should be the chief here in Serenity. But since nothing much ever happens here, I guess people don\u2019t care if she knows what she\u2019s doing or not.\u201d He shifted the toothpick to the other side of his mouth and squatted down in front of Jordan. \u201cIt\u2019s payback,\u201d he whispered. \u201cShe wanted the job, and Randy owed her since he got married to someone else and left her high and dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been chief of police?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout a year,\u201d Del said.</p><p>\u201cMore like two years,\u201d Barry offered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the way she looks color your judgment. She\u2019s a lot tougher than you\u2019d think. She can be a real viper.\u201d</p><p>Jordan leaned around Del to get a look. The chief had brassy, bleached blond hair and wore enough makeup to work in a circus.</p><p>\u201cGetting the job of chief of police is a big deal around here. Serenity is kind of behind the times. The police station only just got a computer, and all the 9ll calls are routed through Bourbon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better now,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m tired of sitting on the ground and being a bystander. Please let me get up.\u201d</p><p>Barry lifted her but didn\u2019t let go of her. He insisted that she sit on the back bumper of the ambulance. \u201cYou lean on me if you feel dizzy.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, she wasn\u2019t at all dizzy, but her throbbing cheek reminded her that one of those brothers had punched her. Seething now, she was about to ask the paramedics which one was J. D. when Barry said, \u201cListen, if the chief does decide to hand you over, I\u2019ll say we\u2019re taking you to the clinic for an X-ray. I\u2019m telling you right now, you don\u2019t want to go anywhere with those brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re being very kind to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate it. I know it looks suspicious. I\u2019m a stranger in town...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s that body in your car,\u201d Del reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am innocent. I didn\u2019t kill anyone, and I assure you no one was more surprised than I was when I opened that trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet. My name\u2019s Del, by the way. And he\u2019s Barry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Jordan Buchanan and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know who you are. The chief already got your driver\u2019s license from your wallet,\u201d Barry said. \u201cShe read your name out loud. You don\u2019t remember? Del, maybe we should go ahead and get her head X-rayed.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been aware that anyone had gone through her purse to get her identification. Had she been knocked unconscious? Maybe she\u2019d just been knocked senseless. That\u2019s what her mother used to ask her when she\u2019d done something she didn\u2019t approve of. Did you get knocked senseless?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an X-ray,\u201d she said for the second time. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking guilty and being guilty are two different things,\u201d Del said. He pulled the stethoscope from around his neck and handed it to Barry.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to be okay,\u201d Barry whispered as he folded the stethoscope and put it in the metal case before snapping it shut. \u201cThe chief knows that you weren\u2019t over in Jessup County, and she also knows you weren\u2019t involved in any car chase. There\u2019s a witness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that witness is going to make it real hard for her to hand you over to the Dickeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still might,\u201d Del said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she can\u2019t,\u201d Barry argued. \u201cNot with the witness. A woman coming out of the grocery store saw the whole thing. She also called 911, and she told the operator what she saw and how J. D. punched Miss Buchanan without any provocation. She said J. D. hopped out of the car like he had a swarm of wasps on his tail and grabbed her phone and punched her silly. Then he smashed her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Buchanan better hope that J. D. doesn\u2019t get to the witness and scare the wits out of her so she\u2019ll change her story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter. Every emergency call is taped, so there\u2019s a record, and J. D. can\u2019t change what\u2019s already on the tape.\u201d</p><p>The two men were talking about Jordan as though she weren\u2019t even there. She was astonished that no one was doing anything about the body. She\u2019d seen the chief of police glance into the trunk, but that was all. As far as Jordan knew, no one else had even looked. The paramedics certainly hadn\u2019t. No one seemed interested in finding out who the victim was. She wondered when they were going to get around to that question.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019ll be taking the body to Bourbon?\u201d Del asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet so. We\u2019ll have to stick around until the crime scene people get here and the coroner releases the body.\u201d</p><p>Weary of being on the sidelines, Jordan thanked the paramedics once again, and then walked closer to the chief and waited for her to acknowledge her.</p><p>One of the Dickey brothers noticed Jordan\u2019s hands were free.</p><p>\u201cSomeone ought to put that suspect in handcuffs,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone who ought to know her job by now,\u201d he added.</p><p>Jordan stepped forward. \u201cAre you the one who hit me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look her in the eye when he answered her. \u201cNo one hit you,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Randy, look at her face. Someone sure as hell hit her,\u201d Maggie Haden yelled. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a witness.\u201d Because the sheriff looked so surprised, she added with a nod, \u201cYes there is. A witness who saw your brother slap the cell phone out of this woman\u2019s hand and then hit her with his fist.\u201d Lowering her voice, she said, \u201cSo you can see nothing can be done or changed now. It\u2019s too late. There could be a potential lawsuit over this.\u201d</p><p>J. D. had been slouching against the hood of the sheriff\u2019s car and shouting his jabs at the police chief, but when he heard about a witness, he lunged forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat witness? Who saw what? If I\u2019m going to be accused of something I didn\u2019t do, I should get to know this witness\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn good time, J. D.,\u201d the chief said.</p><p>\u201cChief Haden, I want to press charges,\u201d Jordan demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou be quiet,\u201d Haden snapped.</p><p>\u201cI want you to arrest him,\u201d Jordan insisted.</p><p>The chief shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you want. Now keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>J. D. nodded his approval and then said, \u201cRandy, doesn\u2019t it seem curious to you that the chief is ranting about a little rough treatment subduing a violent suspect, and that suspect murdered a man. You can\u2019t argue with that. The evidence is right there for anyone to see. The body ain\u2019t in my car or yours, Randy. It\u2019s in her car. And since when do we care about manhandling a murderer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Dickey brothers were two of the most unattractive individuals Jordan had ever encountered. They were both built like used-up wrestlers who\u2019d let their muscles go to flab. Their necks were thick, their shoulders round. J. D. was taller than his brother, but not much. Randy carried quite a paunch, and his face was elongated by a double chin. Both men had small eyes, but J. D.\u2019s were set close like a ferret\u2019s.</p><p>The chief of police finally turned her attention to Jordan.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Chief Haden,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>Since she was holding Jordan\u2019s driver\u2019s license in her hand, the chief knew exactly who she was, but if she wanted to go through the formalities, Jordan wouldn\u2019t argue. She told her her name and gave her address.</p> <p>\u201cI want some questions answered right here and now. Do you know who the man in the trunk of this car is?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe deceased. Do you know his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jordan answered. \u201cHis name is Professor Horace Athens MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jordan quickly explained where and how she\u2019d met the professor and why she was in Serenity. Chief Haden didn\u2019t look like she believed a word Jordan was saying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be coming with me to the police station,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot more explaining to do. We\u2019ll wait here until the coroner arrives, so don\u2019t give me any trouble or I\u2019ll cuff you right now.\u201d</p> <p>Without a word, Sheriff Randy and his brother walked back to their car. J. D. had a disgusting smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cChief Haden, may I ask you a question?\u201d Jordan asked. She was still seething with anger, but she kept calm. Pleasant was too much to ask for.</p><p>\u201cMake it quick.\u201d The chief\u2019s tone was snippy.</p><p>\u201cHow did the sheriff know there was a body in the trunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said his brother got a tip on his cell phone. I can\u2019t say if he\u2019s telling the truth or not.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Randy ignored the comment. His brother didn\u2019t. Whirling around, he shouted, \u201cDid you just call me a liar?\u201d</p> <p>When the chief didn\u2019t answer, J. D. said, \u201cAre you going to take the word of a murderer over a law-abiding citizen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI can check the sheriff\u2019s cell phone records and get a printout of all the calls both of the brothers received in the past twenty-four hours. That will be helpful, won\u2019t it, Chief Haden?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>J. D. snorted. \u201cYeah, right. As if the FBI would go to that kind of trouble for a homicide in this nickel-ass town. They won\u2019t give you the time of day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already called them, and they\u2019re on their way here,\u201d Jordan responded.</p><p>She\u2019d certainly gotten everyone\u2019s attention with that statement.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you call the FBI?\u201d the chief demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy brother Nick is an FBI agent. I talked to his partner and he assured me that he and Nick would be here shortly, but in the meantime, he\u2019s sending over a couple of agents from the area\u2019s district field office.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Randy didn\u2019t seem to be fazed hearing the FBI was going to get involved. J. D., on the other hand, looked startled and angry.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s bluffing.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Randy continued on to his car. \u201cHold on there,\u201d J. D. called out. \u201cMy brother has the right to question her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jordan said. J. D.\u2019s eyes bored into her. She didn\u2019t flinch. She knew he was trying to frighten her, but she wasn\u2019t about to shrivel up or cower. Then he took a threatening step toward her. Bring it on, she thought. He\u2019d caught her unaware with the first punch, but she wasn\u2019t about to let that happen again. This time she would be ready for him.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, are you gonna let the FBI come in here and tell you what to do?\u201d J. D. whined. \u201cAfter all Randy and I have done for you? You wouldn\u2019t be such a hot shot chief of police if it weren\u2019t for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haden cut him off. \u201cListen here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not letting anyone tell me what to do. Randy?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff turned back. \u201cWhat, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing all the way over here anyway? And how come you\u2019re out of uniform?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to take the day off,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t you see the fishing poles in my car? I came over to go fishing with my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always drive your pickup when you go fishing,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t today, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to get snide with me. You ought to get on with fishing and let me do my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the FBI...\u201d J. D. began.</p><p>Jordan deliberately interrupted. \u201cI hope your police station is large enough to accommodate my family. I\u2019m certain by now all of my brothers have heard and are on their way. And I\u2019ve got a lot of brothers. Funny thing is, most of them are in law enforcement. Theo, my oldest brother,\u201d she said, her tone annoyingly cheerful, \u201che doesn\u2019t like to boast, but he\u2019s pretty high up in the Justice Department.\u201d She stared at J. D.\u2019s ugly face as she added, \u201cThe United States Justice Department. Alec is working undercover for the FBI now, but he\u2019ll want to come here too. Oh, and then there\u2019s Dylan. He\u2019s a chief of police himself,\u201d she continued. \u201cI imagine he\u2019ll want to have a little chat with Sheriff Randy and J. D. You see, none of them is going to believe that nonsense about a car chase, and like me, they\u2019re going to wonder who\u2019s lying and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d J. D. snarled.</p><p>\u201cGet in the car, J. D.,\u201d his brother said. \u201cMaggie, I want to talk to you in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay right where you are,\u201d the chief said to Jordan. \u201cBoys, you keep a watch on her,\u201d she called out to the paramedics as she hurried toward the sheriff.</p><p>Jordan watched the two in conversation from where she stood. The chief got as close to the sheriff as she could and nodded several times, obviously agreeing to whatever he was telling her. Not good, Jordan thought. Not good at all.</p><p>A couple of minutes passed and then finally the Dickey brothers got in their car and took off.</p><p>Chief Haden looked disgusted. \u201cI\u2019m going to find out what\u2019s going on here. What\u2019d you do to provoke the sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Jordan countered.</p><p>As though Jordan hadn\u2019t spoken, she continued, \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me why the sheriff wanted to take you with him for questioning. What is it he knows about you?\u201d</p><p>Before Jordan could tell her that she didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what was in either of the Dickey brothers\u2019 twisted minds and she wasn\u2019t about to start guessing, the coroner, wearing sunglasses and a Dallas Cowboys cap, pulled into the lot in a powder pink convertible.</p><p>Del took hold of Jordan\u2019s arm. \u201cCome on back to the ambulance and wait with us.\u201d</p><p>Jordan went with the paramedic, but she kept her eye on Chief Haden, who was next to the rental car conversing with the coroner. When she was ready to leave, she shoved Jordan into the backseat of her squad car but didn\u2019t bother handcuffing her. They drove to the corner and stopped. Haden called her deputy and left a message with his wife to find him and tell him to report to the police station as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cTell Joe I\u2019ve got a murder investigation.\u201d</p><p>Jordan inwardly cringed over the glee she heard in the woman\u2019s voice. The chief gunned the engine and roared through town with her siren blasting away.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>THE POLICE STATION WAS EXTREMELY SMALL. JORDAN THOUGHT it looked like an old western movie set. There were two desks with a waist-high wooden railing between them and a swinging gate to the inner sanctum with a tiny office the size of a toll booth at the back for the sheriff. A door on the left led to a hallway with a bathroom and a single jail cell.</p><p>There was only one other person in the station, a young woman sitting in front of a computer, crying. When the chief and Jordan walked in, she dabbed at her eyes with the cuff of her shirt-sleeve and lowered her head. Jordan heard the chief curse under her breath.</p><p>\u201cStill having trouble, Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know. You\u2019ve done nothing but complain since you took this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take this job,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt was forced on me. And I haven\u2019t complained all that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me in front of a suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I a suspect?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>She expected the chief to tell her that of course she was a suspect. The body was in her car, after all. Then the chief would read her her rights, and she\u2019d ask for an attorney.</p><p>None of that happened.</p><p>\u201cAre you a suspect?\u201d the chief repeated. She cocked her head and frowned as though she couldn\u2019t make up her mind. \u201cI\u2019ll determine that after I question you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan thought she was kidding, but the look on her face indicated she was, in fact, serious. Did she think that Jordan would willingly answer all of her questions and incriminate herself so that she could be arrested? Surreal, she thought. This was simply surreal.</p><p>The cell was real enough. It was tucked around the corner from the front office.</p><p>The chief led Jordan into the tiny room and then stepped out and closed the door. \u201cI\u2019m locking you in here so I\u2019ll know you won\u2019t be running away while I go back to talk to the crime scene people. I\u2019m taking the key too,\u201d Haden added, \u201cjust in case someone comes along and wants to let you out.\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t say a word. She couldn\u2019t. She was speechless. She needed to calm down and collect her thoughts, so she sat on the cot and placed her hands on her knees, palms up, her back straight, her focus on the stone wall across from her. After a few minutes she closed her eyes and tried to remember some of her yoga exercises to gain what her instructor had told her was inner peace. Okay, so inner peace was out of the question, but if she could get her heartbeat to stop racing and her breathing to slow down, then maybe she would be able to stop freaking out inside.</p><p>Two full hours, and then some, passed before the chief came back to the station. She opened the cell and dragged a straight-back chair in with her. Jordan could hear the chief\u2019s assistant muttering in the other room, but she couldn\u2019t make out what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cIs your assistant crying?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>The chief stiffened. \u201cOf course not. That wouldn\u2019t be professional.\u201d</p><p>They both heard a sob.</p><p>\u201cMy mistake,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be taping this interview,\u201d Haden announced as she produced a small recorder and laid it on the cot.</p><p>The chief of police was incredibly inept. Jordan wanted to ask her if she had ever investigated a homicide before, but that question would only make her angry, especially if Jordan pointed out that she hadn\u2019t been read her rights.</p><p>\u201cI have questions to ask. Are you ready to give me some honest answers?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for Jordan to respond. \u201cYou can start by telling me how you could be driving a car and not know there was a dead body in it.\u201d</p><p>Her accusatory tone didn\u2019t sit well with Jordan. \u201cI told you, I picked the car up at the garage and didn\u2019t look in the trunk until I was at the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this friend of yours, this Professor MacKenna, he meets with you one day and is found murdered two days later\u2014and you have no idea how that happened, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should have an attorney present if you\u2019re going to continue with these questions,\u201d Jordan said politely.</p><p>Chief Haden pretended she hadn\u2019t heard her.</p><p>Two can play this game, Jordan decided, and she pretended she didn\u2019t understand a single question she was asked from that point on.</p><p>Eventually the chief stopped in frustration. \u201cI thought we could have a friendly conversation,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jordan tilted her head and studied the woman. \u201cYou\u2019ve locked me in a cell and you\u2019re taping every word I say. That doesn\u2019t seem very friendly to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listen here. You aren\u2019t going to be able to intimidate me like you did the Dickey brothers with your talk about the FBI and the Justice Department. You can get yourself an attorney when I say you can, and you might as well know that, because you aren\u2019t cooperating, you are now making yourself a suspect in this murder investigation.\u201d</p><p>She turned off the tape machine and finally got around to reading Jordan her rights. Then she dragged the chair out and slammed the cell door shut.</p><p>She poked her head around the corner an hour later and said, \u201cHere\u2019s a phone book. You can look through it and pick out your own attorney. You can even get one from back east if that\u2019s what you want, but you\u2019re going to sit in this cell until you answer my questions. I don\u2019t care how long it takes.\u201d She handed the book through the bars and said, \u201cLet me know when you want to make your call.\u201d</p><p>Could she be railroaded and charged with murder? If only Jordan had the approximate time the professor was killed, she would be able to figure out where she was and if anyone had seen her. She hoped he hadn\u2019t been murdered during the night because she couldn\u2019t prove she had stayed in her motel room. They could say that she jogged over to the professor\u2019s house, killed him, but then how did she get the professor\u2019s body into the trunk of her car, which was locked inside of Lloyd\u2019s Garage? What was her motive? Would they make one up?</p><p>This was going nowhere. She didn\u2019t have enough information to form any kind of a defense...or alibi. She didn\u2019t even know how the professor had been murdered. She\u2019d been too stunned to take a good look at him all wrapped up like leftovers.</p><p>She was completely out of her element...or out of her comfort zone as Noah would say. This was really all his fault, she decided, because he\u2019d pointed out to her how dull her life was. She\u2019d been perfectly happy not knowing she was boring. Now she felt powerless. In order to survive, the body needed water and food, but Jordan needed a computer and a cell phone too. Without all of her tech gadgets she was lost.</p><p>Jordan hated feeling out of control. When she got out of here...if she got out...she\u2019d take a couple of years and go to law school. She wouldn\u2019t feel so vulnerable if she knew the law, now, would she?</p><p>The chief interrupted her pity party. \u201cAre you going to make the call to an attorney or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to wait for my brother.\u201d</p><p>The chief snorted. \u201cAre you going to hold to that story? You\u2019re just stalling is all. You\u2019ll change your mind soon enough because you\u2019re not going to get anything to drink or eat until you start cooperating. I don\u2019t care how long it takes. I\u2019ll starve you to death if I have to,\u201d she threatened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that legal?\u201d Jordan asked sweetly.</p><p>Haden had a real mean streak in her. She poked herself in the chest as she said, \u201cI can do anything I want in this town. Understand? I\u2019m not as soft as I look.\u201d</p><p>Jordan couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cNo one could ever think you looked soft.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d gotten a rise out of the chief. Her face colored. \u201cI wonder how much sass you would have if I decided to turn you over to the Dickey brothers.\u201d</p> <p>She pointed her finger at Jordan and was about to threaten something more when she was interrupted by Carrie.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to call me Chief Haden,\u201d she bellowed.</p><p>\u201cChief Haden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is my investigation,\u201d Chief Haden said. \u201cThe FBI has no place here.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Noah had entered the police station expecting to deal with a competent law enforcement professional. They were mistaken. And neither of them was in the mood to put up with foolish territorial issues.</p><p>\u201cHe asked you a question,\u201d Noah barked. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever you mind where she is,\u201d Haden countered. \u201cLike I just told you, this is my investigation. You and your friend need to get out of my police station.\u201d</p><p>Nick had already told her that Jordan was his sister, and he\u2019d shown her his identification and credentials. Now it was her turn. She damn well was going to answer his questions.</p><p>Chief Haden would have taken a step back to get away from his anger, but the railing was behind her, trapping her. She knew she had started out on the wrong foot, but she wasn\u2019t about to back down. The sooner the two of them realized who was in charge, the better.</p><p>The man who identified himself as Agent Nick Buchanan was intimidating and fierce, but he wasn\u2019t nearly as frightening to her as the agent who walked in with him. There was something in his piercing blue eyes that told her not to get in his way. She knew it wouldn\u2019t take much to get him to pounce, and she didn\u2019t want to be the one he pounced on. Her only option was to strike first.</p><p>Nick was about to lose his temper when the young woman sitting in front of a blank computer screen piped up, \u201cYour sister is sitting in a cell just around the corner. She\u2019s doing okay, but wait until you see her.\u201d She was winding a strand of her long curly hair around one finger and smiling up at Noah when she shared the information.</p><p>\u201cMy sister is locked in a cell?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the chief answered after flashing a glare at her assistant.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the charges?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not willing to share that information just yet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to be seeing your sister or speaking to her until I\u2019m finished with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, did she just say, until she\u2019s finished with her?\u201d Noah asked. He sounded amused.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t take his gaze off the chief when he answered. \u201cThat\u2019s what she said.\u201d</p><p>The chief\u2019s lower lip jutted out, and her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any jurisdiction here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chief thinks she can mess with the federal government,\u201d Noah remarked.</p><p>Haden was furious. The two agents were pressing in on her. She pushed through the swinging gate and stood alone near the doorway, blocking access to the cell.</p><p>The FBI agents were arrogant thugs, she thought, smart-mouthing her. The two of them were so full of themselves and so cocky the way they tried to throw their weight around. But they didn\u2019t know who they were dealing with. The fact that a woman had risen to the position of chief of police in Serenity, Texas, should have been an indication to them that she wasn\u2019t a powder puff. Even though Serenity was a bit-of-nothing town, she had had to work hard screwing others, both figuratively and literally, to get where she was. Two muscle men carrying badges and guns had rattled her for a few minutes, but she was back in control now, and they weren\u2019t going to tell her what to do. Screw them. This was her town and her rules. She was the power here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you can do. You can leave your phone number with my assistant, and when I\u2019ve finished interrogating my suspect, I\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d She addressed Nick. \u201cNow go on and get out of my police station and let me get back to work.\u201d</p><p>The suspect\u2019s brother smiled at her. She thought he might start laughing. The possibility didn\u2019t sit well.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we gonna do about this situation?\u201d Nick wanted to know.</p><p>Haden\u2019s bravado ended abruptly. Noah started walking toward her. She stepped out of his way. If she hadn\u2019t moved, he would have walked over her or through her. He didn\u2019t leave any doubt about that.</p><p>Noah glanced over his shoulder at Nick and grinned.</p><p>Nick conceded, \u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019ve still got it.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cit\u201d was spook tactics. Noah had always been able to freeze anyone, male or female, with one hard look. Nick, on the other hand, according to Noah, had still not perfected the art.</p><p>\u201cYou can get the key from her,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cYou listen here. I\u2019m not letting that woman out until she starts cooperating.\u201d Haden\u2019s voice was loud and surly.</p><p>On the other side of the wall Jordan patiently waited for someone to come and get her. She knew that Nick and Noah had arrived because she could hear the chief of police arguing. When she saw Noah, her shoulders sagged with relief. She was so happy to see him.</p><p>He was appalled by the sight of her. \u201cWhat happened to you? You look godawful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s lovely to see you too.\u201d</p><p>Noah ignored her sarcasm. Given the circumstances most women would have been a little upset, he thought, but Jordan wasn\u2019t like most. As miserable as she looked, she could still give him attitude. He had to admire her spunk.</p><p>He leaned against the steel bars and smiled at her. \u201cYou want out of here?\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, she replied, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what. You tell me what happened to that pretty face of yours, and I\u2019ll let you out.\u201d</p><p>She gingerly touched her cheek and winced. \u201cA fist ran into it,\u201d she said. \u201cIs Nick still out there? I don\u2019t hear him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine you could hear anything over that woman\u2019s screeching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here so quickly? I thought you were going to send some agents from the district.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was able to charter a small plane, so I didn\u2019t need to call them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick willingly got into a small plane? It takes a lot of coaxing to get him into a commercial jumbo jet. I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d fly in a small one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say willingly, did I? I had to do some pushing and shoving.\u201d</p><p>She was impressed. \u201cDid he get sick?\u201d she asked, smiling over the possibility. It was comical to see him turn green.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he did.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re both here,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou should be.\u201d</p><p>His arrogance didn\u2019t bother her so much today. She heard the chief\u2019s raised voice again and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. Your brother\u2019s just having a little chat with the chief of police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChief Haden\u2019s a real softie, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s about as soft as a rattlesnake,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to give my home state a bad name, but don\u2019t you worry about her. Nick can handle her.\u201d</p><p>Jordan stood and tried to brush the wrinkles out of her blouse. \u201cDo you think you could find the key and get me out of this cell?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cSure enough,\u201d he agreed. \u201cJust as soon as you tell me whose fist ran into your face.\u201d</p><p>At that moment Haden stormed around the corner, a sour look on her face, the key in her hand. She unlocked the cell door, muttered something under her breath that Jordan pretended not to hear, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been...suggested that we sit down and talk this out. You know...get to the bottom of this mystery.\u201d</p><p>Nick was standing in the doorway. Jordan\u2019s hair had fallen forward, partially covering her face, but when she brushed it back over her shoulder, he got a good look at her injury.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat son of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said quickly before he could finish his obscenity. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201d</p><p>His eyes blazed with anger as he addressed the chief. \u201cAre you responsible for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not responsible,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even there when the alleged incident occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlleged?\u201d Noah spun around to confront Haden.</p><p>\u201cJordan, who hit you?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>The chief swung the door open as Nick posed the question. The woman wouldn\u2019t move out of Jordan\u2019s way, so Noah stepped forward, took hold of Jordan\u2019s arm, and pulled her toward him.</p><p>\u201cJordan, answer me,\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>\u201cHis name is J. D. Dickey. I don\u2019t know what the J and the D stand for. His brother Randy is the sheriff of Jessup County. The two of them were together in Sheriff Randy\u2019s car. We\u2019re in Grady County now,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t the guy who assaulted you arrested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to press charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you tried?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean I tried. She wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d rendered her brother and Noah speechless. They\u2019d never encountered such incompetence.</p><p>They all filed into the outer office. Since there weren\u2019t enough chairs to go around or the space to put them in, they ended up standing in a cluster near the assistant\u2019s desk. Jordan noticed that Carrie was trying\u2014without much success\u2014to get Noah\u2019s attention.</p><p>Maggie Haden made her way around the group to her office and sat on the edge of her desk tapping her foot impatiently while she listened to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him in here,\u201d Noah promised.</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly were you arrested?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cThree or four blocks from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was never arrested,\u201d Haden called out.</p><p>\u201cThen why was I locked in a cell? Remember what you told me? You weren\u2019t going to give me anything to drink or eat until I answered your questions. You also said that you didn\u2019t care if I starved to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Carrie had been quietly content to stare up at Noah until she heard what the chief said. Her head snapped up, and for a second she stopped twirling her hair.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. I heard you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was bluffing,\u201d the chief said.</p><p>\u201cBluffing?\u201d Noah questioned. \u201cDon\u2019t we call that lying to a federal agent and obstructing justice, Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we call it,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou want to arrest her or should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow hold on.\u201d Haden\u2019s voice had risen an octave. \u201cYour sister wouldn\u2019t cooperate. I had to lock her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, is that true?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question,\u201d he demanded impatiently.</p><p>Nick was behaving more like a big brother than an FBI agent now, but she was still too thankful and happy that he was there to be bothered by his high-handed attitude.</p><p>\u201cI requested an attorney,\u201d she began, \u201cand I also informed Chief Haden that I had called you. She then informed me that I wasn\u2019t a suspect but that she was going to interrogate me with her tape recorder on, and when I wouldn\u2019t answer her accusatory questions without an attorney, she changed her mind and decided I was a suspect after all.\u201d</p><p>Turning to the sour-faced woman, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t remember. Was that before or after you threatened to hand me over to the Dickey brothers?\u201d</p><p>All turned to stare at the chief, waiting for her explanation.</p><p>Haden\u2019s chest heaved as she took a deep breath. \u201cI did not threaten any such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d Carrie volunteered. \u201cYou said\u2014\u201d</p><p>The chief cut her off with a scorching glare. \u201cPut a cork in it, Carrie, and get back to that computer. You\u2019re on work release, not a vacation.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s face turned bright red. She lowered her head and stared at the keyboard. Jordan could see that she was embarrassed that Nick and Noah had heard what the chief said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t work the computer. The stupid thing\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>Jordan felt sorry for her and wondered which would be worse, working for the chief from hell or going back to prison to serve out the rest of her sentence.</p><p>Carrie sounded pitiful. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>As galling as it was to inadvertently help the chief of police, Jordan couldn\u2019t stop herself from helping Carrie. With a sigh, she reached around Carrie, hit two buttons, waited half a second, then hit a couple of keys, and the computer screen lit up.</p><p>Carrie looked like she had just witnessed a miracle. Wide-eyed, she stared at Jordan and whispered, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>As Jordan explained, Nick argued with the chief about jurisdiction. The chief liked the word and used it as an answer no matter what question was asked.</p><p>\u201cHas the coroner given you an approximate time of death for the victim?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is my jurisdiction and therefore my case. You don\u2019t need to be butting your nose in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you brought J. D. Dickey and his brother in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat business do you have with the sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat business did he have in Grady County?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my jurisdiction,\u201d Haden huffed.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to arrest J. D. Dickey?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Haden\u2019s cell phone rang. She turned her back on the agents and stepped around her desk.</p><p>She covered her mouth. \u201cI know who it is,\u201d she snapped under her breath. \u201cYou listen here. They\u2019re pressuring me to arrest you.\u201d Several seconds passed, and then Haden said, \u201cFor socking the woman.

I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She disconnected the call and tossed the cell phone onto her desk. Nick waited until she turned around before he asked the obvious.</p><p>\u201cWere you just talking to J. D. Dickey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t bring him in, we will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is my jurisdiction.\u201d</p><p>Nick asked her again if the coroner had given an approximate time of death for Professor MacKenna.</p><p>\u201cI already answered the question. This is my jurisdiction and my case.\u201d She folded her arms and began tapping her foot. \u201cI want you to get out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not going away,\u201d Noah interjected.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the cause of death?\u201d Nick asked.</p> <p>\u201cMy jurisdiction,\u201d she repeated, dragging the word out.</p><p>And so it went. No matter what question was asked, jurisdiction was her answer.</p><p>Jordan felt as though she were watching a tennis match, her gaze bouncing back and forth between her brother and the chief.</p><p>Carrie touched her arm to get her attention. \u201cHow come I can\u2019t get the printer to print?\u201d</p><p>Jordan leaned over the desk and said, \u201cYour printer isn\u2019t hooked up to the computer.\u201d Her attention returned to the ongoing argument.</p><p>Carrie distracted her again. \u201cCan you fix it?\u201d she pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cYes, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found the manual for the computer,\u201d she whispered. She was keeping her eye on the chief now, making sure she wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t read it. I told her I had but...you know. I got busy doing other stuff. I guess I should read it, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea,\u201d Jordan said. She walked around the desk and began hooking up the cable while Carrie continued to whisper.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s really good-looking, but he\u2019s got that wedding ring on. It is a wedding ring, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jordan smiled. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs his wife alive? I mean, some guys keep on wearing their wedding rings for years after their wives die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, his wife is alive, and yes, they\u2019re happily married. In fact, he and Laurant are expecting their second child in three months.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s voice dropped lower. \u201cJaffee\u2019s really nice-looking too. I mean, he\u2019s losing his hair and all, but that makes him kind of sexy. I was walking past his restaurant on my break yesterday, and he and his friends were standing there talking to you. That rich rancher...you know who I mean...his name\u2019s Whitaker...now, he\u2019s really hot. He\u2019s on the lean side, but I can tell he\u2019s got muscles, and I like muscles. I bet he works out, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Jordan didn\u2019t answer, but Carrie didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cThat one there though\u201d\u2014she nodded in Noah\u2019s direction\u2014\u201che\u2019s got to be the sexiest man I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Was there any man Carrie didn\u2019t find appealing? Just how long had she been in prison? Jordan hoped the discussion had ended, but Carrie wasn\u2019t going to let it go.</p><p>\u201cI mean...don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is sexy,\u201d Jordan replied.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Jordan happened to glance up at Noah and realized he\u2019d been watching her. Had he heard the conversation? She hoped not.</p><p>The chief was drawn away by another phone call, and Jordan seized the opportunity.</p><p>\u201cNick, what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for your attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met him, but he comes highly recommended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor Morganstern called him,\u201d Noah told her.</p><p>Startled, she gasped and her hand went to her throat. \u201cYou told Doctor Morganstern about this? Why did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Morganstern was a brilliant man, and his opinion mattered to her. She didn\u2019t want him to think less of her, or to think that she was somehow responsible for this mess.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have bothered the doctor. He\u2019s a busy man.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cWe work for him, remember? We can\u2019t just take off without letting him know where we\u2019re going. We had to tell him what we were doing and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that bother you?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI just told you why. He\u2019s a very busy man,\u201d she said as she walked over to Noah and sat on the edge of the desk next to him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter to me. I just didn\u2019t want you to bother him. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He nudged her. \u201cYeah, it does bother you.\u201d He leaned over and whispered, \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill the guy, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I didn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cThen you have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to the chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t your problem any longer.\u201d</p><p>Before she could ask him to explain, Nick\u2019s cell phone rang. He glanced at the number and told Noah, \u201cChaddick\u2019s calling back.\u201d</p><p>He flipped the phone open and said, \u201cWhat have you got?\u201d</p><p>Jordan tapped Noah\u2019s arm. \u201cWho\u2019s Chaddick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn FBI agent making some calls for us and checking some things out. He\u2019ll come in on this if we need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it,\u201d Nick said into his phone. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll meet you there. I\u2019ll give you a call when I\u2019m leaving Serenity. You\u2019re going to set it up? That\u2019s great. Thanks again.\u201d</p><p>Jordan and Noah looked at him expectantly when he ended the call.</p><p>\u201cStrangulation,\u201d Nick said without preamble.</p><p>\u201cSo it was up close and personal,\u201d Noah remarked.</p><p>\u201cA crime of passion,\u201d Nick said. \u201cRope was used. Chaddick said some fibers were found imbedded in the skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes a lot of strength to strangle someone. I doubt Jordan has that kind of strength. Even coming up behind him, even with the element of surprise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t strangle anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you notice his neck?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see any bruising or discoloration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you wearing your contacts? Could you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was wearing my contacts. I could see just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how could you have missed\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, her irritation growing, \u201cI was too busy noticing he was wrapped up like a sandwich. Oh, God, I\u2019ll never eat anything from a Ziploc bag again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, get a grip,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to get all emotional. I know this is upsetting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpsetting?\u201d She pushed off the desk and took a step toward him. \u201cThe way I feel goes way past upset.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand up. \u201cCalm down. I\u2019m just trying to get as much information as possible before your attorney gets here. I wish your powers of observation\u2014\u201d</p><p>She took another step in his direction. \u201cYou know what I wish? I wish I\u2019d called Theo.\u201d</p><p>Noah grabbed hold of Jordan\u2019s arm and pulled her back. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t call Theo. You called Nick. Take a deep breath, okay?\u201d</p><p>He made her sit back on the desk. \u201cWhat do you suggest we do about her?\u201d he asked, motioning to the chief of police. The woman was pacing in her tiny office while she talked on the phone. \u201cI think we should lock her up and throw away the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d Carrie whispered her name.</p><p>\u201cYes, Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t get mad at your brother. I wish I had a brother who could have helped me when I got into trouble. I do have a brother,\u201d she explained earnestly. \u201cHe drove the getaway car. He didn\u2019t get away though. They caught him too.\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t know what to say and so she simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cSince you helped me with this stupid computer, I want to help you. Did you know that Maggie...I mean Chief Haden...used to live with Sheriff Randy Dickey? Everyone in town thought they would get married. She thought so too, but he married someone else. And you know what else I heard? Sheriff Randy had a connection through his new wife with one of the town council people, and he got them to give the chief of police job to Maggie so she\u2019d have to move over here to Serenity. I also heard she was going to get fired from her old job anyway.\u201d She placed her hand to the side of her mouth as though to share a secret and spoke just above a whisper. \u201cShe was mean back then too, and she did a lot of favors for the Dickey brothers.\u201d She gave a wink and went on. \u201cShe let them get away with a lot of stuff. At least that\u2019s what I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her deputy? What\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s nothing like her. He should have gotten the job of chief of police. He has a lot more experience, and he\u2019s worked here longer. I heard he\u2019s looking for a job outside of Serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that. It would be pretty awful working for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could find him for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could. Deputy Davis is kind of hardnosed about stuff, but he\u2019s honest, and as far as I know, the only person he\u2019s sleeping with is his wife. He treats me like a real person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like Carrie to get on the phone and help you find the deputy?\u201d Jordan asked Noah.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be real nice,\u201d Noah said, smiling at the young woman.</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t move. She just sat there staring at Noah as though she was in a daze. Jordan tapped her on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe said that would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be nice if you would find Deputy Davis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...okay.\u201d Without looking, Carrie picked up the receiver on the other side of the desk and put it to her ear. The cord was too short to reach, so the phone came flying across, knocking a can of soda and a large stack of files to the floor.</p><p>\u201cShoot!\u201d she cried as she jumped up and rounded the desk to clean up the mess. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid.\u201d</p><p>Noah leaned down to help her. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Accidents happen to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially me,\u201d she said. She grabbed the Kleenex box off the desk and wiped up the spilled drink. \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed. I must look like a lobster. I can feel my face turning red.\u201d</p><p>Noah straightened a pile of folders and handed them to her. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very pretty face.\u201d</p><p>When he took her arm to help her stand up, the rosy blush on Carrie\u2019s cheeks turned a deep crimson. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you could find the list of town council members?\u201d Nick asked her from across the room.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s attention swung to him. \u201cI know I could. They\u2019re in my Rolodex. There\u2019s only three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get them in here,\u201d Nick said to Noah. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to officially replace her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re replacing Chief Haden?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>The chief had just finished her call, and there was a smug look on her face until she heard a snippet of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s replacing me,\u201d she said as she stepped out of her office. Her frown was directed at Jordan. \u201cI knew I was right about you. I just had an interesting talk with Lloyd. Remember him?\u201d Chief Haden asked Jordan.</p><p>How could she forget? \u201cOf course I remember him. He worked on my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says you threatened him.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was taken aback. \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. He says you scared him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not threaten him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says you did. He says you told him you were going to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. Jordan remembered the conversation. \u201cI might have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d Noah said. \u201cJordan, I don\u2019t want you to say another word.\u201d Turning to Haden, he said, \u201cGet Lloyd in here. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me what to do.\u201d Chief Haden started walking toward Jordan, her hand resting on the gun at her hip.</p><p>When Noah blocked her, she raised her arm and jabbed her elbow into his chest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Noah said. He latched on to her arm and turned her toward the door that led to the cell. \u201cChief Haden, you have the right to remain silent...\u201d</p><p>Haden\u2019s eyes became slits. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me my rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m required to,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an arrest.\u201d</p><p>Haden tried to pull away. She grabbed the handcuffs sitting on her desk. \u201cThis is outrageous.\u201d Her voice turned into a hiss. \u201cYou have no grounds.\u201d She swung the cuffs and struck Noah on the shoulder.</p><p>He grabbed the cuffs out of her hand, took the gun from her holster, and pushed her ahead of him. \u201cObstructing a criminal investigation and assaulting a federal agent...I think that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know people!\u201d Haden yelled as he nudged her inside the cell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you do,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cPowerful people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d He slammed the door shut in her face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be staying here until arrangements can be made to transfer you to a federal facility for processing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bogus,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be needing a lawyer. I\u2019d get a good one if I were you.\u201d</p><p>It finally penetrated that he wasn\u2019t bluffing. \u201cNow hold on here. Hold on now. Okay, okay, I\u2019ll cooperate.\u201d</p><p>Carrie watched wide-eyed. She wanted to stand up and cheer, but she knew the action might come back to bite her. Her parole officer had told her that her poor impulse control had gotten her into jail, and, if she wanted to change her life, she was going to have to learn to think before she acted. Besides, the chief would eventually get out of jail, wouldn\u2019t she?</p><p>As Noah walked past Nick, he said, \u201cNothing I hate worse than a crooked cop.\u201d He glanced out the window. A late-model sedan pulled up to the curb. A man emerged from the driver\u2019s seat carrying a briefcase in one hand and holding a cell phone to his ear with the other.</p><p>Noah turned to Jordan. \u201cYour attorney\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>LOUIS MAXWELL GARCIA WAS THE EPITOME OF REFINEMENT. HE oozed confidence and charm. His smile was warm and somewhat sincere, and his manners were as polished as alabaster. Neither his designer suit nor his starched pinstriped shirt had a wrinkle anywhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After the introductions were made, the attorney insisted that they call him Max.</p><p>\u201cDoctor Morganstern speaks highly of you,\u201d Nick said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Noah?\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t say a word. He simply moved closer to Jordan and folded his arms across his chest. His expression was impassive. Slow to warm to anyone, Noah always was skeptical, and Max, vouched for or not, had yet to prove his capability.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate you taking this on and getting here so quickly,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>Max\u2019s gaze was locked on Jordan. \u201cI could never say no to Doctor Morganstern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of favors for me over the years,\u201d he said and then turned to Jordan. \u201cIs there somewhere we could talk in private?\u201d</p><p>Jordan thought about suggesting the chief\u2019s office but quickly changed her mind. The small room with the door closed would be too claustrophobic.</p><p>\u201cThere really isn\u2019t anyplace private here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could sit outside on the bench, I suppose, if you don\u2019t mind the heat.\u201d</p> <p>Max had a lovely smile. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem for me. I\u2019m used to the heat. Where\u2019s the chief of police?\u201d he asked then. \u201cI should talk to him first and find out what the charges are. It would be nice if we had his cooperation sharing information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cChief Haden\u2019s a woman,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAnd Noah\u2019s right. She\u2019s not going to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why won\u2019t she?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s locked in a cell around the corner,\u201d Nick explained.</p><p>Max asked the obvious. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI arrested her,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Jordan thought Max didn\u2019t look the least surprised, but then as an attorney he was certainly adept at hiding his reactions.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Max said. \u201cAnd what was the reason for her arrest?\u201d</p><p>Nick explained, and when he was finished, Max scratched his jaw and asked, \u201cAre there any other surprises you would like to mention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Doctor Morganstern explain why I needed an attorney?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. He told me you found a little something in your car trunk.\u201d</p><p>Carrie waved to get Jordan\u2019s attention. \u201cI\u2019ve got Deputy Davis on hold,\u201d she said. \u201cWho wants to speak to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Noah said as he walked around Carrie\u2019s desk and picked up the phone.</p> <p>Max glanced into the hall that led to the jail cell. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to talk to the chief,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to find out what she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s conversation with the deputy lasted less than a minute. After he had identified himself, Noah told the deputy that his boss was under arrest and he needed to get to the police station as quickly as possible.</p><p>Max\u2019s conversation with Haden lasted much longer, though it didn\u2019t start out well. Jordan winced over the woman\u2019s crude vocabulary, but within minutes Haden had stopped yelling, and she guessed that Max had somehow charmed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten real quiet in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Max convinced her to be reasonable,\u201d Jordan suggested.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHe\u2019s wasting his time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t let her out, will he?\u201d Carrie worriedly asked Jordan.</p><p>Max returned to the front office. \u201cThe chief of police doesn\u2019t think she wants to get an attorney\u2019s advice, and she agrees that it would be prudent to cooperate with the FBI. She\u2019s also agreed to let us step outside and have our conference, and when we\u2019re finished, we\u2019ll sit down with her.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>Max ignored Noah\u2019s remark. \u201cAnd what do you think about letting the chief off the hook?\u201d he asked Nick.</p><p>Nick glanced at Noah before answering. Jordan thought her brother was a bit amused by the question. Did Max expect him to override Noah?</p><p>\u201cMy partner just told you that\u2019s not gonna happen, and that means it\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d Before Max could argue, Nick continued, \u201cThe deputy is on his way here. Jordan and you can talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Max looked directly at Noah and said, \u201cDoctor Morganstern warned me about you two. He said you\u2019d give me trouble.\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t make trouble, but when push comes to shove, we shove. We get the job done.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded and placed his hand on Jordan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShall we step outside?\u201d</p><p>Nick opened the door. \u201cJordan, now that your attorney\u2019s here, I\u2019m going to drive to Bourbon and look at the body.\u201d Turning to Noah, he asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this covered, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d Noah assured him.</p><p>Max picked up his briefcase and walked with Nick and Jordan outside. Noah followed and pulled the door closed behind him.</p><p>The stifling air took Jordan\u2019s breath away. She didn\u2019t think she could ever get used to this kind of heat.</p><p>After Nick had left, Max sat down on the bench next to her. He opened his briefcase, removed a notepad and pen, and was snapping the leather case shut when Noah began his interrogation.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you go to law school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStanford. When I finished, I joined a law firm on the West Coast and worked there until four years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Max smiled. \u201cI got tired of defending Silicon Valley boys who were stripping their dot-com companies. I decided to move back home and start over.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s answers were as rapid as the questions.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate any help you can give me,\u201d Jordan said, interrupting Noah\u2019s interrogation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d he answered warmly. He glanced up at Noah. \u201cI\u2019ll need to speak to my client alone.\u201d</p><p>After scrutinizing the situation for a second, Noah turned to go back inside the police station. \u201cJordan, you need anything, you call me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Unlike Noah, the attorney didn\u2019t grill her for answers. He simply asked her to take him through the events, beginning with the wedding she had attended and her first encounter with the professor.</p><p>Max listened intently and made notes as she went through her actions that morning. When she reached the part about J. D. Dickey\u2019s assault, Max raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI told Chief Haden that I wanted to press charges,\u201d Jordan explained. \u201cBut she refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she give you a reason why she wouldn\u2019t arrest him?\u201d</p><p>Jordan shook her head and explained what she had heard about the relationship between Haden and the Dickey brothers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely be speaking to Deputy Davis when he gets here,\u201d Max said. \u201cI assure you that J. D. Dickey can be brought in on charges. You\u2019ll probably have to stay in Serenity a little longer than you planned...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jordan replied hesitantly. \u201cI think I should just let it go, get out of town, and leave this whole nightmare behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Max said. He gave her a sympathetic look and touched her hand. \u201cYou just let me know, and we can see that Mr. Dickey pays for what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>Noah stood at the window watching the conversation between Jordan and Max outside. Jordan kept her eyes on her knees as she talked, and he could tell she was recalling the details of her day. Max Garcia wrote on his pad and cast a caring glance at her from time to time. \u201cLawyers,\u201d Noah mumbled with mild disgust.</p><p>Suddenly a car pulled up to the curb, and a man wearing blue jeans and a plaid shirt got out, walked over to Max and Jordan, and shook their hands.</p><p>Carrie looked through another window. \u201cThat\u2019s Joe,\u201d she said.</p><p>Joe Davis was a young man, but he already had deep worry lines in his forehead. He immediately spotted the gun when Noah walked out to join them.</p><p>\u201cAre you the agent I spoke to on the phone?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cClayborne, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Noah answered, stepping forward to take his hand. \u201cI hope you\u2019re nothing like the chief, because if you are, we\u2019ve got a big problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I\u2019m nothing like her,\u201d Davis assured him. \u201cThis is one hell of a mess. I was out on a friend\u2019s ranch and my wife couldn\u2019t reach me until I got back. I\u2019ve had three calls from three council members. The president will be over shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis reason for coming here?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to personally fire Chief Haden. They\u2019ve been looking for a reason to get rid of her, and now with a false arrest and a failure to press charges I\u2019d say they have grounds enough. They\u2019ve all had to put up with complaints about her over the last year. In the past couple of months the complaints have escalated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the man in charge then,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI told the council members I would take over until they can find a replacement.\u201d</p><p>Davis turned his attention to Max. \u201cIs your client ready to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Jordan nodded. And the questions started all over again.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>J. D. WAS IN A FRENZY. HE KNEW HE NEEDED TIME ALONE TO GET a handle on his temper before he did something else he would later regret. He drove down a dirt road on an isolated stretch of flat land outside of Serenity, his hands gripping the steering wheel, fishtailing around one curve and then another, damn near losing control of his truck as he sped on. Dust fanned out around the truck, and he could barely see where he was going because of the grime that covered the windshield. He almost drove into a gully but swerved to the right on two tires and bounced back onto the road. He slammed on the brakes then, jumped out of his pickup, and started kicking the door while he cursed his own stupidity.</p><p>He was in such a panic, it was hard to think straight. He knew he\u2019d messed up, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about that. It was too late. Randy was as mad as a hornet at him but had promised he\u2019d try to smooth things over.</p><p>Damage control. That\u2019s what it was all about at this point.</p><p>He knew what Cal would be saying to him right now if he knew about this terrible situation. His cellmate in prison would tell him to take responsibility for his failure and then try to understand what went wrong. Learn from your mistakes. When a job goes bad, it\u2019s imperative to figure out what went sour before taking on another job. Any fool knew that. Yes, that\u2019s what Cal would say. He was such a wise man.</p><p>And what had J. D. learned? He\u2019d learned that he\u2019d gotten too damned greedy. He\u2019d had a real sweet life with his new career until the professor came along and put all sorts of big ideas into his head.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted the sweet life to go away, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to go back to prison and this time maybe get stuck with the needle for premeditated murder.</p><p>Luck just hadn\u2019t fallen his way, that was all. He\u2019d gone back to Jordan Buchanan\u2019s room at the motel twice but couldn\u2019t get in. The first time, Amelia Ann had been inside running a vacuum. The second time, there had been a couple of electricians installing new lights outside the room\u2019s door.</p><p>He stopped kicking his new truck and fell back against the fender. Wiping the sweat and dirt off his forehead, he tried to concentrate. The bitch had messed everything up. No, that wasn\u2019t true. She\u2019d complicated his life, but she hadn\u2019t ruined it. He could still fix things. He\u2019d fix her too, he decided. Yeah, he\u2019d fix her.</p><p>First things first. He had to finish the job, and that meant keeping Jordan Buchanan in town until he could figure out what she knew. What were the possibilities that she knew why the professor had to be silenced? Zero to none, J. D. figured.</p><p>Still, he had to be certain.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>THE ORDEAL WAS FINALLY OVER, AND BY SEVEN-THIRTY THAT evening Jordan had been cleared of any and all charges. As soon as the new chief of police had been given the official time of death\u2014with a three-hour window\u2014and had checked Jordan\u2019s alibi, she was free to go.</p><p>Jordan had accounted for her every moment the evening before. She realized how fortunate she was that she had never been alone, only when she\u2019d gone to bed for the night, but Professor MacKenna had been long departed by then.</p><p>The president of the town council insisted on firing Maggie Haden while she was still behind bars. He also insisted that Chief Davis not let the woman out until he had left the station.</p><p>Maggie didn\u2019t take the news of her termination well.</p><p>\u201cYou had to have known this was coming,\u201d Davis told her.</p><p>Her response was predictably vile, and as she was gathering up her personal possessions and throwing them into a cardboard box, she went into a tirade about sexual discrimination.</p><p>\u201cPeople have complained to the council about me because I\u2019m a woman. You never could stand it that I got the job and you didn\u2019t. You\u2019ve been needling the council to fire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to take any responsibility for your actions today?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a lawyer, and I\u2019m going to sue every one of you. You won\u2019t have a penny to piss on when I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen here. You shouldn\u2019t be making any kind of threats. It took a lot of fast-talking to convince Agent Clayborne to drop the assault charge. He could still change his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a trumped-up charge.\u201d</p><p>The box she\u2019d filled was in the center of the desk. She looked down at the contents, then picked it up and hurled it against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any of this junk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave here now.\u201d Davis tried to take hold of her arm.</p><p>She jerked away. \u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable sitting behind my desk. You won\u2019t be chief of police for long. My attorney will force the council to give me back my job. I\u2019ll be wearing my badge and gun before you know it. Then you\u2019ll be officially terminated. My first order of business will be to get rid of you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan had walked to the end of the sidewalk with Max to say good-bye, but she could still hear Haden\u2019s voice loud and clear. Max handed Jordan his business card with all of his phone numbers, including his private cell number. He told her to call him anytime, night or day, if there were any other problems. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI suggest you leave Serenity as quickly as possible,\u201d he advised. \u201cWhoever put the body in your car had a reason, Jordan. I wouldn\u2019t stay around here to find out why. Leave the investigation to the local police. If Chief Davis needs help, he knows he can ask Noah or your brother.\u201d He abruptly changed the subject. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get going, but I wanted to ask...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said, wondering why he was so hesitant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in Boston next month for a conference, and if you\u2019re free I\u2019d love to take you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Noah had already thanked the attorney and was waiting by the door for Jordan to say her good-bye. She was smiling at Max, but there was something else in her expression. Surprise, he thought. Curious, he decided to find out what Max was saying to her. His cell phone interrupted. He would have ignored it, but then he saw the number and changed his mind. Nick was on the line.</p> <p>Jordan tucked Max\u2019s business card into her pocket and watched as he got into his car and drove away. She waved good-bye to him. For some reason the action bothered Noah. It seemed too...personal, too friendly. He wondered if Max had hit on her and decided that, yes, he definitely had. Jordan was a beautiful woman, and Noah had noticed that the attorney was noticing. That bothered him too. It wasn\u2019t professional behavior for her attorney to take such a personal interest in Jordan\u2019s physical assets. Oh sure, he\u2019d done his share of noticing. But that was different.</p><p>The door behind Noah opened with a bang and Maggie Haden stormed out. She spotted Jordan at the end of the sidewalk and headed toward her.</p><p>Jordan turned around and saw blood in Haden\u2019s eyes, but she didn\u2019t back away or look for help. She could hold her own. She stood her ground and waited to see what the crazed woman would do. She was ready for anything.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get the opportunity to find out. One second Haden was flying toward Jordan, and the next second Jordan was staring at Noah\u2019s back. How he\u2019d gotten in front of her so quickly was beyond her.</p><p>Haden was blaming her for everything but the heat. As a parting shot she yelled, \u201cThis isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d Noah asserted.</p><p>Jordan tapped Noah on the shoulder, but he didn\u2019t turn around until Haden was out of sight.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to get in front of me. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>He gave her the famous Noah Clayborne smile. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>He brushed the hair over her shoulder and gently patted the side of her face. \u201cIf you can take care of yourself, how come your cheek\u2019s swollen?\u201d</p> <p>He had her there. \u201cIt was a surprise attack,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>Only after she gave her explanation did she realize how truly lame it sounded.</p><p>\u201cI see. So when you\u2019re ready and it isn\u2019t a surprise, then you can take care of yourself? How much warning would you like to have?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think the sarcastic remark required an answer. Besides, she couldn\u2019t come up with anything.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your older brothers teach you how to defend yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they did. They taught Sidney and me all about gun safety and shooting and fighting, clean fighting and dirty fighting.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd all sorts of other things we weren\u2019t at all interested in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we were girls, and we liked girly things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs building a computer a girly thing to do?\u201d he asked, smiling. \u201cNick told me you were always drawing and designing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still did some girly things,\u201d she insisted. \u201cBut Sidney and I paid attention to our brothers\u2019 lessons too. Really.\u201d</p><p>He abruptly moved to another topic. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve found the most perfect restaurant to take you to for dinner. You\u2019ll love the food. Can we just take off though? Did Chief Davis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows where you\u2019re staying tonight. We can leave.\u201d</p><p>The restaurant was just a couple of blocks away.</p><p>\u201cMy glasses are in my purse, and my purse is in my rental car,\u201d she said as they walked along. \u201cDo you think that when Nick drives back, he could bring them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick isn\u2019t coming back to Serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>They crossed the street and turned south. \u201cDoctor Morganstern called him and wants to meet with him in Boston. Nick doesn\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to go too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ve been ordered to stick with you.\u201d</p><p>She pushed into his side. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to sound so disgruntled. Am I such a pain then?\u201d</p><p>Noah looked down at her. Ordinarily, he would have relished this situation, and even jumped at the opportunity to spend the night watching over a beautiful woman, but this was no ordinary situation, and Jordan was no ordinary woman.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she asked when he didn\u2019t respond. He shrugged in answer. \u201cWhy would Nick ask you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick didn\u2019t ask me to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cMorganstern ordered me to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cWhy? I\u2019ve been cleared of all charges. Yes, I know the professor was placed in my car, and I know what you\u2019re thinking...\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t think you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my rental car? Do you know when it will be released?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. An FBI agent from this district is driving another car here for us and picking up your things first in Bourbon,\u201d he said. \u201cA friend of his is following and will take him back home. He\u2019ll call me when he gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rental agency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to figure out a way to get the car from Bourbon. It\u2019s no longer your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick had a little chat with the owner. As soon as he mentioned a lawsuit, the guy folded. Your brother\u2019s law degree comes in handy on occasion.\u201d</p><p>They reached Jaffee\u2019s restaurant. Noah pulled the door open for her. There were only two tables occupied, and both were by the front window.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Angela,\u201d she replied.</p><p>The waitress was carrying an empty tray back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYour table\u2019s ready,\u201d she called out.</p><p>Noah followed her to the corner table. \u201cYou have your own table here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not teasing. This is my usual table. And watch. She\u2019ll bring me my usual drink.\u201d</p><p>Noah chose the two chairs with backs against the wall. Jordan noticed and thought that taking such measures was second nature to him now. Noah, she believed, would never be caught unaware.</p><p>Angela hurried over to the table with a glass of iced tea and two glasses of iced water. Smiling at Noah, she asked, \u201cNow, what can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have iced tea.\u201d</p><p>She left to get his drink but paused in the doorway. Her gaze was on Jordan when she tilted her head toward Noah and gave the thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cI guess she doesn\u2019t realize I can see her,\u201d Noah remarked. There was laughter in his voice.</p><p>\u201cShe means well.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee hurried out with menus. \u201cHey, Jordan,\u201d he called from across the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jaffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d he asked bluntly as he handed them their menus.</p><p>Jordan introduced Noah. \u201cYou\u2019re FBI, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jaffee asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee nodded. \u201cIs your brother going to be joining you?\u201d he asked Jordan.</p><p>\u201cYou know about Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d he answered. \u201cDid you forget what a small town this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick got called back to Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you her bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>Jordan answered. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend with a gun?\u201d Angela remarked as she joined the group.</p><p>Jordan took it all in stride when both Angela and Jaffee pulled out chairs and sat down.</p><p>\u201cStart at the beginning, hon,\u201d Angela said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave anything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you know more than I do,\u201d Jordan replied.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut I want to hear you tell what happened. It must have been something finding what you did in your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey ought to be able to eat their dinner in peace first,\u201d Jaffee said. \u201cThen she can tell us what happened.\u201d</p><p>Angela nodded. She pushed the chair back and stood. \u201cDeputy Joe Davis came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Chief Davis now,\u201d Jaffee reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, he is. And it\u2019s about time too,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cChief Davis came in here to check on your whereabouts, Jordan, and we told him you were here until almost ten, and then Jaffee walked you over to the motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe told the truth,\u201d Jaffee said, shooting a look at Noah.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have to lie,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two go ahead and look over the menu. I\u2019ve got a real nice pot roast if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Angela and Jaffee returned to the kitchen, Noah said, \u201cJoe Davis asked me to go with him to Professor MacKenna\u2019s house tomorrow morning. He\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll see something he missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I go with you?\u201d She sounded so eager.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. I doubt Joe will mind. The detectives from Bourbon have already been through the place, but they didn\u2019t find anything significant. Tell me, what did you think of the professor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you want the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a disgusting, gross, opinionated bore.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exaggerating,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>She then told him about the dinner she\u2019d suffered through, stressing the professor\u2019s appalling table manners.</p><p>\u201cI understand you were arguing with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe waitress at the restaurant mentioned to Joe that you were shouting, and he mentioned it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not shouting. Oh, wait. Yes, I was. That is, I raised my voice. I didn\u2019t shout though. The professor was being horribly insulting to the Buchanans, and I felt it was my responsibility as a Buchanan to defend our good name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think maybe you overreacted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll read you a little of his research, and then you can make up your own mind. His slanted research,\u201d she thought to add.</p><p>Angela carried out their dinner, and they were left alone to enjoy their meal. Noah couldn\u2019t believe how great the food was. \u201cJaffee could make it anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI wonder what keeps him in Serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>While they ate, she explained what Jaffee had told her. She also mentioned that Trumbo of Trumbo Motors and Whitaker, a wealthy rancher, had dropped by to say hey to Jaffee and have cake with her.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Hey\u2019?\u201d Noah repeated. \u201cSugar, how long have you been in Serenity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s with the \u2018hey\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m blending in. I\u2019m adapting to my environment,\u201d she said and added, \u201cand I\u2019m not your Sugar.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re all sass, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Angela removed their dishes, filled their glasses, and sat down at their table again. Not to be left out, Jaffee soon joined them.</p><p>\u201cDinner was wonderful,\u201d Jordan said, and when Noah didn\u2019t comment, she nudged him under the table.</p><p>He remembered his manners and gave sufficient praise, but he wasn\u2019t looking at Jaffee. He was watching the door. The restaurant was rapidly filling up with townspeople. Noah didn\u2019t like the crowd one little bit. He casually leaned back and shifted slightly closer to Jordan, and his hand moved closer to his weapon. He was ready for anything. A town meeting or a lynching.</p><p>Jordan noticed how tense he\u2019d become and put her hand on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan,\u201d a young woman called out.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHey, Candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Charlene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Amelia Ann.\u201d</p><p>And so it went. She acknowledged each person as he or she walked over to the table. Before long a crowd had gathered three deep.</p><p>\u201cYou remember Steve, don\u2019t you?\u201d Charlene asked. \u201cHe\u2019s my boss at the insurance agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. It\u2019s nice to see you again, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, I just love my china. Thank you so much,\u201d Charlene continued.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I hope you enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Noah nudged her. \u201cChina?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cVera Wang.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee turned a chair toward him and straddled it. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve been patient long enough. We have to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe heard what happened. Everyone in town\u2019s talking about it,\u201d Angela said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t heard it from you. What was it like seeing that corpse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was gross,\u201d Candy answered for Jordan.</p><p>Everyone began to ask questions at the same time. Noah found it interesting that Jordan didn\u2019t have to answer any of them. There were always one or two in the group who already knew the answer and were happy to supply it for her.</p><p>In the middle of the question-and-answer session Noah\u2019s phone rang. They all stopped talking so they could hear what he was saying.</p><p>After a few seconds he said, \u201cJordan, stay here. The FBI agent is out front with a car for us. I\u2019ll only be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Charlene waited until he had left the restaurant and then commented, \u201cHe\u2019s quite a handsome fellow, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Jordan\u2019s friend,\u201d Angela announced.</p><p>\u201cHer special friend?\u201d Amelia Ann wanted to know.</p><p>The women looked expectantly at her. \u201cJust a friend,\u201d Jordan assured them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying the night, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Amelia Ann said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going to be staying the night too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered again.</p><p>Amelia Ann pushed forward. \u201cIn your room or somewhere else?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p> <p>\u201cSomewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt my motel though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would assume so...if you have the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I can do,\u201d Amelia Ann said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you out because I\u2019ve got available rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you help me out?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll put him in the adjoining room.\u201d</p><p>Charlene winked at Jordan. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you to unlock the connecting door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlene!\u201d Candy whispered, drawing the name out. \u201cHe could be seeing someone else...like serious.\u201d</p><p>How about ten someone elses, Jordan thought.</p><p>Charlene gave her a playful nudge with her elbow. \u201cToo bad Kyle Heffermint isn\u2019t here. He sure seemed interested this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you women are through embarrassing Jordan with your silly talk about sleeping arrangements, I\u2019d like to know what happened when Maggie Haden got canned.\u201d It was Charlene\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Keith, who asked the question.</p> <p>Everyone speculated and recounted what they had heard. Then Keith said, \u201cYour friend, the FBI agent, promised Joe Davis he\u2019d stay over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he promise that?\u201d Charlene asked.</p><p>\u201cJoe asked him to look at the dead man\u2019s house. Since he\u2019s experienced and all, Joe thought he might have some insight and suggestions, or maybe see something in that house that could help Joe find the killer.\u201d</p><p>Amelia Ann\u2019s hand went to her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone in Serenity is a killer. Whoever murdered that man had to be an outsider. We\u2019re too friendly here to want to kill anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs friendly as we are here, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s odd that none of us knew the MacKenna fella?\u201d Jaffee asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he kept to himself,\u201d Keith said. \u201cI heard he rented a house less than a mile from here.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee nodded. \u201cHe never came in here to eat, not once. He didn\u2019t even stop by for a slice of my cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan told me he used to be a teacher.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you get all those research papers copied?\u201d Jaffee asked Jordan.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cI still have one more box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that the guy\u2019s dead you can just take those boxes with you, can\u2019t you?\u201d Candy asked. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to want them.\u201d</p><p>Jordan shook her head. \u201cThe research material is now part of the investigation, and it\u2019s also part of Professor MacKenna\u2019s estate. I can\u2019t take the boxes with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could read the rest of the papers tonight,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>It was sweet of him to be concerned about her project, she thought. She doubted she would get much reading done tonight though. She was exhausted from her long, stressful day, and she knew that as soon as her head hit the pillow, she\u2019d be fast asleep.</p><p>Noah walked back into the restaurant but was stopped by Steve Nelson and another man. Steve was doing most of the talking and looked quite earnest, and Jordan wondered if he was trying to sell Noah insurance. Every now and then Noah would nod. Soon a group had gathered around him, and the discussion became more animated. She could hear them bombarding Noah with questions and offering him their conjectures. He seemed to take it all in stride and patiently listened to each person\u2019s views. At one point, he glanced over at her and smiled. It was apparent that Serenity hadn\u2019t seen this much excitement in years. It was also apparent to her that Noah was being very accommodating. They wanted to talk, and he was willing to listen.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>THE GOOD CITIZENS OF SERENITY CONTINUED THEIR DISCUSSION about the events that had suddenly rocked their small town, but after an hour, Noah excused himself and insisted that he and Jordan had to leave. The Texas night air was still muggy and hot when they stepped outside. Noah turned up the dial for the air-conditioning in the new car, and Jordan ooh\u2019d and aah\u2019d over the working feature.</p><p>She found her purse lying on the backseat and reached for it. She turned again to get her laptop, but it wasn\u2019t there. She looked on the floor behind her. Still no laptop.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cMy laptop\u2019s not here.\u201d She turned around and looked under the seat. \u201cIt was in my rental car this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone take it out at the grocery store?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, when Chief Haden took me to the police station, she wouldn\u2019t let me take anything from my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make some calls tomorrow and find it,\u201d Noah assured her.</p><p>He parked the sedan in the back of the motel courtyard. They backtracked to the lobby where Amelia Ann was waiting with a key for Noah. He didn\u2019t comment when he saw that his room was next to Jordan\u2019s. He unlocked his door, went to the connecting door, unlocked it, and then followed Jordan into her room.</p><p>\u201cYou keep this unlocked and wide open,\u201d he said.</p><p>He waited until she agreed. \u201cOkay, but no surprises,\u201d she teased. \u201cYou stay in your room, and I\u2019ll stay in mine.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he walked into his room. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was startled by how much his words hurt. Had he bothered to look at her, he would have seen it in her eyes. Fortunately, he hadn\u2019t bothered. Her reaction puzzled her. It didn\u2019t make any sense. She didn\u2019t want him to be attracted to her, did she?</p><p>No, of course she didn\u2019t. She was only having such weird, crazy thoughts because she was tired and stressed out. That\u2019s all there was to it.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let it go. Noah had said she didn\u2019t have to worry. Why not? How come she didn\u2019t have to worry? What was wrong with her? The man allegedly had hit on nearly every woman he came into contact with, and not having to worry about him hitting on her could only mean he wasn\u2019t interested. So why wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>She walked into the bathroom, looked at herself in the mirror, and shrugged. Okay, she had to admit she wasn\u2019t a beauty queen, and she definitely wasn\u2019t looking her best tonight. Her eyes were bloodshot from wearing her contacts too long; her hair was hanging in her face, and there wasn\u2019t a spot of color in her complexion except for the big fat bruise under her eye.</p><p>Enough self-scrutiny, she decided. She couldn\u2019t do anything about her appearance anyway, at least not tonight. Besides, if she wanted to get any reading done at all, she\u2019d better try to revive herself.</p><p>Removing her contacts and taking a long hot shower helped. She washed her hair but didn\u2019t take the time to blow it dry and curl it. It was still dripping wet when she combed it back over her shoulders. She put on a gray, cotton Jockey T-shirt and gray-and-white-striped boxer shorts. After she brushed her teeth, she slipped on her horn-rimmed glasses and once again looked in the mirror.</p><p>Great, now she looked like a commercial for psoriasis cream. She\u2019d scrubbed her face so vigorously, her complexion was one big red blotch.</p><p>She laughed at herself. Oh, yes, she was a real sex goddess all right, but at least she wasn\u2019t sleepy any longer. Maybe she could get some reading done after all.</p><p>She went back into the bedroom, removed the bedspread, folded it, and tucked it in the corner by the nightstand. Then she pulled the sheet back, grabbed a batch of uncopied papers from the third and last box, and sat down in the middle of the king-sized bed to read.</p><p>She kept glancing into the connecting room, but Noah was nowhere in sight. Her bed was parallel to his, which meant that if she wanted to, she could watch him sleep. Concentrate on the research, she told herself and picked up the top paper.</p><p>There were scribbles in the margin again. And there was for a second time a number she had seen before: 1284. Something significant must have occurred that year to the Buchanans and the MacKennas. But what? Was that the start of the feud or when the treasure was stolen? What happened in 1284?</p><p>Her frustration mounted. If she had her laptop and had Internet access, she could start doing her own research right this minute. Because she didn\u2019t, she would have to wait until she was back in Boston.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered as she began to read. \u201cWhat have the Buchanans done this time?\u201d</p><p>This story took place in 1673. Lady Elspet Buchanan, the only daughter of the ruthless Laird Euan Buchanan, was attending the annual festival near Finlay Ford. Quite by accident she met Allyone MacKenna, favored son of the just and honorable Laird Owen MacKenna. The Buchanans later accused Allyone of sneaking into their camp to bewitch the fair lady, but the MacKennas knew for a certainty that it was the woman Elspet who put an unholy spell on their laird\u2019s son.</p><p>Regardless, as luck would have it, it didn\u2019t take more than a couple of glances for Elspet to fall head over heels in love with Allyone. He was, after all, according to the descendants of the MacKenna clan, as handsome a warrior as ever there was.</p><p>Because he had been bewitched, Allyone loved Elspet as much as she loved him, but both knew they could never be together. Yet they could not stay apart. Elspet pleaded with Allyone to give up his family, his position, and his honor, and run away with her.</p><p>The night before they were to meet in the forest and sneak away together, the Laird Buchanan found out what his daughter was planning. Enraged, he locked her in the tower of his castle and called his warriors together to find and kill Allyone.</p><p>Terrified that her father knew where Allyone was going to be waiting for her, Elspet was determined to warn her lover, but as she was tearing down the slippery steps, she lost her footing and fell to her death.</p><p>It was written that she died whispering his name.</p><p>When Jordan read that poor Elspet had died calling out for her love, tears began to stream down her face. Perhaps it was because she was exhausted. It wasn\u2019t like her to become so emotional.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>The sound of Noah\u2019s voice jarred her. She looked up and saw him standing in the doorway frowning at her. He\u2019d obviously just gotten out of the shower. He had put on jeans but nothing else.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he demanded as he strode into her room pulling a white T-shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened.\u201d She rolled over and grabbed a box of tissues from the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cAre you sick or something?\u201d</p><p>She tried but couldn\u2019t make herself stop crying. She pulled a tissue out and wiped her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m not sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell, Jordan?\u201d</p><p>He threaded his fingers through his hair and stood there looking at her without moving for about fifteen seconds. Finally he sat down on the bed and pulled her into his side.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d She paused to pull another tissue from the box. \u201cIt was so...\u201d</p><p>He thought he\u2019d figured out the problem and leaned toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Sugar. I know you\u2019ve had a rough time today. It must be catching up with you. Go ahead and cry. Let it all out. I know how bad it was.\u201d</p><p>She started to agree with him, paused, and said, \u201cWhat? No, nothing has caught up with me. It was just so sad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad? I wouldn\u2019t call what you went through sad. I\u2019d call it grueling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...the story...\u201d</p><p>He was stroking her arm and distracting her. It suddenly occurred to her that he was trying to comfort her. And how adorable was that? And sweet and caring...and...uh-oh.</p><p>Oh, dear God, she was beginning to like him, and not in an acceptable isn\u2019t-he-a-nice-friend kind of way. Noah could be sensitive. She\u2019d never taken the time to notice before. She remembered how kind he\u2019d been to Carrie that afternoon at the police station. He\u2019d made her feel important and pretty. Now, Jordan realized, he was trying to make her feel better and to not feel so alone.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re gonna stop crying anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and smiled weakly. She was just inches away from his gorgeous eyes...his mouth...</p><p>She jerked back and hastily looked away. \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d she announced. \u201cSee? No more tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done? Then what\u2019s that watery stuff coming out of your eyes?\u201d</p><p>She punched his shoulder. \u201cStop being nice to me. It freaks me out.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI gotta tell you, when I saw you crying at the wedding, I thought it was just an aberration, but now you\u2019re doing it again. You\u2019re different here,\u201d he concluded.</p><p>\u201cHow am I different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time I\u2019ve seen you on Nathan\u2019s Bay, your nose is in a book or a computer. You\u2019re always all business.\u201d</p><p>And no fun at all, she silently added for him.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you\u2019re different here too,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess you just seem a little...sweeter. Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re closer to home. You grew up in Texas, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family moved to Houston when I was eight years old. We lived in Montana before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was a lawman before he retired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your grandfather and his father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come from a long line of lawmen,\u201d he said.</p><p>He began to stroke her arm again. It wasn\u2019t distracting now. It felt good.</p><p>\u201cNick told me you carry a compass with you that belonged to your great-great-grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name was Cole Clayborne, and he was a lawman in Montana. My father gave me his compass when I started working for Doctor Morganstern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll never lose your way. That\u2019s what my mother told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what else she told me about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019s the only woman in the world who can tell you what to do.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>A knock on Noah\u2019s door interrupted them. He went into his room to answer it and found Amelia Ann standing there holding a bucket with several bottles of beer submerged in ice.</p><p>Amelia Ann hesitated for a second and then said, \u201cHey. Um...I know you\u2019ve had a busy day...traveling and all...and...I thought you might be thirsty.\u201d She pushed the ice bucket at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah took it from her and gave her a warm smile. \u201cThat\u2019s awfully nice of you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry,\u201d she continued, \u201cI could pop some corn or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I really appreciate the beer though.\u201d He began to close the door. \u201cHave a good night,\u201d he said.</p><p>Amelia Ann angled her head to peer around the door at him. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything else I can do...anything you need...you just call up to the front desk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will. Thank you,\u201d he said as he closed the door.</p><p>When he returned to Jordan\u2019s room, he was twisting the cap off a beer bottle.</p><p>\u201cThe lady who runs the motel...what was her name...?\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cAmelia Ann?\u201d Jordan supplied.</p><p>\u201cYes, Amelia Ann. She just brought us some beer. That was nice, wasn\u2019t it? Want one?\u201d he offered.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Jordan answered. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it was \u2018us\u2019 she wanted to be nice to.\u201d</p><p>He took a swig from the bottle. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me why you were crying,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read this story the professor had transcribed, and it affected me. Would you like me to read it to you? Then you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Go ahead,\u201d Noah said as he sat on the bed.</p> <p>She began to read in a clear, concise voice, but by the time she reached the end of the tragic story, her voice trembled, and the tears were back.</p><p>Noah was laughing at her. He couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYou\u2019re just full of surprises,\u201d he said as he handed her the box of tissues. \u201cI never would have guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuessed what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being a romantic.\u201d</p><p>Jordan returned to the research papers and read another ridiculous account about the barbaric, bloodthirsty Buchanans. This legend wasn\u2019t at all romantic but a detailed description of a gory battle which, according to Professor MacKenna, was started by the Buchanans.</p><p>\u201cNo surprise there,\u201d she mumbled to herself.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe man taught history, for heaven\u2019s sake. Medieval history. His class should have been called Fantasy because that\u2019s what he was teaching.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled. When Jordan became passionate about something, her face lit up. How come he\u2019d never seen this before?</p><p>\u201cSo what would you sign up for? Fantasy 101?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d call it Let\u2019s Make Up Stuff 101.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019d take that class. Exams would be a snap. Is any of the research accurate?\u201d he asked. He took a swallow of his beer and leaned back against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cThe farther back in history, the crazier the legends become. But there\u2019s some mention over and over again about a treasure that was stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say.\u201d</p><p>Jordan reached for the bottle in his hand and took a drink. \u201cWhat do they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a thread of truth in every lie. Any guesses what the treasure was?\u201d</p><p>She took another sip of his beer and handed it back before answering. \u201cA jeweled crown is mentioned several times in different stories, but there\u2019s also a mention of a jeweled sword.\u201d</p><p>She took the bottle from him again, emptied it in one long gulp, and handed it back. Noah didn\u2019t say a word. He simply got up and brought two bottles back with him.</p><p>\u201cMove over, Sugar,\u201d he said as he dropped down next to her.</p><p>She scooted out of his way. When he offered her a bottle, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019m not in the mood for beer tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>She stacked the papers to put them back in the box. \u201cEven though the professor\u2019s research is grossly biased, he really believed there was a treasure. I\u2019m sure he thought the Buchanans stole it from the MacKennas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think there was a treasure?\u201d</p><p>She was embarrassed to admit it. \u201cI do,\u201d she said and then hastily added, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten caught up in all of this. Maybe I\u2019m just being fanciful.\u201d She sat back and stretched her legs out. \u201cSome of the stories though...they\u2019re fun to read because they\u2019re so...out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Tell me an out-there bedtime story.\u201d</p><p>He put his untouched bottle of beer on the nightstand next to the one he\u2019d offered Jordan, then crossed one ankle over the other and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, Sugar. Once upon a time...Read me something gory.\u201d</p><p>She filed through the papers until she found one especially bloody tale. It was quite graphic, which was probably why Noah enjoyed it so. When she was finished with that one, she told him about another battle.</p><p>\u201cThe legend describes two angels coming down to earth to escort a fallen warrior to heaven. This happened during a fierce battle. It was reported that all the warriors on both sides of the field saw the angels coming. Suddenly time stopped. Some of the warriors had swords raised, others were about to throw their lances or swing their maces, but they were all frozen in those stances. They watched transfixed as the warrior was lifted up into the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI suppose they thawed out and continued with the battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like these. Read another one,\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear something romantic or something gory?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t open his eyes when he replied, \u201cLet me think about this. I\u2019m in bed, and right next to me is a scantily clad woman who\u2019s in dire need of a little action...\u201d</p><p>She poked his side. \u201cI am not scantily clad. I\u2019m wearing shorts and a T-shirt. There\u2019s nothing scanty about my clothing.\u201d</p><p>His eyes remained closed, but he was grinning now. \u201cBut I happen to know that you\u2019re not wearing anything underneath that T-shirt and shorts.\u201d</p><p>She quickly looked down at her chest. Nothing showed through the fabric, thank God. \u201cOnly you would think about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny man would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull up the sheet, but it was trapped under his legs. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just not think about it.\u201d</p><p>He opened one eye. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear another story or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cHuh what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t argue with me about needing a little action.\u201d</p><p>He had her there. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to respond to such an incorrect assumption. What story would you like to hear?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gotten her all riled up again. He didn\u2019t know why he got such a kick out of her indignation, but he did. \u201cAm I rubbing you the wrong way, Sugar?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Oh, brother. \u201cYou\u2019re not rubbing me at all. I\u2019m putting these papers away,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re real easy\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the boys tell me,\u201d she joked.</p><p>\u201cYeah? But are you any good?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled playfully. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t answer at first. He stared into her incredible blue eyes and lost his train of thought. Sexual banter had always come as second nature to him, but suddenly he had no reply. An image of Jordan\u2014sans T-shirt, sans shorts, making love\u2014whizzed through his head and rendered him speechless.</p><p>He grabbed the beer bottles on the nightstand and headed for his room. His words were gruff when he finally answered her. \u201cI think I\u2019d better get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>TWO PHONES RANG SIMULTANEOUSLY.</p><p>Jordan woke to the sounds coming from Noah\u2019s room. She rolled over in bed and opened her eyes a crack as she listened to Noah answer the ring that sounded like his cell phone. She heard him ask \u201cDarlin\u2019\u201d to hold on a minute, and then he answered the other ring. He obviously didn\u2019t like whatever the caller was saying to him because his voice turned hard. Then he began to snap out orders. She heard him explain in his don\u2019t-mess-with-me tone that he expected results by noon.</p><p>A few minutes later he strolled through the door. \u201cThat was Joe Davis on the line...\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cBefore you tell me what he has to say, you might want to talk to Darlin\u2019 if she\u2019s still holding on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell...\u201d he said as he hurried back into his room.</p><p>She could hear him apologizing to the caller as he returned. He dropped down on Jordan\u2019s bed, grabbed the edge of her T-shirt when she tried to get up, and said, \u201cHold on. She\u2019s right here.\u201d He handed his cell phone to her. \u201cSidney wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe her sister was on the line until she said hello.</p><p>\u201cHow come you have Noah\u2019s phone number?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always known it. That isn\u2019t important now. Theo told me what happened. Did you know about the body when we talked before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore what? I don\u2019t remember,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes everyone know what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan and Kate don\u2019t know, but then they\u2019re on their honeymoon, so Alec didn\u2019t think we should bother them with any worries. Jordan, tell me, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she assured her sister. \u201cThe police sorted it all out, and I\u2019m coming home tomorrow. I\u2019ll tell you everything then. I promise. Sidney...\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo Mom and Dad know what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick called and talked to both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll worry, and they both have enough to think about now, what with the trial and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have found out. Zack would have let it slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told Zack?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, and then Sidney said, \u201cI might have mentioned it to him.\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t want to argue. She talked to her sister for a few more minutes to reassure her and ended the call. As she handed the cell phone to Noah, she said, \u201cWhen I found that body, I should have called Dylan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because Nick told your family?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSidney insists they would have found out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she allowed.</p><p>After she had dressed and packed her things, she zipped her bag shut and went to the connecting door. Noah was snapping his gun holster closed.</p><p>\u201cYou were about to tell me what Chief Davis had to say,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRight. He told me Sheriff Randy has no idea where his brother is. He said he has people looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe sheriff knows exactly where J. D. is. He probably wants to sit down with Chief Davis and work something out before J. D. comes in. That\u2019s my guess anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould the sheriff of Grady County usually handle a murder investigation?\u2019</p><p>\u201cYes, but Davis told me he\u2019s on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawaii,\u201d she volunteered. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the FBI help the chief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavis seems to think he can handle this without the FBI\u2019s interference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lloyd? Has Davis spoken to him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cNo one can find him. His garage was unlocked, but Davis says that\u2019s not unusual. A lot of people in this town don\u2019t lock their doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet they do now. After all, one of their own was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Professor MacKenna wasn\u2019t one of them. He didn\u2019t own the house. He rented it, and he kept to himself. Very antisocial. No one really knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Lloyd knows what happened. If he didn\u2019t kill the professor, I\u2019ll bet he knows who did. He was so nervous when I picked up the car. I think he knew the body was in the trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s the primary suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait for me to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that was peculiar because when I first drove the car in, he hit on me and kept trying to get me to go out with him. He tried to keep me in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he continue to try to get you to go out with him after you threatened him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not...oh, okay, I guess I did. But it was all so stupid. He asked me what I would do if my car wasn\u2019t ready when I came back the second time, and before I could answer, he asked me if I would hurt him. I believe I agreed that I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t see. Lloyd happens to be a very big man. I would have to stand on a chair to hit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chair, huh?\u201d</p><p>She was irritated that he was making fun of her. \u201cI went over all of this with Chief Davis, and I believe you were standing right there. Weren\u2019t you paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLloyd will turn up,\u201d he predicted.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhen do we meet Chief Davis at the professor\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>He checked the time. \u201cIn an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if we stopped at the grocery store first? I\u2019d like to photocopy the rest of the research papers. It shouldn\u2019t take long, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of those boxes need to go to Davis?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCopies don\u2019t have to go to him. I\u2019m going to ask Candy if she\u2019ll mail them to Boston for me.\u201d</p><p>Candy was working at the front desk and was all in favor of helping out and making some extra spending money. Jordan filled out a form with the necessary mailing information, told Candy she would bring her the boxes to be mailed, paid her in advance, and headed back to her room.</p><p>Noah was leaning against his door talking to Amelia Ann when she returned. Amelia Ann had brought him coffee and a basket of homemade cinnamon rolls. Jordan noticed that she had put on makeup. The blouse she wore was tucked into her slacks, and the top three buttons were undone. Ten to one she was wearing a push-up bra. Amelia Ann\u2019s nervous laughter followed her as Jordan walked into Noah\u2019s room, grabbed the car keys from the desk, and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to start loading these boxes in the car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Sure you are, she thought to herself, just as soon as Amelia Ann finishes flirting.</p><p>She carried one box outside, rounded the corner of the building, and immediately noticed their car\u2019s right rear tire was riding low.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she whispered. The tire was either going flat or needed air, and the way her luck had been going, she\u2019d wager it was flat. She dropped the box on the pavement, slipped the key into the trunk lock, and stepped back as the lid popped open.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. She couldn\u2019t move. She shut her eyes, opened them, and nothing had changed.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She slammed the trunk lid down and ran as fast as she could back to Noah\u2019s room. His door was closed. She pounded on it with her fist.</p><p>He knew something was wrong the second he looked at her face. \u201cJordan? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his shirt and panted to get the words out. \u201cThere\u2019s a dead body in the trunk of our car.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>LLOYD WAS FOLDED UP LIKE A CONTORTIONIST. ONE LEG WAS bent underneath him, and the other was pressed against the back of his head. He died with the most startled look on his face, not pained, just startled, like a big glassy-eyed carp on the end of a fishhook. Jordan didn\u2019t think she was going to be able to get his expression out of her head for a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Jordan. Lloyd was a big man.\u201d Noah stood in front of the open trunk, peering down at the body. He glanced over his shoulder to look at her.</p><p>She sat on a stone wall, waiting for him to finish his inspection of the body. She refused to look at poor Lloyd a second longer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in a Ziploc bag,\u201d she commented weakly. She couldn\u2019t imagine why that was important to her, but at the moment it was.</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d Noah agreed.</p> <p>Chief Joe Davis stood beside him. The two men were now on a first-name basis. Murder had a way of cutting through formalities. Davis leaned into the trunk and then said, \u201cSo we agree? One blow, back of the head. Then he was stuffed into the trunk, right?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cLooks that way, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blow cracked his skull,\u201d Joe concluded. \u201cHad to be someone strong. Someone real strong.\u201d</p><p>In unison the two men turned and looked at Jordan. Were they wondering if she were strong enough to kill Lloyd? She folded her arms and frowned at Noah. He\u2019d better not be thinking such a crazy thought.</p><p>Joe looked at Lloyd again. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked in frustration. \u201cTwo bodies in what? Two days? Three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your first homicide?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cSecond if you count Professor MacKenna,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I didn\u2019t see the body, the investigation is on my shoulders now. This is the second murder Serenity\u2019s ever had. We\u2019re a peaceful community. That is, we were until your girlfriend hit town and men started dropping like flies.\u201d</p><p>Noah let Joe\u2019s assumption that Jordan was his girlfriend slide. \u201cYou know she didn\u2019t do this. She didn\u2019t kill either one of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLloyd was my primary suspect. He had her car in his garage, so he had the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about motive?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Joe shook his head. \u201cI hadn\u2019t figured that out yet. I\u2019m gonna get some help. I\u2019ve got two sheriff\u2019s deputies driving over, and they both have more experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith homicides?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve also got detectives from Bourbon on their way too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the coroner?\u201d Noah asked as he checked the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for forty-five minutes now. And where are the lab techs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings move considerably slower in small towns, you know that. Everyone has to come in to Serenity from other places. They\u2019re all on their way,\u201d Joe assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve got friends who can help.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cI know, and if I need the FBI\u2019s help, I\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sheriff Randy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be meeting with him this afternoon. We were gonna meet this morning. He called last night,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut now that I\u2019ve got to deal with this situation,\u201d he said, nodding to Lloyd, \u201cI had to push his meeting back and the meeting you and I have at MacKenna\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go with you,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Joe shook his head. \u201cNo. Randy knows me. He\u2019ll clam up about his brother around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s his brother? And don\u2019t try to tell me I won\u2019t be talking to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where J. D. is, but Randy will tell me. Then we\u2019ll decide what to do.\u201d</p><p>What was there to decide? J. D. had assaulted Jordan. He should be dragged into jail and locked up. Nothing much to decide about that.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t bring J. D. in, I will.\u201d</p><p>Joe cocked his head and frowned. \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d</p><p>Noah snapped. \u201cDamn right it is.\u201d</p><p>Joe put his hands up in a conciliatory gesture. \u201cOkay, okay. I hear you. But please, let me talk to Randy alone. I live in this town,\u201d he reminded him. \u201cI\u2019ve got to try to do this the right way, so let me take this one step at a time.\u201d</p><p>Unlike Joe, Noah didn\u2019t care or need to get along with anyone. He was about to tell him that he wasn\u2019t going to be patient and that, one way or another, he would be talking to both Dickey brothers, but Jordan drew his attention.</p><p>Jordan scooted off the wall and walked over to him. She brushed her hand down his arm, and said, \u201cJoe, Noah and I would like to help any way we can. Isn\u2019t that right, Noah?\u201d He glanced down at her. When he didn\u2019t respond, she leaned into his side and repeated, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Noah finally answered. This was one of the most absurd situations he\u2019d ever encountered. There was a dead man in the trunk, an inexperienced and possibly inept policeman running the investigation, and a woman who was slowly driving him nuts and now wanted him to be nice.</p><p>\u201cI guess you two will be staying on in Serenity a while longer,\u201d Joe stated. It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cYes, we will,\u201d Noah said. \u201cSo far Jordan\u2019s the only connection between the professor and Lloyd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go tell Amelia Ann we\u2019ll need the rooms again tonight,\u201d Jordan offered.</p><p>Noah grabbed her hand and pulled her back. \u201cYou stay close to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knows,\u201d Noah said as he tilted his head toward the window behind the wall. Amelia Ann and Candy were both watching, wide-eyed. Fortunately, from their angle they couldn\u2019t see inside the trunk of the car.</p><p>Joe suggested they both go back into the motel. \u201cYou two don\u2019t have to wait with me. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I\u2019m finished here and finished talking to Randy.\u201d</p><p>Noah put his arm around Jordan and headed inside.</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d Joe called.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be needing another car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks that way.\u201d Noah felt Jordan\u2019s shoulders slump under his arm. \u201cYou okay, Sugar?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she answered with a sigh. \u201cBut I\u2019m beginning to think this friendly little town isn\u2019t so friendly after all.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>ALTHOUGH AGENTS CHADDICK AND STREET FROM THE FBI\u2019s regional office hadn\u2019t officially been assigned to the investigation, they were doing as much as they could to help Noah figure out what was going on.</p><p>The two men brought Noah and Jordan yet another car, a Toyota Camry. Jordan, who was beyond spooked at this point, insisted that one of them open the trunk and have a look inside before she got into the car. Agent Street had a rather warped sense of what was funny. He thought it was humorous that Nick\u2019s sister had found another body and laughingly called her a corpse magnet.</p><p>Chaddick handed Noah a large manila envelope. \u201cEverything you asked for is in there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are copies of MacKenna\u2019s bank statements for the past year, but I\u2019ll go back further if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKenna was into something all right,\u201d Street said. \u201cFor eight months he\u2019s only made cash deposits. Five thousand dollars every couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he drove all the way to Austin to make those deposits,\u201d Chaddick added. \u201cHe also purchased a new car eight months ago, and the mileage indicates he\u2019s done some serious driving since then. One of the assistants at the college where he taught told me the professor received an inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange inheritance,\u201d Street said. \u201cCash every couple of weeks that can\u2019t be traced back to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his phone records?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the envelope too,\u201d Chaddick said. \u201cIn the six months that he lived in that house he only received a couple of telemarketing calls. No calls made out either, except for one very short call someone made a half hour before J. D. Dickey says he got a tip that there was a body in Jordan\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me someone called J. D. from inside MacKenna\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I called the professor,\u201d Jordan interjected. \u201cWhen I got to Serenity. He had given me his number. That call has to show somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what about cell phone records?\u201d Noah asked the agents.</p><p>Street answered. \u201cWe can\u2019t find any record of a cell phone listed in MacKenna\u2019s name. Jordan, if you\u2019ll give me the number you called, we\u2019ll check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went ahead and had a couple of our people process MacKenna\u2019s car. I\u2019m betting the only prints they find are his,\u201d Chaddick said. \u201cJoe Davis is in way over his head, but he won\u2019t ask for help from us. You want us to push our way in? We could take over and get you two out of here.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He looked at Jordan and reevaluated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it would be a good idea to take her...\u201d</p><p>Jordan knew where this was going and decided to nip it in the bud. \u201cI\u2019m staying here with you, Noah. Besides, I promised Chief Davis I\u2019d stay another day. For all we know, he might decide to arrest me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to do that, and if I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t negotiable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d To emphasize her decision she tried to stare him down.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lot like her brother,\u201d Chaddick commented, smiling.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lot prettier,\u201d Noah said. After thanking the two men for their help and promising to stay in touch, Noah opened the car door for Jordan, then circled and slid into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we have the time, I\u2019d like to drive to Bourbon and buy a new cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get along without a phone for a few more days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s my PDA, my camera, my Rolodex, my global positioning system, and, most important, my personal computer. I can access the Internet and e-mail. I can also send pictures or text or video clips electronically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what else you can do? You can make phone calls.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat too. And after I purchase a phone, I\u2019d like to stop by the police station and talk to the detectives and find out what happened to my laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick already talked to them. They said they never saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t just dance away. It was in my rental car, on the seat next to me. Maggie Haden must have seen it too when she went through my purse to get my identification. I\u2019ll bet she took it. She did go back to the grocery store lot when she locked me in a cell. She could have taken it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep looking, but for now we\u2019re meeting Joe Davis at MacKenna\u2019s house, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter he talks to Sheriff Randy,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t insist on being there when he talks to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in his brother.\u201d He handed her a slip of paper. There were two addresses with directions from the motel.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe we\u2019d drive by J. D. Dickey\u2019s place. See if he\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he is?\u201d</p><p>Noah started the engine and put the gear in drive. \u201cI\u2019d like to stop in and say hey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trying to fit in, Sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie Haden, your old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to drive by her house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got J. D.\u2019s license plate number. He drives a red pickup truck. He could be with her. You did tell me that she has a history with both Dickey brothers.\u201d</p><p>Jordan flipped on the air conditioner. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d she asked as she lifted the envelope Chaddick had given to Noah. \u201cI\u2019d like to look at his bank statements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. Add up all the cash deposits,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cIf it was five thousand dollars every two weeks for six months, that\u2019s sixty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>After she added all the deposits, the total was actually ninety thousand dollars. \u201cThe last two months the professor was alive, the deposits had increased in both amount and frequency. Where did the money come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the ninety-thousand-dollar question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he was into? You think maybe drugs? Or gambling? He didn\u2019t seem the type to get into either one of those vices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what type gambles? Was he the type of man to lie about getting an inheritance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead me those directions to Dickey\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Jordan did as he asked, spotted Hampton Street, and said, \u201cTurn right at the corner.\u201d</p><p>She then returned to speculating. \u201cThe professor told me that he had changed his plans and was leaving for Scotland earlier than he\u2019d originally intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was jumpy at dinner when he noticed how crowded the restaurant had become. I thought he might be claustrophobic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah slowed the car. \u201cThat\u2019s Dickey\u2019s place on the corner.\u201d</p><p>It was a ranch house, no larger or smaller than any of the other houses on the street, but certainly the nicest. It had recently been painted a dark gray, and the black shutters also had a fresh coat of paint. The roof was new, and the yard was surprisingly well tended. There was even a flower bed with blooming marigolds along the front of the shrubs.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be his house. It\u2019s so nice,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cThis is the address Agent Street gave me. It\u2019s Dickey\u2019s house all right. I guess, when he isn\u2019t beating up women, he takes care of his lawn.\u201d</p> <p>Dickey\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t parked in the gravel drive.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t expect to find him home, did you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wanted to see where he lived. I\u2019d sure like to look around inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she whispered as though admitting such a thing would get her into trouble. \u201cWe can\u2019t even look in the windows because the blinds are down.\u201d She bit her lower lip. \u201cI wonder if my laptop is in there.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d sounded so earnest, he tried not to laugh. \u201cSugar, you\u2019ve got to let it go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy laptop? I don\u2019t think so. I want it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have to get a new one.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. She\u2019d programmed the laptop, changed out all the chips, added a ton of memory. Her life was in there.</p><p>\u201cIf you lost your gun, how would you feel if I told you to let it go and get a new one?\u201d</p><p>Her laptop was obviously a sensitive subject. Noah let it drop.</p><p>\u201cGive me directions to Haden\u2019s house,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They only had to drive a couple of blocks. It was exactly as Jordan expected\u2014stark and uninviting. The yard was a combination of dirt, gravel, and weeds. Like Dickey\u2019s house, Haden\u2019s didn\u2019t have a garage, and there were no cars or trucks in her driveway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any desire to look inside her house,\u201d he said. \u201cShe probably sleeps in a coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, you really need to ease up. The police are looking for it.\u201d</p><p>He was right. She was obsessing about it. \u201cMaybe Haden packed up and left town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt she\u2019d leave. No, she won\u2019t give up that quickly. She had too much power to let it go without a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must know she couldn\u2019t possibly get her job back,\u201d said Jordan.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably gone off somewhere to think up a strategy to force the council to make her chief again right now.\u201d</p> <p>Noah turned the next corner and headed back toward the center of town. \u201cWhere do you want to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one place we can go. Jaffee\u2019s. There are other restaurants around, but if we eat anywhere else, he\u2019ll hear about it because they all talk to each other about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if he hears about it? What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis feelings will be hurt.\u201d She wasn\u2019t joking.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been so kind to me,\u201d she said, \u201cand I like him. Besides, you enjoyed the food, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, okay. We\u2019ll go to Jaffee\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He drove back to the motel and parked in the back lot. Jordan carried the envelope Chaddick had given them, as they made their way to the restaurant. When they passed Lloyd\u2019s Garage, she felt a shiver go down her spine.</p><p>\u201cFor a while there I thought Lloyd killed the professor and put him in my car, and that\u2019s why he was so nervous. I didn\u2019t know what his motive was, but I knew that eventually Chief Davis would find one. Now Lloyd\u2019s dead. Want to hear my new theory?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLloyd must have seen the murderer put the professor\u2019s body in the trunk of my car. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too enthusiastic, but I know what you\u2019re thinking. Why didn\u2019t the murderer kill Lloyd right away? Why did he wait? I think he didn\u2019t know that Lloyd had seen him, but if that\u2019s the case, how did he find out?\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t have to answer any questions. Jordan was doing that all by herself. She\u2019d pose the question, work it out in her mind, and come up with what she considered a plausible explanation.</p><p>Jaffee\u2019s place was nearly empty. There were just a few businessmen lingering over iced coffee as they discussed the news of the day. One of them was Kyle Heffermint, the man she had met at the insurance office.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any of these men?\u201d Noah asked as they walked past the front window.</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d she answered. \u201cKyle Heffermint. He\u2019s what I\u2019d call a name-dropper.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t have much use for anyone whose claim to fame was that he knew someone famous. \u201cI don\u2019t like name-droppers,\u201d he remarked as he opened the door for her.</p><p>The group stopped talking as Jordan and Noah walked past. She smiled at Kyle when he nodded to her, and continued to their table in the corner. Angela greeted them with her usual iced tea as the men continued to watch them. The waitress put her hand on her hip, glanced over her shoulder, and then looked at Jordan again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind them,\u201d said Angela. \u201cThey\u2019re just talking up the news of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they staring at me?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d replied Angela \u201cyou\u2019re easy to look at, being so pretty, and second of all, you\u2019re the news of the day. We all heard about you finding Lloyd and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought a blight on Serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say that. You just have a habit of finding dead people, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s kind of like that movie. You know the one where dead people talk to the kid? Except they don\u2019t talk to you. Either one of you in the mood for beef today? Jaffee\u2019s making beef burgers. He also made a big pot of beef stew.\u201d</p><p>Angela had just walked back into the kitchen to place their hamburger orders when Kyle sauntered over. The light reflecting off his belt buckle, as big as a Cadillac grille, signaled his approach.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Kyle. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>Jordan introduced Kyle to Noah. He shook his hand and then turned back to her. \u201cI understand you\u2019re going to be staying in town a little longer, Jordan. You think we might have dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no. I have plans with Noah. Thank you for asking though.\u201d</p><p>This time he didn\u2019t press. \u201cJordan, I heard about what happened to you, and I have to tell you, Jordan, I don\u2019t know what I would do if I ever found a body in my car, and look at you. You\u2019ve found two bodies. That\u2019s got to be some kind of a record, Jordan, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>While he talked to her, Noah put his arm around the back of her chair. Each time Kyle said her name, Noah gently tugged on a strand of her hair.</p><p>\u201cAgent Clayborne, I might have some information for you. I happened to drive by Lloyd\u2019s Garage the other night, and noticed a light on in his office. I thought to myself that it was mighty odd seeing someone in the office so late, \u2019cause Lloyd never worked late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see Lloyd?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cI saw a shadow of a man, Jordan, but I don\u2019t think it was Lloyd. I only saw him for a second or two. The shadow didn\u2019t seem to be as big or as wide as Lloyd.\u201d He raised both eyebrows as he asked, \u201cIs that information helpful to you, Agent Clayborne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJordan, I really would love to see you again. There\u2019s this\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah cut him off before he could say another word. \u201cShe has plans with me.\u201d</p><p>Jordan tried to soften Noah\u2019s curtness. \u201cThank you for asking.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Kyle walked away, she whispered, \u201cYou were rude to him. What came over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, nothing at all, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI told you he was a name-dropper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the hots for you,\u201d he said. He wasn\u2019t smiling. \u201cIn fact, it appears that half the men you\u2019ve met since you\u2019ve been in Serenity have the hots for you.\u201d Noah reached across her and brushed a strand of hair away from her face, his fingers gently touching her cheek.</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat. He had merely touched her, and she\u2019d reacted. She\u2019d always thought she was immune to his charm, but she was becoming worried that she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she answered incredulously. \u201cI\u2019m not the big attraction around here...you are. Carrie at the police station was all but standing on her head to get your attention. And what about Amelia Ann with her bottles of beer and her cinnamon rolls? She\u2019s definitely sweet on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she is,\u201d he admitted with a grin, \u201cbut I think you are too.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back. \u201cOh brother. Not every woman drops to her knees in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Too late she realized exactly what she\u2019d said. And she knew without a doubt he wouldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice fantasy. You think you\u2019d ever...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s cheeks turned bright pink. Her blush was lovely, he thought. He enjoyed embarrassing her because that\u2019s when she showed another side of herself, the side that was vulnerable and sweet and innocent. She was beautiful, no doubt about that, and every man in Serenity seemed to notice.</p><p>Why did that bother him? He wasn\u2019t the jealous sort. And he certainly had no reason to be jealous. Jordan was a good friend, that\u2019s all. So why did he get an uneasy feeling when he was with her? He didn\u2019t have an answer. How could he explain what he didn\u2019t understand? One thing he knew: he didn\u2019t like the idea of any man getting close to her.</p><p>Ah hell, he wanted her.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>JORDAN LOOKED THROUGH THE PROFESSOR\u2019S PHONE STATEMENTS while they ate lunch.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were hungry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely touched your food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis hamburger could feed a family of six. I ate as much as I wanted.\u201d She moved on to more important matters. \u201cI called Professor MacKenna when I got into town. This isn\u2019t the same phone number I called. And I remember Isabel told me that she and the professor often talked about the MacKenna clan. Her phone number isn\u2019t here either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he only used throwaways,\u201d said Noah. \u201cUntraceable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince he moved to Serenity the professor\u2019s life became untraceable.\u201d</p><p>She picked up a french fry and was about to take a bite, then changed her mind. She pointed it at Noah. \u201cAnd why did he move to Serenity? What made him choose this little town? Because it was so isolated? Or because it was close to something illegal he was involved in? We know whatever he was doing was illegal. Who makes a total of ninety thousand dollars in cash deposits?\u201d</p><p>He took the french fry and popped it into his mouth.</p><p>She thought about the various possibilities and said, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that whoever killed those two men is determined to keep me here. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Before he could answer, she said, \u201cWhy else would both bodies be put in my cars?\u201d</p><p>He loved watching her face as she thought aloud. She was so animated and eager. Over the past couple of years Noah knew he\u2019d become overly cynical, but in his line of work, it was only a matter of time before the calluses formed. He\u2019d learned not to get too close and not to expect anything, but he still hadn\u2019t quite figured out how to leave the work at work.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what we need?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cA suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Anyone come to mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ. D. Dickey\u2019s at the top of my list,\u201d said Noah.</p><p>\u201cBecause he knew the body was in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI had Street run his name, and J. D. did some hard time.\u201d</p><p>He told her what he\u2019d learned about J. D. When he was finished, Noah said that if Joe Davis didn\u2019t locate J. D. and bring him in for questioning soon, Noah was taking it out of his hands.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll stay on in Serenity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means Agents Chaddick and Street will take over the investigation. This is their district,\u201d he thought to add. \u201cAnd you and I will get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go back to work for Doctor Morganstern right away, or will you take a few days off and go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to go home to,\u201d he said. \u201cI sold the ranch after my father died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you call home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHere and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d she said. \u201cHere come the troops.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee and Angela were headed to their table. Jordan knew what they wanted, the gory details about finding Lloyd in the trunk. Fortunately, Noah was saved from having to answer a hundred questions because he got a call from Chief Davis.</p><p>\u201cGotta go,\u201d he said. He quickly paid the bill.</p><p>They were leaving the restaurant when Angela caught Jordan\u2019s attention and gave her the thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cShe still hasn\u2019t figured out I can see her reflection in the window,\u201d Noah commented, laughing.</p><p>\u201cAre we meeting Joe now?\u201d Jordan hurried to catch up.</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s twenty minutes away. That gives us enough time to get the boxes of research to MacKenna\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where Joe wants them. Probably because the police station is so small. No place to store them until he can go through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what he expects to find,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just historical research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still needs to look through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if we made a quick stop at the grocery store on the way to the professor\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t object, and while he carried the first two boxes to the car, she stuffed the last two hundred and some pages she needed to copy into her tote bag and carried the empty third box.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait in line at the store. As soon as she walked in, shoppers scurried to get away from her. They stood in clusters staring at her while they whispered. She heard one woman say, \u201cShe\u2019s the one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordan plastered a smile on her face and continued on to the photocopy machine. There had been a line\u2014one woman and two men had been waiting\u2014but as soon as they saw her coming, they scattered. Jordan was mortified. Noah thought the attention she was receiving was quite funny. She didn\u2019t. After all, she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. She made that comment to him once they were back in the car.</p><p>\u201cPeople do tend to die around you,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cJust two.\u201d She sighed. \u201cOh, God, did you just hear what I said? Just two? I\u2019ve become insensitive about the death of two men. What\u2019s happened to my compassion? I used to have some.\u201d</p><p>She finished separating the professor\u2019s papers from the copies and handed Noah the originals. \u201cWould you please put these back in the empty box?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to open the trunk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. Just do it, please.\u201d</p><p>She really wasn\u2019t afraid, she told herself. She was just skittish. She didn\u2019t want to admit it though. She stuffed the copies into her tote, put it on the floor, and sat back.</p><p>She was suddenly weary and feeling out of sorts. \u201cNick should be back in Boston by now,\u201d she said when Noah got back into the car.</p><p>He started the engine before he answered. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll call when he gets home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd when he does, you\u2019ll tell him about Lloyd?\u201d she asked and then promptly answered the question. \u201cOf course you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I just don\u2019t want him to get on another plane and come back. I also know he\u2019ll tell the rest of the family, including my parents, and they have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to worry about,\u201d Noah finished for her. \u201cJordan, it\u2019s okay for them to be concerned about you every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t comment. Instead, she stared out the window at the desolate landscape. The yards on the street they drove down hadn\u2019t weathered the heat well. All the lawns had burned patches of brown weeds and dirt.</p><p>What had Jordan been looking for when she came to Serenity? Her brother and Noah had both challenged her to step outside her comfort zone, but she wouldn\u2019t have paid attention to any of their suggestions if she hadn\u2019t been so discontent in the first place.</p> <p>Her life was so regimented, so organized...so mechanical. She knew what she wanted. The wow factor. The problem was, it didn\u2019t exist. At least not for her. She needed to get back home and stop thinking such crazy thoughts. Her life was mapped out for her. Structure. That\u2019s what she was used to and what she needed. Everything would be in perspective once she was in Boston again.</p><p>There was just one little problem.</p><p>Noah noticed her disheartened expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to get out of this town, am I?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>PROFESSOR MACKENNA HAD LIVED ON A QUIET, DEAD-END street about a mile off Main Street. It was a dismal setting.</p><p>There were no trees or shrubs or grass to soften the ugly tract houses, most of which were in dire need of repairs.</p><p>Chief Joe Davis was waiting for Noah and Jordan. The front of his shirt was soaked through. As Jordan and Noah walked to the front door, the chief pulled out a handkerchief and wiped the back of his neck.</p> <p>\u201cWere you waiting long?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, just a couple of minutes, but damn it\u2019s hot. Pardon me, ma\u2019am, for using a curse word in your presence.\u201d Joe unlocked the door. \u201cI\u2019ll warn you, it\u2019s even hotter inside. MacKenna kept all of his windows closed and his shades down, and he never turned on the air conditioner far as I can tell. It\u2019s a window unit, but it wasn\u2019t plugged in.\u201d He held the door open and cautioned, \u201cWatch your step. Someone really trashed the place.\u201d</p><p>Jordan fought the urge to gag as she entered the living room. The smell of overcooked fish mixed with some kind of metallic odor permeated the air.</p><p>The entire house couldn\u2019t have been more than eight hundred square feet. There was little furniture. A gray plaid sofa, so dilapidated Jordan thought the professor must have found it on a curb somewhere, had been shoved against the wall facing a picture window that had been covered with a white flat sheet. A square oak coffee table sat in front of the sofa, and there was one small round table with a lamp and a torn shade. An old Philips television set was on a crate in the corner.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if there was a rug in the living room or not. The floor was covered with newspapers, some yellow with age, and there were also ripped notebooks and shredded textbooks everywhere. Some piles of papers were a foot high.</p><p>They waded through the trash to get to the dining room around the corner. A large desk was its only piece of furniture. The professor had used a wooden folding chair, but someone had hurled it against the wall. It lay in fragments on the floor.</p><p>A power strip on the desk had five cell phone charge cords plugged into it. The cell phones were missing. Jordan nearly tripped over an extension cord. Noah grabbed her around the waist before she went headfirst into the desk.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>She nodded as she pulled away from Noah and walked toward the light-deprived kitchen. The smell was getting stronger, even fouler. There were dirty dishes in the sink, a feast for the roaches crawling over the counter, and trash overflowed from a shopping bag the professor had been using as a trash can near the back door. Garbage was decomposing in the sack.</p><p>Jordan backtracked through the living room and went down the hallway. There was a bathroom on one side\u2014surprisingly clean, considering the condition of the rest of the house\u2014and on the other side was a small bedroom. The drawers in the dresser had been ripped out and dumped on the floor. The double-bed mattress and box springs had also been overturned, both shredded with a knife.</p><p>Noah came up behind her, looked at the mess for about five seconds, turned around, and strode back into the dining room.</p><p>\u201cDo you think whoever trashed the place found what he was looking for?\u201d Jordan asked as she followed him.</p><p>\u201cHe? There could be more than one,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s missing, Jordan?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cBesides cleaning supplies? The professor\u2019s computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Noah.</p><p>\u201cThe cables are still here,\u201d Joe said. \u201cSee? On the floor behind the desk. And look at all those phone chargers. I\u2019ll bet the phones he was using were untraceable.\u201d</p><p>Jordan thought she saw something moving under one of the newspapers. A mouse maybe. She didn\u2019t freak. She wanted to, but she didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll be outside...getting fresh air.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait around for permission. Once she reached the sidewalk, she rubbed her arms and shivered over the thought that one of the insects might have gotten into her clothes.</p><p>Noah and Joe came outside ten minutes later. As Noah walked past her he whispered, \u201cMouse spooked you, didn\u2019t it, Sugar?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Jordan wished Noah wasn\u2019t quite so observant.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan, you want to open the trunk?\u201d Noah called from behind the car.</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d she called back.</p><p>His grin suggested otherwise. After he opened it, he turned to Joe. \u201cAre you sure you want to store the boxes here? They\u2019re going to be covered with bugs in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll seal them up tight,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple of deputies will help me go through everything in the house including the boxes, page by page. I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re looking for, but hopefully something will stick out.\u201d</p><p>Jordan suddenly remembered. \u201cChief Davis, I have a flash drive the professor gave me to take home. Will you need that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need everything that will give us a clue to the professor,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll see that you get it back.\u201d</p><p>He picked up one of the boxes and started up the sidewalk. \u201cI guess when we\u2019re finished with all this, I\u2019ll send it to a relative. That is, if I can find one,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s part of the MacKenna clan,\u201d Jordan said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t imagine any of them would claim the professor. He was kind of a nutcase.\u201d</p><p>She immediately felt guilty talking about the dead that way, but she was only being honest.</p><p>Joe paused at the doorway. \u201cDid you get a chance to read all of those papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I read a few accounts from each of the boxes, but that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Noah opened the car door for her and handed her the keys. \u201cYou go ahead and turn the air on. I\u2019m gonna be a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot angry, irritated. I\u2019ve been real accommodating, and as you know, that\u2019s a stretch for me, but I pulled it off, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile, but she wanted to. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Joe talked to Sheriff Randy Dickey, but he still hasn\u2019t said a word to me. That means he\u2019s made some kind of deal. So...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m through being accommodating. Get in the car.\u201d</p><p>Joe came outside then. Noah headed toward him as he locked the front door.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget to tell me what Randy Dickey had to say?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t forget. I thought maybe we could talk about it over a beer later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand. Up until the time his brother got paroled, Randy was doing a good job as sheriff. Folks were happy with him. But J. D.\u2019s a hothead, and Randy would like to give him a second chance to redeem himself. I agreed with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Joe said. \u201cUnless Jordan presses charges against J. D. for that hit she took, there\u2019s not a whole heck of a lot you or she can do. I\u2019m not being contrary. I\u2019m just telling you the way it is. And like I said before, I have to live in this town, and that means I\u2019ve got to get along with people in authority. Sheriff Randy can make my life miserable. It doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s in another county. He\u2019ll still do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. He sounds like a real good sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. He just wants a favor, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t get that favor, then he\u2019ll make your life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he said with his hands up. \u201cI know what I said. But J. D.\u2019s his brother,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll get bounced back to prison before you can snap your fingers if she presses charges, and Randy will be beholden to me if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want this job to be permanent.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked sheepish. \u201cMy wife says I shouldn\u2019t let my ego get in my way. I did get passed over before, but now I\u2019m chief,\u201d he said, \u201cand I could be talked into staying on if that\u2019s what the council wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to Randy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that to him, and he\u2019s okay with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay with it?\u201d Noah could feel his neck getting hot.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Joe, lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, no need to get your back up. Randy\u2019s out looking for his brother right now. Honest to God, he really doesn\u2019t know where J. D. is, and he told me he\u2019s worried sick that J. D. might do something foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ. D.\u2019s way past the foolish stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to turn up, and when he does Randy will bring him over to have a sit-down and work this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork this out? J. D. is a suspect in a homicide investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s my homicide investigation,\u201d said Joe.</p><p>Noah ignored the statement. \u201cThe timetable hasn\u2019t changed, Joe. Randy has until tomorrow to bring J. D. in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I can\u2019t find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS SORRY LIFE, J. D. WAS TRULY AFRAID. He\u2019d dug himself into a hole so deep he didn\u2019t know if he was ever going to be able to climb out.</p><p>The problem was his employer. The man scared the hell out of him. All he had to do was look at him in a certain way, and J. D. felt his blood run cold. He\u2019d seen that look back when he\u2019d been in prison. Lifers with nothing to lose had that attitude. Kill or be killed. That\u2019s what the look meant.</p><p>Cal had taught him to steer clear of those men, and on too many occasions to count, he\u2019d protected him from them. No one went up against Cal\u2014no one in his right mind, anyway.</p><p>Cal couldn\u2019t protect him now. J. D. was completely on his own, and his boss was no different from the killers he\u2019d hidden from in prison. The boss carried that same attitude all right, and he was more vicious than most. J. D. had watched him pick up the professor and throw him like a Frisbee into a wall. It wasn\u2019t so much his strength that scared J. D., it was the look in his eyes as he squeezed the life out of the man. J. D. knew that look would haunt his dreams for the rest of his life.</p><p>Greed had gotten the MacKenna man killed, and greed had made J. D. a willing accomplice to a murder. Now was too late for regrets. He was in that hole, and he could feel the dirt pouring in to bury him.</p><p>The boss had made J. D. get rid of the body and had ordered him to keep the woman in town until he could find out what she knew. J. D. could only think of one way to do that. He\u2019d frame her for murder. His brother would keep her in jail then. That had been J. D.\u2019s plan, anyway, but it all went south when the woman found the body while she was in the wrong county. He knew he\u2019d overreacted when he saw the phone in her hand, but all he could think of was getting it away from her. No, that wasn\u2019t true. He hadn\u2019t been thinking. If he had been, he never would have hit her.</p><p>Like a fool, he thought Maggie would be able to fix things his way. She was the chief of police after all, and he knew she would do whatever he told her to do.</p><p>Bad luck followed bad luck, Cal used to say. J. D. understood what that meant now. Maggie couldn\u2019t fix anything after she got fired. Her power was gone. As if that wasn\u2019t enough bad luck, the Buchanan woman was connected to the FBI.</p><p>He had dreaded telling the boss about the woman\u2019s brother and the other FBI agent, who was sticking to her like bad perfume on a new jacket.</p><p>Fortunately for J. D., the boss already knew about the FBI. He told J. D. that it didn\u2019t matter how many FBI agents were in town, J. D. still had to keep her here until he could get her alone and interview her. The way he\u2019d drawn out the word \u201cinterview\u201d made J. D. wish he could run away. But it was too late for that. Much too late. The incident with Lloyd had seen to that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was no coincidence that J. D. had run into Lloyd as the mechanic was packing his car to get out of town. Maggie had tipped him off that Jordan Buchanan was telling everyone who would listen that Lloyd had acted mighty suspicious when she\u2019d picked up the car. She\u2019d even suggested Lloyd knew the body was in the trunk.</p><p>J. D. had only wanted to talk to Lloyd to find out what he\u2019d seen, yesterday, but the second Lloyd spotted him, he ran inside and tried to barricade himself in his house.</p><p>\u201cI just want to talk to you, Lloyd,\u201d J. D. had called out.</p><p>\u201cGo away or I\u2019ll call the sheriff,\u201d Lloyd shouted. \u201cI ain\u2019t fooling! I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you forget where you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of question is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live in Jessup County, you moron, and that means if you call the sheriff, you\u2019ll be calling my brother. And you know he\u2019ll do anything I ask him to,\u201d he lied.</p><p>Lloyd cursed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d J. D. shouted. \u201cYou let me inside and we\u2019ll have us a talk. I\u2019ll wait real patient right here until you make up your mind. I\u2019m not going to hurt you, Lloyd.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou hurt that other man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I swear I didn\u2019t. He was already dead when I found him. Someone...I\u2019m not saying who, told me to put him in the woman\u2019s car. That\u2019s all I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I believe you, will you let me leave town?\u201d Lloyd asked. \u201cJust until this blows over and that FBI man leaves Serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was hoping you would do. You know, leave town until the FBI gets out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why do you need to come inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d said J. D. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. If you want, you can call me and tell me where you\u2019re holed up, and if it isn\u2019t too far away, I\u2019ll send over one of my best girls to keep you company. She\u2019d spend at least one whole night taking care of you. I can give\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll call you,\u201d Lloyd eagerly blurted.</p><p>J. D. knew Lloyd was watching him through the peephole, so he didn\u2019t smile. Convinced that he wouldn\u2019t call Chief Davis or the sheriff, he sauntered back to his pickup. Then he drove around the corner, turned off the motor, and waited for Lloyd to leave so he could tail him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t killed him. He\u2019d simply made a phone call and told the boss where Lloyd could be found. As far as J. D. was concerned, he had done nothing wrong. He\u2019d just shared some information.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>CRIPPLE CREEK BAR AND GRILL HELD THE OFFICIAL COUNTY record for having the most animal heads hanging on its walls. A couple of stuffed rattlers even hung from the rafters. At one time there had been more, but the ceiling fans had played havoc with them, and the customers didn\u2019t appreciate chopped snake skin occasionally raining down on them while they drank at the bar.</p><p>Agent Street had given Noah directions to the bar, suggested he and Jordan ignore the d\u00e9cor, and promised the pizza at Cripple Creek was the best in the state. The chef, he explained, was a transplant from Chicago.</p><p>The fa\u00e7ade resembled a large log cabin big enough to accommodate Paul Bunyan. The interior reminded Jordan of a ski resort. High, open ceilings with exposed beams and a balcony that overlooked the dance floor were all constructed from knotty pine. The air was heavy with the scent of pine air fresheners, and a band played twangy country-and-western songs from a small, raised platform tucked in the corner.</p><p>As though it were the most natural thing in the world to do, Noah took hold of Jordan\u2019s hand and pulled her along as he threaded his way through the crowd.</p> <p>Agent Street stood by a booth near the back. Noah waited until Jordan slid into the booth before he sat next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the folder, Agent Street?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Bryce,\u201d he insisted, and was about to answer her question when the waiter appeared to take their drink orders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re off duty, right?\u201d Bryce asked Noah.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t officially been on duty for a couple of days now. I\u2019m just helping out a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a beer then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he answered. \u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiet cola would be nice.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the waiter walked away, Bryce said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of information about the Dickey brothers. Randy\u2019s okay, but J. D. has had trouble with the law off and on for years. He\u2019s been in a lot of fights, but one bar fight landed him in prison.\u201d</p><p>Noah waited to hear something new. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Bryce continued, \u201cis that J. D.\u2019s former cellmate, a man named Calvin Mills, is still doing twenty to life for murder. Cal, as he\u2019s called, worked for a security company. He was really into all kinds of surveillance equipment, knew all the latest gadgets. Cal liked to drive by his house a couple of times a day to listen to his wife chatting it up on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t trust her,\u201d Jordan surmised.</p><p>\u201cAs it turned out, ole Cal had good reason not to,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHe parked down the street one afternoon and listened to her pillow talk with a man she\u2019d met at work. Cal later told the detectives he might have been able to forgive her the affair if she hadn\u2019t been making fun of his...equipment.\u201d He shot Jordan a quick glance before continuing. \u201cAccording to Cal, his wife called his manhood a cocktail wiener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would do it all right,\u201d Noah drawled, leaning back. \u201cSo he killed her, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure did,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately for him, the judge was a man, so Cal didn\u2019t get as much time as he might have.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cThe judge was sympathetic.\u201d</p><p>Jordan couldn\u2019t tell if they were joking or serious. \u201cThe man killed his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Noah said, \u201cbut still, you just don\u2019t make fun of a man\u2019s equipment.\u201d</p><p>Bryce was in full agreement. It was only when Noah winked at her that she knew he was teasing.</p><p>The drinks arrived, and after they placed their order for a couple of specialty pizzas, Bryce continued. \u201cCal taught J. D. everything he knew about surveillance. He took a real interest in J. D. One of the guards said Cal thinks of himself as some sort of technological guru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find out anything about J. D.\u2019s finances?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHe made a lot of cash deposits over the last six months, but unlike MacKenna, J. D.\u2019s deposits were never more than a thousand dollars at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmail. That\u2019s what he was doing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cHe was listening to people\u2019s conversations and then blackmailing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my guess,\u201d Bryce agreed.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could get inside his house,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, without a warrant you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Bryce handed Noah his notes and said, \u201cHere\u2019s everything I\u2019ve got so far. If you need anything else, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Noah said, \u201cI appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to do it,\u201d Bryce replied. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally work with you. You and Nick Buchanan are practically legends in the agency. I\u2019ve heard about some of your cases, and you\u2019ve got quite a track record.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s expression turned somber. \u201cI wish it were better. They don\u2019t all work out the way we want.\u201d</p><p>Bryce nodded his agreement. \u201cI know, but some do. I heard what you did with the Bains case in Dallas. It was all the talk for a while. I also heard recently that Jenna Bains is at SMU this year.\u201d</p><p>A smile creased the edges of Noah\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s doing great.\u201d</p><p>Jordan had been listening to the conversation with interest. \u201cWho\u2019s Jenna Bains?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Noah answered. \u201cA kid who didn\u2019t deserve what she got.\u201d</p><p>Bryce saw Jordan\u2019s puzzled look at the vague answer Noah had given and said, \u201cJenna Bains was a kid whose parents died when she was young, and so she was sent to live with her only relative, an uncle, who just happened to be a crack dealer. Things got really bad at the uncle\u2019s house. He was strung out most of the time, and some thugs moved in and took over his operation. Jenna spent a couple of years with these scumbags. When they didn\u2019t have her locked up in a closet, they used her as their personal slave. Finally, the authorities got wind of the drug operation and moved in, but unfortunately, the leader of the gang was tipped off and got away before the raid. He took Jenna with him as a bargaining chip. That\u2019s when Noah and your brother were called in. The guy had Jenna for over two months and kept moving around, so it was hard to catch him, but they finally tracked him down at an abandoned apartment building. I heard, when they got there, Jenna was pretty beat up and unable to say much.\u201d He looked at Noah for verification.</p><p>Some of the anger that he had felt back then resurfaced, and Noah said, \u201cShe was scared out of her mind. She hung on to me for dear life, and all she could say was, \u2018Don\u2019t leave. Don\u2019t leave.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Bryce looked at Jordan again and continued. \u201cWhen Jenna was released from the hospital, Social Services stepped in, but Noah found her a home with a great family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were friends of mine,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cI knew she\u2019d be in good hands. I just didn\u2019t want to see her get caught up in the system after all she\u2019d been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, from what I\u2019ve heard, someone anonymous has paid her college tuition. And the rumors say it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t respond to Bryce\u2019s comment. \u201cJenna\u2019s a great kid. She wants to become a teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a fine thing you did,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>Noah dismissed the compliment with a shrug. \u201cA lot of people would have done the same.\u201d</p><p>The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of the pizzas. Jordan could only eat one slice, but as Bryce and Noah devoured the rest, they continued talking about the Dickey brothers.</p><p>Jordan sat back against the wooden bench and listened, but she wasn\u2019t really hearing what the two men were saying. She was looking at Noah. She\u2019d always known that he was dedicated to his work, and she had definitely seen the fun-loving side of him, but there obviously were things about him she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Noah finished his beer and ordered a bottle of water. She watched as he crossed his arms and leaned his elbows on the table, listening intently to Bryce\u2019s suggestions about the investigation. He had the loveliest profile, she thought. And when he smiled...</p><p>Oh dear, she knew what was happening. Where was Kate when she needed her? On her honeymoon, of course. Kate could talk some sense into her, but she wasn\u2019t here, and Jordan suddenly realized she was in big trouble. She was becoming a Noah Clayborne groupie.</p><p>She wondered what it would feel like to be kissed by him. To be touched...to hold on to...</p><p>\u201cJordan, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>The question jarred her. \u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo leave,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Bryce, it was a pleasure,\u201d Jordan said, smiling. \u201cI know you\u2019re doing a lot of the legwork on your own time, and I want you to know how much I appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, but you don\u2019t have to thank me. You\u2019re Nick\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>The three of them walked outside together. Bryce said goodbye at the door. \u201cWhen\u2019s the deadline again?\u201d</p><p>Noah answered. \u201cTomorrow, noon. If I haven\u2019t talked to both Dickey brothers by then, you take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was quiet on the ride back to the motel. A couple of times Noah glanced over at her and asked if she was okay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t though. Inside, she was a colossal wreck. All Jordan could think about was Noah. She needed to get back on course. No more crazy thoughts about him. No more wondering what it would be like to sleep with him. Don\u2019t go there, she told herself. But the more she warned herself not to obsess, the more she thought about him.</p><p>Yoga. That\u2019s what she needed. When she got to the motel, she\u2019d take a quick shower, put on her pajamas, then sit in the middle of the bed in the lotus position. She\u2019d breathe deeply and clear her thoughts. And he would not intrude. She would be in charge of her thoughts, not him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think something\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He began to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re glaring at me, Sugar.\u201d</p><p>She came up with a lame excuse and stared out the window the rest of the way to the motel.</p><p>She carried her tote bag into her room and stopped abruptly. The door into Noah\u2019s room was open. Noah\u2019s bed had been turned down, and there were chocolates on his pillow. Her bed hadn\u2019t been touched.</p><p>She shook her head and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Amelia Ann isn\u2019t in bed waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he walked into his room. \u201cShe\u2019s not my type.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to ask him what his type was but resisted; instead, she grabbed her pajamas and headed into her bathroom.</p><p>She actually felt better, and her thoughts were less jumbled by the time she finished showering and washing her hair. She even took time to dry it.</p><p>While she was removing the bedspread, she saw Noah on his phone. Every now and then, she heard him laugh. She thought he might be talking to Nick. She\u2019d just gotten settled on her bed with her stack of photocopies when Noah strolled into her room.</p><p>\u201cNick wants you to call him on his cell phone. Wait a couple of minutes though. He had Morganstern on the other line.\u201d He handed her his phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to get in the shower. No matter what, do not open that door for anyone. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already gone into his bathroom before she remembered to ask him if he\u2019d told Nick about Lloyd. Of course he had. Still, he might have left the news for her to impart. She didn\u2019t want Nick to come back to Serenity. If all went well, she\u2019d be on her way back to Boston sometime tomorrow.</p><p>After she had organized the rest of her research copies, she dialed her brother. Nick picked up on the second ring.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste time on a greeting, but answered with, \u201cFound another one, huh?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>JORDAN SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BED, READING YET ANOTHER chilling account of a terrible battle between the Buchanans and the MacKennas. Each clan had called up its allies and had gone to war in hopes of annihilating the other. She was so caught up in the story she didn\u2019t notice Noah standing in the doorway watching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah told himself to turn around and go back into his room, but he couldn\u2019t make himself move. She drew him to her, and she didn\u2019t realize it. He loved being near her, talking to her, listening to her crazy stories and theories, and he loved watching her smile. The most wondrous thing about her was her ability to make him laugh. No other woman made him feel the way she did.</p><p>She was damned pretty, he decided. Even when\u2014like now\u2014she was wearing glasses. He didn\u2019t know why they were such a turn-on to him, but they were. If she had them on when he ran into her on Nathan\u2019s Bay, he\u2019d look over the top of her head so he wouldn\u2019t be distracted. Once Dr. Morganstern had noticed what he was doing and had commented on it. Now Noah wondered if the doctor had known Noah was attracted to Jordan before he did.</p><p>When had she stopped being his partner\u2019s kid sister and become the amazingly sexy woman he wanted to take to bed?</p><p>He knew what he was going to do before he took one step into her room. He didn\u2019t give a damn about the repercussions. He barely made a sound as he walked to her bed, placed his gun and holster on the side table, and sat next to her.</p> <p>Jordan glanced over and smiled. He looked relaxed in his worn-out Levi\u2019s and pale gray T-shirt. She watched him get settled. He put both pillows behind his neck and gave them a couple of whacks to get them just so. Yawning loudly, he stacked his hands on his chest and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cComfy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cRead me a bedtime story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis story is pretty brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like brutal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo surprise there,\u201d she teased. \u201cThe date\u2019s iffy, but this war supposedly took place sometime between 1300 and 1340. The MacKenna laird claimed the Buchanans had stolen another treasure from them. This treasure was a piece of land near the MacKenna holding that the laird believed should have been given to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gave the land to the Buchanans?\u201d</p><p>Jordan shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say. The MacKenna laird stewed about this atrocity for months and months. Then, one afternoon in the early fall, a young Buchanan was captured on their land.</p><p>\u201cThe MacKenna laird decided to hold the boy for ransom. If the Buchanans gave up the slice of land, he\u2019d return the boy. That was the plan, anyway, until some of the MacKenna warriors, in their enthusiasm, accidentally killed the boy. That\u2019s how it was written,\u201d she said. \u201cThey meant to torture him, but had wanted to keep him alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the Buchanans agree to give the land back before the boy was killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have time to agree or disagree. When they heard one of their young was murdered, they gathered their forces and went to war. They were always fighting with the MacKennas, but this was different. The MacKenna laird knew he was in for it, and he called up all of his allies. It doesn\u2019t give the number of clans, but three are named.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the Buchanans?\u201d</p><p>She scanned down the page in front of her. \u201cThey called up one ally. I\u2019m not sure if it was because they only had one ally or because they only needed the one. The MacHughs. The name alone sent terror through the MacKenna clan. The MacHughs were thought to be inhuman and indestructible. They were much more ruthless than the Buchanans, or so it says.</p><p>\u201cThe battle took place on a field near Hunter Point. The Buchanans and the MacHughs were hopelessly outnumbered, and the MacKennas foolishly believed they would make quick work of slaughtering the entire two clans.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s back ached. She fell back and rested on Noah\u2019s shoulder. She held the paper up and continued on.</p><p>\u201cThe MacKennas and their allies were sadly mistaken about the odds being in their favor. The MacHugh clan didn\u2019t believe in showing any mercy. After all, the MacKennas had butchered a child. Nor did the Buchanans show mercy,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen it was finished, there were body parts strewn over the field; the ground itself was covered in blood. To this day, the area is called Blood Field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the MacKennas then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat was left of the clan fled,\u201d she said. \u201cThey returned to the field the next day to collect their dead and give them a proper warrior\u2019s burial, but there weren\u2019t any bodies to collect. They were all gone. And therefore there could be no sacred warrior burial ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they ever find them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. She leaned up on an elbow and looked into his eyes. \u201cAnd back then, if a warrior wasn\u2019t given a proper send-off, he couldn\u2019t go to the hereafter. He would be condemned to roam in the \u2018other world\u2019 for eternity, forever alone and forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many were killed? Does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut if any of this story is true, can you imagine what it would have been like to walk around the field...a field soaked with blood, picking up body parts? An arm here, a leg there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA head...\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could be a couple of benefits. No reading scumbags their Miranda rights or having to watch a judge let them go on a technicality. Back then, if you knew someone was guilty, you got rid of them. Simple as that. You know what else? If the story has a thread of truth in it, I don\u2019t care how many warriors were killed on that battlefield. There isn\u2019t a number high enough to justify killing one child.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were still closed, so it was okay for her to stare at him. He wouldn\u2019t notice. He was so sexy, so rugged. She forced herself to look away. This could go nowhere, she told herself. But she wanted him. He\u2019d break her heart and leave her devastated, she warned. No thank you.</p><p>She was no groupie. No, she absolutely was not. Truth was, she\u2019d gone way past that stage. She was falling in love.</p><p>Suddenly in a panic, she quickly swung her legs over the side of the bed, gathered up the papers, and took them to the table. She stacked them next to her satchel and then walked back to the bed. \u201cNoah?\u201d she whispered as she poked him in the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t you fall asleep on me.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond. She poked him again. \u201cI want to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She was about to give him a harder poke when he reached up and grabbed her wrist. Before she could respond, he pulled her down on top of him. He wrapped his arms around her and rolled her onto her back. His knee nudged her legs apart, and he stretched out between her thighs, bracing himself on his elbows as he looked down at her flushed face.</p><p>Her heart raced. She went completely still and waited to see what he\u2019d do. Don\u2019t let go, she frantically thought. \u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, Sugar.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut and groaned. \u201cI said that out loud, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He gently removed her glasses, and his hard chest rubbed against her br**sts as he leaned over to put them on the table next to his gun. When he began to nuzzle the side of her neck, shivers cascaded down her arms and legs. His breath was sweet and warm against her skin, and when he tugged on her earlobe, she felt a jolt of longing all the way down to her toes.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d she whispered as she tilted her head so he could have better access. She reached up, caressed the back of his neck, and tugged on his hair. She wanted him to kiss her on her mouth.</p><p>He lifted up. \u201cWant me to stop?\u201d</p><p>She pretended to give the matter her utmost attention. \u201cNo.\u201d Jordan reached up and kissed his chin. \u201cI was just saying it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>She was sorry she\u2019d said anything because now she worried he would come to his senses and stop touching her. She desperately wanted and needed him to hold her and make love to her.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d His voice was a rough whisper.</p><p>Oh, God, he was going to stop. She swallowed. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth for me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. He waited for her to make up her mind.</p><p>Any guilt or worry about the consequences of her actions flew from her thoughts. There was only room for Noah. She stared into his beautiful blue eyes and slowly pulled him toward her.</p><p>It was all the encouragement he needed. His mouth settled on hers in a kiss that was warm and soft and undemanding. And wonderful. But soon it wasn\u2019t enough for him. One taste of her sweet mouth made him crave more. His tongue swept inside and rubbed against hers. He took his time leisurely exploring her mouth until even that wasn\u2019t enough. He tightened his hold on her and the kiss deepened.</p><p>He was voracious, and he believed he was the aggressor until he felt her pulling on his T-shirt. Did she want him to stop? With a groan he lifted his head. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d His voice was raspy.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOff. Everything off.\u201d</p><p>The warm glint in his eyes made her shiver. His thumb swept across her lower lip. \u201cYou taste good, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He tugged her shirt up over her br**sts and pulled his own T-shirt at the same time, but elbows and hands got in the way. He was suddenly eager and hot, as though it were his first time. He knew how to please a woman\u2014God knows he\u2019d perfected his technique over the years\u2014but this was different. Jordan was different. The need to be with her made him ache. He\u2019d never felt this way before.</p><p>His shirt came off first, but hers quickly followed. She wasn\u2019t shy with him or hesitant. She stroked his back, his shoulders, his arms. He could feel her heart pounding, and when he touched her breast, she arched against him and moaned softly.</p><p>Her legs moved restlessly against his. He kissed the side of her neck and slowly moved lower, taking his time, teasing, tormenting. His tongue gently tickled her collarbone, and when at last he reached her breast, he felt her tighten around him.</p><p>He began to slowly drive her out of her mind. She had no idea her br**sts were so sensitive, but with each stroke of his tongue, she lost a bit more control.</p><p>He was losing his control as well. He took a deep, shuddering breath and passionately kissed her. His hands actually trembled. He kissed her again\u2014hard, quick\u2014and then pulled away.</p><p>\u201cBe right back...\u201d A quick kiss, and he rolled over. \u201cI want to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing now. As soon as he got up, she wrapped the pillow in her arms and hugged it to her chest. One kiss, she thought, and she had melted. She sighed. Noah certainly knew how to kiss. No other man had ever made her feel the way he did.</p><p>The bed sagged when he returned to her. He tugged the pillow away, and she didn\u2019t resist. She rolled onto her back, her gaze locked on his. His hands moved to her waist and slowly pushed her shorts down. He threw them off the bed. He\u2019d already removed his pants, and as he moved between her thighs and stretched on top of her, the feel of him made her forget to breathe.</p><p>Her hands caressed his back, her touch feather light, until his mouth settled on hers again. Her touch quickly became more frantic. She clutched his shoulders, demanding that he stop tormenting her.</p><p>\u201cNoah.\u201d She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d shouted his name or sighed it. His hand had moved between her thighs, and he was driving her out of her mind. He knew just where to touch, exactly how much pressure to exert. She writhed in his arms, pleading with him to come to her.</p><p>She was desperate to feel every inch of him, to wrap herself in his warmth. His breathing became more labored, and that excited her even more. She would die if he continued to torment her.</p><p>Noah delayed as long as he could, to give her as much pleasure as she was giving him. Her response made it impossible to wait any longer. He knew she was ready. Her nails scored his shoulders, and she arched against him. His mouth covered hers and he moved between her thighs and slowly sank into her liquid heat. She was so tight, so hot, he groaned from the sheer bliss. He stayed completely still inside her, panting as he whispered her name.</p><p>When he came to her, she cried out. The ecstasy was overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cAh, Jordan.\u201d He breathed her name. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t content to let him catch his breath. Every nerve in her body was clambering for release. She lifted her knees to take him deeper and began to move.</p><p>Oh, how she wanted to please him, to make him as crazed as she was. She bit his shoulder, kissed him on the mouth, and moved to his neck. She was panting now. He pulled back and thrust deep again, and tears came to her eyes, she was staggered by the intensity of the feelings gathering inside her. His movements became more powerful, more all-consuming, more demanding. It was exquisite.</p><p>Even in the throes of raw passion Noah had always been able to control his reactions, to set his pace. But he couldn\u2019t control what was happening to him now. He thrust into her again and again, powerless to slow down.</p><p>She was every bit as passionate as he. Tension built within her, ready to burst with the need for release.</p><p>Wave after wave of sensation poured over her. She\u2019d never experienced anything like it. She let it sweep her away, like a roller coaster plunging to the ground and jolting every nerve, the waves of pleasure coursing through her.</p><p>Noah kissed her, then buried his face in the crook of her neck, slow to recover. \u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>A curse word...and yet, she felt as though she\u2019d just been caressed.</p><p>He was panting against her ear. Or was that her panting? She was so shaken, she couldn\u2019t hold a thought. The man had turned her into a blithering idiot.</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t want to let go of him. Not ever.</p><p>He rolled to his side and pulled her against him. Noah held her and stroked her, his touch tender now. Neither spoke, both content for the moment. The minutes ticked away, and she fell asleep in his arms.</p><p>In the middle of the night, she awoke. He was still there.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>A BOOMING CRASH AWAKENED JORDAN FROM A DEEP SLEEP. She bolted upright in bed fearing the motel room had just been split in half. It was pitch-black. Groggy and dis-oriented, she couldn\u2019t make sense of anything.</p><p>A thunderbolt shook the ceiling and actually made the bed shudder. She jumped up, then relaxed. It was just a storm. A flash of lightning lit up the window and another sonic boom followed. The clock radio on the bedside table indicated it was five o\u2019clock. Too early to get up.</p><p>The storm was a worry. It seemed to be increasingly violent. The rain beat against the window like a stranger\u2019s frantic knocking, and the wind picked up and began to howl.</p><p>Was a tornado coming? She\u2019d never been in one, but she\u2019d seen several on the weather channel. Would a siren alert them? Did Serenity even have a siren? She pushed a clump of hair out of her eyes and tried to think about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thunder exploded again, the sound ricocheting around the room. Even storms were bigger in Texas, she thought.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Noah whispered. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d He gently pulled her down next to him, put his arm around her waist, and dragged her up against him until her back was pressed snugly against his chest.</p><p>Go back to sleep? Impossible. She was stark na*ed and in bed with Noah. Sleep was the last thing on her mind. The memory of their lovemaking filled her thoughts. My God, she\u2019d had sex with Noah...over and over again. She sighed softly. It had been amazing...and astonishing...and perfect, but there had also been a stunning discovery. Who knew that sex could be so wonderful? She certainly hadn\u2019t known until Noah. Just thinking about the way he had touched her made her whole body shiver...and crave more.</p><p>It had seemed the most natural thing in the world to fall asleep in his arms. She\u2019d felt so safe and protected. And loved, she admitted. She\u2019d felt loved. If being loved by Noah, even for one night, was a fantasy, she wanted to indulge. What was the harm? She was a big girl. She could protect herself.</p> <p>She remembered all the wonderful things they had done, the different ways they had made love, and her heart raced. He was a voracious lover. There wasn\u2019t anything he wouldn\u2019t do or coax her into doing. He wasn\u2019t the least bit shy with her and had proved it again and again. Around two he\u2019d nudged her awake...or had she awakened him? She didn\u2019t think there was an inch of her body that he hadn\u2019t kissed or touched.</p><p>Apparently she was also insatiable. She had become a wild woman in his arms, and knowing Noah, Jordan would never be able to live it down.</p><p>She rolled over and kissed the base of his neck, her mouth lingering on the pulse. She loved his scent\u2014so sexy, so male\u2014and the taste of his warm skin. She kissed him again, but that didn\u2019t seem to get much of a reaction until she began to caress him. Her mouth and her fingertips trailed down his chest, circled his navel, and moved lower.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Sugar.\u201d</p><p>Did that mean he wanted her to stop? She pulled back. \u201cDo you want...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah, I want.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her onto her back and covered her with his body. He kissed her hungrily and showed her just how much he wanted her. Their lovemaking was as fierce as the storm raging around them.</p><p>Thoroughly sated, she collapsed on top of him and fell asleep.</p><p>It was nine o\u2019clock in the morning when he shook her awake. She rolled over to kiss him, opened her eyes, and saw him walk away. He was fully dressed.</p><p>\u201cGet moving, Jordan,\u201d he called. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>No kiss. No words of endearment. Not even a \u201cgood morning.\u201d She watched him disappear into his room and then rolled onto her back and stared at the ceiling. Why hadn\u2019t he kissed her?</p> <p>Don\u2019t go there, she told herself. Don\u2019t let what happened last night become part of something much bigger...like falling hopelessly in love with a man who never, ever would commit to a lasting relationship. Last night had been earthshaking, but things had a way of changing in the bright light of day.</p><p>She groaned loudly as she stretched and forced herself to get up and stagger into her bathroom.</p><p>Halfway through her shower, her mind cleared. Noah had certainly been blas\u00e9. In fact, his attitude had bordered on indifferent. She thought about it while drying her hair. He had told her to get moving, but that was it. He hadn\u2019t even said where they were going. Were they leaving town? She slipped into a skirt and a fitted pale blue blouse. She hoped they were leaving town. She needed to get out of Serenity and away from this man before she became so emotionally attached that she turned into what she most despised, an NCG, a clinger. She would never let that happen. By the time she\u2019d applied sunscreen and a little makeup and lip gloss, her resolve was firmly in place. She grabbed her lens case and went back into the bedroom. Noah was on the phone.</p><p>She waited in the doorway until he finished the call. \u201cWhere are we going? Should I pack and check out?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and didn\u2019t look up as he secured his gun and holster. \u201cWe\u2019re to meet Sheriff Randy at ten,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll check out when we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me grab my key and my glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still on the nightstand,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>And that comment was as close to an acknowledgment that he had been in her bed as she was going to get.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he said. He grabbed his room key and headed for the door.</p><p>She picked up her purse and shoved her things inside. How could he be so unemotional about last night? And how come she was so frickin\u2019 emotional? She could feel her heart beginning to sink, but she braced herself and followed after him.</p><p>She knew what Kate would say. Her friend would tell her it was simply the difference between men and women. And maybe she would be right. But that didn\u2019t matter. Noah\u2019s behavior still stung, and his attitude was not only insensitive but also downright mean. The big jerk. Okay, now she felt better. She had placed the blame where it belonged. Noah was the one with a problem, not her. She frowned at him as she walked out the door. He didn\u2019t seem to notice she wasn\u2019t in the best of moods, or if he did, he didn\u2019t mention it.</p><p>They broke protocol and ate breakfast at a run-down diner on the east side of town. Everything looked greasy, even the orange juice. Jordan settled on a slice of toast and hot tea. Noah, on the other hand, had a Texas-sized breakfast.</p><p>She nibbled on her toast and stared at him from across the table.</p><p>\u201cSomething bothering you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She slowly nodded.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAre you gonna tell me what it is, or am I supposed to guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had sex last night. Lots and lots of sex.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, she\u2019d made the emphatic statement just as the waitress was placing the bill on the table. The older woman with big hair giggled like a young teenager. Jordan was mortified and could feel her face heating. Noah\u2019s smile turned into a broad grin, and there was a sparkle in his eyes. He was getting a real kick out of her discomfort. As soon as the waitress walked away, no doubt to tell the other employees about the slut at table three, Noah said, \u201cYes, we did.\u201d</p><p>She sat back. \u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted. An acknowledgment.\u201d</p><p>As far as she was concerned, the subject was closed. She folded her napkin and placed it on the table, checked the time, and said, \u201cWe\u2019d better hurry. It\u2019s almost ten.\u201d</p><p>The cook was staring at her through the order window, as were the two waitresses huddled together behind the counter. Jordan kept her head high as she walked out.</p><p>She knew that Noah didn\u2019t understand why she needed an acknowledgment, but that didn\u2019t matter to her. From this moment on, they were going to go back to the way things used to be. He would be her brother\u2019s friend and partner, and she would be a boring but decidedly happy woman who lived in a safe comfort zone.</p><p>Noah had just slid in behind the steering wheel when he noticed her scowl. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had a revelation,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about comfort zones...my comfort zone. You know, that place you said was so boring and safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is boring and safe. I remember what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was wondering\u2014what was missing from my dull, boring life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that too, she admitted to herself. \u201cBesides sex,\u201d she said, disgruntled.</p><p>\u201cFun? Laughter? Hot sex?\u201d</p><p>He was maddening. \u201cYou already said sex,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cMy mistake,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Ignoring his sarcasm, she continued. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what was missing. Dead bodies, Noah. There were never any dead bodies in my comfort zone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>J. D. USED TO BRAG TO HIS BROTHER THAT IF HE DIDN\u2019T WANT to be found, he wouldn\u2019t be found. He knew all the best hiding places in and around Serenity.</p><p>Randy knew about some of J. D\u2019s hidey-holes, but he didn\u2019t know about all of them. For example, J. D. had never told Randy about the abandoned mine he\u2019d accidentally found last year when cutting across Eli Whitaker\u2019s land. He\u2019d known he was trespassing, but since Eli hadn\u2019t yet put up a fence, J. D. figured it was all right, especially if he didn\u2019t tell anyone.</p><p>The mine had become his own private getaway. When he was there, he was pulling one over on Eli, and that made J. D. feel good. It wasn\u2019t right the way Eli gobbled up all the prime land and had all that money.</p><p>J. D.\u2019s second home wasn\u2019t much to look at, but he liked it just fine. He\u2019d put down a couple of old sleeping bags and brought in a cooler he\u2019d periodically fill with ice and beer. His only other accessories were two flashlights and extra batteries. He didn\u2019t want to run out of light at night when he was reading his girly magazines. He was proud to admit he didn\u2019t read the articles. Looking at the nudie girls was all he wanted or needed.</p><p>He even entertained the notion of bringing a couple of the girls from The Lux out for a little howdy-do. He didn\u2019t though. He liked having a secret place only he knew about.</p><p>The location was perfect. The mine was just far enough outside of Serenity to be forgotten, but close enough to keep a signal on his cell phone. The last couple of days he\u2019d had to be on twenty-four-hour call in case his employer needed something.</p><p>He considered calling Randy several times to find out if there was a warrant out for him, but every time he\u2019d start to punch in the numbers, he\u2019d change his mind. He just didn\u2019t want to listen to another long lecture. Besides, the boss would find out if there was a warrant out for J. D. or not. He had connections all over town, and at most it would only take a couple of phone calls to find out if that Buchanan bitch had decided to go after him.</p><p>Fortunately the disposable phone he\u2019d stolen from Professor MacKenna\u2019s house had the number taped on the back. The boss was the only person who knew it.</p><p>J. D. was getting anxious waiting to hear from him. Not only would he find out if he was wanted by the police but also today was payday, and he sure could use the cash.</p><p>He practically jumped on the phone when it rang.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d the boss said.</p><p>\u201cTo the house?\u201d J. D. asked.</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cYes. That\u2019s where we agreed to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll leave right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember to park at least three blocks away and walk over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d J. D. promised. \u201cDid you remember today is payday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. We have a lot of loose ends to tie up before nightfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d J. D. said. \u201cDid you find out anything about a warrant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new chief isn\u2019t going to let two murders go unsolved. I was thinking we ought to come up with a couple of names. If there was a way to pin those murders\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got someone in mind to take the fall, but to pull it off I\u2019ll need your help. We should be able to wrap it up within a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d figure something out. You\u2019re so smart about stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had practice. Now, hurry up. We\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>WHEN JORDAN AND NOAH WALKED INTO THE POLICE station, Sheriff Randy was in Chief Davis\u2019s office trying to pace in front of the desk. Since the office was so small, he could only take two steps forward and two back.</p><p>Noah made her stay behind him as he entered. She knew Noah didn\u2019t want to give J. D. another opportunity to punch her.</p><p>But J. D. was nowhere in sight. Joe spotted them and waved. \u201cCome on in,\u201d he called out.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t waste time on introductions. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d Randy said. \u201cI swear to you I\u2019ve looked high and low for him, and I\u2019ve left at least five messages on his home phone and twice that many on his cell phone telling him to come in, and that it was going to be okay because Miss Buchanan agreed not to press charges...\u201d He tried to see around Noah. \u201cI was right, wasn\u2019t I, Miss Buchanan? Joe told me you weren\u2019t going to press charges.\u201d</p><p>Although Noah took up most of the doorway, she was able to squeeze in next to him. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying my best to help J. D. make some good decisions, but it\u2019s an uphill battle.\u201d</p><p>He sounded sincere and contrite, and Jordan suddenly felt sorry for him. It must be awful trying to keep his punch-happy brother in line.</p><p>Randy once again addressed Noah. \u201cI know he messed up, but he\u2019s my brother, and the only family I have. I really am trying to help him move forward and stay out of trouble. I thought he was on the right path. He was closing down The Lux, and that\u2019s a real positive step.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t care about that. \u201cHow did he know there was a body in Jordan\u2019s car trunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ. D. told me he got a tip on his cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know exactly what J. D. told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to go fishing, and I went by his place to pick him up. He came tearing out of his house and told me about the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho called him?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cDid he tell you who the tip was from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman,\u201d Randy answered. \u201cIt took a long while for me to get that much out of him. He wouldn\u2019t tell me her name though. J. D. said he had to protect her, that he\u2019d promised. To be honest, I don\u2019t know if he was telling the truth or not.\u201d He added fervently, \u201cI hope to God he was.\u201d</p><p>Looking defeated now, Randy leaned back against the desk. \u201cJ. D. is always looking for the big score. He has this pipe dream to buy a ranch. He doesn\u2019t know the first thing about ranching, but that don\u2019t matter to him. He thinks he\u2019s clever, but he isn\u2019t, and that\u2019s why he gets into trouble. He\u2019s done some real stupid things, and he\u2019s got a temper, that\u2019s for sure, but he wouldn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to prison because he killed someone,\u201d Joe pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt was a bar fight J. D. didn\u2019t start. That was bad luck all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad luck seems to chase J. D., doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Joe remarked. \u201cI\u2019ve got the sheriff\u2019s deputies combing the county looking for him,\u201d he told Noah. He suddenly noticed Jordan. \u201cWhere are my manners? Jordan, come on in here and have a seat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine where I am,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cAll right then. Noah, I\u2019ve been thinking about the woman J. D. said called him. Now that\u2019s something Maggie Haden would do. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of her,\u201d Randy said. \u201cShe hooked up with J. D. right after I got married. She got real hateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was always hateful, Randy,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p> <p>Randy shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for her too. Her cell phone goes directly to voice mail, and she doesn\u2019t have an answering machine at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you wanting to get hold of her?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Randy looked over his shoulder at the chief. \u201cWhy do you think? She might know where J. D. is. That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019d ever call her again.\u201d Randy stood. \u201cI\u2019ve got to head back to my office. I\u2019ll keep looking for J. D., but if you and Joe find him, call me right away. I\u2019m worried about him.\u201d</p><p>Noah got out of the way so Randy could get past him.</p><p>The sheriff walked to the door, hesitated a second or two, then turned around and looked at Noah. \u201cCould I have a word with you in private?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>He followed Randy out to his car, and the two men stood there talking for several minutes.</p><p>Joe took a phone call while Jordan waited for Noah\u2019s return. \u201cWhere\u2019s Carrie?\u201d she asked when he hung up the receiver. \u201cTaking a break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s back in prison,\u201d Joe said. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to send me a replacement tomorrow, but until then the calls I don\u2019t catch get forwarded to Bourbon.\u201d</p><p>Since his office was not big enough to accommodate a second chair, Jordan leaned against the door frame. \u201cWhy is she back in prison? She was part of a work release program, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, she was,\u201d he said. He moved some papers out of his way and rested his elbows on the desktop. \u201cAs one of Maggie\u2019s last vengeful acts, she called the prison and gave Carrie a terrible evaluation. Said she was incompetent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you think she was?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe had trouble learning the computer, but she was good enough with the phones and taking messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you get her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie also accused her of stealing supplies, but I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, you have to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d he said.</p><p>Not good enough, Jordan thought.</p><p>The minute Noah came into the station, she told him about Carrie. She didn\u2019t have to ask him to do something about it because she knew he would.</p> <p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything more we can do here,\u201d Noah said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to check out of the motel and get on the road. I want to get Jordan to the airport and back to Boston. If you need anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come back, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgents Chaddick and Street will come in on this if you need them to. All you have to do is ask.\u201d</p><p>Shaking Noah\u2019s hand, Joe said, \u201cI wish you could stay around, but I understand you wanting to leave and get back to your life and your job.\u201d He turned to Jordan. \u201cEventually there\u2019ll be a trial. You\u2019ll have to come back for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Relief washed over Jordan when they walked out of the station. She was finally going to leave Serenity.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take either of them long to pack up their things. Noah planned to put the bags in the car and then check out with Amelia Ann. A phone call changed the plan.</p><p>\u201cNoah, it\u2019s Joe. The MacKenna house is on fire.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>\u201cWHAT IN GOD\u2019S NAME IS GOING ON?\u201d JOE\u2019S VOICE SHOOK when he asked the question. He stood with Jordan and Noah on the sidewalk across the street from MacKenna\u2019s tiny rental house, watching the roaring fire consume it.</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cWe had a good long rain last night. It should have soaked that roof and kept it wet, but it sure didn\u2019t. Look at it burn.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a fire eat up a house this quick.\u201d</p><p>They could use another storm right now, Jordan thought. She shielded her eyes with her hands and looked up at the sky. Not a cloud in sight. The sun was bright and beating down on them mercilessly. As usual, the desert sun was hot and unforgiving.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Joe muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d</p><p>Although there wasn\u2019t any doubt in his mind that the fire had been set, he still wanted and needed confirmation.</p><p>\u201cLook at the way it\u2019s going, all four sides of the house burning straight up like that. It\u2019s like it was napalmed.\u201d Joe pulled his attention away from the fire and looked up at Noah. \u201cI know the fire chief will have to make the call, but I\u2019m betting he\u2019ll say it\u2019s arson. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks that way,\u201d Noah said without hesitation. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say a very powerful accelerator was used to get it started and keep it going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever seen a house burn so quick,\u201d Joe repeated, clearly impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t get it though. Why burn it down? The detectives and the crime scene crew from Bourbon went through the house from top to bottom, and any evidence they found they bagged and took to their lab. You were in there too. You saw what was left. Just old papers and used-up furniture. Did you see anything worth burning? I sure didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Joe moved so he could see Jordan, who was standing on the other side of Noah. \u201cSorry about those boxes of papers. I know you were hoping you could have them.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t correct his misconception. Joe had obviously forgotten that she\u2019d made copies. Either that, or he thought she still had more copies to make, but it no longer mattered. The hard copies of his research would have gone into the professor\u2019s estate, and she no longer needed them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would go to this much trouble burning a house to get rid of some old history papers,\u201d Joe concluded.</p><p>Jordan watched the volunteer firemen. They\u2019d given up trying to save the professor\u2019s house and were frantically working to keep the house next door from catching fire. If the wind picked up, the entire block could go up in flames.</p><p>\u201cDid you make sure all the neighbors got out?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cOld lady Scott was the only one who gave me any trouble. She wouldn\u2019t let me get near her to help her down the steps. One of the firemen carried her out kicking and screaming. You know what I heard her say? She didn\u2019t want to miss her stories on the television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t she let you near her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t think anyone does enough for her. She\u2019s a real pain in the neck. She calls Sheriff Randy one day, me the next complaining about something or other. Doesn\u2019t care whose jurisdiction it is. Anyone walks through her yard, front or back, and she has a fit. Calls it trespassing. She called me the other day about kids trampling on her flowers by the front porch.\u201d He pointed to the right. \u201cHer house is two down from MacKenna\u2019s. Now I ask you, would you call those weeds flowers?\u201d</p><p>Noah wanted to get him back on track. \u201cDid you talk to the neighbors? Ask them if they saw anyone hanging around MacKenna\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t interviewed all of them yet,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI only just got here a few minutes before you, and I was busy getting everyone out of their houses. I\u2019ll start asking questions now. Would you mind helping me with that?\u201d He walked toward the group of people clustered together at the corner and then stopped. \u201cI\u2019m in over my head here,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the experience, and I can\u2019t be everywhere at the same time. I think maybe I could use some help from your FBI friends. Why don\u2019t you go ahead and call them?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s about damned time, Noah thought. \u201cBe happy to,\u201d he said instead. He made the call immediately, before Joe could have second thoughts. He got Chaddick\u2019s voice mail and left a message for him to call.</p><p>As they walked toward the neighbors, Jordan asked, \u201cWhere are the deputies? I know the Grady sheriff is in Hawaii, but didn\u2019t you ask his deputies to lend a hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re helping,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now they\u2019re combing two counties looking for J. D. He could be hiding in one of about a thousand places, but they\u2019ll keep at it until they find him and bring him in for questioning.\u201d</p><p>MacKenna\u2019s neighbors were eager to tell what they knew, but unfortunately none had seen anything out of the ordinary. One woman had noticed a carpet cleaning van drive down the street, but she was pretty sure it had driven on to the next block.</p><p>Mrs. Scott had information, but every time Joe tried to talk to her, she turned her back on him and looked up at the sky. It was left to Noah to charm her, and that only took a couple of smiles and a look of sympathy when she went into a rant about her flowers.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I did see someone,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw that no-good Dickey boy cut through my backyard today. I saw him as clear as he could be. I was standing at my kitchen sink making my cherry Kool-Aid drink because I like to have my Kool-Aid while I watch my programs.\u201d She paused to glare at Joe before continuing. \u201cThen I saw the Dickey boy sneak past. He was carrying something that had a big handle, like a gas can. I was all set to open my back door and yell at him to get off my property, but he was moving so fast, he was gone before I could get my second dead bolt undone. Not five minutes later I hear shouting about a fire, and people start banging on my front door, so I got out of my La-Z-Boy and turned up the volume on my television so I could hear my programs.\u201d Once again, she shot Joe a glare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain it was J. D.?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain I\u2019m not talking to you,\u201d she snapped. \u201cNow if this nice gentleman were to ask, I\u2019d say, yes, it was Julius Dickey. That ten-pound belt buckle he always wears was plain to see. It was him.\u201d</p><p>Joe and Noah thanked the various neighbors and headed down the street. Jordan stayed behind, talking to a few of the women. Noticing she wasn\u2019t with him Noah turned around and saw Mrs. Scott wagging her finger in Jordan\u2019s face. He backtracked to tell her it was time to leave.</p><p>\u201cAre we leaving the street or leaving Serenity?\u201d Jordan asked after saying her good-byes to the neighbors.</p><p>He honestly didn\u2019t know. Though he was anxious to get her out of town and on a flight back to Boston, Jordan was at the center of this craziness, and until Noah understood why the killer was hell-bent on implicating her and keeping her in Serenity, he wasn\u2019t going to leave her alone for a second. The thought popped into his mind that he never wanted to leave her.</p><p>He shook his head, trying to clear it.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what Mrs. Scott called me?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>He slowed down. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018You there.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she wanted to know why \u2018you there\u2019\u2014that would be me\u2014came to Serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo wreak havoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Serenity,\u2019 she said, \u2018used to be a peaceful place.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you came to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would also like to know when I\u2019m leaving. I believe she plans to stay inside and keep her doors locked until I do.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSoon,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on the road in a couple of hours. Joe asked me to wait until Chaddick and Street get here. He\u2019s nervous. It\u2019s a big case, and he doesn\u2019t want to mess up. I know you\u2019re ready to take off...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...conflicted,\u201d she said with some hesitation.</p><p>\u201cYeah? How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to leave, but I also want to find out who, what, and why. And I have a funny feeling the answer\u2019s right in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can read all about it in the papers when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>The comment about the papers triggered something in Jordan\u2019s memory, but it was too elusive to catch hold.</p><p>\u201cAfter you drop me at the airport, are you going to come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, I\u2019m not dropping you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her toward the car. She glanced over her shoulder and saw Joe standing in the middle of the street, talking to a fireman.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the plan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you all the way to Boston, so no, as much as I would like to help, I won\u2019t be coming back. This isn\u2019t my area of expertise anyway. Chaddick\u2019s the man in charge now\u2014or will be as soon as he returns my call\u2014and he knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s been at it awhile, and he\u2019s got a lot of experience.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the keys when they reached their car. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you turn the motor on and get the air conditioner going? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Jordan got behind the wheel, started the engine, and adjusted the air-conditioner dial. She watched Noah in the side mirror. Now he and Joe spoke to the fireman. Then Joe pulled out his cell phone and made a call as Noah headed back to the car. Shaking his head, he looked frustrated. He walked to the passenger side, but she climbed over the console and motioned for him to drive. Sweat trickled down his neck, so she turned up the fan and adjusted a vent to blow directly on him.</p><p>\u201cHow come you don\u2019t want to drive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTraffic,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate driving in traffic.\u201d</p><p>It took a second to realize what she\u2019d said. He laughed. \u201cWhat constitutes traffic in Serenity? Three, four cars in front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I just hate to drive.\u201d Before he could comment, she asked, \u201cWhat happened with Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting a warrant to go into J. D.\u2019s house. He\u2019s talking to a judge in Bourbon now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in there with you,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I bet I\u2019ll find my laptop. And if I do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething,\u201d she said. \u201cAll my files are on it, all my accounts...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried someone can get private information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s encrypted. No one could get into my files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you so worried about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know that with all the right information and data, I can figure all of this out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was looking out the window. \u201cI wonder how long it\u2019s going to take Joe to get in his damn car and drive to J. D.\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say about five seconds.\u201d The calculated guess was based on the fact that Joe was sprinting toward them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s signed,\u201d he shouted at Noah. \u201cBut we could go in anyway. A neighbor just called in. J. D.\u2019s front door\u2019s wide open.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, they were on their way.</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t someone call Sheriff Randy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to Joe.\u201d</p><p>She shifted in her seat. \u201cThe sheriff did a complete turnaround. He was almost...humble at the police station, but back when he drove into the lot with his brother and saw J. D. hit me, he was pretty obnoxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing a fast dance trying to keep his brother out of trouble. He knows...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnows what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJ. D.\u2019s a lost cause. I understand his loyalty though. It\u2019s his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes J. D. have that kind of loyalty? I bet not. Sheriff Randy would be better off with J. D. back in prison.\u201d She rubbed her arms as though to ward off a sudden chill. \u201cIf J. D. happens to be inside his house, you be careful. There was something crazy in his eyes. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. He was hateful...and creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet him. I can be pretty damned hateful too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, he\u2019s innocent until proven guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hit you. That\u2019s what I remember.\u201d</p><p>Joe pulled into J. D.\u2019s driveway. Noah pulled in behind him. \u201cYou wait here. Keep the doors locked,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>He moved fast. Pulling the gun from his holster, he held it to his side and met Joe at the front door. \u201cWe go in, you head left, I\u2019ll go right.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s heart skipped a beat as Noah, gun in hand, rushed into the house. She told herself that everything would be fine. He was a federal agent, trained to protect himself. She\u2019d heard stories about some of the harrowing situations he\u2019d been in, and he had the scars to prove it. He knew what he was doing. He\u2019d be fine. She nodded to reinforce the thought. Still, freak accidents happened, and sometimes there were unexpected surprises...some not the good kind.</p><p>She was working herself into a state, as her mother would say. Then Noah walked outside and everything really was fine. J. D\u2019s house was so small, it had only taken a few minutes to make certain no one was there.</p><p>She unlocked the car door for him. He pulled it open and said, \u201cIt looks like J. D. left in a hurry, and the door didn\u2019t catch. Wait until you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>Joe interrupted, running from the house into the yard shouting, \u201cThey found J. D.!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>AND THEN THERE WERE THREE.</p><p>J. D. Dickey was found in the ashes. The firemen discovered what was left of him underneath a pile of still-smoldering rubble near what used to be the back door of the professor\u2019s house. They were soaking the last embers when they spotted his remains. The only reason they knew for sure that it was J. D. was the gaudy belt buckle. Its edges were melted and blackened, but the rhinestone initials were still legible.</p> <p>Jordan sat in the car in front of the smoldering ruins of the collapsed house and watched Noah. He was standing in the front yard talking to Agent Chaddick and Joe while they waited for the FBI\u2019s crime scene crew to arrive. He looked over at Jordan every once in a while to make sure she was okay.</p><p>Three corpses in one week. Professor MacKenna. Lloyd. And now J. D. Dickey. The boast that Serenity was a safe and peaceful place to live had just been shot to hell. And the town blamed Jordan Buchanan. After all, she was the only connection between the murders and the fire. She wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the residents showed up at her motel room with pitchforks and torches to run her out of town.</p><p>She could still hear Old Lady Scott\u2019s accusations. Never had a murder before she came to town...never had a fire like the one that consumed the MacKenna house. Oh, and they never had car trunks full of dead people\u2014before Jordan came to town.</p><p>Statistics don\u2019t lie. This was more than a run of bad luck. It was a curse of biblical proportions. Even she wanted to get away from herself. Jordan knew such superstition wasn\u2019t logical, but nothing about this situation was logical. Just one thing was certain: Since Jordan had met the professor, she had become a one-woman plague.</p><p>It was impossible to predict what would happen next, but while she waited for Noah, Jordan tried to do just that. It was a frustrating exercise because she didn\u2019t have sufficient data, and the horrifying images from the last few days kept breaking into her thoughts. To think clearly again, she needed to erase these pictures from her mind. She reached into the backseat for a folder from MacKenna\u2019s research and began reading.</p><p>Noah glanced at her and saw her head down, poring over a paper. He had told her to stay in the car, that he didn\u2019t want her to see J. D.\u2019s incinerated remains. He didn\u2019t think he would ever forget her reaction. She\u2019d looked stunned and then had very quietly asked, \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name would you think I would want to see a charred body?\u201d</p><p>Why indeed? It was a gruesome sight. And while neither Noah nor Chaddick were the least affected by the scene, Joe was having difficulty keeping it together. His face was a shade of gray that Noah had never before seen, and he kept making gagging sounds.</p><p>Noah took pity on him. \u201cJoe, you\u2019ll feel better if you don\u2019t look at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s like a car wreck. I don\u2019t want to look, but I do anyway.\u201d</p><p>Chaddick was exasperated. \u201cYou\u2019re a cop,\u201d he reminded him. \u201cYou come up on a wreck, you\u2019re supposed to look, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>One of the volunteer firemen motioned them over from the front yard. His name was Miguel Moreno, and he was a retired fireman from Houston who decided late in life to own a ranch. He\u2019d trained the volunteers, which was why they were so well organized, quick to respond, and efficient. Since he\u2019d taken charge, none of his firemen had sustained a single injury. He\u2019d already walked through the rubble several times and was ready to tell Noah what he thought.</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t any doubt that J. D. set the fire, but I\u2019m willing to bet he didn\u2019t know his way around such a volatile accelerator. If he did, he sure wouldn\u2019t have ignited it while he was still inside the house.\u201d</p><p>Joe stepped away from the body. \u201cJ. D. could have accidentally started the fire too early,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThe way I see it\u2014he gets inside and he soaks everything down real good, and then he\u2019s thinking he\u2019ll go out the same way he came in, through the back door. Once he\u2019s outside, he\u2019d toss something in to get the fire going, like maybe a rag dipped in kerosene or maybe some rolled-up paper he was gonna light up.\u201d</p><p>Moreno nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cJust needed one spark to get a flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything could cause a spark,\u201d Joe said, now eager to share his theories. \u201cMaybe when he opened the door to leave, the friction from the metal threshold against his boots made a spark...that would have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly an arson expert can say for sure what happened,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cYou have any of those coming to Serenity, Agent Chaddick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d he replied. \u201cJoe, you think you can handle this with Moreno? Keep the area sealed until my crew gets here? I want to head over to Dickey\u2019s house with Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it,\u201d Joe assured him. \u201cHas Agent Street found anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know as soon as I get over there.\u201d</p><p>Joe followed Noah. \u201cNoah, you have a second?\u201d</p><p>Noah turned back. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the agents will want me to step back now that they\u2019ve taken over?\u201d he asked in a low voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in their way, but...\u201d He ended the sentence with a shrug.</p><p>Noah motioned to Chaddick. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we find out right now?\u201d</p><p>Joe looked embarrassed when he put the question to the agent. Chaddick, the more diplomatic of the two agents, glanced at Noah before answering. \u201cI know you have heard stories about how we\u2019re bullies and roll over the locals when we take charge, and most of those stories are probably true,\u201d he added with a grin. \u201cWe don\u2019t like local interference, but Noah told me this is a different situation. You and Street and I will work this together.\u201d</p><p>Joe quickly nodded. \u201cI sure appreciate it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great opportunity to learn from the experts.\u201d</p><p>That settled, Noah headed back to his car. The windows were down, and he could see Jordan reading some papers while she sipped from a bottle of what was no doubt lukewarm water. Poor Jordan had been waiting a hell of a long time for him to finish up, but she hadn\u2019t complained or tried to hurry him along.</p><p>Jordan saw him coming and quickly gathered up the papers she\u2019d spread over the seat. She was so hot, she thought she was going to have a heatstroke any second now. She hadn\u2019t wanted to keep the engine idling with the air on for such a long time, and so she had turned the motor off and prayed for a little wind to push the heat around.</p><p>Earlier, despite Noah\u2019s orders, she had momentarily slipped out of the car to sit under the shade of a walnut tree, but the stares from the crowd that had gathered across the street made her uneasy. Whispering to one another, they never took their eyes off her. Who knew what they could be saying? Probably something about tar and feathering or burning at the stake.</p><p>When she and Noah had driven from J. D.\u2019s over to the professor\u2019s house, she\u2019d offered to return to the motel and wait for him. All he had to do was call her and she\u2019d drive back, but he wouldn\u2019t hear of it. He didn\u2019t want her out of his sight, and from the steel in his voice, she knew it would be pointless to argue.</p><p>Noah got behind the wheel, started the engine, and flipped on the air. Then he turned to her. Her face was flushed. She\u2019d pinned her hair up, but the tendrils at the back of her neck were damp. Her clothes stuck to the curves of her body, and her skin glistened. She looked both utterly beautiful and wilted. It made him feel guilty for what he was about to do.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to ask this of you, but I really need to get back over to Dickey\u2019s house. I want to go through it\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to explain. You need to do this, and I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t push him to take her back to the motel because she knew he\u2019d again refuse. He\u2019d insisted that she stay with him, and if that helped him get the job done, she\u2019d cooperate.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t notice the time until he was pulling up to J. D.\u2019s house. The day was getting away from him. He couldn\u2019t believe how long they\u2019d been at MacKenna\u2019s house, and he knew he\u2019d spend as much time if not more going through J. D.\u2019s place.</p><p>He parked behind Chaddick\u2019s car and said, \u201cWe may have to stay another night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she assured him. \u201cWe can leave first thing in the morning.\u201d How many times had she thought that?</p><p>Already inside, Chaddick came to the front door and called out, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love this.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded back to him before speaking to Jordan. \u201cIf you want, you can come inside,\u201d he said, \u201cbut don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>NOAH HADN\u2019T SEEN THIS MUCH SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT since he had been at Quantico.</p><p>Agent Street was in awe. \u201cFrom what I\u2019d heard about this guy, I had him pegged as an idiot, you know? But now...\u201d His eyes swept the room with all the spying tools lying about. \u201cSome of this stuff is pretty sophisticated and complicated to use. By the look of things, I\u2019d say he knew what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly was he doing?\u201d Jordan stood just inside the door, surveying the gadgets Chaddick had pulled out of a box and placed on the floor.</p><p>Street tossed Noah a pair of gloves as he answered Jordan\u2019s question. He pointed to what looked like a tiny satellite dish. \u201cThat\u2019s a parabolic microphone. Lets you hear conversations at least three hundred yards away.\u201d</p><p>Noah walked over to get a closer look. \u201cIt\u2019s got a built-in tape recorder and an output jack,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how many private conversations he listened to,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just listening in,\u201d Street said. \u201cWait until you see his video collection. He had cameras set up in a room in that sleazy motel he ran and filmed customers with his girls. We\u2019ll probably find the cameras in the smoke detectors or the ceiling lights.\u201d</p><p>Chaddick nodded. \u201cDid you look at any of the videos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d he answered. \u201cGood quality. Film wasn\u2019t grainy at all.\u201d He sounded clinical about it. \u201cGraphic stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Jordan whispered. Just being inside J. D.\u2019s house made her feel like she could catch something.</p><p>\u201cCheck out these binoculars.\u201d Noah picked up a pair and examined them. \u201cThere\u2019s an amplifier attached. Pretty high-tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Chaddick agreed. \u201cJ. D. could watch and listen at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd record,\u201d Street added. \u201cSome of this stuff is brand-new. Batteries aren\u2019t unwrapped yet. I\u2019d say he was setting up to do some real serious business. It\u2019s a given he was into blackmail. And with all this equipment, he had to have a list of his clients, right? How else could he keep track of who paid what, when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Chaddick surmised. \u201cDid you find any notebooks or papers?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m guessing he stored everything in his computer.\u201d</p><p>Chaddick looked surprised. \u201cHe\u2019s got a computer? Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the den behind the kitchen. You didn\u2019t notice it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten past all these gadgets.\u201d</p><p>Jordan wasn\u2019t paying much attention to the conversation. She was thinking about the cash deposits J. D. had made into his own bank account. The professor was putting large amounts of cash into his account, but J. D. never deposited any more than $1,000 at a time. Had he just started his venture? And where did he get the money to buy this kind of equipment? It had to be expensive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked to the window and looked out at the street while she tried to figure out the relationship between the professor and J. D.</p><p>After Noah had gone through the last box, he stood and asked Street if he\u2019d had time to get into the computer.</p><p>\u201cI got it up and running, but I can\u2019t get into any of the files. He\u2019s blocked access. We\u2019ll have to take it with us and get one of our techs to work on it. That will take a big chunk of time.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d He turned toward the window. \u201cJordan, would you mind breaking into a computer for us?\u201d</p> <p>She looked over her shoulder. \u201cBe happy to,\u201d she said, thankful she could be of use. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen to be a laptop, would it?\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>\u201cSugar, didn\u2019t we talk about letting that go?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJust asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think you can do it?\u201d Street asked.</p><p>\u201cI really do.\u201d</p> <p>She followed Noah into the den. The computer was a new model, and Jordan was impressed. Carrie had told her the prison had offered her computer classes, but she hadn\u2019t been interested. Maybe J. D.\u2019s place of incarceration had offered him the same training. And if it had, it looked like he had paid attention.</p><p>Noah pulled a chair up to the keyboard for her. \u201cGo to it.\u201d</p><p>It only took a second for her to pull up J. D.\u2019s files. Opening them would take longer.</p><p>\u201cCall me when you\u2019re in,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>He went back into the living room with Chaddick. Street stayed behind and watched Jordan\u2019s fingers fly over the keys. Symbols and numbers filled up the screen. He didn\u2019t know what she was doing, but she did, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>Jordan lost track of time as she concentrated on the computer screen and the task at hand. Finally, she broke through.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d she called out.</p><p>A folder opened just as Noah put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cWhat have you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA list,\u201d she answered. She leaned closer to the screen. \u201cHe kept records.\u201d</p><p>Standing, Jordan moved out of the way so that Street could sit. Her back was stiff, and she noticed it was getting dark outside. How long had she been sitting there? She arched backward to stretch.</p><p>Chaddick leaned against the side of the desk. \u201cDoes it tell us anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d Street replied. \u201cI\u2019ve got first names only, no dates but days of the week, offenses, payoffs, and some locations.\u201d He began to laugh. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, if all these people live in Serenity, this town\u2019s a real hotbed of activity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s on the list?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a Charlene paying four hundred dollars on a Friday at an insurance office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharlene? Why did she pay J. D. four hundred dollars?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>Street grinned. \u201cHe had a video of her shacking up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith her fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>All three agents looked at her, and she realized how stupid her question was. If Charlene had been sleeping with her fianc\u00e9, J. D. wouldn\u2019t have been blackmailing her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m tired,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was cheating on her fianc\u00e9.\u201d Suddenly Jordan was full of outrage. \u201cI gave that woman china! Vera Wang!\u201d</p><p>Chaddick looked back at the screen. \u201cShe\u2019s been paying for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been shacking up for a while,\u201d Street added. \u201cGuess she didn\u2019t mind paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she sleeping with?\u201d Jordan asked. \u201cNo, don\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t want to know. Yes, I do. Who was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy named Kyle\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her hand flew to her throat. \u201cNot Kyle Heffermint!\u201d</p><p>Noah thought Jordan\u2019s reaction was hilarious. He went to her and put his arm around her. \u201cHe\u2019s the name-dropper, isn\u2019t he? And he was hitting on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one,\u201d she affirmed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Steve N. here,\u201d Street continued.</p><p>\u201cCould be Steve Nelson,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI met him at the restaurant. He runs the insurance agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Charlene\u2019s boss,\u201d Jordan told him.</p><p>Street grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s not all he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear God, she wasn\u2019t sleeping with Steve too, was she? No, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to watch the video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, she was. And Steve\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Noah said drily, \u201cwhich is why he\u2019d pay blackmail to keep his affair secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m printing this out,\u201d Street said, moving the mouse on the pad. \u201cI\u2019ll make two copies. You take one, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this. Before I leave Serenity, I want to meet this Charlene,\u201d Chaddick said.</p><p>Noah heard a car pull up outside. He went to the living room and looked out the front window. \u201cTech crew\u2019s here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Street said. \u201cThey can box all this stuff up.\u201d He went to the printer, sorted the copies, and handed a set to Noah.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking off early in the morning,\u201d Noah told him. \u201cIf you need anything, just let me know. And please keep me apprised.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was more than ready to leave J. D. Dickey\u2019s house. Once they were on the road, she said, \u201cYou think you know someone, and then you find out she\u2019s a sex maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t really know Charlene, did you? You\u2019d only just met her,\u201d Noah countered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But it\u2019s still disheartening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you can think of another restaurant, I guess we\u2019re going back to Jaffee\u2019s. Okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d she said. \u201cIs he on the list?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou want to look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it.\u201d</p><p>Noah pulled over to the curb, put the car in park and quickly went through the list. He saw Amelia Ann\u2019s name and wondered how Jordan would react if she knew.</p><p>\u201cNo Jaffee,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Noah thought about the long day he\u2019d put her through. \u201cYou\u2019re a real trouper, you know that?\u201d He looked at her for a long second, then reached over and cupped the back of her neck with his hand, and pulled her toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d she began.</p><p>His mouth settled firmly on hers. She hadn\u2019t expected his kiss, yet she instinctively parted her lips for his tongue. He took full advantage, and the kiss deepened. Noah didn\u2019t do anything half measure. The kiss didn\u2019t last long, but it was thorough. When he sat back, her heart was pounding. Falling against the seat, she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t look like he was having any trouble catching his breath. He put the car in drive and continued on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the mood for fish,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a cold beer.\u201d</p><p>No mention about the kiss, no thank-you or even a \u201cwasn\u2019t that nice?\u201d comment.</p><p>Noah glanced over. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d he asked, knowing full well there was. She glared at him. \u201cYou look a little irritated.\u201d</p><p>Ya think? \u201cNo, nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering how you can be so laid-back...you know, blas\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaid-back and blas\u00e9 are two different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re both. You just kissed me.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it, and it was out there for discussion.</p><p>\u201cMmm, sure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? \u2018Sure did\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d sounded so furious, he smiled. Jordan was something when she was wound up.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>He had to be kidding. He knew exactly what she wanted him to say. That the kiss meant something. It was a big deal. But apparently it wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d kissed a lot of women. What was this to him: same old, same old?</p><p>She thought about reminding him of the wild time they\u2019d had the night before. She could also point out that this morning he had acted as though nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. She knew that if he responded by asking her what she wanted him to say, she might very well pull a J. D. and punch him senseless.</p><p>She bet he\u2019d remember that.</p><p>Even though, at the moment, it was a lovely fantasy, violence was never the answer.</p><p>They stopped at a red light and Noah looked over. \u201cNow what are you thinking about, Sugar? You\u2019ve got a perplexed look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolence,\u201d she immediately answered. \u201cI was thinking about violence.\u201d</p><p>He swore he never knew what she was going to say. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never the answer. That\u2019s what my father and mother taught Sidney and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were usually trying to pummel one another into the ground. I think that\u2019s why they all did so well in sports. They got to pound other teams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did you get rid of your aggressive tendencies?\u201d he asked, genuinely curious.</p><p>\u201cI broke things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t vandalism,\u201d she explained. \u201cI broke things so I could put them back together. It was a...learning experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have driven your parents nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThey were patient with me though, and after a while they got used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are some of the things you broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to remember, I was a kid, so of course I started small. A toaster, an old fan, a lawn mower...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawn mower?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s still a sore subject with my father. He came home from work early one afternoon and found all the parts of his lawn mower, down to the nuts and bolts, spread out on the drive. He wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d</p><p>Noah was having a hard time picturing her with grease on her face and hands, screwing things together. Jordan was so feminine now. He couldn\u2019t imagine it.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the lawn mower back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my brothers\u2019 help, which, by the way, I didn\u2019t need. The next week my father brought home an old, broken computer. He told me I could have it, but I had to promise I wouldn\u2019t touch any more appliances, lawn mowers, or cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never worked on one of those. Not interested. And once I got a computer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found your calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I did. What about you? What were you like as a little boy? Were you packing a gun back then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrnery,\u201d he answered. \u201cI got into my share of fights, I suppose, but we lived in Texas,\u201d he reminded her, \u201cand that meant playing football in high school. I did all right and ended up getting an athletic scholarship to college. All through school I was always a model student.\u201d Even he couldn\u2019t say the lie with a straight face. \u201cI didn\u2019t like rules back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t like rules now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rebel,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Doctor Morganstern calls me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>He pulled the car into the parking lot behind the Home Away from Home Motel\u2019s courtyard. \u201cSure. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been in a relationship that lasted more than a week or two? Have you really ever committed to one woman, even for a little while?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste a second thinking over his response. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>If the abruptness in his answer and his emphatic tone were an attempt to get her to drop the subject, he was mistaken.</p><p>\u201cGoodness. Aren\u2019t you Mister Sensitive.\u201d</p><p>He parked and opened the door. \u201cSugar, there\u2019s not a sensitive bone in my body.\u201d</p><p>He was wrong about that, but she wasn\u2019t going to argue.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou ever been in a long relationship?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, he came around and opened her door. Taking Jordan\u2019s hand, Noah walked toward the street. The lot was dimly lit by a lamp at the far end, and the only sound was the night settling in around them.</p><p>He stopped for a moment and stared into her eyes. \u201cI know what you\u2019re all about, Jordan Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you care to explain it all to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>And the subject was closed.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, IF JAFFEE\u2019S BISTRO IS CROWDED, I\u2019M going in the back door and eating in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Noah asked the obvious question. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Jordan looked at him as if the answer should be obvious. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go through another inquisition. And I certainly don\u2019t want people glaring at me while I eat. It\u2019s bad for the digestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are curious, that\u2019s all,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cFace it, Sugar. You\u2019re news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m news all right,\u201d she said. \u201cSince I arrived here three people have died. If you consider the number of times I\u2019ve been here, the number of residents, and the number of unexpected deaths, and then leave room for a statistical anomaly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I\u2019m guessing would be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m the deviation in my calculations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d he said drily.</p><p>\u201cYou can, therefore, draw one conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve started an epidemic.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around her and pulled her toward him. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, it kinda is.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. She couldn\u2019t believe how quickly she became rattled these days. \u201cOkay, maybe I\u2019m being a little unreasonable, which, by the way, is totally not me. I\u2019m always reasonable. But here...I can\u2019t seem to think straight.\u201d Especially when I\u2019m around you, she silently added.</p><p>They walked around a corner and crossed the street. Jaffee\u2019s was directly ahead of them, and Jordan could see a few customers inside, but most of the tables were empty.</p><p>\u201cWe get in, we eat, we get out. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a wonderful dining experience. Can we sit at a table, or must we stand while we eat?\u201d he asked as he swung the door open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angela looked happy to see them. \u201cHey, Jordan,\u201d she called out.</p><p>\u201cHey, Angela. You remember Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cYour table\u2019s waiting for you. With all the big doings today, you must be hungry as all get out.\u201d She took their drink orders and said, \u201cYou two got in just under the wire. I was about to take off the tablecloths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow night?\u201d Jordan asked.</p> <p>\u201cAlways is on poker night,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shut down an hour early so Jaffee can get the kitchen cleaned up. He hates to be late for poker.\u201d</p><p>Noah went to the men\u2019s room to wash up, and when he returned, the drinks were already on the table, and Angela was waiting.</p><p>\u201cI hate to hurry you along,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I promise you can take your time once I get your dinner orders in, but Jaffee would really like to get started fixing your meals.\u201d</p><p>She made a few recommendations, and as soon as they ordered, she hurried back into the kitchen.</p><p>Jordan relaxed. The last table had cleared, and she and Noah were the only customers in the restaurant. Neither Angela nor Jaffee interrupted them.</p> <p>Noah raised his bottle of beer. \u201cTo our last night in Serenity.\u201d</p><p>She hesitantly lifted her glass of ice water. \u201cHopefully, our last night in Serenity.\u201d</p><p>He took a long drink. \u201cAny more murders, they\u2019ll have to change the name of the town.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI guess I overreacted, didn\u2019t I? I was certain we\u2019d be surrounded by a crowd again, asking all sorts of questions about the fire and about J. D. But look at us. We have the entire restaurant to ourselves, and we\u2019ll get to eat dinner in peace. That\u2019s a nice bit of luck, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled back, but didn\u2019t comment. Angela was busy folding tablecloths, but he noticed the tray that she had just placed on one of the tables was stacked with decks of cards. Jaffee obviously hosted poker night at the restaurant. Noah wondered how long it would take Jordan to catch on.</p><p>Jordan wasn\u2019t paying Angela any attention. She was busy thinking about the list Agent Street had compiled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will happen to those tapes J. D. made?\u201d she asked in a whisper. \u201cWill they be made public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I don\u2019t understand? Everyone seems to know everyone else\u2019s business, so how was Charlene able to hide her little...hobby?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHobby? Never heard it called that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were any of those people on the list able to hide their extracurricular activities?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou want something bad enough, you figure out a way to get it.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and looked at him inquisitively. \u201cHave you ever wanted something so badly that you would risk everything?\u201d</p><p>Noah stared at her for a long moment. \u201cYeah, I guess I have,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>Their conversation ended when Angela returned to carry their empty dishes back to the kitchen. Jaffee came out to say hello, and also to ask Jordan if she would mind taking a quick look at Dora.</p><p>Noah stood when she did. \u201cWho\u2019s Dora?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cComputer,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Finish your drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep him company,\u201d Angela promised. \u201cYou want another beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen does poker start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn about fifteen minutes. The men ought to be drifting in pretty soon. Well, look there. Dave Trumbo\u2019s getting out of his Suburban, and he\u2019s got Eli Whitaker with him. They\u2019re always the first to arrive. They\u2019re best friends,\u201d she added. \u201cEli\u2019s the richest man in Serenity. Some say he could be the richest man in all of Texas.\u201d</p><p>She jutted her hip out and put her hand on her waist. \u201cI bet you\u2019re wondering where he came by all that money. No one knows for sure, but we all like to speculate. I think maybe he inherited it. None of us would dare ask him though. He doesn\u2019t come to town much. He likes to stay to himself. He\u2019s real shy, and Dave\u2019s the opposite. Never met anyone he didn\u2019t like, he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t any of the women play poker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t like to play with the men. They\u2019re too competitive, and they don\u2019t like to visit the way we do. We have our own poker night. Now here comes Steve Nelson. I don\u2019t remember if you met him the other night or not. He runs the only insurance agency around.\u201d</p><p>Jordan sat at Jaffee\u2019s computer, unaware that the poker players were arriving. Back at their table, Noah wondered if Jordan could hear the commotion. It didn\u2019t take long for the restaurant to fill up.</p><p>Jordan quickly solved Jaffee\u2019s latest problem. He\u2019d mixed up two different commands. While she heard people talking, she stayed focused on the daunting task of helping Jaffee understand what he had done so he wouldn\u2019t repeat the mistake.</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d Jordan told him, \u201cDora doesn\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>Jaffee wiped his hands on a towel and nodded. \u201cBut if I get into trouble...\u201d</p><p>She reassured him. \u201cYou can e-mail or call me.\u201d</p><p>Jordan gave him a few suggestions for troubleshooting, but when she saw the glazed look in his eyes, she knew he didn\u2019t understand a single word she was saying. She had a feeling she was going to be getting daily calls from him for a while. That thought made her smile as she headed back to her table. The evening was turning out to be a relaxing one after all. Her biggest dilemma at the moment was dessert. Should she or shouldn\u2019t she? Noise intruded into her thoughts, and she came to a dead stop in the doorway when she saw the crowd.</p><p>Noah watched her enter the room and thought the look on her face was priceless.</p><p>A hush fell over the gathering, and all eyes were on her as she slowly walked over to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPoker night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? Poker night is here? Why did I think...I just assumed...Do you think we could just leave now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could sneak out the back...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSneaking out isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>She understood when she turned around. Every man there was standing, and those who had not yet met her were waiting to be introduced.</p><p>Jaffee did the honors. There were so many she couldn\u2019t remember half their names. Every single one of them said \u201cHey.\u201d After the introductions, they bombarded her with questions.</p><p>They didn\u2019t just want to know about the fire and J. D.\u2019s terrible death. They also wanted to rehash how she had discovered the professor and then Lloyd in her car. Jordan wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if one of them had asked for a reenactment. She answered every question\u2014sometimes twice\u2014in their morbid curiosity. She was able to laugh a few times, and in between the questions, Dave, the natural salesman, tried to sell her a new car.</p><p>Noah got his fair share of questions too.</p><p>\u201cDoes Joe figure it was J. D. who killed those two men?\u201d Jaffee asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a smart cookie,\u201d Dave said. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d heard J. D. disappeared,\u201d a man named Wayne interjected.</p><p>\u201cDid Joe have enough to arrest him?\u201d Dave asked.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now, does it? The man\u2019s dead,\u201d Steve Nelson reminded the group. \u201cSay, Agent Clayborne, did you and Joe happen to go through J. D.\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>It was difficult for Noah not to smile. He knew what Steve was fishing for. He wanted to know if J. D. had kept records.</p><p>\u201cYes, we went through it. Everything was packed up by two other FBI agents and taken away. There wasn\u2019t much there though.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t have much of a poker face. Noah could see the relief in his eyes and understood why. He\u2019d seen Steve\u2019s name on the list not only for sleeping with Charlene but for some questionable insurance practices.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever know why J. D. killed those men?\u201d Dave asked.</p><p>\u201cJoe will tell us when he knows something,\u201d Steve said with assurance.</p><p>\u201cMy heart goes out to Randy Dickey. He\u2019s turned into a decent sheriff. This will be a hard blow for him. I think J. D. was his only family,\u201d Dave remarked.</p><p>Noah noticed Eli Whitaker standing among the men, listening to the conversation but saying little.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do for a living, Eli?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI raise horses, run some cattle,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat breed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cattle are mostly longhorns,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey seem to be the hardiest for this part of the country.\u201d</p><p>Noah followed up with a couple of other questions about Eli\u2019s operation, and before long the two were standing apart, having a conversation about ranching.</p><p>Dave grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s the most I\u2019ve seen Eli talk to a newcomer.\u201d</p><p>The other men in the group took notice and all nodded in agreement.</p><p>Steve turned back to Jordan. \u201cI know you two haven\u2019t been here long, but you don\u2019t seem like newcomers to me. You\u2019ve brought a lot of excitement to our town. When are you and Noah leaving Serenity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Jordan answered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a real pleasure meeting you two,\u201d Dave said.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019ve had enough questions for one night,\u201d Jaffee told everyone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you all get drinks from the bar and take your seats?\u201d</p><p>While most of the men scattered around the room, Dave and Eli stepped forward with Jaffee to say good-bye to Jordan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure going to miss you,\u201d Jaffee said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry you lost your research papers. I heard you had to leave them at the professor\u2019s house. You go to all the trouble of making copies and then you watch them go up in flames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a crying shame. Didn\u2019t you tell us you came all the way from Boston to get that research?\u201d Dave asked.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say it all got burned up?\u201d Eli wondered aloud.</p><p>Jordan finally got a word in. \u201cI have the copies. They weren\u2019t in the fire, and I had already mailed the bulk of them home before the originals were destroyed. If Joe and the two agents in charge of the investigation now want to see them, I\u2019ll have to mail them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real good news,\u201d Jaffee said. \u201cYour trip wasn\u2019t wasted. Dinner\u2019s on the house, and don\u2019t even think about arguing about that. Dora and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all your help. I sure hope you come back here someday to say \u2018hey.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He hugged her good-bye and shook Noah\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cEither one of you need another car, you think of me. I\u2019ll drive it to Boston for you,\u201d Dave offered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll do it too,\u201d Eli called out as he headed to his table.</p><p>Noah left a generous tip for Angela and steered Jordan toward the door amid a chorus of good-byes.</p><p>Neither of them said a word until they were a block away. Jordan broke the silence. \u201cHmm. Poker night. Didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that look on your face before...when you saw the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe evening wasn\u2019t too bad. We had a lovely dinner without interruptions, and we met some charming gentlemen,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCharming...and interesting,\u201d she added with a nod.</p><p>\u201cYou know what else is interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf of those charming men were on the list.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>JORDAN WAS STANDING IN THE SHOWER RINSING OFF THE HEAT of the day and lathering her hair with apricot-scented soap when the realization hit. She didn\u2019t want to go home. She immediately pushed the ridiculous thought aside. Of course she wanted to go home.</p><p>She wanted her organized life back, didn\u2019t she? When she\u2019d sold her company, she had netted a staggering profit, but now she needed to decide what to do with it. She had toyed with the idea of investing some of the money in developing a new computer processor, one that would be so fast it could handle even the most complicated multimedia software several times over. She had even visualized the design and the prototype. But there was only one problem with her grand scheme to shake up the Silicon Valley giants again. She didn\u2019t want to. Let someone else come up with a design that would make the world spin faster and faster.</p><p>Not wanting to get into the game again wasn\u2019t the only startling revelation. She no longer was in a hurry to run out and buy another laptop and cell phone. In the past they had been her appendages, but she didn\u2019t feel laptop dependent anymore, and she was finding it remarkably pleasant not to be answering her cell phone every five minutes. There were definite perks to being unavailable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to scare myself,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>What was happening to her? It was as though she were morphing into a completely different person. Maybe sitting in 120-degree heat waiting for Noah to examine the fire wreckage had done something to her brain. Maybe the heat melted it. Or maybe all the showers she\u2019d been taking since she\u2019d arrived in Serenity had washed away her brain cells.</p><p>She was dehydrated from exposure to the sun. That\u2019s what it was.</p><p>She put on her T-shirt and boxer shorts and brushed her teeth. With her toothbrush sticking out of her mouth, she wiped the steam off the mirror and looked at herself. Blotchy skin and freckles. What a prize she was, especially wearing her unisex pajamas.</p><p>Jordan put the toothbrush down, reached for a jar of Kate\u2019s special body lotion, and opened the door. She\u2019d never worried about how she looked, but now everything was upside down.</p><p>Jordan knew what the real problem was. Until this moment, she had refused to admit it. Noah. Oh, yes, he was the problem. He had changed everything, and she didn\u2019t know what she could do about it.</p><p>Worrying wouldn\u2019t improve her situation. A smart woman would run as fast as she could in the opposite direction, but she guessed she wasn\u2019t smart because, at the moment, all she could think about was going to bed with him again.</p><p>She needed a distraction to take her mind off sex. She decided she would curl up in bed with the professor\u2019s research papers and read another grisly tale about bloodshed, decapitation, mutilation, and superstition. That ought to do the trick and take her mind off Noah.</p><p>Where were her glasses? She thought she\u2019d left them by her contact lens case in the bathroom, but they weren\u2019t there. She crossed the bedroom to the desk and stubbed her toe on the leg of a chair. Groaning, she hopped on one foot while she dug through her satchel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNoah,\u201d she asked, \u201chave you seen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the table,\u201d he called through the open door between their rooms.</p><p>How did he know what she wanted? Was he a mind reader? Her glasses were right where he\u2019d told her they were. \u201cHow did you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re squinting,\u201d he answered before she could finish her sentence. \u201cAnd you just ran into a chair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t watching where I was going.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see where you were going.\u201d</p><p>Jordan noticed water spots on her lenses and went back into the bathroom. She thought she heard someone knocking on her door and called out, \u201cNoah, could you get that?\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later she heard a woman\u2019s voice coming from Noah\u2019s room. The knocking had been at his door, not hers. Curious, she hurriedly cleaned her glasses, slipped them on, and went into the bedroom. Oh, great. Noah was getting personalized turn-down service, and Amelia Ann was doing the honors. Noah leaned against the door frame watching her, but when he heard Jordan, he glanced over his shoulder and winked at her.</p><p>He was getting a kick out of the preferential treatment. Jordan wasn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t stop staring at Amelia Ann through the doorway. The woman was dressed like a cocktail waitress in a seedy bar. She had on short-shorts; red, open-toed, stiletto heels; and a low-cut blouse she\u2019d apparently forgotten to button. She was definitely advertising. The way she bent over the bed when she smoothed the sheets was comical, but Jordan wasn\u2019t laughing. Amelia Ann\u2019s behavior was disgraceful.</p> <p>Muttering to herself, Jordan spun around and pulled off her own bedspread. She put it in the corner, then dumped a stack of papers in the middle of the bed, grabbed a bottle of water, and sat down to read.</p><p>The room phone rang. It was her sister, Sidney, calling. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to guess. Tell me,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have caller ID?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called my motel room, Sidney. You should know I don\u2019t have caller ID.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Los Angeles, and I\u2019m surrounded by boxes. Since I can\u2019t check into my dorm for another week and a half, I\u2019m stuck in a hotel. Actually, it\u2019s a very nice hotel,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe bellman carried up all my stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought Mother was going out there with you next week. Why are you there so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything suddenly changed,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent the other night with my friend Christy, and when I got home the next morning, Mom had my flight all set up. It was like she couldn\u2019t wait another minute to get rid of me. I think I was driving her crazy worrying out loud about Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re on your own now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going overboard with room service, but since I can\u2019t get into my dorm, what else can I do? I hope Dad doesn\u2019t have a fit when he gets the bill on his credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dad doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess. You know Dad. Death threats don\u2019t seem to faze him. Mother\u2019s another story though. She\u2019s a wreck, but trying not to let it show. Everyone is so stressed out over this trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny updates on when it will be over?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sidney answered. \u201cDad\u2019s bodyguards are becoming permanent fixtures on Nathan\u2019s Bay. Everywhere I looked, there they were: constant reminders that someone wants our father dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe threats will stop as soon as there\u2019s a verdict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you know that for certain? That\u2019s what everyone keeps saying, but come on, Jordan, this is a racketeering case. It\u2019s...major.\u201d</p><p>Jordan heard the anxiety in Sidney\u2019s voice. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if that horrible man is convicted, won\u2019t his family and his business associates still come after Dad? And if he\u2019s not convicted, won\u2019t the other side\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Jordan cut her off. \u201cYou\u2019ll drive yourself nuts thinking about all of this. You have to hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d she replied. \u201cI am glad I came out here early. I was making it worse on Mom. Now she\u2019s got Laurant to worry about...and Nick\u2019s freaking out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. What did you say? What\u2019s wrong with Nick and Laurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with Nick. His wife is the worry. I thought you knew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d she asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cLaurant started having labor pains, really bad labor pains, and the doctor put her in the hospital. She can\u2019t have the baby yet. She\u2019s only six months along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick took her to the hospital yesterday. I was already on my way to L. A.\u201d</p><p>Had Jordan talked to her brother since then? She couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Nick came back home early and Noah stayed with you, isn\u2019t it? It would be awful if he was that far away when Laurant started having problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Laurant. What\u2019s the doctor saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sidney answered. \u201cMom told me she\u2019s hooked up to an IV. They\u2019ve slowed down the contractions, but they haven\u2019t stopped them completely. Listen, when will you get home? Mom sure could use your support now. You\u2019re always so cool and calm about everything. Nothing rattles you.\u201d</p><p>Not anymore, Jordan thought. Thanks to Noah, everything rattled her.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, Jordan saw Noah walking toward her, and she promptly lost her train of thought. He wore jeans and a clean T-shirt. He put his gun and holster on the nightstand and stretched out next to her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cJordan? Didn\u2019t you hear me? I asked when you were leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...uh...I...\u201d Oh sure, she never got rattled. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she stammered. Noah had reached up and was pulling her down next to him. \u201cEarly. We\u2019re leaving early. We have a long drive to the Austin airport.\u201d She pushed Noah\u2019s hand away and turned around. Frowning at him, she wagged her finger in his face and whispered, \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d Sidney asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Do you think I should fly back home?\u201d asked Sidney. \u201cI could maybe help out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you should stay where you are. There\u2019s nothing you could do back home. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up. I didn\u2019t ask you how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Noah was tickling her neck, causing shivers. \u201cFine. I\u2019m doing fine,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cDid they find the degenerate who was stuffing those bodies in your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they did. Talk to you tomorrow. \u2019Bye now. Keep safe.\u201d</p><p>She hung up before Sidney could stop her. Then she turned to confront Noah.</p><p>\u201cTrying to distract...\u201d That was as far as she got before she again lost her train of thought. Noah was pulling off his T-shirt. He had an amazing body. His upper arms were so muscular, and his abs...</p><p>She mentally shook herself out of her stupor. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting comfortable.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his hands when he tried to take his jeans off. \u201cFor the love of...Unless you plan to get under the covers, I suggest you keep your pants on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you embarrassed?\u201d He seemed puzzled by the possibility. \u201cSugar, you\u2019ve seen and touched every\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember very clearly what I did,\u201d she interrupted. She suddenly laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any inhibitions, do you? I\u2019ll bet you could walk down Newbury Street in Boston stark na*ed and not be fazed.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s summer or winter.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s presumptuous to think you can waltz in here and sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>He adjusted the pillows behind his head. \u201cI don\u2019t waltz anywhere, and I don\u2019t plan to sleep, at least not for a very long while. So, do you want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>That question was a no-brainer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over him, planted her hands on his warm chest, and kissed him. Then she pinched his shoulder and sat up.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve talked to Nick,\u201d she said accusingly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me what was going on?\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised. \u201cSidney told you? I didn\u2019t think she knew. Your mother got her out of Boston early so she wouldn\u2019t find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick should have called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick didn\u2019t want you to worry, and he knew that you would hear about it when you got back to Boston.\u201d</p><p>She sat back on her heels. \u201cFind out what?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHold on. What exactly did Sidney tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to hear your version.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into your parents\u2019 house and left a note for your father in his library. It was stuck to a wall with a knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he find it?\u201d</p><p>Noah hated to tell her. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. Your mother did.\u201d He sighed and added, \u201cWhoever it was got in sometime during the night. She found it the next morning before your father came down.\u201d</p><p>Jordan pictured some maniac with a knife creeping through the house and starting up the stairs. She shivered. \u201cThey were asleep? Where were the bodyguards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were two of them. One outside and one in. Neither one heard or saw a thing.\u201d</p><p>She felt sick to her stomach. \u201cHe could have gone into their bedroom. And Sidney...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Noah said. \u201cShe was at a friend\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cThey can get to my father anytime they want, can\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your brothers are in this now and have beefed up security. No one\u2019s going to get that close again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cWhat did the note say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I remember...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cJordan, it was just a scare tactic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know what that note said, Noah. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...,\u201d he answered reluctantly. \u201cThe note said, \u2018We\u2019re watching.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>JORDAN\u2019S ANXIETY ABOUT HER FAMILY WOULDN\u2019T EASE UP. She kept thinking about her mother and father asleep in their bed while a cold-blooded killer roamed their house. What made the situation even more chilling was the fact that there were two professional bodyguards on duty, and the intruder had been able to get past them.</p><p>Holding her in his arms, Noah listened as she played out every possible scenario: what could have happened, what didn\u2019t happen, and what might possibly happen in the future. He\u2019d heard it all before from Nick, who had gone into a rage when he\u2019d found out about the break-in.</p><p>\u201cYou knew about Laurant too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Jordan asked. Noah didn\u2019t answer fast enough to suit her. \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch! Stop pinching me. And yes, I knew about Laurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand before she could pinch him again. \u201cNick didn\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. He didn\u2019t want me to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her hand back, rolled away from him, and sat up. \u201cMy father and Laurant...what other secrets are out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that I know about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to do you any good to get all worked up about it.\u201d</p><p>His calm attitude didn\u2019t sit well with her. \u201cWell, I am already worked up about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on your brother. Nick was only trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t defend him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only saying that Nick thought you had plenty to worry about. He was planning to fill you in on everything when you got back to Boston. And Laurant\u2019s doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital. That isn\u2019t \u2018doing okay.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting the care she needs.\u201d</p><p>Jordan shook her head. \u201cIf you were my brother and I kept something like this from you, how would you feel?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sideways glance. \u201cSugar, if I were your brother, we\u2019d have a much bigger problem to worry about.\u201d</p><p>To make his point, his hand slipped under her T-shirt and tugged on the waistband of her shorts.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that was a bad example.\u201d She gathered up the papers. \u201cI just hate secrets,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? You\u2019re pretty damned good at keeping secrets yourself.\u201d</p><p>He sounded angry. Surprised by his sudden mood swing, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? I don\u2019t keep secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me about that little scar on the side of your right breast?\u201d</p><p>Pretending that she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about probably wouldn\u2019t work. Knowing Noah, he\u2019d pull off her T-shirt and point to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember hearing about your surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was...a while ago,\u201d she said, trying to think of a way to get out of the corner she\u2019d trapped herself in. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my question,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you find a lump in your breast\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a little bump.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her interruption, he continued, \u201cAnd didn\u2019t you check yourself into the hospital and have the surgery without telling anyone in your family?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cYes, but it was a procedure...a biopsy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You didn\u2019t want anyone to worry, did you? What if something had gone wrong? What if the procedure had turned into major surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate drove me to the hospital. She would have called everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jordan admitted. \u201cIt was wrong. But I was scared. And telling everyone made it more real.\u201d</p><p>Strangely enough, he understood. He took her hand and squeezed it. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. You ever pull a stunt like that on me, and there\u2019ll be hell to pay.\u201d Just thinking about the possibility of her keeping something that serious from him made him angry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo more secrets,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>She tried to get up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI was going to read, but I\u2019m not in the mood to think about old feuds.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her back. \u201cRead something to me. Maybe a battle,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThat will relax you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a man could think that hearing about a bloody battle would be relaxing.\u201d</p><p>She decided to humor him. She scooted closer, leaned against his chest, and dropped the stack of papers in her lap.</p><p>He looked over her shoulder. \u201cHow far back have you gotten?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve been randomly pulling out a story or two from every other century. When I get home I\u2019ll make myself read all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, make yourself? If you don\u2019t think any of it is accurate...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I want to read all of it. And then I\u2019m going to do my own research. I want to find the truth.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019m sure there are threads of truth in some of the stories. For the most part, they\u2019ve been handed down from father to son.\u201d She gave him the stack. \u201cYou choose one.\u201d</p><p>She watched him flip through the pages. \u201cWait,\u201d she said as she snatched one of the papers. \u201cI just saw...There it is again.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out the page and held it up. \u201cSee? In the margin. The professor wrote the date 1284 again. I\u2019ve seen it on two other pages in the margins. And what\u2019s that? A crown? A castle? 1284 has to be when he thought the feud started. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he allowed. \u201cThe numbers are thick, like he was going over them again and again so he wouldn\u2019t forget.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, he wouldn\u2019t need to write the date more than once. If what he told me about his memory was true, he didn\u2019t need to write anything down. He\u2019d remember. I think he must have been absentmindedly scribbling while he thought about something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on. What did he tell you about his memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was boasting,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he had an extraordinary memory. He never forgot a face or a name no matter how much time had passed. He recorded these tales to organize them for other people to read someday, but he had committed every detail to memory. He claimed he was a voracious reader. What newspapers he couldn\u2019t get his hands on, he read on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>Noah remembered all the newspapers littering the professor\u2019s living room floor. \u201cLook through the rest of the pages,\u201d he suggested. \u201cSee if he did any sketches or wrote any other dates.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t find any in her stack, but he found a couple in the bottom half of his.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that look like to you?\u201d He pointed to something sketched in the margin at the top of the page.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a dog or a cat...with that long mane, a lion. I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s a lion.\u201d</p><p>The last drawing he found was easier to figure out. Another crown. A very poor drawing of a lopsided crown.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d he said. \u201cProfessor MacKenna was crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit he was strange, and he was obsessed with his work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he made it all up.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019m crazy, but I think there really is a hidden treasure.\u201d</p><p>Noah continued to flip through the pages. \u201cSome of these aren\u2019t dated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be a guessing game. Maybe the name of a king is mentioned...or a new weapon, like a crossbow. That would give us an approximate time period, but the rest are just guesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead this one.\u201d He handed her the papers and leaned back.</p><p>As if it were the most natural thing in the world, he pulled her closer and put his arm around her.</p><p>She began reading in a soft clear voice.</p><p>Our beloved king is dead, and in this time of our terrible grieving, the clans have been embroiled in battle after battle to gain power and control over the others. We have a pretender who demands to be king and struggles to rule, and there is now constant political turmoil.</p><p>Greed has taken root in the hearts of our leaders. We do not know how this will end, and we fear for our children. There is no unbloodied ground to walk upon, no cave in which to find sanctuary for our old and our young. The road is desolate. We have witnessed murder and infidelity. And now betrayal.</p><p>The MacDonalds are warring with the MacDougals, and the western coast is their battleground. In the south the Campbells fight the Fergusons, and the MacKeyes and the Sinclairs spill their blood in the east. There is no refuge.</p><p>But it is the treachery in the north that we now most fear. The MacKennas have new allies from the other end of the world to help them destroy their enemy, the Buchanans.</p><p>The MacKenna laird shows no interest in stealing the Buchanans\u2019 land and forcing the warriors under his rule, though we know such a thing could never be accomplished. Nae, perhaps in the past, that was the MacKenna\u2019s intent, but no longer. He wants to destroy all of them, every man, every woman, every child. His anger is fierce.</p><p>Though we must never openly speak of this, even in whispers, we believe the MacKenna laird has made an evil pact with the King of England. The king sent his emissary, a young prince who came to the court from a distant domain that is now ruled by the king. A witness observed this secret meeting, one of our own, and we believe his words to be true, for he is a man of God.</p><p>The king wants a foothold in the north, and his eyes are on the Buchanan land for its position in the highlands. Once the land is conquered, his soldiers will advance toward the south and the east. He will conquer Scotland, one clan at a time, and when they are under his rule, he will gather a massive force and go north into the land of the giants.</p><p>The prince has told the laird that the king has heard of the animosity between the Buchanans and the MacKennas, and even though he believes destroying the Buchanans with his help should be reward enough, he will sweeten his pact by giving the laird a title and a silver treasure. The treasure alone would elevate the laird above all other clans, for there is a mystical power to the treasure. Aye, with this treasure, the laird would become invincible. He would have the power he longed for, and he would have his revenge against the Buchanans.</p><p>Greed overtook the laird, and he could not say no to the devil\u2019s bargain. He called up his allies, but he did not tell them about his meeting with the emissary or the pact he had struck. He concocted a story of infidelity and murder, and demanded they follow him into war.</p><p>We too fear the Buchanans\u2019 wrath, but we cannot allow this slaughter, and we have determined that one of us will go to their laird and tell him of this plot. We do not believe the King of England should have power in our land. The MacKenna laird may wish to sell his soul, but he will not.</p><p>With great trepidation, our courageous friend Harold went alone to speak to the Buchanan laird. When he did not return, we believed the Buchanans had killed him. But Harold was not harmed. He returned to us, and his body was sound, but terror had overtaken his mind, for he declared to us that he had seen him. Harold had seen the ghost. He had seen the lion in the mist.</p><p>Noah interrupted Jordan. \u201cHe saw what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarold had seen the ghost. He had seen the lion in the mist,\u201d Jordan repeated.</p><p>Noah smiled. \u201cA lion in Scotland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a figurative lion,\u201d she suggested. \u201cAfter all, there was Richard the Lionhearted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep reading,\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>\u201cHas the Buchanan laird gathered his allies?\u201d we asked.</p><p>\u201cNae,\u201d came his reply. \u201cHe sent messengers to the north to call forth one warrior. That is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they will all die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they will die\u201d another said. \u201cThe English king is so sure of victory he has sent a legion of soldiers</p><p>Noah interrupted again. \u201cA legion? Come on. Do you know how many that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, I\u2019ve already read about a ghost and a lion in the mist. What\u2019s the big deal about a legion?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to continue or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise not to interrupt again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was I? Oh, yes, the legion.\u201d She found her place and resumed reading.</p><p>\u201cThe English king is so sure of victory he has sent a legion of soldiers with the treasure to Laird MacKenna. He has also ordered these soldiers to join the MacKennas in their battle against the Buchanans. The MacKenna laird has only just been given this news. He cannot stop the advance, and he knows that his allies will turn against him when they discover he has a pact with the king. They will not fight by the side of an English soldier.\u201d</p><p>Jordan dropped the paper. \u201cHe did it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did what?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cThe king. He sent soldiers knowing the MacKenna allies would turn against the laird. He also knew they would find out about the pact. The clans would know that MacKenna joined forces with the king. For silver. Talk about betrayal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they all end up killing each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWhich is exactly what the king wanted. How could the MacKenna laird believe the King of England would keep his word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreed. He was blinded by greed. Did he get the treasure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She picked up the paper again. \u201cThe victory belonged to the Buchanans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was rooting for them,\u201d Noah drawled. \u201cThey were the underdogs. Besides, I\u2019m in bed with a Buchanan. I should be loyal.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t comment. She read on, then stopped. \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not reading these descriptions of the actual battle. Suffice it to say, there were a lot of severed body parts and heads gone missing. The few English soldiers who survived returned to England. I wish I knew what king it was,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the MacKenna laird?\u201d</p><p>She skimmed another page before answering. \u201cAh, here it is. \u2018The MacKenna laird lost his treasure and the king\u2019s promise of a title.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat title specifically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But he lost it. He lived the rest of his days in disgrace. And get this\u2014his clan blamed the Buchanans. I\u2019ll bet Professor MacKenna found a way to twist this so he could blame the Buchanans too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess everything. The English soldiers, the treasure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe laird must have put quite a spin on the facts to get his clan to believe him.\u201d</p><p>She agreed. \u201cThis legend has everything. Greed, betrayal, secret meetings, murders, and no doubt, infidelity. There was infidelity in the story, but I skimmed over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much has changed over the centuries. You know that blackmail list of J. D.\u2019s that Street printed out? It\u2019s the same old story. Infidelity, greed, betrayal. You name the vice, it\u2019s on the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s an exaggeration. I know Charlene\u2019s been cheating on her fianc\u00e9, but there\u2019s always one who doesn\u2019t conform. Could I see the list?\u201d</p><p>He started to get out of bed. She pushed him back. \u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t need to see it. Just tell me. Is Amelia Ann on the list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. Nothing illegal though. She got treated for an STD, and J. D. knew about it. She paid him a hundred dollars so he wouldn\u2019t tell her daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred dollars was probably a lot of money for her to scrape together. She wouldn\u2019t want her daughter to be disappointed in her. It could be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets worse. Remember the videos that Street found at J. D.\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis victims weren\u2019t the only ones he taped. Evidently he liked to watch some of his own sexual escapades too. And one of the tapes was labeled \u2018Amelia Ann.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cAre you serious? Amelia Ann and J. D.?\u201d She gave the news a moment to sink in and then said, \u201cThat would mean that J. D. could have given her the sexually transmitted disease, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d said Noah.</p><p>\u201cI hope Candy never finds out. What\u2019s wrong with the people in this town? Haven\u2019t they ever heard of cable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, sex trumps cable any time of the day or night.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis is just wrong. All wrong.\u201d</p><p>She had heard enough about the secret, sordid lives of the locals. She gathered the papers, dumped them into her bag, and got back in bed.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you attracted to women who wear short-shorts and stiletto heels?\u201d</p><p>He leaned up on his elbow to look at her. \u201cWhere did that question come from? Who wears short-shorts and stilettos?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAmelia Ann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my type.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and reached across his chest to turn off the light. \u201cGood answer.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>\u201cI CAN\u2019T BELIEVE I\u2019M ADMITTING THIS TO YOU, BUT I\u2019M GOING TO miss Serenity.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Jordan were driving past Jaffee\u2019s Bistro when she made the comment. A hint of morning lit the sky, and a soft, golden glow surrounded them. It was dark inside the restaurant. Jaffee wouldn\u2019t be opening up for hours.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you going to miss?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI had a life-changing experience here.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cSex was that good, huh?\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, she shook her head at him. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I was talking about. But speaking of sex...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty damned good last night, wasn\u2019t it? You wore me out.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just good, she thought. It was amazing and incredible and wonderful, but if she told him so, Noah\u2019s arrogance would get completely out of hand.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to embarrass me. It won\u2019t work,\u201d she warned.</p><p>He didn\u2019t contradict her. She was wrong though. It was working: She was blushing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your life-changing experience?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess it was more of a life-changing decision. I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve been a slave to technology, and that\u2019s going to change. There\u2019s more to life than building computers and designing bigger and better and faster...\u201d Her sigh was long and drawn out. \u201cI want more out of life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He flashed a smile. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first thing I\u2019m going to do when I get home is make a list of all the things I want to do. Cooking is number one,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a cooking class. No more take-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA list, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>The drive to the Austin airport was a long one and it gave them time to talk about a variety of topics. One was the differences in their upbringing. Noah was an only child, whereas Jordan came from a gaggle of siblings, as she referred to her brothers and sister. Noah didn\u2019t realize the importance of having his own space because he\u2019d always had it. Jordan told him how she had longed to have a little privacy. Her biggest complaint, however, was being constantly teased by her brothers. Noah laughed as she recounted some of the pranks they had played on her and her sister when they were young. He thought growing up in such a big family was a blessing\u2014a constant party.</p><p>Occasionally there were pauses in the conversation, but Jordan felt so comfortable with him, she didn\u2019t need to fill the silences with small talk. They had been in the car a couple of hours before she finally got up the nerve to ask him to explain an earlier remark he\u2019d made that had bothered her.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember telling me you knew what I was all about? What did you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at her. \u201cYou sure you want to know?\u201d</p><p>How bad could it be? \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you for a long time, and I know how your mind works, especially where men are concerned. You like control. You\u2019d like to control everyone and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her denial. \u201cYou especially like to control the men you date. I\u2019ve met some of them, Sugar, and I know what I\u2019m talking about. You go for the weak ones. But then if you can walk all over them, you don\u2019t want them. I\u2019ll bet you haven\u2019t slept with any of them. Maybe that\u2019s why you choose that type, so you won\u2019t get involved. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI like sensitive men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you went to bed with me. And I sure as certain am not sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me sound terrible,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not terrible, you\u2019re a sweetheart. A bossy sweetheart,\u201d he added with a grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd I do not want to control anyone,\u201d she said vehemently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried. You\u2019ll never control me.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cWhy do you think I would want to? And don\u2019t you dare tell me I can\u2019t stop myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting upset.\u201d</p><p>Duh. \u201cAnd about sex...\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you familiar with the expression \u2018What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the commercials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proposing that what happened between us in Serenity stays in Serenity. We\u2019re bound to run into each other sometime or other on Nathan\u2019s Bay. You\u2019ll be fishing with one of my brothers and I\u2019ll be checking in with the family and I don\u2019t want you to feel awkward...\u201d She stopped when she realized what she was saying. \u201cOkay, you wouldn\u2019t feel awkward, but I don\u2019t want you to worry about me feeling awkward.\u201d She was making a mess of her speech. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhy are you worried about\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just am,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cMy question is: Do we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it will make you happy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She thought it might be pushing the matter to suggest that they shake hands, but she was happy to have it settled. It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to pretend that nothing extraordinary had happened. She was a pro at pretending. She could even pretend she hadn\u2019t fallen in love with him...couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>BY THE TIME JORDAN ARRIVED HOME, IT WAS WELL AFTER midnight. Noah carried her bags up to her brownstone apartment, checked each room just to make sure everything was as it should be, then kissed her good-bye and left without a backward glance.</p><p>He was already moving on, she thought. And she needed to do the very same thing.</p><p>When she fell into bed, she immediately crashed, and slept hard. In the morning, she opened her eyes and instinctively reached for Noah, but he wasn\u2019t there. Feeling groggy and disoriented, she threw off the covers, put on her favorite ratty old robe, and padded into the kitchen. She pushed the play button on her answering machine as she walked past, and while she made herself a cup of hot tea, she listened to her messages. All forty-nine of them.</p><p>Three of the messages were from Jaffee. He wanted to know just how serious the delete button was because he had accidentally hit it when he was trying to save all his recipes and had lost them. He hoped he could get them back. Would she send him an e-mail telling him what to do, if indeed anything could be done?</p><p>\u201cMy computer mail is working fine,\u201d he explained. \u201cI haven\u2019t messed that up, so I\u2019ll get your reply. I\u2019ve already left you two phone messages, and this is the third, and I\u2019m guessing you aren\u2019t even home yet. Please check your messages on your computer when you get in.\u201d</p><p>How serious was the delete button? Jordan smiled. She guessed there really were people who needed extensive training on computers. Jaffee, was one of them. She would phone him later. After she listened to and erased the rest of the messages, she carried her cup of tea across the living room, curled up in the window seat that overlooked the Charles River, and stared out the window at nothing in particular.</p><p>Love wasn\u2019t all it was cracked up to be. How long was she going to be miserable? Since she\u2019d never really loved anyone the way she loved Noah, she didn\u2019t have a timeline. She hoped that phase one of getting over him was feeling sorry for herself, because she was now wallowing in self-pity.</p><p>In no hurry to get dressed, she stayed in her pajamas until the middle of the afternoon. Around three p.m. she got a glimpse of herself in the mirror and cringed. So she took a shower and got dressed.</p><p>Nick called just after she\u2019d put in her contacts.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to call you,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s Laurant? I don\u2019t want to phone the hospital and disturb her if she\u2019s sleeping. Can she have visitors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doctor wants to keep her another day at least, and I\u2019m keeping the visitors to a minimum so she\u2019ll rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t come today,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cGive her a kiss for me and tell her I\u2019ll be by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe ready to answer a lot of questions,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Oh, God, what did Laurant know? \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked nervously. \u201cWhat questions? Why would Laurant want to ask me questions?\u201d Could Jordan have sounded any guiltier? Did Nick notice?</p><p>\u201cJordan, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d noticed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she replied. \u201cNothing\u2019s the matter. I was just wondering why your wife would want to question me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe she wants to ask you about those bodies you found,\u201d he said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. The bodies. The dead bodies.\u201d She could not believe she\u2019d forgotten about them. \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll answer her questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you angry with me? Is that why you\u2019re acting so squirrelly?\u201d</p><p>So much for her brother\u2019s hotshot detective skills. \u201cUm, that\u2019s right, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d she stalled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I left you in Serenity, isn\u2019t it? You were in good hands with Noah, but I\u2019m your brother, and I should have stayed. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? That\u2019s why you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>She was going to burn in purgatory for this lie alone. \u201cYes. That\u2019s exactly why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor Morganstern ordered me back to Boston, and I don\u2019t feel guilty about doing my job, Jordan. Besides, I was here when Laurant started having contractions. I needed to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Well, I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what you had to do,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now. Someone\u2019s at the door. \u2019Bye.\u201d</p><p>There really was someone at her door. UPS was delivering the research boxes she\u2019d sent one-day air. After she brought them in and stacked them inside the front door by the coat closet, she went to her computer and turned it on. She wanted to get through her e-mails before she sent a message out to all of her addressees explaining that she was shutting down the computer for a while. She wouldn\u2019t say for how long.</p><p>It took the rest of the afternoon and evening to get through all her cybermail. She still hadn\u2019t called Jaffee back, and she made a mental note to do that first thing in the morning.</p><p>A bag of microwave popcorn was Jordan\u2019s dinner. She stretched out on her sofa and channel-surfed while trying to keep Noah out of her thoughts. But he kept intruding. What had he done all day today? What was Noah doing now?</p><p>\u201cOh, this has to stop!\u201d</p><p>Determined to think about something besides Noah, Jordan thought back over other aspects of her eventful journey to Texas. An innocent trip had become a firestorm leaving three men dead and a little town dazed. Had she been told beforehand what she was heading into, she never would have believed it. There were still so many unanswered questions, and she hoped that Agents Chaddick and Street would be able to get to the bottom of it all and wrap up the investigation quickly. All the intrigue and the deceptions were enough to make one\u2019s mind spin, so Jordan concentrated on sorting it all out, starting with Professor MacKenna.</p><p>His story about the inheritance had been a lie. He\u2019d obviously moved to Serenity because of the money he was getting. But where did he get those cash deposits? Were he and J. D. working together? Did J. D. kill the professor because he learned he was holding out on him? The professor was making five-thousand-dollar deposits while J. D. was collecting nickels and dimes. With his hair-trigger temper, J. D. could have easily killed him. And then J. D. himself went up in a blaze while trying to stir up even more trouble.</p><p>If they were working together. That would certainly solve part of the mystery, but what Jordan couldn\u2019t work out was their association. The professor was a strange duck, a loner. He didn\u2019t play well with others. So why\u2019d he hook up with J. D.?</p><p>It didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>She considered a second possibility. Sneaky blackmailer J. D. had found out about the money the professor was getting from a third party, and then tried to blackmail him. But the nutty professor couldn\u2019t be blackmailed. If MacKenna had threatened to go to the police, J. D. knew he\u2019d be sent back to prison. He couldn\u2019t risk that, so he killed the professor to shut him up.</p><p>But something about that didn\u2019t sit right either. Jordan thought it was a good bet the professor was involved in something illegal too.</p><p>Where was Professor MacKenna getting the money? That was the million-dollar question.</p><p>Sometimes you need to stop thinking about a problem for the solution to present itself. Jordan fell asleep waiting for that to happen. She was still waiting the next morning when she woke up. And by noon, she gave up. Jordan was unaccustomed to any sort of problem-solving failure. Obviously, this was a whole new can of worms.</p><p>Car keys in hand, she was walking out the door on her way to visit Laurant when her phone rang.</p><p>\u201cJordan, Agent Chaddick here. I\u2019ve got some interesting news. We found your laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? Where did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn eBay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie Haden had it. She was trying to sell it on eBay. I guess she can kiss any hope of resuming her career good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Jordan hadn\u2019t time to absorb the news before Chaddick said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to take this call. I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan dropped into a chair. Maggie Haden. The gall...the unmitigated...</p><p>Her phone rang again.</p><p>\u201cJordan, Agent Chaddick again. Listen, I\u2019ve got some other news. Not so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWe just received a preliminary autopsy report on J. D. Dickey. It\u2019s a homicide.\u201d</p><p>All of Jordan\u2019s earlier conjectures disappeared. She faced a new, more troubling scenario: The killer was still out there.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>PAUL NEWTON PRUITT WASN\u2019T GOING TO LET ANYONE DESTROY HIS NEW life. He had worked hard to get where he was, and he wasn\u2019t going to run and hide and then start all over again. Not this time.</p><p>He had come a long way. Murder didn\u2019t faze him these days. First there was the Scottish pip-squeak; then Lloyd, the lumbering idiot; and finally his eager but stupidly greedy little helper, J. D.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been at all squeamish about killing any one of them. Hadn\u2019t had any remorse either. Pruitt had killed once before and had learned a valuable lesson. He would do anything to protect himself.</p><p>He\u2019d thought he\u2019d found the perfect patsy in J. D. And placing the bodies in Jordan Buchanan\u2019s cars had bought him more time. Then, getting rid of J. D. would take care of the last link to Pruitt.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><p>He\u2019d been one of the first to hear the results of J. D.\u2019s autopsy. There shouldn\u2019t have been anything left of him to examine, but there was. The cracked skull had given him away, and J. D.\u2019s accidental death was now listed as a murder.</p><p>Getting his hands on the copies of Professor MacKenna\u2019s papers was becoming critical.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>NOAH HAD BEEN STUCK IN SEMINARS WITH DR. MORGANSTERN for the past two days, and he hated every minute of it. He wasn\u2019t a seminar kind of agent, which he mentioned several times, but his complaints didn\u2019t matter to the doctor.</p><p>Morganstern wanted a bigger budget. The lost-and-found program he\u2019d created several years ago had been immensely successful, and with their impressive records, Noah and Nick were the doctor\u2019s best advertisement for expanding the program.</p><p>Each interminable seminar ended with a question and answer period. In Nick\u2019s absence, all of the questions were directed at Noah. Had Nick been there, he would have stepped in and taken over that portion of the program. He was far more diplomatic and polished. But because his wife, Laurant, was in the hospital, Nick got a pass on attending the conference. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The lucky bastard.</p><p>By the end of the second day Noah could barely be civil to the other attendees. Sitting at a table with the doctor at the end of a long corridor, he waited for the next seminar to begin. Morganstern, Noah noticed, looked completely relaxed, but then Noah had learned that nothing ever got to him.</p><p>The venerable Dr. Peter Morganstern encouraged Nick and Noah to call him by his first name, but they would do so only when alone with him.</p><p>Noah whispered, \u201cHey, Pete, I want to ask you something. You think you\u2019ll still get your bigger budget when I start shooting people? Because if I have to listen to one more long-winded lecture from another boring speaker, honest to God, I\u2019m gonna shoot somebody...and then myself. And I just might take you with me for making me wear a suit and tie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a psychiatrist, I\u2019ve been trained to pick up on subtle hints, and I should probably be alarmed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubtle hints?\u201d Noah began to laugh.</p><p>Pete smiled. \u201cHowever, since I feel the same way about the speakers, I won\u2019t be too concerned, even though some of your comments during our last chat did make me wonder.\u201d</p><p>Noah knew that \u201cchat\u201d was Morganstern\u2019s code word for their private conferences. As a psychiatrist, Pete\u2019s goal was to get inside Noah\u2019s head and make sure he wasn\u2019t about to go postal. The good doctor always found a way to accomplish it.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d Noah asked him.</p> <p>\u201cNot in the least. How was your trip to Texas?\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cI kept her alive. That\u2019s about it. I trust you heard what went on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgents Chaddick and Street took over the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is as it should be,\u201d Pete said. \u201cThat\u2019s their area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated giving it up,\u201d he admitted.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>Pete raised an eyebrow. \u201cI was wondering how she handled the stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. She did okay.\u201d There was a note of pride in his answer.</p><p>\u201cJordan has always had a special spot in my heart. My wife and I don\u2019t ever play favorites, but if we did...\u201d He added, \u201cShe has a wonderful heart, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she does,\u201d Noah said softly.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to her since you\u2019ve been back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>The abrupt response didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Pete didn\u2019t say a word. He picked up a pencil and twirled it between his fingers while he waited for his subordinate agent to talk to him. It didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Noah demanded.</p><p>And still Pete didn\u2019t speak. Frustrated, Noah asked, \u201cWhat are you fishing for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed you\u2019ve been on edge since you\u2019ve been back,\u201d Pete said. \u201cI\u2019m curious to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I made that perfectly clear. I hate seminars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that isn\u2019t the reason for your anxiety, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell, Pete. Anxiety? Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Pete smiled again. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to discuss whatever is going on with you, Noah, let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>He was letting him off the hook. Noah could have gotten up and walked away, but he didn\u2019t. He leaned back in the cushioned chair and, blankly staring as Pete sketched on his notepad, thought about how edgy he\u2019d been lately.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drawing?\u201d Noah asked after a minute.</p><p>Pete\u2019s mind was somewhere else too. He looked at his sketch for a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. It might be a calendar.\u201d He nodded. \u201cMy subconscious must be trying to help me remember a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys believe those chicken scratches mean something, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a persistent, recurring sketch or doodle...yes, I\u2019d look at that closely.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we need to attend this last meeting.\u201d</p><p>Noah felt as though he\u2019d just been given a last-minute reprieve from the governor. He walked with Pete to the parking garage.</p><p>When they reached the third level, Pete headed in one direction and Noah in the other.</p><p>Pete had his keys in his hand and was opening his car door when he heard Noah call to him.</p><p>Pete looked over the top of the car. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you decide to leave me in Serenity and bring Nick back? Was there a meeting or a review Nick needed to attend? Or was it something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Pete grinned as he slid into the driver\u2019s seat and pulled the car door closed.</p><p>Noah stood in the corner of the garage and watched Pete drive away. The truth almost knocked him off his feet. He\u2019d been played...and he was supposed to be a highly trained, astute, pickup-on-all-the-signals agent. So much for his razor-sharp skills.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Pete had blindsided him. Noah had never considered the possibility that the psychiatrist might have had an ulterior motive. Unbelievable. When he\u2019d been apprised of Jordan\u2019s situation in Serenity, Pete had decided then and there to be clever. He\u2019d leave Noah and bring Nick home.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Noah whispered again. Pete had been matchmaking.</p><p>Noah called Nick from the car. When his partner answered, Noah could hear Nick\u2019s two-year-old, Samantha, laughing in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading over to the hospital to hit on your wife,\u201d he told Nick.</p><p>\u201cPick me up on your way,\u201d Nick said. \u201cSam, put that down.\u201d Noah heard a crash, then Nick\u2019s sigh. \u201cI swear to God, I don\u2019t know how Laurant does it. Hostage negotiations are a piece of cake compared to bargaining with a two-year-old.\u201d</p><p>Traffic was a bear, but that was the norm for Boston. Noah thought about Serenity. No traffic there. Just murder and mayhem.</p><p>Nick waited on his front porch holding pretty little Sam. A stunning brunette took the baby when Noah pulled into the drive.</p><p>\u201cIs that a new babysitter?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s our backup sitter,\u201d Nick explained.</p><p>\u201cSam like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she does.\u201d Nick waited a minute and then, puzzled, asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask if she\u2019s married? She\u2019s not. Want her phone number?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cNot my type.\u201d</p><p>Nick, though happily married and faithful to the love of his life, had certainly noticed how attractive the babysitter was. \u201cHow can she not be your type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just isn\u2019t,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNick, you look like you haven\u2019t gotten any sleep in a month. Is Sam keeping you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I read her a story and she\u2019s out for the night. I\u2019m the one having the trouble. It\u2019s odd. When I\u2019m out of town on a case, I sleep just fine, but when I\u2019m home, I need Laurant to be next to me. But she isn\u2019t now, and I\u2019m not sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Noah understood. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping much either since he\u2019d been home.</p><p>\u201cGot any suggestions?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stop acting like a girl.\u201d</p><p>Nothing Noah said ever bothered Nick, probably because their senses of humor and personalities were so much alike.</p><p>\u201cHow was the conference?\u201d Nick asked with a straight face. He knew how much Noah detested anything that remotely hinted of bureaucracy. \u201cI was really sorry I had to miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>Nick had a good laugh. Then he asked, \u201cHow come you haven\u2019t commented on the verdict in my father\u2019s court case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The verdict\u2019s in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been all over the news channels. Guilty on all counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been locked up in meetings and didn\u2019t hear. Your father must be relieved. How long was the deliberation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of hours. That\u2019s not the only good news. One of the detectives called to tell me they were looking at the guy\u2019s cousin for the break-in on Nathan\u2019s Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sure are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure enough to pick him up.\u201d</p><p>They were still talking about the case when Nick parked the car in the underground garage at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cYour father will be happy to get rid of those bodyguards. I know they were driving him crazy by following him everywhere he went,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019s already dismissed them.\u201d</p><p>Noah removed his suit jacket and tie and left them in the car. He rolled up his sleeves as he walked.</p><p>A tall, leggy blonde strolled toward them. She slowed down, as if waiting for a reaction, smiled at Noah, glanced at the gun at his side, and kept going.</p><p>Nick noticed that Noah hadn\u2019t noticed. He didn\u2019t even break his stride.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong with you?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI saw her.\u201d Noah shrugged. \u201cAgain, she\u2019s not my type.\u201d</p><p>The elevator was directly across from the emergency room station. Nick pushed the button.</p><p>Noah\u2019s phone rang. He saw the caller ID. \u201cThat\u2019s Chaddick,\u201d he said as he flipped the phone open. A nurse and a security guard frowned at him. The nurse pointed to the wall and shook her head. The sign on the tile next to the elevator buttons said no cell phones were allowed. There was also an outline of a phone with a red X through it.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Noah said into his phone.</p><p>The federal agent got right to the point. \u201cNoah? Chaddick here. J. D. Dickey\u2019s death has been ruled a homicide.\u201d</p><p>Noah cursed loudly. The security guard started toward him, so he pulled out his FBI badge and held it up as he listened to Chaddick\u2019s explanation. The guard backed away.</p><p>Noah snapped the phone shut as the elevator doors opened. His mind was racing. There were dozens of suspects on J. D.\u2019s blackmail list, and Serenity was a thousand miles away. Still, Noah had learned to pay attention to his instincts, and he suddenly felt very uneasy.</p><p>With a killer on the loose, where was Jordan?</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p><p>JORDAN BROKE DOWN AND PURCHASED ANOTHER CELL PHONE identical to the one J. D. Dickey had smashed before he\u2019d decked her. She could have gotten a newer model, she supposed, but she already had an extra battery in a charger sitting on her desk and a cord for her car that was specifically designed for her old phone.</p><p>She told herself she wasn\u2019t slipping back into her old tech ways. She was just being smart. A cell phone was a safety tool, especially when Jordan was jogging by herself or driving on the highway. If anything happened, help was just a phone call away\u2014providing, of course, she could get a signal.</p><p>She kept the same phone number, and when she returned home after making her purchase, she immediately plugged the unit into her computer to program it. By the time she\u2019d changed her clothes, brushed her hair, and applied a little makeup, the new phone was ready to go.</p><p>Visiting hours at the hospital would be over in an hour and a half. To avoid the rush-hour traffic on her way there, Jordan took as many side streets as possible. Unfortunately, a lot of other drivers did the same thing.</p><p>She pulled her car into a spot in an underground parking garage adjacent to the emergency room entrance. It was well lit, and there were people coming and going. The ambulance bay was next to the automatic doors.</p><p>Just outside the entrance, eating a chocolate bar, a nurse sat on a bench. Chocolate reminded Jordan of Jaffee\u2019s chocolate cake. She still hadn\u2019t called him. How long had he been waiting to hear from her? She pulled out her phone and saw that she had a signal. She could call him now. But maybe later was better. If Jaffee had a lot of computer questions for her she\u2019d be on the phone for a good, long while, and visiting hours would soon be over. Jordan couldn\u2019t miss visiting Laurant. No matter what, she vowed, as soon as she came out of the hospital, she\u2019d call Jaffee.</p><p>Entering Laurant\u2019s private room on the fifth floor, Jordan was surprised to find herself walking into a small crowd. Her father had just arrived and the judge was kissing his daughter-in-law Laurant on the cheek. Nick was there, too, sprawled in a chair half-asleep.</p><p>And there was Noah, leaning against the window ledge, waiting to talk to Judge Buchanan, who had just turned in his direction. Noah\u2019s arms were crossed and he looked perfectly relaxed. Jordan had wondered how she would feel when she saw him again, and it was exactly as she had thought: A stabbing pain shot through her heart.</p><p>So relieved to see her, Noah got angry. Where the hell had she been? Nick had told Noah that Jordan was on her way to the hospital, but she\u2019d sure taken her own sweet time getting there. Did she come by way of New Hampshire?</p><p>The wait had been agonizing. He\u2019d called her home phone and only reached her answering machine. If she had a damned cell phone, he could have been able to get hold of her while she was en route and would have known she was safe. It was the not knowing that had been tearing Noah up inside.</p><p>Jordan hugged her father and squeezed Laurant\u2019s hand. Since Nick looked like he was asleep, she didn\u2019t bother with him. Not sure of what she was going to say to Noah, Jordan finally looked over at him and managed a smile.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Not so very imaginative, but it was all she could come up with. It\u2019s nice to see you again had been her second choice. Thank God she hadn\u2019t said that.</p><p>He straightened. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>His greeting wasn\u2019t so hot either. He sounded like a drill sergeant. Grabbing her hand, Noah headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>He pulled her halfway down the hall before stopping and facing her.</p><p>\u201cListen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jordan kept her voice as low as his.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to answer. The truth was out of the question. She wondered how he would react if she told him, no, she wasn\u2019t okay, she was miserable\u2014thanks to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know...\u201d she stalled.</p><p>He frowned, waited.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Chaddick.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Jordan was past her awkwardness with Noah. \u201cI did too. Can you believe it? Were you as stunned as I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was surprised,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe gall,\u201d Jordan huffed.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheer gall of that Haden woman. On eBay no less! How could she possibly think she wouldn\u2019t be caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, what are you talking about?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy laptop. Maggie Haden was trying to sell it on eBay.\u201d</p><p>Noah lowered his head. \u201cSugar, you need to focus on the bigger picture here. Didn\u2019t you hear? J. D. Dickey\u2019s death was declared a homicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. And you\u2019re right. That\u2019s the bigger picture. I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot, but it always seems I end up with more questions than answers. Who do you think is behind it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of suspects, thanks to J. D.\u2019s list. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: I\u2019m not going to stop worrying about you until this case is closed and the killer is behind bars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSerenity\u2019s a long way from here, Noah. You don\u2019t need to worry about me. Down in Texas, I was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me,\u201d Noah said. \u201cJust be careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd get a damned cell phone.\u201d</p><p>Where had that come from? \u201cYou\u2019re such a charmer,\u201d Jordan whispered, following him back into the hospital room.</p> <p>Her father was telling Nick and Laurant a funny story about one of his \u201cshadows,\u201d the name he\u2019d given to the contingent of bodyguards who had been constantly at the judge\u2019s side for the last few months. Jordan was happy to see her father laughing again. The lines in his face had diminished, and he looked as though a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders.</p><p>When Nick raised a question about the lapse in security at Nathan\u2019s Bay, the judge downplayed it, praising the agents for their dedication and professionalism. He admitted, however, that he was glad to be rid of them.</p><p>The conversation was interrupted when Laurant\u2019s doctor arrived on his evening rounds. Everyone in the room was glad to hear the doctor say how pleased he was with the results of the medication and the tests. Laurant\u2019s contractions had stopped, and if all stayed calm through the night, she could go home as early as tomorrow morning. After promising to stop by their house tomorrow to help with Sam, Jordan left a few minutes before visiting hours were over.</p><p>Noah followed her into the hallway. From behind, he called out, \u201cWait for me. I\u2019ll walk you to your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to make a phone call that I\u2019ve been putting off,\u201d Jordan said, pulling out her cell phone. She held it up. \u201cAnd as you can see, I already purchased a \u2018damned cell phone.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cOkay then. Go make your call, but wait for me downstairs, inside by the emergency room entrance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s leaving soon. I\u2019ll come down with him,\u201d he said.</p><p>She stepped inside the elevator, then turned around. Noah watched as the doors closed between them.</p><p>OUTSIDE, PAUL PRUITT PATIENTLY WAITED FOR JORDAN. SLUMPED down behind the steering wheel, certain no one would notice him, he figured he\u2019d found the perfect spot. His rental car was tucked neatly in between two sedans. He\u2019d backed the car in to ensure he could quickly get away.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be much longer. On the seat beside him, ready to fire, was the gun.</p><p>The entire day had been a waiting game. Most of the afternoon, he\u2019d been parked down the street from Jordan\u2019s apartment. Earlier he had identified her car parked in front of her building, so he\u2019d known she was inside. His plan was to wait until she left the area, and then Pruitt would break into her apartment and get what he needed. He didn\u2019t care how long it would take. He could wait one hour or twelve. Didn\u2019t matter to him.</p><p>He\u2019d carefully mapped out his strategy. Once he\u2019d broken into her apartment, he\u2019d pack up all the copies of MacKenna\u2019s papers she had shipped from Serenity. He\u2019d brought along a bunch of big cardboard boxes for just this purpose. After he had all the documents, he\u2019d disappear, and any and all evidence implicating Paul Pruitt would be gone.</p><p>He had thought about tearing up her apartment so it would look like a simple break-in, but he\u2019d realized how foolish that plan was. Why would a thief steal research papers?</p> <p>Let Jordan wonder why they were taken. Without the copies, she\u2019d never figure it out. And Pruitt could keep his nice new life.</p><p>Unfortunately, his plan got a little more complicated once Pruitt had actually gotten inside Jordan\u2019s apartment. He had been walking across her living room when her phone rang. The answering machine quickly picked up. Jordan\u2019s father was calling to tell her that he would meet her at St. James Hospital, and to remind her that Laurant\u2019s room number was 538.</p><p>Good, he had thought. She was on her way to St. James Hospital. He didn\u2019t know who this Laurant was and didn\u2019t care. He planned to be long gone before Jordan returned home and discovered the theft.</p><p>It had been a piece of luck that Pruitt had noticed the notepad on the coffee table. Seeing what was written on it, he\u2019d stopped cold. There, in the center of the page, pulsating like a neon beacon, were the numbers: 1284. And surrounding the numbers were a bunch of question marks.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten too close. He tore the sheet of paper from the notepad, staring at it as his mind raced. Once again, everything had changed. But yet again, he knew what had to be done.</p><p>Her father...yes, her father, Judge Buchanan, was at the hospital. A perfect opportunity. Paul had done enough research on Jordan Buchanan to know who her father was, and he had immediately recognized the name when he recently heard it on the news. It was impossible to miss. The media were saturating the airwaves with reports about the major court case verdict and the judge who had presided over it. The news reports also mentioned the death threats the judge had received. So if he timed it just right, Pruitt could make it look like Judge Buchanan was the target, not his daughter Jordan.</p><p>And here he sat, in an outside parking lot with a good view of the hospital doors. If luck were truly on his side, any minute now the judge would walk through those hospital doors with his daughter.</p><p>Suddenly, Paul sat up. Was that her? Yes...Jordan Buchanan was coming through the doors.</p><p>Pruitt reached for his gun, waiting for just the right moment.</p><p>STEPPING OUTSIDE THE EMERGENCY ROOM DOORS INTO THE PARK-ing garage, Jordan turned on her cell phone and called information for Jaffee\u2019s phone number. Checking her watch and subtracting an hour, she was sure Jaffee would be at the restaurant.</p><p>Jordan knew the operator would connect the call for her, but she wanted to write down the number in case she had to call Jaffee back. She dug through her purse for a scrap of paper and a pen. Holding her phone to her ear with her shoulder, she waited, pen poised to hear the phone number. There were two benches, one on each side of a concrete pillar. Both were empty. She started toward the one farther away from the entrance. The bright fluorescent lights above the sliding glass doors bothered her eyes, and one of the tubes was flickering annoyingly and making a low buzzing sound.</p><p>As the operator recited Jaffee\u2019s number, two orderlies walked out, loudly talking to an ambulance driver, so Jordan needed to ask the operator to repeat the number. She quickly wrote it down.</p><p>She settled on the bench as the call went through.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d It was Angela on the other end. Jordan held her hand over her other ear to block out the background noise.</p><p>\u201cHello, Angela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan? Hey, Jordan! How are you doing? Jaffee\u2019s sure going to be happy to hear from you. He\u2019s really been fretting over Dora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a busy time at the restaurant? Should I call back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closed. We had bankers\u2019 hours today. Jaffee made a triple-sized chocolate sheet cake and drove it over to Trumbo\u2019s house in Bourbon. His wife, Suzanne, is having her monthly bridge club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed Jaffee. Please tell him I\u2019ll call tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, don\u2019t wait till tomorrow. You can catch him over at the Trumbo house. Jaffee\u2019s wife is one of the bridge players in the club, so Jaffee drives her to Bourbon and waits to bring her back home. It\u2019s the same every month. He takes a big old chocolate sheet cake for Suzanne to serve and a bottle of Bailey\u2019s Irish whiskey for Dave to lace his coffee with. Since he has to drive back home, Jaffee says he only drinks his coffee straight. No lacing for him. He\u2019ll be sitting there in Dave Trumbo\u2019s kitchen, so you can call him on the Trumbo\u2019s house phone. I know he\u2019d be upset if you didn\u2019t call tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jordan promised she\u2019d call Jaffee right away. She tried to hang up, but Angela wasn\u2019t quite ready to say good-bye.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear? They say J. D. Dickey got murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard that,\u201d said Jordan.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m too sorry about it. Folks sure have been acting strange since we heard though. Usually when news this big hits this town, our restaurant gets jam-packed. Everyone wants to come in and jabber on about it...like they did after you found that professor man and Lloyd, remember? The restaurant drew real crowds then. But no one\u2019s come in to talk about J. D. It\u2019s like they\u2019re all hiding in their houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they must be frightened. Until an arrest is made...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re saying. Until then, we\u2019ve got some crazy murderer running around town, so of course everyone\u2019s scared witless. Still, there\u2019s something else going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuddenly, no one looks me in the eye. It\u2019s like they\u2019re embarrassed or something. I was in the grocery story getting some more half-and-half for the restaurant and I saw Charlene doing her shopping. I went over to say hey to her\u2014I know she saw me\u2014but what does Charlene do? She leaves a cart full of groceries in the middle of the aisle and speed-walks out of the store. Her face was flaming red too. Then I hear from Mrs. Scott. A similar thing happened to her over at the hardware store\u2014only with her it was Kyle Heffermint not looking her in the eye and hightailing it out of the store. I sure wish I knew what was going on.\u201d Angela sighed.</p><p>The tapes were what was going on, Jordan knew. Charlene and the others on the list obviously weren\u2019t yet sure if anyone else in town had heard about their transgressions. Oh, no doubt, they were in a panic now.</p><p>\u201cThat all sounds very strange,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d said Angela. \u201cNow you hang up and call Jaffee...Oh, but before you do, I was just wondering...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about you and Noah, and how perfect you two look together, and I wondered if you\u2019ve decided to stay with him.\u201d</p><p>The question caught Jordan entirely off guard. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s sure a catch. But then so are you, and don\u2019t you forget it. Jaffee says he\u2019s sure he\u2019s seen your picture in one of those outdoor magazines.\u201d</p><p>Was that supposed to be a compliment? An outdoor magazine? Had Jaffee thought she\u2019d made the cover of Lumberjack Weekly?</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cAre you sure Jaffee didn\u2019t think he saw me in Glamour?\u201d</p><p>She was teasing, but Angela was serious. \u201cYou\u2019re the Ralph Lauren type, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Angela interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m just stating the truth. Just don\u2019t make the same mistake I made, Jordan. Don\u2019t wait eighteen years for any man. And if he doesn\u2019t realize what he\u2019s got right in front of him, he\u2019s never going to know.\u201d</p><p>With that as the final word, Angela finally hung up. Jordan found another blank scrap of paper in her purse and again called information. She thought about Angela\u2019s comments while waiting for the operator to key in her request for Dave Trumbo\u2019s phone number.</p><p>Behind her, the glass doors opened. A woman walked out carrying a basket of wilted flowers. Jordan looked around and spotted her father stepping out of the elevator at the end of the hall. Behind him was Noah.</p><p>\u201cI have two listings for a Dave Trumbo,\u201d the operator said. \u201cA Dave Trumbo Motors at 9818 Frontage Road and a Dave Trumbo at 1284 Royal Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the home...Wait. Will you repeat that second address on Royal please? Did you say 1284?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, 1284 Royal. That number is...\u201d</p><p>Jordan was so stunned she dropped her phone in her lap. Dave \u201cI\u2019ll-make-you-a-deal\u201d Trumbo lived at 1284 Royal.</p><p>Wait until Noah heard this! Jordan grabbed her phone and shoved it into her purse, then jumped to her feet. A car backfired, the sound huge and piercing. A nearby chunk of concrete from the pillar suddenly exploded. She instinctively pivoted to get away from the flying fragments. The car backfired again, and Jordan felt a tremendous jolt from behind. Tires screeched, and a car sped past her in a blur. She caught a glimpse of the driver out of the corner of her eye, just as her legs gave out.</p><p>Everything happened in slow motion: Noah pushing her father, running toward her, shouting, pulling his gun from his holster.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes closed as she slammed into the pavement.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>THE HOSPITAL WAS IN LOCKDOWN. NO ONE WAS GETTING IN OR out until the all clear was sounded. Policemen blocked every entrance, and emergencies were temporarily being shuffled to other medical centers. The police also were doing a thorough search of the garage and a floor-by-floor search of the hospital to make certain there weren\u2019t any other shooters hiding inside.</p><p>The attempted murder of a federal judge was big news, and there were television crews set up on all sides of the hospital. They were all competing to get an interview with anyone who might be able to tell them what had happened.</p><p>Judge Buchanan\u2019s daughter was reported to be in critical condition. One reporter speculated\u2014on the air no less\u2014that if Jordan hadn\u2019t been within seconds of emergency personnel, she would have bled to death.</p><p>That was something the Buchanan family didn\u2019t need to hear. They were gathered in the surgical waiting room, talking in whispers and pacing while they waited for Jordan to emerge from surgery.</p><p>Two policemen stood guard outside the door and had made it perfectly clear that they weren\u2019t going to let Judge Buchanan out of their sight until his bodyguards took over. Two of them were on their way to the hospital now.</p><p>Judge Buchanan had aged twenty years since he\u2019d watched his daughter crumble to the ground. Noah had thrown him into a wall to get him out of the line of fire. The judge had heard him yell, \u201cDown! Get Down!\u201d as he raced toward Jordan. He\u2019d never forget the look on Noah\u2019s face when he\u2019d knelt beside Jordan. He looked destroyed.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s mother sat beside her husband, gripping his hand. Tears streaked down her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomeone needs to call Sidney,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to hear it on the news. Has anyone called Alec? Dylan? Where\u2019s Father Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way back to Holy Oaks,\u201d the judge told her.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to call him. He\u2019ll want to know. And we need a priest here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to die,\u201d Zachary, the youngest, shouted angrily.</p> <p>Noah had separated himself from the family. He didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. He couldn\u2019t talk now. Standing in front of a window across the room from the others, he stared blankly out into the night. It was difficult to breathe, impossible to think. He was in a cold rage. Blood...there had been so much blood. He had felt Jordan slipping away from him.</p><p>This waiting was horrific. He\u2019d been shot before, and he remembered it had hurt like hell, but that pain was nothing compared to what Noah was feeling now. If he lost her...Oh God...he couldn\u2019t lose her...couldn\u2019t live without her...</p><p>Nick had taken the elevator down to Laurant\u2019s room to tell her what had happened. His wife was sound asleep, and so he decided not to wake her. He pulled the plug on the television set on his way out the door and told the nurse on duty not to mention the shooting. Tomorrow would be soon enough to hear such bad news.</p><p>When Nick returned to the surgical floor, he spotted Noah standing alone. He went to stand beside him.</p><p>And the wait continued.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, the surgeon, Dr. Emmett, walked into the room. He was smiling as he pulled off his cap. Judge Buchanan rushed to meet him.</p><p>\u201cJordan did just fine,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cThe bullet went through her rib cage, and she lost some blood, but I expect a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>The judge shook the doctor\u2019s hand and thanked him profusely.</p><p>\u201cHow soon can we see her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in recovery now, and she\u2019s already coming out of the anesthesia. I\u2019ll let one of you go in, but only for a minute. She needs to rest.\u201d The surgeon started for the door. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me.\u201d</p><p>The judge didn\u2019t move. \u201cNoah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s awake, give her our love.\u201d</p><p>Nick had to give him a shove to get him moving. The news that Jordan was going to be okay had made Noah weak with relief. He followed the doctor down the hall.</p><p>\u201cJust one minute,\u201d Dr. Emmett instructed. \u201cI want her to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was the only patient in the recovery room. A nurse was checking her IV, and when she saw Noah, she stepped out of the way.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cIs she in pain?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said the nurse. \u201cShe\u2019s coming in and out of consciousness.\u201d</p> <p>Noah stood beside her bed, content to watch her sleep. His hand rested on top of hers, and he could feel the warmth. The color was returning to her face.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her forehead and then whispered into her ear, \u201cI love you, Jordan. You hear me? I love you, and I\u2019m never letting you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah...\u201d Her voice was a hoarse whisper. She didn\u2019t open her eyes as she said his name.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure she had heard him, and so he tried to soothe her. \u201cI love you. You\u2019re going to be okay. The surgery is over, and you\u2019re in recovery. You need to rest now. Sleep, Sugar.\u201d</p><p>She tried to raise her hand, and her brow wrinkled into a frown.</p><p>\u201cSleep now,\u201d he whispered, gently stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cHe shot me.\u201d Though weak, her voice was surprisingly clear.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were shot, but you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to open her eyes, but her eyelids were too heavy. \u201cI saw him.\u201d</p><p>She drifted off again. Noah waited. She saw him? She saw the shooter? Did she know what she was saying?</p><p>She whispered the words again. \u201cI saw him.\u201d</p><p>Her voice faded. He leaned over her with his ear close to her lips. Her words were faint but slow and measured. \u201cHe tried to kill me...Dave...Trumbo.\u201d</p><p>She fell back into a deep sleep.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>DID JORDAN UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE HAD TOLD HIM? OR was she hallucinating from the drugs that were still in her system? Noah had to make sure. He waited by the side of her bed, and each time she awoke he asked her again to tell him what she had seen.</p><p>The answer was always the same. Dave Trumbo.</p><p>Her eyes were open now, and he could see that she was in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou have to let her sleep,\u201d the nurse told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in here fifteen minutes, and that\u2019s enough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hurting,\u201d he said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just about to give her something. It\u2019s important to keep ahead of the pain. She\u2019ll sleep until tomorrow. She\u2019ll be moved to ICU by then.\u201d</p><p>The nurse injected mor**ine into the IV. He waited until she had finished and then asked, \u201cDoes she know what she\u2019s saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d she answered. \u201cMost of my patients don\u2019t make much sense at all. And she won\u2019t remember anything she said by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Noah kissed Jordan again and went out into the hallway. Nick leaned against the wall, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI can\u2019t think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2019s going to be okay. Take a breath, Noah. It\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. \u201cYeah, I know she\u2019s going to be okay. That\u2019s not the problem now. She told me something, and I don\u2019t know if I should believe her or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saw the shooter,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty out of it,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut she kept saying the same thing. Her voice was getting stronger, and she seemed more alert. I tell you, I think she did see the bastard. I heard the car tearing out of the parking lot, but I got outside too late to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can believe anything she said. She\u2019s drugged...\u201d</p><p>Noah threaded his fingers through his hair in agitation. \u201cThe nurse told me she hears some crazy things, but still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta wait until Jordan really wakes up. She\u2019s going to be in so much pain they\u2019ll keep her sedated for at least twenty-four hours. It will be a while before she\u2019s lucid.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cShe saw him, and she told me who he was. Dave Trumbo. He\u2019s the guy who sells cars in Bourbon. A big shot around Serenity. I don\u2019t think you met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a car salesman come all the way to Boston to kill Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but ten to one he wouldn\u2019t come here unless he thought she could connect him to the three murders in Serenity. I\u2019m not going to wait around until she\u2019s clear of the pain medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t put his name out there yet. What if it\u2019s all in Jordan\u2019s head? You have to have more before you go after him.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s Trumbo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy way to find out. Call him at home. If he answers the phone, you\u2019ll know Jordan dreamed it up.\u201d</p><p>Nick got the number from information. He made sure he\u2019d blocked the caller ID and handed the phone to Noah.</p><p>Trumbo\u2019s wife answered.</p><p>Noah\u2019s voice was syrupy sweet. \u201cHi, there. This is Bob. I\u2019m really sorry I\u2019m callin\u2019 so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it isn\u2019t late,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCould I speak to Dave? He told me to call him if I had a question about my car, and darned if I can\u2019t figure out this remote alarm thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Bob, but Dave\u2019s not here. He\u2019s in Atlanta at a big auto show. May I take your number and have him call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a real fix. Don\u2019t know if you can hear it, but the car\u2019s alarm is blarin\u2019 away outside and is wakin\u2019 up all the neighbors. Do you happen to know where he\u2019s stayin\u2019 in Atlanta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. What a shame. He just called me a few minutes ago. But he was in such a hurry, we didn\u2019t have long to talk, so I didn\u2019t get the name of his hotel. He was planning on coming home tomorrow but said something\u2019s come up and he may have to stay in Atlanta longer. What about the service manager? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to help you. I could give you that number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate it, but I think I should be able to work this out myself. Hope Dave\u2019s havin\u2019 a good time in Atlanta. \u2019Bye now.\u201d</p><p>Noah disconnected the call, looked at Nick, and said, \u201cThat son of a bitch is here. She said he\u2019s at an auto show in Atlanta, but he\u2019s here, Nick.\u201d</p><p>They headed down the hall toward the waiting room.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about this Dave Trumbo?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a car dealer. That\u2019s about it, except for two other things. He isn\u2019t home, and he hasn\u2019t told his wife where he\u2019s staying in Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need more than that to go after him. He could be taking a vacation with his mistress or maybe he really is at a car show. I\u2019ll get some agents to look for him in Atlanta. They can check the show as soon as it opens tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. Nick was calming him down. \u201cOkay, good,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to see what we can find out about Trumbo. Call Chaddick and tell him what happened. See if he can get any leads to locate him. And tell him he\u2019s got to figure out a way...a quiet way...to get Trumbo\u2019s fingerprints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s in the system?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to find out. I want to know everything there is to know about him.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll run his name and see what I can come up with. One phone call and we can get his history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your father still here?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to put a twenty-four-hour guard on Jordan, and I want her to stay in critical condition. Your father needs to know that the party line is that Jordan\u2019s still critical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind Trumbo. If Jordan knows something that connects him to the murders, he\u2019s going to come after her again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>NICK HAD TAKEN OVER ONE OF THE HOSPITAL\u2019S WAITING rooms and was using it as a command post as he called in every possible favor. He got Pete Morganstern out of bed to make calls because he knew the eminent doctor could get the information much quicker than either he or Noah could.</p><p>Noah was also on the phone to Texas, Chaddick had really come through for him. Noah didn\u2019t know how the agent had accomplished it, but he had gotten into Trumbo\u2019s office and had taken several items he was certain had Trumbo\u2019s fingerprints on them. One of those items was a coffee mug with the imprint \u201cBest Dad in the World.\u201d</p><p>Chaddick gave Noah an update while on his way to the lab. \u201cShould have something in a couple of hours...hopefully a couple of hours,\u201d he qualified. \u201cHow is Jordan doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Noah said. \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a situation we\u2019ve got here,\u201d Chaddick said. \u201cStreet is on his way to the office. He\u2019ll run a computer search on Trumbo and see what he can find.\u201d</p><p>There were now at least four agents searching through the FBI\u2019s voluminous computer files, but Dr. Morganstern was the first to break the strange news to Noah.</p><p>\u201cDave Trumbo\u2019s life started fifteen years ago. According to the records, he didn\u2019t exist before then. New social security number, new name, new everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitness protection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Morganstern agreed. \u201cI\u2019m waiting to hear something more. Fingerprints would certainly save us some time. Any possibility...\u201d</p><p>Noah told him about Chaddick. \u201cAs soon as he knows something, he\u2019ll call. I\u2019m betting his prints are in the system.\u201d</p><p>Noah found Nick and explained what Morganstern had found out. Nick wasn\u2019t surprised. He\u2019d heard the same information from another source a short while ago.</p><p>Every few minutes Noah would look in on Jordan to assure himself that she was sleeping soundly. He was becoming so familiar with the monitoring devices, he didn\u2019t need to ask how her body was responding to trauma. Her pulse and blood pressure were both steady. The rhythmic beeping sound of her heart was a comfort to him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sleep at all through the night, and when he had gone in to check on Jordan around seven, they were in the process of moving her to a private room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a step down from ICU,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cShe\u2019s doing just great. Once we get her settled, you can sit in the room with her.\u201d</p><p>It was great news. He was walking out of the unit when the nurse caught up with him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me...Agent Clayborne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the patient still supposed to be listed as critical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked worried. \u201cI\u2019m afraid word will get out. Someone will leak it to the media. They always do.\u201d</p><p>He agreed. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to buy us a little more time.\u201d He was desperate to find out who Trumbo was before that news was also leaked to the press.</p><p>Nick had done a complete turnaround from the night before. He now wanted to plaster Trumbo\u2019s face and name everywhere.</p><p>Noah held him off. \u201cObviously fifteen years ago he changed his identity. He can do it again,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd we would never know if and when he might come after Jordan again. We have to wait until we hear from Chaddick. We both know the guy\u2019s been hiding from something, so his fingerprints are bound to turn up on a file.\u201d</p><p>Noah paced for a while and then went into Jordan\u2019s new sterile, white room. He stood at the foot of the bed watching her, his hands shoved in his pockets.</p><p>Nick entered a minute later. \u201cMan, you look worse than she does,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>They both noticed her smile. It was fleeting, but it was there. \u201cYou hear us, Jordan?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>She smiled again. And then she fell back asleep.</p><p>Judge Buchanan stood at the door. \u201cHow is she?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Noah beckoned to him. \u201cShe\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit with her for a while,\u201d the judge said. He quietly pulled the chair close to the bed. \u201cGo get some rest,\u201d he ordered both of them, knowing full well neither would. Nick turned to follow Noah out the door when his father called his name. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>The judge got up and walked into the hallway so he wouldn\u2019t disturb his daughter.</p><p>\u201cYour wife would like to have a word with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake?\u201d he asked, surprised. He quickly looked at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s already past seven? I thought it was...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve lost about four hours. Does Laurant know about Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she does. She was watching the news when your mother and I walked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI unplugged the television...\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, someone plugged it back in. Your mother\u2019s sitting with her, and both of them want an update on Jordan\u2019s condition. I\u2019ll switch places with your mother in a little while. She\u2019ll want to be with Jordan.\u201d</p><p>Nick took the stairs to get to Laurant while Noah went back into the waiting room to call Chaddick. He\u2019d been checking in with him every half hour. He was probably driving the agent nuts, but Noah didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d stop harassing him when he got the information he needed.</p> <p>Dr. Morganstern appeared in the doorway. Noah raised his index finger to ask him to wait while he answered Chaddick.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got his name,\u201d Chaddick blurted.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul Newton Pruitt.\u201d</p><p>Noah repeated the name for Morganstern.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of him?\u201d Chaddick asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Tell me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cFor openers, he\u2019s been dead for fifteen years. Yeah, I know, he isn\u2019t dead,\u201d he rushed on. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you what I read. Pruitt was connected. He testified against a mob-connected guy named Chernoff. Ray Chernoff. No doubt you\u2019ve heard of Chernoff. Pruitt\u2019s testimony sent him away for a couple of life sentences. Pruitt was supposed to stay in protective custody and testify at two other trials, and then they were going to put him in witness protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d he asked as he rubbed the back of his neck to ease his tension.</p><p>\u201cPruitt vanished,\u201d Chaddick continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened. The agents in charge found blood in his apartment. A lot of blood, and all of it was his. No body though. After a lengthy investigation, they concluded he was killed by one of Chernoff\u2019s associates. They also concluded that they\u2019d never find his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe staged his own death and started over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he did a fine job of it until now,\u201d Chaddick added.</p><p>\u201cWas Chernoff \u2019s trial high-profile?\u201d asked Noah.</p><p>\u201cIt sure was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLots of camera time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, not a lot,\u201d said Chaddick. \u201cThey tried to keep it out of the press to protect their witnesses, but you know how that goes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan told me that Professor MacKenna had bragged to her that he never forgot a face. I\u2019ll just bet the professor saw Pruitt and recognized him. That\u2019s it!\u201d said Noah.</p><p>\u201cThe cash deposits. MacKenna was blackmailing him. Nasty,\u201d Chaddick muttered. \u201cIt seems to me, half of Serenity was being blackmailed by J. D. I couldn\u2019t figure the professor\u2019s angle, but it looks like he had a rather lucrative sideline as well.\u201d</p><p>Noah dropped down on the sofa and hunched forward into the phone. \u201cSo now we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, everyone under the sun is going to go after this guy. You\u2019re going to get flooded with agents wanting in on this. And if Chernoff\u2019s gang hears that Pruitt\u2019s surfaced, they\u2019re going to be on the lookout for him too. I just hope he hasn\u2019t already gone to ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHe\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Chaddick didn\u2019t wait for confirmation. \u201cI\u2019m getting on the next plane to Boston. I want to be in on this too. I talked to Trumbo. I mean Pruitt. Hell, I shook his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious? You\u2019re coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right. Wait to kill him, okay?\u201d</p><p>It was funny really\u2014Chaddick assuming Noah would find Pruitt and also assuming he\u2019d kill him. But in fact that was exactly what Noah planned to do.</p><p>Chapter Forty-one</p><p>HAD HE GOTTEN THE JOB DONE OR NOT? WAS JORDAN Buchanan going to live or die? Ironically, Pruitt\u2019s life hung in the balance as well. If she survived, he\u2019d have to go back and finish the job, but if she died, he could return to his family and his work.</p><p>She was still listed in critical condition. Pruitt had called the hospital twice during the night for an update. He\u2019d gotten through to ICU with his second call and had been informed by an efficient but harried nurse that Jordan Buchanan had not regained consciousness.</p><p>He had checked into a run-down motel close to the airport to wait it out. He\u2019d snatched only a couple of hours\u2019 sleep, staying glued to the television news station. The early-morning news on Channel 7 ran a story on Judge Buchanan and his impressive career on the bench. On another local channel there was a taped interview with a matronly woman with bleached straw hair and painted-on eyebrows who swore she had witnessed the shooting. She was quite animated as she described what had happened. She had just walked out of the hospital when gunfire erupted. She insisted that, had she been one minute later, she would have been the innocent victim instead of the poor federal judge\u2019s daughter. She told the interviewer she was cutting behind an ambulance to get to her car when the gunfire started blazing.</p><p>Her account of the shooting was all wrong. She claimed to have seen two men firing at the judge, one hanging out the passenger window of a late-model Chevy sedan. As the car careened around the corner, both the driver and the other man opened fire. Logistically, what she claimed was impossible. If there had been two men and both had been firing their weapons, then one of the gunmen would have been shooting into parked cars.</p><p>The TV reporter doing the interview didn\u2019t catch the inconsistency. His voice reeked of false sympathy. \u201cThat must have been terrifying. Did you see Judge Buchanan\u2019s daughter fall? Can you remember how many shots were fired? Did you see them? And could you identify them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she\u2019d answered. That was the only time during the interview the woman seemed nervous. No, she couldn\u2019t possibly identify either one of them. Their faces had been covered, and they were wearing hoodies.</p><p>And on it went. The more sympathy and interest the newscaster showed, the bigger and more outrageous the story became. The pathetic woman was making the most of her moment of fame. Eager to please and impress, she smiled into the camera and continued to embellish her account.</p><p>The good news for Pruitt was that every news bulletin update began with the same lead-in, the attempted murder of a federal judge.</p><p>It was an automatic assumption, and there weren\u2019t any questions raised. Why would there be? There had been death threats against the judge. Of course he was the target, and his daughter was just an innocent bystander.</p><p>But Pruitt still needed to destroy the copies of the research. He was going to buy a paper shredder from an office supply store. He\u2019d already searched through the phone book and found several that were at least twenty miles away from the hospital. He then planned to return to the motel and spend the afternoon shredding and stuffing plastic bags with the confetti paper. When he was finished, he would drop the bags into the Dumpster behind the motel and be done with that problem.</p><p>That stupid little man had almost destroyed his life. Pruitt didn\u2019t feel an ounce of remorse for killing him. The bastard had been blackmailing him and deserved to die. The fool obviously had not guessed the lengths Pruitt would go to to protect himself.</p><p>A stupid twist of fate, Pruitt thought. That\u2019s what it was. Someone had walked into his showroom to look around while his car was being repaired in the service department. He\u2019d seen Pruitt then, and as he had explained later over the phone in a disguised voice, he had recognized him from the Chernoff trial coverage. The man bragged that he\u2019d never forgotten a face, and Pruitt\u2019s face was especially memorable. At one point, Pruitt had been led into a courthouse to testify against the patriarch of the Chernoff family. He had tried to cover his head as he was rushed into the building, but despite the law\u2019s attempt to keep his picture out of the media, the cameras had gotten a couple of good shots.</p><p>By testifying and telling family secrets, Pruitt had been breaking the code, but he\u2019d been promised amnesty, and his freedom was worth any price he had to pay. He\u2019d worked as an enforcer and a collector for the Chernoff family, and he\u2019d given the prosecutor names. He also swore under oath that he had witnessed his employer, Ray Chernoff, murder his own wife, Marie Chernoff. Pruitt\u2019s details about the crime were so accurate, the jury believed him. When that crime was added to a myriad of others, Chernoff received three consecutive life sentences.</p><p>Most of what Pruitt had told the jury was true. He was quite specific about the killings ordered by the boss when a \u201cclient\u201d refused to cooperate. He\u2019d only tweaked a few important facts. He lied when he said that he himself had never killed anyone. He also lied when he said that he had witnessed Ray brutally stabbing his wife to death. In reality, it was Paul Pruitt who had killed Marie Chernoff. The opportunity had presented itself, and Pruitt pinned the murder on Ray Chernoff.</p><p>After the verdict, Ray was dragged out of the courtroom screaming at Pruitt, swearing revenge.</p><p>Killing Marie was the most difficult thing Pruitt had ever done, and to this day he thought about her. Oh, how he had loved her.</p><p>He had been quite the womanizer before he had met her at a Christmas party. The second he laid eyes on her, he had fallen in love with her. They started their affair that very night, and he pledged his undying love to her at each of their clandestine meetings from then on.</p><p>But sweet Marie became consumed with guilt. She would meet him and spread her legs for him, and then she would get dressed and go to church to light a candle for her sin of adultery. After a while, even that wasn\u2019t enough. She told Pruitt she wanted to end their affair, that she would confess her sins to her husband and beg forgiveness. Pruitt remembered picking up the knife and walking toward her. He hadn\u2019t meant to kill her. He just wanted to scare her a little, make her see that both of their lives would be over if she told. But Marie got hysterical and he couldn\u2019t stop. He\u2019d cried as he stabbed her.</p><p>He justified his actions by telling himself there hadn\u2019t been any other way. Ray might have forgiven Marie for her infidelity, but he certainly wouldn\u2019t have forgiven Pruitt. In the end, didn\u2019t it come down to kill or be killed?</p><p>Once Ray Chernoff was put away, Pruitt thought he might have a chance. But things didn\u2019t work out. Though Chernoff was behind bars, he still had plenty of connections on the outside, and the government\u2019s promise of protection was a joke. Even if they relocated Pruitt, he\u2019d be watched. No, he had to take care of himself. For several weeks he lived the life of a paranoid, and then, finally, one day he arrived home to see a shadow on the stairwell. There was no mistaking the fact that the man hiding one flight above him was pointing a gun and lying in wait for him. Pruitt took off and hid in a bar down the street until the coast was clear. Then he cautiously returned to his apartment and did what he had to do. As far as anyone knew, Paul Pruitt died that day.</p><p>For the last fifteen years he\u2019d lived a lie. He\u2019d been so careful. After the first ten years, he began to relax. He had moved as far away from his home as he could imagine, settling in a small town in Texas. He got a job selling cars in Bourbon and eventually worked his way into owning the dealership. He\u2019d even managed to find a wife who wouldn\u2019t ask too many questions. When people suggested that he do more advertising, he declined. He never wanted a camera near him. He was content right where he was. He had enough money to feel important. Maybe his ego got the better of him a time or two. He did like it when people looked up to him. He had earned some respect as Dave Trumbo in his part of the world, and he liked the fact that they were glad to see him when he came around.</p><p>The call from an anonymous man who had recognized him threatened to take everything away. After that first message, he\u2019d tried to track down the caller. Every time he put the cash in the manila envelope and mailed it to another post office box, he\u2019d try to find out who the blackmailer was, but each time the mystery man called, he\u2019d give Pruitt a different address. Pruitt had even hidden and waited by one of the post offices to see who would carry out the package, the one he had marked with a fluorescent yellow pen. He\u2019d put in two long days and nights sitting in a car on a street in Austin, binoculars in his lap, hoping to catch a glimpse of the bastard. When no one picked up the money in that time, he had returned to Bourbon. As the demands for money increased over the next month, Pruitt grew more panicky.</p><p>J. D. Dickey put an end to all of that. Pruitt had never met the man, but he\u2019d heard about him. He knew he\u2019d been in prison and also knew his brother was the sheriff of Jessup County. He had to give it to J. D. for having the balls to walk into his office, shut the door, and calmly tell him he could help him solve his little problem.</p><p>And what would that problem be? Pruitt remembered asking.</p><p>J. D. had laid it all out on the table. He explained he\u2019d gotten into a new line of work that he found quite lucrative. He was now into blackmail. Before Pruitt could react to his confession, J. D. put his hands up and assured him that he hadn\u2019t blackmailed him, and he had no plans to do so in the future.</p><p>He wanted to work for him. Pruitt remembered the conversation almost word for word. J. D. had told him how he would spend his days and evenings cruising neighborhoods and listening in on conversations with his surveillance equipment. If he heard something interesting, like a man cheating on his wife, well then, he\u2019d make a note of it. Sometimes he\u2019d even get into a room and set up a microphone or a camera. He found that videotaping sex brought him a lot of money. Some Serenity residents had some peculiar sexual habits. J. D. then gave Pruitt several examples.</p><p>It took J. D. a while to get back to Pruitt\u2019s problem, but Pruitt didn\u2019t mind. He was fascinated by what he was hearing. J. D. finally came around to the subject of Pruitt\u2019s blackmailer. He explained that he had been parked up the street from the man\u2019s house and had listened in as he talked to Pruitt on one of his cell phones. He didn\u2019t know what Pruitt had done but assumed that he was probably having an affair or maybe something more serious, like skimming money off his profits at the dealership and not reporting it to the IRS. J. D. said he didn\u2019t care what he had done, but he could help him get rid of his blackmailer. He could chase him out of town. And he would do it free of charge if Paul would put him on his payroll for future problems. Maybe he could be like a lawyer and be on retainer, J. D. suggested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pruitt quickly agreed. Relieved that J. D. didn\u2019t have a clue about his real identity, he made the decision then and there to force J. D. to help him get rid of the blackmailer. Then Pruitt would get rid of J. D.</p><p>When J. D. gave up the professor\u2019s name, he didn\u2019t have any notion that he was signing MacKenna\u2019s death warrant. Pruitt told J. D. that he wanted to talk to MacKenna before J. D. scared the professor into leaving town. He asked J. D. to meet him at MacKenna\u2019s house, though J. D. hadn\u2019t known the professor was going to die.</p><p>Pruitt now remembered how he had had a good laugh as he told J. D. that he was now an accomplice to murder, and right then he was going to get rid of the professor\u2019s body for Pruitt.</p><p>J. D. was terrified. Pruitt didn\u2019t care. He told him to follow his orders and everything would be just fine. The first priority was to get rid of the body.</p> <p>In retrospect, Pruitt realized he should have been more specific. He also should have realized how stupid J. D. was. He shook his head as he thought about it. J. D. believed he was so clever, dumping the professor\u2019s body in Jordan Buchanan\u2019s car because she was a stranger in town. He thought he could place the blame on her, and he had it all set up. Or so he thought.</p><p>But J. D. hadn\u2019t expected Lloyd to witness him stuffing the professor\u2019s body in the trunk. And J. D. hadn\u2019t expected that Pruitt\u2014or Dave, as he knew him\u2014would do whatever it took to keep Lloyd\u2019s fat mouth shut. In fact, he hadn\u2019t thought much of anything through. J. D. certainly hadn\u2019t thought that Dave Trumbo would kill him.</p><p>Paul Pruitt stacked his hands on his chest and leaned back. It would have been so much simpler for all involved if J. D. had taken the professor\u2019s body out into the desert and buried it, but he had to go and try to be clever instead.</p><p>Pruitt fell asleep wondering if he\u2019d killed J. D. outright when he\u2019d clobbered him from behind. Or had J. D. simply been stunned, and had he felt the fire eating his flesh?</p><p>Chapter Forty-two</p> <p>PILLOWS TUCKED ALL AROUND HER, JORDAN WAS SITTING UP in bed\u2014with medical assistance\u2014when Noah checked on her later in the afternoon.</p><p>She looked pale again, which Noah mentioned to the nurse after the woman finished checking Jordan\u2019s temperature.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s been up and has walked a few steps today,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cShe\u2019s worn out.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was more clearheaded each time he saw her. She took this opportunity to plead her case again. \u201cMay I have some water please?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The nurse briskly shook her head. \u201cAbsolutely not. Nothing at all by mouth yet. I\u2019ll get you a cold washcloth and maybe a few ice chips.\u201d</p><p>What was she supposed to do with a washcloth? Noah waited until the nurse left, then came around to the side of the bed and gently touched Jordan\u2019s hand. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve been shot.\u201d She sounded disgruntled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s what happened, Sugar.\u201d</p><p>So much for sympathy. Her mother had sat at her bedside most of the morning, and each time Jordan opened her eyes, her mother was dabbing the tears on her cheeks, asking what she could do to make Jordan feel better. She also kept calling Jordan \u201cyou poor darling.\u201d Noah, on the other hand, went the opposite route, acting like getting shot wasn\u2019t any big deal. Jordan much preferred his approach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re anxious to get back to your life,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She sounded pitiful. Her eyes closed for a second, and she didn\u2019t see his exasperated expression.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep just yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a change. Everyone else who comes in here insists again and again that I sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what you told me in recovery?\u201d</p> <p>She eyed him suspiciously. \u201cWas I talking a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too much,\u201d Noah said with a laugh. \u201cBut you did say something about the shooting.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened with the returning memory. \u201cYes...Dave Trumbo tried to kill me.\u201d Then, as though what she had said finally penetrated, she continued. \u201cWhy did he shoot me? What did I ever do to him?\u201d She thought for a minute and said sarcastically, \u201cI guess maybe I should have bought a car from him.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to think. She knew she wanted to tell Noah something else, but she couldn\u2019t remember what it was.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to him,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou can sleep now. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>Noah moved the chair close to Jordan and sat. He was so weary. If he could rest for just a minute...</p><p>\u201cDid you figure it out yet? I did.\u201d Her voice interrupted his dreams.</p><p>He looked over at her and saw a smile. \u201cWhat did you figure out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe date\u20141284. And the crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKenna\u2019s research papers, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe date isn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>Did Jordan know she wasn\u2019t making any sense? \u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, tentatively.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Trumbo\u2019s address. 1284 Royal Street. That\u2019s where he lives. So why don\u2019t you go there and get him so I can have a little chat with him?\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled. The old Jordan was coming back full force.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t figure it out earlier. In my defense,\u201d she continued, \u201cI was reading historical research. But you know what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrumbo saw it. It\u2019s the only way he could have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he first met me, I was in Jaffee\u2019s restaurant, and I had a lot of the research spread out on the table. He called it homework. He had to have seen it.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was dry and her throat was sore. She swallowed and said, \u201cTrumbo saw the date, 1284, and a crown. What he saw was his address in MacKenna\u2019s papers, but we didn\u2019t know what it was. The boxes I mailed...they\u2019re inside my apartment. There might be more incriminating information about him in those pages. You should send someone over. It\u2019s evidence now.\u201d</p><p>Noah made the call to Nick then and there. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people on their way,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll need my key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they won\u2019t. They can get in. You can rest now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t catch him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But I will.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyelids drooped, and he waited until she\u2019d drifted off before he closed his own eyes.</p><p>An hour later, Nick shook him awake. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>Noah sat up with a start. His hand automatically went for the snap on his holster. \u201cWhat the...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up. They\u2019re waiting,\u201d Nick repeated.</p><p>\u201cLower your voice. You\u2019ll wake Jordan.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s already awake. You were out. We\u2019ve been carrying on a conversation for a couple of minutes now.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Noah stood up that he realized that Judge Buchanan and Jordan\u2019s youngest brother, Zachary, were in the room with them. Nick motioned for Noah to follow him out to the hallway. Noah caught himself before he ordered a federal judge not to wear out his own daughter.</p><p>Nick walked toward the elevators. \u201cI\u2019ve got some bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cPruitt broke into Jordan\u2019s apartment. He took the copies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell.\u201d Noah cursed his stupidity. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I send someone over there sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan got shot. She\u2019s been your priority...and mine.\u201d</p><p>Noah issued a deep sigh. He couldn\u2019t let his guard down. He needed to be on his game now more than ever before. For Jordan\u2019s sake. \u201cI need caffeine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete\u2019s waiting for us in the cafeteria. Food\u2019s bad, but you should eat something. I did, and it was god-awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood advertisement. I can\u2019t wait!\u201d</p><p>The elevator was taking too long, so they took the stairs. Dr. Morganstern was sitting alone at a corner table. Noah grabbed a soda and went over to join him.</p><p>There was an untouched dinner salad in front of Pete. He saw Noah looking at it. \u201cReminds me of my days in medical school,\u201d Pete said with a disgusted scowl, pushing the plate away. \u201cLet\u2019s get down to business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are several agents eager to take this case. They\u2019re anxious to get Pruitt, and they want him alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAre they thinking they\u2019ll give him another pass if he\u2019ll testify against some more of Chernoff\u2019s associates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re being evasive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPruitt killed three people in Serenity and was trying for four with Jordan. No way is this lowlife gonna get a pass,\u201d Nick countered.</p><p>\u201cThat is not our decision...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Noah was emphatic.</p><p>Nick backed him up. \u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Morganstern didn\u2019t pull rank on them. \u201cI happen to agree with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere are these agents?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cAcross town, waiting for the okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay for what?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cTo go public with our search for Pruitt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Noah protested. \u201cHe\u2019ll vanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you propose?\u201d Pete asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing this all wrong,\u201d said Noah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPruitt thinks he\u2019s safe for now. But he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in those papers, and whether we have any more information about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can you be sure that\u2019s what he thinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s here. Everyone\u2019s on the lookout for him, and he hasn\u2019t surfaced. Pruitt\u2019s cautious. Jordan told me that she had the research papers spread out in front of him with his street number right there plain as day. He might suspect there\u2019s other incriminating information in the professor\u2019s research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks he can still fix this,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>\u201cYes, and he\u2019s halfway there,\u201d Noah concurred. \u201cHe broke into Jordan\u2019s apartment and got the copies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Pete asked.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d Noah answered. \u201cPruitt\u2019s waiting to hear if she makes it or not.\u201d</p><p>The doctor drummed his fingers on the table. \u201cIf we put Pruitt\u2019s name out there, we\u2019ll lose him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Noah said. Nick nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen. You have a plan?\u201d said Pete.</p><p>Noah was glad he asked. \u201cYes, sir, I do. We\u2019re setting a trap for this rat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Noah said, \u201cI\u2019m going to lure Pruitt back to Jordan\u2019s apartment, but we\u2019ll have to move fast to set it up.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled, but Pete frowned, saying, \u201cAnd how are you going to accomplish that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one phone call,\u201d Noah answered. \u201cThat\u2019s all it will take.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty-three</p><p>\u201cANGELA. THIS IS NOAH CLAYBORNE.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness. Noah!\u201d On the other end of the phone, Angela was clearly surprised at his call. He heard a small crash and wondered if the waitress had just dropped some of Jaffee\u2019s dishes. \u201cYou poor thing. How are you doing? We were devastated to hear about Jordan. It\u2019s been all the talk around Serenity. How is she? We heard she was listed critical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to stay...hopeful, you know? It\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know how it is. We\u2019re all praying for her. And you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t regained consciousness,\u201d he said.</p><p>He looked down at his notepad and drew a line through the first of several pieces of information he wanted to give her.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t? I\u2019m so sorry. I sure wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason I\u2019m calling...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Angela said eagerly.</p><p>\u201cThey gave me her things...you know. And I was going through her purse to get her phone so I could turn it off, and I saw a note she had written to herself to call Jaffee at the restaurant. I don\u2019t know...I was just wondering if she did call him. If so, Jaffee was probably the last person...\u201d Noah paused as his voice broke.</p><p>He crossed off the second line. Was he overdoing it? Angela seemed to be buying it.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jordan didn\u2019t talk to him. She talked to me.\u201d Angela gasped. \u201cI was probably the last person she spoke to. She seemed happy and cheerful. She told me she was going to call Jaffee, but he never did hear from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThat must have been when it happened. The gunman was trying to shoot her father, but Jordan got in his way. I blame myself,\u201d he added sadly.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you blame yourself?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cJordan was waiting for me to join her, but I ran into some people I knew, and I lost track of the time. We were going to go back to her apartment. She was so excited to show me...\u201d His voice broke again.</p><p>\u201cShow you what?\u201d Angela urged.</p><p>\u201cYou know all those research papers she made copies of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She told me they were historical papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. But she told me that when she checked some info on her computer, she spotted something she really wanted me to see, something that didn\u2019t have anything to do with history, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was.\u201d</p><p>He drew a line through another subject and continued. \u201cI thought maybe she might have told Jaffee, but since she didn\u2019t talk to him, I\u2019ll have to get over there sometime and look myself. But not now. I\u2019m not leaving the hospital. I wasn\u2019t by her side when she got shot, but I\u2019m going to be there when she wakes up, no matter how long it takes. We can look at the information on her computer together when she\u2019s better. Whatever Jordan found will have to wait.\u201d</p><p>When their conversation ended, Noah hung up the phone and turned to Nick. \u201cThe word\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take to reach Pruitt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHour, maybe two, tops.\u201d</p><p>THE NET WAS IN PLACE. TWO AGENTS WATCHED THE ENTRANCE TO Jordan\u2019s apartment building and two more watched the back door. All four were well hidden. Pruitt could walk past any one of them and take no notice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah and Nick were parked at one end of the block in Nick\u2019s car, and two other agents were also monitoring from their parked car at the block\u2019s opposite end. A third vehicle with two more feds in it was parked in a driveway between buildings. Once Pruitt started down the street, they\u2019d have him hemmed in.</p><p>If he came down the street.</p><p>They had been waiting for over two hours. Nick was lobbying to change locations and wait inside Jordan\u2019s apartment. \u201cWe could trap him by the computer. We could have it all set up and spring on him. Wouldn\u2019t you like a couple of minutes alone with him? I sure as hell would.\u201d</p><p>Noah rejected his plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay then. We could spring on him as soon as he opens the apartment door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t work. It\u2019s a bad idea too.\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed. \u201cWhy? I\u2019m telling you we could spring\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah began to laugh. \u201cWhat is it with you and springing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn element of surprise,\u201d Nick explained with a deadpan expression.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. So, as much as I understand your need to spring on Pruitt, I\u2019m not gonna let you lie in wait up there.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled an apple from his pocket. He wiped it on his sleeve and took a big bite.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you about the fire at MacKenna\u2019s house?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Nick took another bite before replying with his mouth full. \u201cYou said it burned down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t just burn, Nick. That fire was nuclear. You should have seen it. It\u2019s like it imploded. The place was incinerated in a couple of minutes. Smoldered for a long time though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I missed it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPruitt set that fire. He knows his way around chemicals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did evacuate Jordan\u2019s neighbors, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Noah answered.</p><p>Several minutes passed in silence. The only sound was Nick chomping on his apple. \u201cToo bad we can\u2019t spring,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d Noah and Nick heard an agent\u2019s excited whisper in their earpieces.</p><p>\u201cI see him. That\u2019s him,\u201d another said.</p><p>\u201cYou sure it\u2019s him?\u201d the first asked.</p><p>\u201cBlack jogging suit with the hood up...in August. That\u2019s him. He\u2019s sure walking slow.\u201d</p> <p>The figure came around the corner and into Noah\u2019s view. He leaned over the steering wheel to get a good look at him.</p><p>\u201cIs he carrying something? Yeah, he is. What is that?\u201d Nick asked. He looked at Noah. \u201cCould he be cooking up another fire?\u201d</p><p>The man turned and walked up the steps of Jordan\u2019s apartment building.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let him get inside. We have to take him down in the street,\u201d the agent closest to the man said. \u201cGo!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Noah ordered, but it was too late. Three overzealous agents swarmed into the street, guns drawn. Two pointed their guns in the man\u2019s face while the third grabbed the box the man was dropping.</p><p>Noah and Nick rushed forward.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not him,\u201d Noah yelled angrily.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d the man stammered. Barely more than a teenager, he was unshaven, and his hair looked like it hadn\u2019t seen shampoo in a month. \u201cBe careful with that box. It\u2019s delicate. I\u2019m not supposed to shake it.\u201d The punk was so scared, he could barely get the words out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d one of the agents barked at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A guy gave me a hundred bucks to deliver it to his girlfriend. I\u2019m supposed to leave it at her door. Look, honest. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>Noah turned and sprinted back to his car. Nick was right on his heels, shouting back to the agents, \u201cGet the bomb squad over here.\u201d He pointed to one of them, \u201cYou got this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Nick dove into the car as Noah started the engine.</p><p>\u201cCall the hospital and check on Jordan,\u201d Noah shouted. \u201cJust to be sure.\u201d</p><p>He took the corner on two wheels. Slamming his foot on the accelerator, Noah hit the siren.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Pruitt\u2019s onto us?\u201d Nick asked as they raced through Boston\u2019s streets.</p><p>\u201cNo way of knowing. Pruitt could have set this kid up to do his dirty work and be on his way back to Texas, or he could have something else up his sleeve. Whatever his plan, we\u2019ve got to make sure Jordan isn\u2019t a part of it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty-four</p><p>HE NEEDED TO TIME IT JUST RIGHT. ANY MINUTE NOW, THE messenger Pruitt had hired would be placing the gift-wrapped box outside of Jordan\u2019s door. Liquid fire, that\u2019s how he thought of his special brew. It had worked so beautifully on MacKenna\u2019s house. And it would work beautifully again. There were enough chemicals inside that box to blow the top floor of the apartment building into the stratosphere and burn what was left to the ground. Probably overkill, he thought, but he wouldn\u2019t have to worry that Jordan Buchanan\u2019s computer might somehow still be operable.</p><p>He\u2019d set the timer and had exactly one hour before the explosion. He needed to get to Jordan before then. Once her apartment went up, the police and the FBI would be on her at the hospital like ants on a picnic. They would then know that Jordan had been the intended target of the shooting. But if Pruitt could get to her today, no one would ever know why.</p><p>Thank God for small-town gossip. Pruitt had just arrived back at the motel, shredder in hand, when he\u2019d gotten the phone call from his wife, Suzanne. She had just heard from Jaffee\u2019s wife, Lily, who had heard from Jaffee, who had heard from Angela that Jordan Buchanan was hanging on to life by a thread. It was just so sad that something this tragic had to happen to someone so young\u2014and so nice. What was the world coming to? Three people killed in Serenity, and then this lovely young woman, who had been traumatized enough, goes home to Boston and gets shot down by some maniac who\u2019s out for revenge against her father? And that handsome FBI agent, Noah Clayborne, who was with her in Serenity turned out to be more than just a friend. He had called Angela and could barely talk, he was so brokenhearted. Angela had told him that Jordan\u2019s last phone call, right before she was shot, was to her. Angela said poor Noah Clayborne sounded absolutely lost. It didn\u2019t look like poor Jordan was going to make it but he was searching for a ray of hope. He was trying to think positive thoughts, planning Jordan\u2019s return home from the hospital. The last thing Jordan had said to him was something about those research papers she had come to Serenity to get. She was so excited for him to see some surprising information she\u2019d stored on her computer\u2014something she\u2019d learned from the papers that the dead professor had given her. She was some sort of computer genius, everybody says. But now Noah may never know what Jordan wanted to tell him. It was all just so very sad....</p><p>Suzanne cackled on, but Pruitt\u2019s mind had strayed. What other information had Jordan found in Professor MacKenna\u2019s notes? What was on her computer? Maybe she had already figured everything out.</p><p>He walked into the hospital without anyone noticing. He looked down at his feet in case security cameras were pointed his way. He wasn\u2019t worried he would be recognized. The police were looking for gangsters related to Judge Buchanan\u2019s racketeering case, right? And even if Jordan could identify Dave Trumbo, she wouldn\u2019t see him closely, not until it was too late.</p><p>The security personnel didn\u2019t pay much attention to him either. No reason to. He\u2019d stopped at a big supermart where you could buy anything from toothpaste, to automotive parts, to professional uniforms. He\u2019d picked up a pair of surgical scrubs. The hospital was a huge medical complex and there were so many physicians and nurses bustling about, no one paid Pruitt any attention.</p><p>The elevator opened as soon as he pushed the button, and he rode alone up to the fifth floor, mentally practicing what he would say if he was stopped by a nurse. The second he stepped off the elevator he scanned the numbers beside the doors, looking for the one he\u2019d been given when he\u2019d called the information desk. An arrow indicated Jordan Buchanan\u2019s room was around the corner on the right. He turned the corner and stopped. A uniformed police guard stood outside her door. Pruitt changed direction, and he had to change his plan as well.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t anticipated a guard, but that was an oversight. Of course her father would want to beef up security.</p><p>Back in the elevator, he looked at the hospital directory printed on the wall. Pushing the button for the second floor, he headed down to radiology. No one was in sight when he walked out into the empty corridor. It took only a couple of calls on his cell phone to get the name of her surgeon and her internist. Then he called the fifth floor and told the nurse that Dr. Emmett had ordered more X-rays for Jordan Buchanan.</p><p>From the sound of her voice, the nurse was young and inexperienced. She didn\u2019t ask questions. She simply hung up the phone, then promptly called radiology and gave them the doctor\u2019s verbal orders.</p><p>Pruitt heard the orderly take the call. Fortunately, it was a slow evening, and radiology was empty. Nevertheless, Pruitt had to wait ten minutes before the slow-moving blond orderly came through the doors and got on the elevator to retrieve Jordan. With an iPod in his shirt pocket and tiny earphone wires hanging from his ears, he hummed to an unrecognizable song.</p><p>Pruitt liked the isolation of his hiding place. There were dark rooms, darker corridors, and empty reception desks. The chances of anyone interrupting were not a concern.</p><p>He looked around the radiology floor and found a perfect spot in a cubicle just inside the swinging doors to the X-ray room.</p><p>Would the guard accompany Jordan to radiology? Most likely. Pruitt would have to take him first. Come up behind him and hit him hard. And while he was going down, Pruitt would grab his gun. Unless the iPod orderly hung around. Pruitt was hoping he would park an unconscious Jordan and then go to get the X-ray tech. If that didn\u2019t happen, Pruitt would have to deal with him too. That wouldn\u2019t be difficult, and he wouldn\u2019t make a sound. Pruitt\u2019s techniques for keeping his former clients quiet were all there. Funny how you didn\u2019t forget such things.</p><p>Beyond the swinging doors were several changing cubicles, where patients changed into gowns before their scans. Each had doors that clicked shut. There were clean gowns stacked on the shelves inside each cubicle, and lo and behold, a metal rod with plastic hangers.</p><p>He had thought he would have to break into the supply closet to find something he could use as a club to hit the guard, but the metal clothes rod would do just fine. It took Pruitt a few minutes to get the screws loose using a dime. About ten or twelve inches long, the rod was the perfect weight for the job. It fit nicely in his hand.</p><p>He pulled the door of the cubicle toward him, leaving it open a crack so he could see Jordan being wheeled by. He\u2019d get a warning. He had noticed that when the button for the swinging doors was pushed on the other side, lights would come on in here.</p><p>His eyes adjusted to the dark. He wasn\u2019t sure how much time passed before he heard voices. A minute later, the lights blinked on, and he heard the whoosh of the doors slowly opening inward.</p><p>Not too eager, he calmed himself. Timing had to be perfect.</p><p>Then there they were. First he saw Jordan, then the orderly pushing her wheelchair. The guard trailed behind. That was a nice piece of luck. The guard was last, but he would be the first to be taken down.</p><p>Gripping the bar, Pruitt slowly pushed open the door and stepped out. The guard didn\u2019t hear him coming. Pruitt struck him hard at the base of the neck, reaching for the guard\u2019s gun as the man crumpled to the floor.</p><p>The orderly managed to hear the noise over his music and whirled around, confusion in his eyes. \u201cHey...what...?\u201d</p><p>Down he went. The rod caught him on the side of his face just above his ear. It happened so fast he didn\u2019t have time to duck. The orderly crashed into Jordan, knocking her from the wheelchair to the floor.</p><p>Pruitt kicked the chair out of his path and picked up the gun. His eyes were cold and fiendish. Jordan wondered if that was the last sight she would see before she died. She screamed and doubled over, trying to protect herself.</p><p>Suddenly Noah crashed through the doors. Pruitt barely had time to turn his head before a bullet from Noah\u2019s gun cut through his shoulder. He swung around to reach for Jordan, but Noah shot him in the chest, and Pruitt fell to the floor with a shocked look on his dying face. He struggled to raise his gun, but Noah shot again. The explosion was deafening and reverberated down the empty corridor.</p><p>Jordan faded into its echo.</p><p>Chapter Forty-five</p><p>JORDAN WAS CURLED UP ON THE SOFA IN THE SUNROOM, PRETENDING to be asleep so her mother would stop fussing over her. She\u2019d already covered Jordan with one afghan and was threatening to get a heavier blanket.</p><p>The windows were open and a lovely cool breeze freshened the air. She could hear the ocean waves rolling onto shore. Her parents\u2019 home on Nathan\u2019s Bay was surrounded on three sides by water. In the winter, the glass windows would be covered with a layer of ice. In the summer, a cool breeze came off the water, a welcome relief on the rare humid or hot days.</p><p>It was a lovely place to visit, but Jordan was ready to go home. She felt like she was a constant worry to her mother. And she missed her own bed. She missed her window seat.</p><p>And most of all she missed Noah. Since that terrible night in the hospital when he\u2019d picked her up in his arms and carried her to her room, she\u2019d missed him.</p><p>He and Nick were on an assignment. Laurant told Jordan that Nick checked in with her every night that he was away. He\u2019d been gone four days now, but Laurant expected Nick home tomorrow. Jordan didn\u2019t ask her about Noah. That was over, and he had returned to his life. What happened in Serenity...</p><p>She sighed. If she didn\u2019t get up and try to be productive, she\u2019d start crying. That\u2019s all her mother would need to hear. Then she\u2019d have Jordan in bed with a nurse standing over her around the clock.</p><p>Her ribs were still sore, and she winced when she stood up. The housekeeper, Leah, was stacking dishes in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Jordan offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah, I know you mean well, but I am sick and tired of being told to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost a lot of blood. Mrs. Buchanan said you should not overtire yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jordan noticed the number of plates and followed Leah into the dining room. The oblong table took up most of the space with six chairs on each side and two at each end.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. Laurant and Nick will be here.\u201d Leah counted. \u201cWith baby Sam,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the high chair in after I give it a good scrubbing. And Michael will be home. And Zachary of course. Alec and Regan will be here next weekend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s just family?\u201d said Jordan.</p><p>\u201cWith Zachary always bringing home strays from college, I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of setting extra places.\u201d</p><p>Jordan asked again what she could do to help, and when Leah shooed her away, she went upstairs to her old bedroom. Her parents used the room for guests these days.</p><p>She\u2019d heard from Kate and Dylan. They were back in South Carolina, and Kate wanted Jordan to come down and recuperate there. Jordan hadn\u2019t yet made up her mind whether or not to go. She felt so restless and out of sorts.</p> <p>What remained of the afternoon Jordan spent in her old room reading. Thankfully, the police had found her copied pages from Professor MacKenna\u2019s research undamaged in the back of Pruitt\u2019s rental car. And now that she had access to research sources, she could check out the validity of the professor\u2019s stories.</p><p>At sunset, Michael came upstairs to get her. He actually suggested that he carry her down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMy recovery period is officially over,\u201d she announced during dinner. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want any more pampering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice, dear,\u201d her mother crooned. \u201cDid you get enough to eat?\u201d</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNick\u2019s in the sunroom. Why don\u2019t you go say hello?\u201d</p><p>She headed in that direction, stopping when she heard laughter. She knew that laugh. Noah was with her brother.</p><p>She backed up, stopped, thought about it, and backed up another step. She suddenly noticed how quiet it had become in the dining room. No wonder. When she looked back, she saw her family members all leaning forward, intently watching her. Now she had to go into the sunroom to say hello. Jordan took a deep breath.</p><p>Nick was sprawled on the sofa. Noah sat in an easy chair. Both were drinking beer.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nick. Hey, Noah.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed. \u201cWell hello to you,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>\u201cHey back at you. Jordan, you\u2019re not in Serenity now,\u201d Noah interjected. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m fine. I guess I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d She turned around to walk away.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d said Noah.</p><p>She turned back. Noah set his beer on the end table. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He stood and started toward her. \u201cYou remember our deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWhat about the deal?\u201d she asked Noah.</p> <p>\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Nick asked again.</p><p>\u201cWhen we left Serenity, Jordan and I agreed to go our separate ways,\u201d Noah answered.</p><p>\u201cDid you have to tell him?\u201d she said, disgruntled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d Jordan said, beginning to pivot again.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d said Noah.</p><p>She stopped once more. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He was slowly advancing. \u201cLike I was saying...about that deal we made...\u201d He stopped in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s just not gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to argue, but didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal\u2019s off, that\u2019s what I mean. We\u2019re not going our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you two a little privacy,\u201d Nick said, rolling off the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need privacy,\u201d Jordan insisted.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Noah countered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to be alone with you to tell you how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan felt as though the wind had just been knocked out of her. \u201cYou do...No, wait. You love all women, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled the door shut behind him.</p><p>Noah wrapped Jordan in his arms and whispered all the words he\u2019d been storing in his heart. He nudged her chin up and kissed her. \u201cAnd you love me, don\u2019t you, Sugar?\u201d</p><p>All her defenses melted. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make me the happiest man in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, if we were to get married, you couldn\u2019t date anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Always giving me attitude. I don\u2019t want any other women. Just you. Only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be cutting back some, but I\u2019m not giving up on computers,\u201d Jordan warned.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think I would want you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy comfort zone? Remember that little speech?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. It got you out of your apartment, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd into your bed,\u201d she added. \u201cYou know what I\u2019ve decided? I\u2019m going to write a program that a four-year-old would understand. Then I\u2019m going to figure out a way to get computers in schools and community centers that can\u2019t afford to buy them. You get a child started early, she\u2019ll become a natural. Technology is here, and I want to use it to write the future with.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a good start. A simple program. I\u2019m sure Jaffee will be happy to hear about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Jaffee, I talked to Angela yesterday. She says the restaurant has been packed ever since they heard about Trumbo. The whole town is reeling from the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve had a lot to deal with lately. Chaddick tells me this bombshell has overshadowed J. D.\u2019s list. He and Street are about to wrap things up.\u201d</p><p>Jordan shared a couple of other ideas with Noah and then listened to him talk about his work. His job was so stressful, but he made such a difference when he succeeded. The failures were devastating to him.
