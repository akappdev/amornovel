And me? I\u2019ve got hearts in my eyes and a letter that\u2019s burning a hole in my coat pocket.</p><p>As we\u2019re putting on our shoes, Kitty\u2019s still trying to weasel her way out of wearing a hanbok to Aunt Carrie and Uncle Victor\u2019s. \u201cLook at the sleeves! They\u2019re three-quarter length on me!\u201d</p><p>Unconvincingly Daddy says, \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be that way.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty points to me and Margot. \u201cThen why do theirs fit?\u201d she demands. Our grandma bought the hanboks for us the last time she was in Korea. Margot\u2019s hanbok has a yellow jacket and apple-green skirt. Mine is hot pink with an ivory-white jacket and a long hot-pink bow with flowers embroidered down the front. The skirt is voluminous, full like a bell, and it falls all the way to the floor. Unlike Kitty\u2019s, which hits right at her ankles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our fault you grow like a weed,\u201d I say, fussing with my bow. The bow is the hardest thing to get right. I had to watch a YouTube video multiple times to figure it out, and it still looks lopsided and sad.</p><p>\u201cMy skirt\u2019s too short too,\u201d she grumps, lifting the bottom.</p><p>The real truth is, Kitty hates wearing a hanbok because you have to walk delicately in it and hold the skirt closed with one hand or the whole thing comes open.</p><p>\u201cAll of the other cousins will be wearing them, and it will make Grandma happy,\u201d Daddy says, rubbing his temples. \u201cCase closed.\u201d</p> <p>In the car Kitty keeps saying \u201cI hate New Year\u2019s Day,\u201d and it puts everyone but me in a sour mood. Margot is already in a semi-sour mood because she had to wake up at the crack of dawn to get home from her friend\u2019s cabin in time. There\u2019s also the matter of that maybe hangover. Nothing could sour my mood, though, because I\u2019m not even in this car. I\u2019m somewhere else entirely, thinking about my letter to Peter, wondering if it was heartfelt enough, and how and when I\u2019m going to give it to him, and what he\u2019ll say, and what it will mean. Should I drop it in his mailbox? Leave it in his locker? When I see him again, will he smile at me, make a joke of it to lighten the mood? Or will he pretend he never saw it, to spare us both? I think that would be worse. I have to keep reminding myself that, despite everything, Peter is kind and he is easygoing and he won\u2019t be cruel no matter what. Of that much I can be sure.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking so hard about?\u201d Kitty asks me.</p><p>I barely hear her.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and pretend to be asleep, and all I see is Peter\u2019s face. I don\u2019t know what I want from him exactly, what I\u2019m ready for\u2014if it\u2019s boyfriend-girlfriend heavy-duty serious love, or if it\u2019s what we had before, just fun and some here-and-there kisses, or if it\u2019s something in between, but I do know I can\u2019t get his Handsome Boy face out of my mind. The way he smirks when he says my name, how when he\u2019s near me I forget to breathe sometimes.</p><p>Of course, when we get to Aunt Carrie and Uncle Victor\u2019s, none of the other cousins are wearing hanboks, and Kitty practically turns purple with the effort of not yelling at Daddy. Margot and I give him some side-eye too. It\u2019s not particularly comfortable to sit around in a hanbok all day. But then Grandma gives me an approving smile, which makes up for it.</p> <p>As we take off our shoes and coats at the front door, I whisper to Kitty, \u201cMaybe the adults will give us more money for dressing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou girls look so cute,\u201d Aunt Carrie said as she hugs us. \u201cHaven refused to wear hers!\u201d</p><p>Haven rolls her eyes at her mom. \u201cI love your haircut,\u201d she says to Margot. Haven and I are only a few months apart, but she thinks she\u2019s so much older than me. She\u2019s always trying to get in with Margot.</p><p>We get the bowing out of the way first. In Korean culture, you bow to your elders on New Year\u2019s Day and wish them luck in the new year, and in return they give you money. The order goes oldest to youngest, so as the oldest adult, Grandma sits down on the couch first, and Aunt Carrie and Uncle Victor bow first, then Daddy, all the way down the line to Kitty, who is youngest. When it\u2019s Daddy\u2019s turn to sit on the couch and receive his bows, there\u2019s an empty couch cushion next to him as there has been every New Year\u2019s Day since Mommy died. It gives me an achy feeling in my chest to see him sitting there alone, smiling gamely, handing out ten-dollar bills. Grandma catches my eye pointedly and I know she\u2019s thinking the same thing. When it\u2019s my turn to bow, I kneel, hands folded in front of my forehead, and I vow that I will not see Daddy alone on that couch again next year.</p><p>We get ten dollars from Aunt Carrie and Uncle Victor, ten from Daddy, ten from Aunt Min and Uncle Sam, who aren\u2019t our real aunt and uncle but second cousins (or is it cousins once removed? They\u2019re Mommy\u2019s cousins, anyway), and twenty from Grandma! We didn\u2019t get more for wearing hanboks, but all in all a good take. Last year the aunts and uncles were only doing five apiece.</p><p>Next we do rice cake soup for good luck. Aunt Carrie also made black-eyed pea cakes and insists we try at least one, though no one wants to. The twins, Harry and Leon\u2014our third cousins? Cousins twice removed?\u2014refuse to eat the soup or the black-eyed pea cakes and are eating chicken nuggets in the TV room. There isn\u2019t enough room at the dining table, so Kitty and I eat on stools at the kitchen island. We can hear everyone laughing from over here.</p><p>As I begin to eat my soup, I make a wish. Please, please let things work out with me and Peter.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I get a smaller bowl of soup than everyone else?\u201d Kitty whispers to me.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the littlest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get our own bowl of kimchi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Aunt Carrie thinks we don\u2019t like it because we\u2019re not full Korean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ask for some,\u201d Kitty whispers.</p><p>So I do, but mainly because I want some too.</p><p>While the adults drink coffee, Margot, Haven, and I go up to Haven\u2019s room and Kitty tags along. Usually she plays with the twins, but this time she picks up Aunt Carrie\u2019s Yorkie, Smitty, and follows us upstairs like one of the girls.</p><p>Haven has indie rock band posters on her walls; most I\u2019ve never heard of. She\u2019s always rotating them out. There\u2019s a new one, a letterpressed Belle and Sebastian. It looks like denim. \u201cThis is cool,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to switch that one out,\u201d Haven says. \u201cYou can have it if you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I tell her. I know she\u2019s only offering it to feel above me, as is her way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Kitty says, and Haven\u2019s face pulls into a frown for a second, but Kitty\u2019s already peeling it off the wall. \u201cThanks, Haven.\u201d</p><p>Margot and I look at each other and try not to smile. Haven\u2019s never had much patience for Kitty, and the feeling is infinitely mutual.</p><p>\u201cMargot, have you been to any shows since you\u2019ve been in Scotland?\u201d Haven asks. She plops down on her bed and opens up her laptop.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Margot says. \u201cI\u2019ve been so busy with classes.\u201d Margot\u2019s not much of a live-music person anyway. She\u2019s looking at her phone; the skirt of her hanbok is fanned around her. She\u2019s the only one of us Song girls still fully clothed. I\u2019ve taken off my jacket, so I\u2019m just in the slip and skirt, and Kitty\u2019s taken off both the jacket and the skirt and is just wearing an undershirt and bloomers.</p><p>I sit down on the bed next to Haven so she can show me pictures from their vacation to Bermuda on Instagram. As she\u2019s scrolling through her feed, a picture from the ski trip pops up. Haven\u2019s in the Charlottesville Youth Orchestra, so she knows people from a lot of different schools, including mine.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but sigh a little when I see it\u2014a picture of a bunch of us on the bus the last morning. Peter has his arm around me, he\u2019s whispering something in my ear. I wish I remembered what.</p><p>All surprised, Haven looks up and says, \u201cOh, hey, that\u2019s you, Lara Jean. What\u2019s this from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school ski trip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that your boyfriend?\u201d Haven asks me, and I can tell she\u2019s impressed and trying not to show it.</p><p>I wish I could say yes. But\u2014</p><p>Kitty scampers over to us and looks over our shoulders. \u201cYes, and he\u2019s the hottest guy you\u2019ve ever seen in your life, Haven.\u201d She says it like a challenge. Margot, who was scrolling on her phone, looks up and giggles.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not exactly true,\u201d I hedge. I mean, he\u2019s the hottest guy I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, but I don\u2019t know what kind of people Haven goes to school with.</p><p>\u201cNo, Kitty\u2019s right, he\u2019s hot,\u201d Haven admits. \u201cLike, how did you get him? No offense. I just thought you were the non-dating type.\u201d</p><p>I frown. The non-dating type? What kind of type is that? A little mushroom who sits at home in a semidark room growing moss?</p> <p>\u201cLara Jean dates plenty,\u201d Margot says loyally.</p><p>I blush. I date never, Peter barely even counts, but I\u2019m glad for the lie.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Haven asks me.</p><p>\u201cPeter. Peter Kavinsky.\u201d Even saying his name is a remembered pleasure, something to savor, like a piece of chocolate dissolving on my tongue.</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought he dated that pretty blond girl. What\u2019s her name? Jenna? Weren\u2019t you guys best friends when you were little?\u201d</p><p>I feel a pang in my heart. \u201cHer name is Genevieve. We used to be friends, not anymore. And she and Peter have been broken up for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then how long have you and Peter been together?\u201d Haven asks me. She has a dubious look in her eye, like she 90 percent believes me but there\u2019s still that niggling 10 percent that has doubt.</p><p>\u201cWe started hanging out in September.\u201d At least that much is true. \u201cWe\u2019re not together right now; we\u2019re kind of on a break. . . . But I\u2019m . . . optimistic.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty pokes my cheek, makes a dimple with her pinky. \u201cYou\u2019re smiling,\u201d she says, and she\u2019s smiling too. She cuddles closer to me. \u201cMake up with him today, okay? I want Peter back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d I say, though maybe it could be?</p><p>\u201cSure it\u2019s that simple. He still likes you a lot\u2014just tell him you still like him, too, and boom. You\u2019re back together and it\u2019ll be like you never kicked him out of our house.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes go even wider. \u201cLara Jean, you broke up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, is it so hard to believe?\u201d I narrow my eyes at her, and Haven opens and then wisely closes her mouth.</p><p>She takes another look at the picture of Peter. Then she gets up to go to the bathroom, and as she closes the door, she says, \u201cAll I can say is, if that boy was my boyfriend, I\u2019d never let him go.\u201d</p><p>My whole body tingles when she says those words.</p><p>I once had that exact same thought about Josh, and look at me now: It\u2019s like a million years have gone by and he\u2019s just a memory to me. I don\u2019t want it to be like that with Peter. The farawayness of old feelings, like even when you try with all your might, you can barely make out his face when you close your eyes. No matter what, I always want to remember his face.</p><p>When it\u2019s time to go, I\u2019m putting on my coat and Peter\u2019s letter falls out of my pocket. Margot picks it up. \u201cAnother letter?\u201d</p><p>I blush. In a rush I say, \u201cI haven\u2019t figured out when I should give it to him, if I should leave it in his mailbox, or if I should actually mail it? Or face to face? Gogo, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should just talk to him,\u201d Margot says. \u201cGo right now. Daddy will drop you off. You go to his house, you give him the letter, and then you see what he says.\u201d</p><p>My heart pumps wildly at the thought. Right now? Just go over there, without calling first, without a plan? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I hedge. \u201cI feel like I should think it over more.\u201d</p><p>Margot opens her mouth to respond, but then Kitty comes up behind us and says, \u201cEnough with the letters. Just go get him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it be too late,\u201d Margot says, and I know she\u2019s not just talking about me and Peter.</p><p>I\u2019ve been tiptoeing around the subject of Josh because of everything that\u2019s happened with us. I mean, Margot\u2019s forgiven me, but there\u2019s no sense in rocking the boat. So these past couple of days I\u2019ve stayed silently supportive and hoped that was enough. But Margot leaves for Scotland again in less than a week. The thought of her leaving without at least talking to Josh doesn\u2019t feel right to me. We\u2019ve all been friends for so long. I know Josh and I will mend things, because we\u2019re neighbors, and that\u2019s how it goes with people you see a lot. They mend, almost on their own. But not so for Margot and Josh, with her so far away. If they don\u2019t talk now, the scar will only harden over time, it will calcify, and then they\u2019ll be like strangers who never loved each other, which is the saddest thought of all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While Kitty\u2019s putting on her boots, I whisper to Margot, \u201cIf I talk to Peter, you should talk to Josh. Don\u2019t go back to Scotland and leave things like this with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d she says, but I see the hope that flares in her eyes, and it gives me hope too.</p><p>2</p><p>MARGOT AND KITTY ARE BOTH asleep in the backseat. Kitty\u2019s got her head in Margot\u2019s lap; Margot\u2019s sleeping with her head back and her mouth wide open. Daddy is listening to NPR with a faint smile on his face. Everyone\u2019s so peaceful, and my heart is thumping a million beats a minute just in anticipation of what I\u2019m about to do.</p> <p>I\u2019m doing it now, this very night. Before we\u2019re back at school, before all the gears shift back to normal and Peter and I are nothing more than a memory. Like snow globes, you shake them up, and for a moment everything is upside down and glitter everywhere and it\u2019s just like magic\u2014but then it all settles and goes back to where it\u2019s supposed to be. Things have a way of settling back. I can\u2019t go back.</p><p>I time it so that we are one stoplight from Peter\u2019s neighborhood when I ask Daddy to drop me off. He must hear the intensity in my voice, the necessity, because he doesn\u2019t ask any questions, he just says yes.</p><p>When we pull up to Peter\u2019s house, the lights are on and his car is in the driveway; so is his mom\u2019s minivan. The sun is just going down, early because it\u2019s winter. Across the street, Peter\u2019s neighbors still have their holiday lights up. Today\u2019s probably the last day for that, seeing as how it\u2019s a new year. New year, new start.</p><p>I can feel the veins in my wrists pulsing, and I\u2019m nervous, I\u2019m so nervous. I run out of the car and ring the doorbell. When I hear footsteps from inside, I wave Daddy off, and he backs out of the driveway. Kitty\u2019s awake now, and she\u2019s got her face up against the back window, grinning hard. She sends me a thumbs-up and I wave back.</p><p>Peter opens the door. My heart jumps like a Mexican jumping bean in my chest. He\u2019s wearing a button-down I\u2019ve never seen before, plaid. It must have been a Christmas present. His hair is mussed on top, like he\u2019s been lying down. He doesn\u2019t look so very surprised to see me. \u201cHey.\u201d He eyes my skirt, which is poofing out from under my winter coat like a ball gown. \u201cWhy are you so dressed up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for New Year\u2019s.\u201d Maybe I should\u2019ve gone home and changed first. At least then I would feel like me, standing at this boy\u2019s door, proverbial hat in hand. \u201cSo, hey, how was your Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He takes his time, four whole seconds, before he asks, \u201cHow was yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. We got a new puppy. His name is Jamie Fox-Pickle.\u201d Not even a trace of a smile from Peter. He\u2019s cold; I didn\u2019t expect him to be cold. Maybe not even cold. Maybe just indifferent. \u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugs, which seems like a yes, but he doesn\u2019t invite me in. I have this sudden sick-to-my-stomach fear that Genevieve is inside\u2014which quickly dissipates when I remember that if she were inside, he wouldn\u2019t be out here with me. He leaves the door ajar as he puts on sneakers and a coat, and then steps onto the porch. He closes the door behind him and sits down on the steps. I sit next to him, smoothing my skirt around me. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d he says, like I\u2019m taking up his precious time.</p><p>This isn\u2019t right. Not what I expected at all.</p><p>But what, exactly, did I expect from Peter? I\u2019d give him the letter, and he\u2019d read it, and then he\u2019d love me? He\u2019d take me in his arms; we\u2019d kiss passionately, but just kissing, just innocent. Then what? We\u2019d date? How long until he grew bored of me, missed Genevieve, wanted more than I was prepared to give, bedroomwise and also just lifewise? Someone like him could never be content staying at home and watching a movie on the couch. This is Peter Kavinsky we\u2019re talking about, after all.</p> <p>I take so long swept up in my fast-forward reverie that he says it again, just slightly less cold this time. \u201cWhat, Lara Jean?\u201d He looks at me like he\u2019s waiting for something, and suddenly I\u2019m afraid to give it.</p><p>I tighten my fist around the letter, shove it into my coat pocket. My hands are freezing. I don\u2019t have any gloves or hat; I should probably just go home. \u201cI just came to say . . . to say I\u2019m sorry for the way things turned out. And . . . I hope we can still be friends, and happy new year.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow at this. \u201c\u2018Happy new year\u2019?\u201d he repeats. \u201cThat\u2019s what you came here to say? Sorry and happy new year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I hope we can still be friends,\u201d I add, biting my lip.</p><p>\u201cYou hope we can still be friends,\u201d he repeats, and there is a note of sarcasm in his voice that I don\u2019t understand or like.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d I start to stand up. I was hoping he\u2019d give me a ride home, but now I don\u2019t want to ask. But it\u2019s so cold outside. Maybe if I hint. . . . Blowing on my hands, I say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. Let\u2019s go back to the apology part. What are you apologizing for, exactly? For kicking me out of your house, or for thinking I\u2019m a dirtbag who would go around telling people we had sex when we didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>A lump forms in my throat. When he puts it that way, it really does sound terrible. \u201cBoth of those things. I\u2019m sorry for both of those things.\u201d</p> <p>Peter cocks his head to the side, his eyebrows raised. \u201cAnd what else?\u201d</p><p>I bristle. What else? \u201cThere is no \u2018what else.\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d Thank God I didn\u2019t give him the letter, if this is how he\u2019s going to be. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m the only one with stuff to apologize for.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who came here talking about \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s be friends.\u2019 You don\u2019t get to force me into accepting your half-assed apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wish you a happy new year anyway.\u201d Now I\u2019m the one being sarcastic, and it sure is satisfying. \u201cHave a nice life. Auld lang syne and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Bye.\u201d</p><p>I turn to go. I was so hopeful this morning, I had such stars in my eyes imagining how this was all going to go. God, what a jerk Peter is. Good riddance to him!</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><p>Hope leaps into my heart like Jamie Fox-Pickle leaps into my bed\u2014swift and unbidden. But I turn back around, like Ugh, what do you want now, so he doesn\u2019t see it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got crumpled up in your pocket?\u201d</p><p>My hand flies down to my pocket. \u201cThat?

He shrugs, and I relax and let out a small sigh of relief, and then he lunges forward and plucks it away from me.</p> <p>I pant, \u201cGive it back, Peter!\u201d</p><p>Blithely he says, \u201cTampering with US mail is a federal offense.\u201d Then he looks down at the envelope. \u201cThis is to me. From you.\u201d I make a desperate grab for the envelope, and it takes him by surprise. We wrestle for it; I\u2019ve got the corner of it in my grip, but he\u2019s not letting go. \u201cStop, you\u2019re going to rip it!\u201d he yells, prying it out of my grasp.</p><p>I try to grab harder, but it\u2019s too late. He has it.</p><p>Peter holds the envelope above my head and tears it open and begins to read. It\u2019s torturous standing there in front of him, waiting\u2014for what, I don\u2019t know. More humiliation? I should probably just go. He\u2019s such a slow reader.</p><p>When he\u2019s finally done, he asks, \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you going to give me this? Why were you just going to leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause, I don\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t seem so glad to see me. . . .\u201d My voice trails off lamely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called playing hard to get! I\u2019ve been waiting for you to call me, you dummy. It\u2019s been six days.\u201d</p><p>I suck in my breath. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Oh.\u2019\u201d He pulls me by the lapels of my coat, closer to him, close enough to kiss. He\u2019s so close I can see the puffs his breath makes. So close I could count his eyelashes if I wanted. In a low voice he says, \u201cSo then . . . you still like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI mean, sort of.\u201d My heartbeat is going quick-quick-quick. I\u2019m giddy. Is this a dream? If so, let me never wake up.</p><p>Peter gives me a look like Get real, you know you like me. I do, I do. Then, softly, he says, \u201cDo you believe me that I didn\u2019t tell people we had sex on the ski trip?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He inhales. \u201cDid . . . did anything happen with you and Sanderson after I left your house that night?\u201d He\u2019s jealous! The very thought of it warms me up like hot soup. I start to tell him no way, but he quickly says, \u201cWait. Don\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, firmly so he knows I mean it. He nods but doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Then he leans in, and I close my eyes, heart thrumming in my chest like hummingbird wings. We\u2019ve technically only kissed four times, and only one of those times was for real. I\u2019d like to just get right to it, so I can stop being nervous. But Peter doesn\u2019t kiss me, not the way I expect. He kisses me on my left cheek, and then my right; his breath is warm. And then nothing. My eyes fly open. Is this a literal kiss-off? Why isn\u2019t he kissing me properly? \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cBuilding the anticipation.\u201d</p><p>Quickly I say, \u201cLet\u2019s just kiss.\u201d</p><p>He angles his head, and his cheek brushes against mine, which is when the front door opens, and it\u2019s Peter\u2019s younger brother, Owen, standing there with his arms crossed. I spring away from Peter like I just found out he has some incurable infectious disease. \u201cMom wants you guys to come in and have some cider,\u201d he says, smirking.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Peter says, pulling me back.</p> <p>\u201cShe said right now,\u201d Owen says.</p><p>Oh my God. I throw a panicky look at Peter. \u201cI should probably get going before my dad starts to worry. . . .\u201d</p><p>He nudges me toward the door with his chin. \u201cJust come inside for a minute, and then I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d As I step inside, he takes off my coat and says in a low voice, \u201cWere you really going to walk all the way home in that fancy dress? In the cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was going to guilt you into driving me,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with your outfit?\u201d Owen says to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what Korean people wear on New Year\u2019s Day,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Peter\u2019s mom steps out of the kitchen with two steaming mugs. She\u2019s wearing a long cashmere cardigan that\u2019s loosely belted around her waist, and cream cable-knit slippers. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look gorgeous. So colorful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, feeling embarrassed over the fuss.</p><p>The three of us sit down in the family room; Owen escapes to the kitchen. I still feel flushed from the almost kiss and from the fact that Peter\u2019s mom probably knows what we were up to. I wonder, too, what she knows about what\u2019s been going on with us, how much he\u2019s told her, if anything.</p><p>\u201cHow was your Christmas, Lara Jean?\u201d his mom asks me.</p><p>I blow into my mug. \u201cIt was really nice. My dad bought my little sister a puppy, and we\u2019ve just been fighting over who gets to hold him. And my older sister\u2019s still home from college, so that\u2019s been nice too. How was your holiday, Mrs. Kavinsky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it was nice. Quiet.\u201d She points to her slippers. \u201cOwen got me these. How did the holiday party go? Did your sisters like the fruitcake cookies Peter baked? Honestly, I can\u2019t stand them.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, I look over at Peter, who is suddenly busy scrolling on his phone. \u201cI thought you said your mom made them.\u201d</p><p>His mom smiles a proud kind of smile. \u201cOh no, he did it all by himself. He was very determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tasted like garbage!\u201d Owen yells from the kitchen.</p><p>His mom laughs again, and then things are silent. My mind is racing, trying to think up potential conversation pieces. New Year\u2019s resolutions, maybe? The snowstorm we\u2019re supposed to get next week? Peter\u2019s no help at all; he\u2019s looking at his phone again.</p><p>She stands up. \u201cIt was nice to see you, Lara Jean. Peter, don\u2019t keep her out too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d To me he says, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back; I\u2019m just gonna get my keys.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019s gone, I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for dropping in like this on New Year\u2019s Day. I hope I wasn\u2019t interrupting anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome here anytime.\u201d She leans forward and puts her hand on my knee. With a meaningful look she says, \u201cJust be easy with his heart is all I ask.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My stomach does a dip. Did Peter tell her what happened between us?</p><p>She gives my knee a pat and stands up. \u201cGood night, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d I echo.</p><p>Despite her kind smile, I feel like I\u2019ve just gotten in trouble. There was a hint of reproach in her voice\u2014I know I heard it. Don\u2019t mess with my son is what she was saying. Was Peter very upset by what happened between us? He didn\u2019t make it out like he was. Annoyed, maybe a little hurt. Certainly not hurt enough to talk to his mom about it. But maybe he and his mom are really close. I hate to think I may have already made a bad impression, before Peter and I have even gotten going.</p> <p>It\u2019s pitch black out, not many stars in the sky. I think maybe it\u2019ll snow again soon. At my house, all the lights are on downstairs, and Margot\u2019s bedroom light is on upstairs. Across the street I can see Ms. Rothschild\u2019s little Christmas tree lit up in the window.</p><p>Peter and I are warm and cozy in his car. Heat billows out the vents. I ask him, \u201cDid you tell your mom about how we broke up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because we never broke up,\u201d he says, turning the heat down.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cNo, because we were never really together, remember?\u201d</p> <p>Are we together now? is what I\u2019m wondering, but I don\u2019t ask, because he puts his arm around me and tilts my head up to his, and I\u2019m nervous again. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d he says.</p><p>I give him a quick kiss to prove I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cKiss me like you missed me,\u201d he says, and his voice goes husky.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I say. \u201cMy letter told you I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>I kiss him before he can finish. Properly. Like I mean it. He kisses back like he means it too. Like it\u2019s been four hundred years. And then I\u2019m not thinking anymore and I\u2019m just lost in the kissing.</p> <p>3</p><p>AFTER PETER DROPS ME OFF, I run inside to tell Margot and Kitty everything, and I feel like a purse bulging with gold coins. I can\u2019t wait to spill.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s lying on the couch, watching TV with Jamie Fox-Pickle in her lap, and she scrambles up when I come through the door. In a hushed voice she says, \u201cGogo\u2019s crying.\u201d</p><p>My enthusiasm dries up instantly. \u201cWhat! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she went over to Josh\u2019s and they had a talk and it wasn\u2019t good. You should go check on her.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. This isn\u2019t how it was supposed to go for them. They were supposed to get back together, like Peter and me.</p><p>Kitty settles back on the couch, remote in hand, her sisterly duty fulfilled. \u201cHow did it go with Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say. \u201cReally great.\u201d The smile comes to my face without me even intending it, and I quickly wipe it away, out of respect for Margot.</p> <p>I go to the kitchen and make Margot a cup of Night-Night tea, two tablespoons of honey, like Mommy used to make us for bedtime. For a second I contemplate adding a splash of whiskey because I saw it on a Victorian show on PBS\u2014the maids would put whiskey in the lady of the manor\u2019s hot beverage to calm her nerves. I know Margot drinks at college, but she already has a hangover, and besides, I doubt Daddy would be into it. So I just put the tea, sans whiskey, in my favorite mug, and I send Kitty upstairs with it. I tell her to act adorable. I say she should first give Margot the tea and then snuggle with her for at least five minutes. Which Kitty balks at, because Kitty only cuddles if there\u2019s something in it for her, and also because I know it frightens her to see Margot upset. \u201cI\u2019ll just bring her Jamie to cuddle with,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>Selfish!</p><p>When I go to Margot\u2019s room with a piece of buttered cinnamon toast, Kitty\u2019s nowhere in sight and neither is Jamie. Margot\u2019s curled up on her side, crying. \u201cIt\u2019s really over, Lara Jean,\u201d she whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s been over, but now I know it\u2019s over for good. I th-thought that if I wanted to get back together, he would too, but he d-doesn\u2019t.\u201d I curl up next to her, my forehead pressed to her back. I can feel every breath she takes. She weeps into her pillow, and I scratch her shoulder blades the way she likes. The thing to know about Margot is she never cries, so seeing her cry sets my world, and this house, off its axis. Everything feels tilted somehow. \u201cHe says that long distance is too h-hard, that I was right to break up with him in the first place. I missed him so much, and it seems like he didn\u2019t miss me at all.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip guiltily. I was the one who encouraged her to talk to Josh. This is partly my fault. \u201cMargot, he did miss you. He missed you like crazy. I would look out the window during French class, and I would see him outside on the bleachers eating his lunch alone. It was depressing.\u201d</p><p>She sniffles. \u201cDid he really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s the matter with Josh. He acted like he was so in love with her; he practically went into a depression when she was gone. And now this?</p><p>Sighing, she says, \u201cI think . . . I think I just still really love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Love. Margot said \u201clove.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard her say she loved Josh before. Maybe \u201cin love,\u201d but never \u201clove.\u201d</p><p>Margot wipes her eyes with her sheet. \u201cThe whole reason I broke up with him was so I wouldn\u2019t be that girl crying over her boyfriend, and now that\u2019s exactly what I am. It\u2019s pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the least pathetic person I know, Gogo,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Margot stops sniffling and rolls around so we\u2019re lying face to face. Frowning at me, she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I was pathetic. I said crying over a boy was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cWell, I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s pathetic to cry over someone. It just means you care about them deeply and you\u2019re sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been crying so much I feel like my eyes look like . . . like shriveled-up raisins. Do they?\u201d Margot squints at me.</p><p>\u201cThey are swollen,\u201d I admit. \u201cYour eyes just aren\u2019t used to crying. I have an idea!\u201d I leap out of bed and run downstairs to the kitchen. I fill a cereal bowl with ice and two silver spoons and come running back. \u201cLie back down,\u201d I instruct, and Margot obeys. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d I put a spoon over each eye.</p><p>\u201cDoes this really work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it in a magazine.\u201d</p><p>When the spoons warm up against her skin, I dip them back into the ice and back onto her face, over and over again. She asks me to tell her what happened with Peter, so I do, but I leave out all the kissing because it feels in poor taste in light of her own heartbreak. She sits up and says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend to like Peter just to spare my feelings.\u201d Margot swallows painfully, like she has a sore throat. \u201cIf any part of you still likes Josh . . . if he likes you . . .\u201d I gasp in horror. I open my mouth to deny it, to say that it feels like forever ago already, but she silences me with her hand. \u201cIt would be really hard, but I wouldn\u2019t want to stand in the way of that, you know? I mean it, Lara Jean. You can tell me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m so relieved, so grateful she\u2019s bringing it up. I rush to say, \u201cOh my gosh, I don\u2019t like Josh, Gogo. Not like that. Not at all. And he doesn\u2019t like me like that either. I think . . . I think we were both just missing you. Peter\u2019s the one I like.\u201d Under the blanket I find Margot\u2019s hand and link my pinky with hers. \u201cSister swear.\u201d</p><p>She swallows hard. \u201cThen I guess there\u2019s no secret reason for him not wanting to get back together. I guess it\u2019s as simple as he just doesn\u2019t want to be with me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s as simple as you\u2019re in Scotland and he\u2019s in Virginia and it\u2019s too hard. You were wise to break it off when you did. Wise and brave and right.\u201d</p><p>Doubt creeps across her face like dark shadows, and then she shakes her head and her expression clears. \u201cEnough about me and Josh. We\u2019re yesterday\u2019s news. Tell me more about Peter. Please, it\u2019ll make me feel better.\u201d She lies back down, and I put the spoons back on her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWell, tonight at first he was very cool with me, very blas\u00e9 blas\u00e9\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, go all the way back to the beginning.\u201d</p><p>So I go back further: I tell her about our pretend relationship, the hot tub, everything. She keeps taking the spoons off so she can look at me as I tell her. But before long her eyes do look less puffy. And I feel lighter\u2014giddy, even. I\u2019ve kept all these things secret from her for months, and now she knows everything that\u2019s happened since she\u2019s been gone, and I feel so close to her again. You can\u2019t be close to someone, not truly, with secrets in between you.</p><p>Margot clears her throat. She hesitates and then asks, \u201cSo, how does he kiss?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m blushing. I tap my fingers on my lips before I say, \u201cHe kisses like . . . like it could be his job.\u201d</p> <p>Margot giggles and lifts the spoons off her eyes. \u201cLike a male prostitute?\u201d</p><p>I grab one of the spoons and tap her on the forehead with it like a gong.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d She snatches for the other spoon, but I\u2019m too quick and I\u2019ve got them both. We\u2019re both laughing like crazy as I try to get in another gong on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMargot . . . did it hurt when you had sex?\u201d I\u2019m careful not to say Josh\u2019s name. It\u2019s strange, because Margot and I have never talked about sex before in any kind of real way, because neither of us had a point of reference. But now she does and I don\u2019t, and I want to know what she knows.</p><p>\u201cUmm. I mean, the first couple of times, a little.\u201d Now she\u2019s the one who\u2019s blushing. \u201cLara Jean, I can\u2019t talk about this with you. It\u2019s too weird. Can\u2019t you just ask Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to hear it from you. Please, Gogo. You have to tell me everything about it so I\u2019ll know. I don\u2019t want to look like a fool when I do it the first time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Josh and I had sex hundreds of times! I\u2019m not an expert. He\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve done it with. But if you\u2019re thinking about having sex with Peter, make sure you\u2019re careful and you use a condom and everything.\u201d I nod quickly. This is when she\u2019ll get to the good stuff. \u201cAnd just be really sure, as sure as you can be. And make sure he knows to be really gentle and caring with you, so it\u2019s special and it\u2019s something you can look back on with good feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. So, like, how long did it last from start to finish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that long. Don\u2019t forget, it was Josh\u2019s first time too.\u201d She sounds wistful. Now I feel wistful too. Peter\u2019s done it with Genevieve so many times, he\u2019s probably an expert by now. I\u2019ll probably even have an orgasm my first time out. Which is great, but it might\u2019ve been nice if we both didn\u2019t know what we were doing instead of just me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t regret it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so. I think I\u2019ll always be glad it was with Josh. No matter how it\u2019s turned out.\u201d This is a relief to me, that even now, with eyes red from crying, Margot still doesn\u2019t regret having loved Josh.</p><p>I sleep in her room that night like old times, huddled beside her under her quilt. Margot\u2019s room is coldest, because it\u2019s above the garage. I listen as the heat clicks off and on.</p><p>In the dark next to me she says, \u201cI\u2019m going to date a bunch of Scottish guys when I get back to school. When else will I have another opportunity like that, right?\u201d</p><p>I giggle and roll over so we\u2019re face-to-face. \u201cNo, wait\u2014don\u2019t date a bunch of Scottish guys. Date one from England, one from Ireland, one from Scotland. And Wales! A tour of the British Empire!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I am going to school to study anthropology,\u201d Margot says, and we giggle some more. \u201cYou know the saddest part? Josh and I will never be friends like we were before. Not after all this. That part\u2019s just over now. He was my best friend.\u201d</p><p>I give her fake-wounded eyes to lighten the mood, so she won\u2019t start crying again. \u201cHey, I thought I was your best friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my best friend. You\u2019re my sister, and that\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>It is more.</p><p>\u201cJosh and I started out so easy, so fun, and now we\u2019re like strangers. I\u2019ll never have that person back, who I knew better than anyone and who knew me so well.\u201d</p><p>I feel a pinch in my heart. When she says it that way, it\u2019s so sad. \u201cYou could become friends again, after some time has passed.\u201d But it wouldn\u2019t be the same, I know that. You\u2019d always be mourning what once was. It would always be a little bit . . . less.</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be like before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agree. \u201cI suppose it won\u2019t.\u201d Strangely, I think of Genevieve, of who we used to be to each other. Ours was the kind of friendship that makes sense as a kid but not so much now that we\u2019re older. I suppose you can\u2019t hold on to old things just for the sake of holding on.</p><p>It\u2019s the end of an era, it seems. No more Margot and Josh. This time for real. It\u2019s real because Margot is crying, and I can hear it in her voice that it\u2019s over, and this time we both know it. Things have changed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it happen to you, Lara Jean. Don\u2019t get too serious to where things can\u2019t go back. Be in love with Peter if you want, but be careful with your heart. Things feel like they\u2019ll be forever, but they aren\u2019t. Love can go away, or people can, without even meaning to. Nothing is guaranteed.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gulp. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d But I\u2019m not sure I even know what that means. How can I be careful when I already like him so much?</p><p>4</p><p>MARGOT\u2019S OFF SHOPPING FOR NEW boots with her friend Casey, Daddy\u2019s at work, and Kitty and I are lazing about watching TV when my phone buzzes next to me. It\u2019s a text from Peter. Movie tonight? I text back yes, exclamation point. Then I delete the exclamation point for sounding too eager. Though without the exclamation point, the yes seems completely unenthused. I settle on a smiley face and press send before I can obsess over it further.</p><p>\u201cWho are you texting with?\u201d Kitty is sprawled out on the living room floor, spooning pudding into her mouth. Jamie tries to steal a lick, but she shakes her head and scolds, \u201cYou know you can\u2019t have chocolate!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was texting with Peter. You know, that might not even be real chocolate. It might be imitation. Check the label.\u201d</p><p>Of all of us, Kitty is firmest with Jamie. She doesn\u2019t immediately pick him up when he\u2019s crying to be held; she sprays him in the face with a water bottle when he\u2019s naughty. All tricks she\u2019s learning from our across-the-street neighbor Ms. Rothschild, who it turns out is kind of a dog whisperer. She used to have three dogs, but when she and her husband got divorced, she got to keep Simone the golden retriever, and he got custody of the other two.</p><p>\u201cIs Peter your boyfriend again?\u201d Kitty asks me.</p><p>\u201cUm. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d After what Margot said last night about taking things slow and being careful with my heart and not going to a point of no return, maybe it\u2019s good to exist in a place of unsureness for a while. Also, it\u2019s hard to redefine something that never had a clear definition in the first place. We were two people pretending to like each other, pretending to be a couple, so now what are we? And how might it have unfolded if we\u2019d started liking each other without the pretense? Would we ever have been a couple? I guess we\u2019ll never know.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re not sure?\u201d Kitty presses. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you know if you\u2019re somebody\u2019s girlfriend or not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed it yet. I mean, not explicitly.\u201d</p><p>Kitty switches the channel. \u201cYou should look into that.\u201d</p><p>I roll on my side and prop myself up on my elbow. \u201cBut would that change anything? I mean, we like each other. What\u2019s the difference between that and the label? What would change?\u201d Kitty doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, can you say that again at the commercial break? I\u2019m trying to watch my show.\u201d</p><p>I throw a pillow at her head. \u201cI would be better off discussing these things with Jamie.\u201d I clap my hands. \u201cC\u2019mere, Jamie!\u201d</p><p>Jamie lifts his head to look at me and then lies back down again, nestled against Kitty\u2019s side, still hoping for pudding, I\u2019m sure.</p> <p>In the car last night Peter didn\u2019t seem troubled by the status of our relationship. He seemed happy and carefree as always. I\u2019m definitely a person who worries too much over every little thing. I could do with a bit more of Peter\u2019s roll-with-it philosophy in my life.</p><p>\u201cWanna help me pick out what to wear to the movies with Peter tonight?\u201d I ask Kitty.</p><p>\u201cCan I come too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kitty starts to pout and I amend: \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Show me two options and I\u2019ll tell you which is the better one.\u201d</p><p>I dart upstairs to my room and start going through my closet. This will be our actual first date, I want to wow him a bit. Unfortunately, Peter\u2019s already seen me in my good outfits, so the only thing to do is go for Margot\u2019s closet. She has a cream sweater dress she brought back from Scotland that I can put with tights and my little brown boots. There\u2019s also her periwinkle Fair Isle sweater I\u2019ve been admiring; I can wear it with my yellow skirt and a yellow ribbon in my hair, which I\u2019ll curl, because Peter once told me he liked it curled.</p><p>\u201cKitty!\u201d I scream. \u201cCome up and look at my two options!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the commercial break!\u201d she screams back.</p> <p>In the meantime I text Margot:</p><p>Can I borrow your fair isle sweater or your cream sweater dress??</p><p>Oui.</p><p>Kitty votes for the Fair Isle sweater, saying I look like I\u2019m wearing an ice-skating outfit, which I like the sound of. \u201cYou can wear it if we go ice skating,\u201d she says. \u201cYou, me, and Peter.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>PETER AND I ARE STANDING in line for popcorn at the movies. Even just this mundane thing feels like the best mundane thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. I check my pocket to make sure I\u2019ve still got my ticket stub. This I\u2019ll want to save.</p><p>Gazing up at Peter, I whisper, \u201cThis is my first date.\u201d I feel like the nerdy girl in the movie who lands the coolest guy in school, and I don\u2019t mind one bit. Not one bit.</p><p>\u201cHow can this be your first date when we\u2019ve gone out plenty of times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first real date. Those other times were just pretend; this is the real thing.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cOh, wait, is this real? I didn\u2019t realize that.\u201d</p><p>I move to slug him in the shoulder, and he laughs and grabs my hand and links my fingers with his. It feels like my heart is beating right through my hand. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve held hands for real, and it feels different from those fake times. Like electric currents, in a good way. The best way.</p><p>We\u2019re moving up in the line, and I realize I\u2019m nervous, which is strange, because this is Peter. But he\u2019s also a different Peter, and I\u2019m a different Lara Jean, because this is a date, an actual date. Just to make conversation, I ask, \u201cSo, when you go to the movies are you more of a chocolate kind of candy or a gummy kind of candy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. All I want is popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re doomed! You\u2019re neither, and I\u2019m either or all of the above.\u201d We get to the cashier and I start fishing around for my wallet.</p><p>Peter laughs. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to make a girl pay on her first date?\u201d He puffs out his chest and says to the cashier, \u201cCan we have one medium popcorn with butter, and can you layer the butter? And a Sour Patch Kids and a box of Milk Duds. And one small Cherry Coke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that was what I wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pay a lot better attention than you think, Covey.\u201d Peter slings his arm around my shoulders with a self-satisfied smirk, and he accidentally hits my right boob. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>He laughs an embarrassed laugh. \u201cWhoops. Sorry. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I give him a hard elbow to the side, and he\u2019s still laughing as we walk into the theater\u2014which is when we see Genevieve and Emily coming out of the ladies\u2019 room. The last time I saw Genevieve, she was telling everyone on the ski trip bus how Peter and I had sex in the hot tub. I feel a strong surge of panic, of fight or flight.</p><p>Peter slows down for a second, and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen. Do we have to go over and say hi? Do we keep walking? His arm tightens around me, and I can feel Peter\u2019s hesitance too. He\u2019s torn.</p> <p>Genevieve solves it for everyone. She walks into the theater like she didn\u2019t see us. The same theater we\u2019re going into. I don\u2019t look at Peter, and he doesn\u2019t say anything either. I guess we\u2019re just going to pretend like she isn\u2019t here? He steers me through the same set of doors and picks our seats, far left toward the back. Genevieve and Emily are sitting in the middle. I see her blond head, the back of her dove gray dress coat. I make myself look away. If Gen turns around, I don\u2019t want to be caught staring.</p><p>We sit down, and I\u2019m taking off my coat and getting comfy in my seat when Peter\u2019s phone buzzes. He pulls it out of his pocket and then puts it away, and I know it was Gen, but I feel like I can\u2019t ask. Her presence has punctured the night. Two vampire bite marks right into it.</p><p>The lights dim, and Peter puts his arm back around me. Is he going to keep it there the whole movie, I wonder. I feel stiff, and I try to even my breathing. He whispers in my ear, \u201cRelax, Covey.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying, but it\u2019s sort of impossible to relax on command under these circumstances. Peter gives my shoulder a squeeze, and he leans in and nuzzles my neck. \u201cYou smell nice,\u201d he says in a low voice.</p><p>I laugh, a touch too loudly, and the man sitting in front of us whips around in his seat and glares at me. Chastened, I say to Peter, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m really ticklish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d he says, keeping his arm around me.</p><p>I smile and nod, but now I\u2019m wondering\u2014is he expecting that we\u2019re going to do stuff during the movie? Is that why he picked seats in the back when there were still free seats in the middle? Panic is rising inside me. Genevieve is here! And other people too! I might have made out with him in a hot tub, but there wasn\u2019t anyone around to see. Also, I kind of just want to watch the movie. I lean forward to take a sip of soda, but really it\u2019s just so I can subtly move away from him.</p><p>After the movie we have an unspoken understanding to hustle out so we don\u2019t run into Genevieve again. The two of us bolt out of the theater like the devil is on our heels\u2014which, I suppose, she sort of is. Peter\u2019s hungry, but I\u2019m too full from all the junk to eat a real dinner, so I suggest we just go to the diner and I\u2019ll share his fries. But Peter says, \u201cI feel like we should go to a real restaurant since this is your first date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew you had such a romantic side.\u201d I say it like it\u2019s a joke, but I mean it.</p><p>\u201cGet used to it,\u201d he boasts. \u201cI know how to treat a girl.\u201d</p><p>He takes me to Biscuit Soul Food\u2014his favorite restaurant, he says. I watch him scarf down fried chicken with hot honey and Tabasco drizzled on top, and I wonder how many times Genevieve has sat and watched him do the very same thing. Our town isn\u2019t that big. There aren\u2019t many places we can go that he hasn\u2019t already been with Genevieve. When I get up to go to the bathroom, I suddenly wonder if he\u2019s texting her back, but I make myself push this thought out of my mind tout de suite. So what if he does text back? They\u2019re still friends. He\u2019s allowed. I\u2019m not going to let Gen ruin this night for me. I want to be right here, in this moment, just the two of us on our first date.</p> <p>I sit back down, and Peter\u2019s finished his fried chicken and he has a pile of dirty napkins in front of him. He has a habit of wiping his fingers every time he takes a bite. There\u2019s honey on his cheek, and a bit of breading is stuck to it, but I don\u2019t tell him, because I think it\u2019s funny.</p><p>\u201cSo how was your first date?\u201d Peter asks me, stretching back in his chair. \u201cTell it to me like it wasn\u2019t me that took you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked it when you knew what kinds of movie theater snacks I like.\u201d He nods encouragingly. \u201cAnd . . . I liked the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that. You kept shushing me and pointing at the screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man in front of us was getting mad.\u201d I hesitate. I\u2019m not sure if I should say this next thing I want to say, the thing I\u2019ve been thinking all night. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . is it just me, or . . .\u201d</p><p>He leans in closer, now he\u2019s listening. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cIs it . . . a little weird? I mean, first we were fake, and then we weren\u2019t, and then we had a fight, and now here we are and you\u2019re eating fried chicken. It\u2019s like we did everything in the wrong order, and it\u2019s good, but it\u2019s . . . still kind of upside down.\u201d And also were you trying to feel me up during the movie?</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a little weird,\u201d he admits.</p> <p>I sip my sweet tea, relieved that he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m the weird one for bringing up all the weirdness.</p><p>He grins at me. \u201cMaybe what we need is a new contract.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s joking or if he\u2019s serious, so I play along. \u201cWhat would go in the contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff the top of my head . . . I guess I\u2019d have to call you every night before I went to bed. You\u2019d agree to come to all my lacrosse games. Some practices, too. I\u2019d have to come to your house for dinner. You\u2019d have to come to parties with me.\u201d</p><p>I make a face at the parties part. \u201cLet\u2019s just do the things we want to do. Like before.\u201d Suddenly I hear Margot\u2019s voice in my head. \u201cLet\u2019s . . . let\u2019s have fun.\u201d</p><p>He nods, and now he\u2019s the one who looks relieved. \u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>I like that he doesn\u2019t take things too seriously. In other people that could be annoying, but not him. It\u2019s one of his best qualities, I think. That and his face. I could stare at his face all day long. I sip sweet tea out of my straw and look at him. A contract might actually be good for us. It could help us to head problems off at the pass and keep us accountable. I think Margot would be proud of me for this.</p><p>I pull a little notebook out of my purse and a pen. I write Lara Jean and Peter\u2019s New Contract on the top of the page. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Line one I write, Peter will be on time.</p><p>Peter cranes his neck to read upside down. \u201cWait, does that say, \u2018Peter will be on time\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say you\u2019re going to be somewhere, then be there.\u201d</p><p>Peter scowls. \u201cI didn\u2019t show up one time and you hold a grudge\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re always late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as not showing up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing late all the time shows a lack of respect for the person who\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect you! I respect you more than any girl I know!\u201d</p><p>I point at him. \u201c\u2018Girl\u2019? Just \u2018girl\u2019? What boy do you respect more than me?\u201d</p> <p>Peter throws his head back and groans so loudly it\u2019s a roar. I reach across the table, over the food, and grab him by the collar and kiss him before we can fight again. Though I have to say, it\u2019s this kind of fighting, the bickering kind, not the hurt-feelings kind, that makes us feel like us for the first time all night.</p><p>This is what we decide on.</p><p>Peter will not be more than five minutes late.</p><p>Lara Jean will not make Peter do crafts of any kind.</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t have to call Lara Jean before he goes to bed at night, but he can if he feels like it.</p><p>Lara Jean will only go to parties if she feels like it.</p> <p>Peter will give Lara Jean rides whenever she wants.</p><p>Lara Jean and Peter will always tell each other the truth.</p><p>There\u2019s one thing I want to add to the contract, but I\u2019m nervous to broach the subject now that things are going smoothly.</p><p>Peter can still be friends with Genevieve, as long as he is up front with Lara Jean about it.</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s Peter will not lie to Lara Jean about Genevieve. But that\u2019s redundant, because we already have the rule about always telling each other the truth. A rule like that wouldn\u2019t be the truth anyway. What I really want to say is Peter will always pick Lara Jean over Genevieve. But I can\u2019t say that. Of course I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know a ton about dating or guys, but I do know that jealous insecurity is a real turnoff.</p><p>So I bite my tongue; I don\u2019t say what I\u2019m thinking. There\u2019s only one thing, one really important thing I want to be sure of.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want us to ever break each other\u2019s hearts.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughs easily; he cups my cheek in his hand. \u201cAre you planning on breaking my heart, Covey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not planning on breaking mine. Nobody ever plans it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put that in the contract. Peter and Lara Jean promise not to break each other\u2019s hearts.\u201d</p><p>I beam at him, relieved as anything, and then I write it down. Lara Jean and Peter will not break each other\u2019s hearts.</p><p>6</p><p>THE DAY BEFORE WE GO back to school, Kitty and I are lying in my bed watching pet videos on my computer. Our puppy, Jamie Fox-Pickle, is curled up in a ball at the foot of the bed. Kitty wrapped him up in her nubby old baby blanket so only his face is peeking out. He\u2019s dreaming\u2014I can tell by the way he shudders and shakes every so often. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a good dream or a bad dream.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should start doing videos of Jamie?\u201d Kitty asks me. \u201cHe\u2019s cute enough, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely got the look, but he doesn\u2019t have any discernible talent or quirky thing about him.\u201d As soon as I say the word \u201cquirky,\u201d I think of Peter and how he once said I was \u201ccute in a quirky way.\u201d I wonder if that\u2019s still how he sees me. I\u2019ve heard people say that the more you like someone, the more you think they are beautiful even if you didn\u2019t think so in the beginning.</p><p>\u201cJamie does that thing where he prances around like a baby deer,\u201d Kitty reminds me.</p><p>\u201cHm. I wouldn\u2019t exactly call that a \u2018thing.\u2019 It\u2019s not the same as leaping into cardboard boxes or playing the piano or having a really grumpy face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Rothschild will help me train him. She thinks he has the right personality for tricks.\u201d Kitty clicks on the next video, a dog that howls when you play Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller.\u201d Kitty and I crack up and we watch it again.</p><p>After a video of a woman whose cat wraps itself around her face like a scarf, I say, \u201cWait a minute\u2014did you do your homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I had to do was read a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d Kitty hedges, snuggling in closer to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had all of Christmas break to read it, Kitty!\u201d I really wish Kitty were more of a reader like Margot and me. She much prefers TV. I click stop on the video and snap my computer shut with a flourish. \u201cNo more pet videos for you. You go finish your book.\u201d I start to shove her out of the bed, and Kitty grabs on to my leg.</p><p>\u201cSweet my sister, cast me not away!\u201d Proudly she says, \u201cThat\u2019s Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet, in case you haven\u2019t read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act high and mighty like you were reading Shakespeare. I saw you watching the movie on TV the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares if I read it or I saw the movie? The message is still the same.\u201d Kitty crawls back up by me.</p><p>I pat her hair. \u201cSo what\u2019s the message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill yourself over a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a girl,\u201d she agrees. She opens up my computer. \u201cOne more cat video and then I\u2019ll go read.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes, a text from Chris.</p><p>Check Anonybitch\u2019s instagram NOW.</p><p>Anonybitch is an anonymous Instagram account that puts up scandalous pictures and videos of people hooking up and getting drunk at parties around town. No one knows who runs the account; they just send in the content. There was a picture of a girl from another high school that went viral last year\u2014she was flashing a cop car. I heard she got expelled from school for it.</p><p>My phone buzzes again.</p><p>NOW!</p><p>\u201cHold on, Kitty, let me check something first,\u201d I say, pausing the video. As I type in the address, I say, \u201cIf you want to stay in here, close your eyes until I tell you to open them.\u201d</p><p>Kitty obeys.</p><p>At the top of Anonybitch\u2019s feed, there is a video of a boy and a girl making out in a hot tub. Anonybitch is particularly famous for her hot tub videos. She tags them #rubadub. This one\u2019s a little grainy, like it was zoomed in from far away. I click play. The girl is sitting in the boy\u2019s lap, her body draped over his, legs hooked around his waist, arms around his neck. She\u2019s wearing a red nightgown, and it billows in the water like a full sail. The back of her head obscures the boy. Her hair is long, and the ends dip into the hot tub like calligraphy brushes in ink. The boy runs his hands down her spine like she is a cello and he is playing her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m so entranced I don\u2019t notice at first that Kitty is watching with me. Both of our heads are tilted, trying to suss out what it is we\u2019re looking at. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be looking at this,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAre they doing it?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say because of her nightgown.\u201d But maybe?</p><p>Then the girl touches the boy\u2019s cheek, and there is something about the movement, the way she touches him like she is reading braille. Something familiar. The back of my neck goes icy cold, and I am hit with a gust of awareness, of humiliating recognition.</p> <p>That girl is me. Me and Peter, in the hot tub on the ski trip.</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>I scream.</p><p>Margot comes racing in, wearing one of those Korean beauty masks on her face with slits for eyes, nose, and mouth. \u201cWhat? What?\u201d</p><p>I try to cover the computer screen with my hand, but she pushes it out of the way, and then she lets out a scream too. Her mask falls off. \u201cOh my God! Is that you?\u201d</p> <p>Oh my God oh my God oh my God.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Kitty see!\u201d I shout.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s wide-eyed. \u201cLara Jean, I thought you were a goody-goody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d I scream.</p><p>Margot gulps. \u201cThat . . . that looks like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t say it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lara Jean,\u201d Kitty soothes. \u201cI\u2019ve seen worse on regular TV, not even HBO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty, go to your room!\u201d Margot yells. Kitty whimpers and clings closer to me.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe what I am seeing. The caption reads Goody two shoes Lara Jean having full-on sex with Kavinsky in the hot tub. Do condoms work underwater? Guess we\u2019ll find out soon enough. ;) The comments are a lot of wide-eyed emojis and lols. Someone named Veronica Chen wrote, What a slut! Is she Asian?? I don\u2019t even know who Veronica Chen is!</p><p>\u201cWho could have done this to me?\u201d I wail, pressing my hands to my cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t feel my face. Is my face still my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Anonybitch?\u201d Margot demands.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows,\u201d I say, and the roaring in my ears is so loud I can hardly hear my own voice. \u201cPeople just re-gram her. Or him. Am I talking really loud right now?\u201d I\u2019m in shock. Now I can\u2019t feel my hands or feet. I\u2019m gonna faint. Is this happening? Is this my life?</p><p>\u201cWe have to get this taken down right now. Is there a help line for inappropriate content? We have to report this!\u201d Margot\u2019s grabbing the computer from me. She clicks the REPORT INAPPROPRIATE tab. Scanning the comments on the page, she seethes, \u201cPeople are absolute jerks! We might have to call a lawyer. This won\u2019t get taken down right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I scream. \u201cI don\u2019t want Daddy to see!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLara Jean, this is serious. You don\u2019t want colleges to google you and have this video come up! Or, like, future employers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGogo! You\u2019re making me feel so much worse right now!\u201d I grab my phone. Peter. He\u2019ll know what to do. It\u2019s five o\u2019clock, which means he\u2019s still at lacrosse practice. I can\u2019t even call him right now. I text instead:</p><p>Call me ASAP.</p><p>Then I hear Daddy\u2019s voice calling up the staircase. \u201cThese potatoes won\u2019t mash themselves! Who\u2019s helping me?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. Now I have to sit at dinner and look my dad in the face, knowing that this video exists. This can\u2019t be my life.</p><p>Margot and Kitty look at each other, then back at me. \u201cNobody says a word to Daddy!\u201d I hiss at them. \u201cThat means you, Kitty!\u201d</p><p>She gives me a hurt look. \u201cI know when to keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d I mumble. My heart is pounding so hard it\u2019s giving me a headache. I can\u2019t even think straight.</p><p>At dinner, my stomach is churning and I can barely get down a bite of potatoes. Luckily, I have Margot and Kitty to run interference and keep a steady chatter going so I don\u2019t have to talk. I just push the food around on my plate and sneak Jamie Fox-Pickle bites under the table. As soon as everyone else is done eating, I sprint upstairs and look at my phone. Still nothing from Peter. Just more texts from Chris and one from Haven:</p><p>OMG is this you??!</p><p>I don\u2019t know who the girl in the video is. I don\u2019t recognize me in it. It\u2019s not how I see myself at all. It\u2019s like some other person who has nothing to do with me. I\u2019m not someone who climbs into hot tubs with boys and sits in their laps and kisses them passionately with a wet nightgown clinging to them. But I was that night. The video just doesn\u2019t tell the whole truth.</p><p>I keep telling myself it\u2019s not like we\u2019re really having sex in the video. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m naked. It just feels like I\u2019m naked in the video. And all I can think is, everybody at school has seen that video, a video of me in one of the most intimate and truly romantic moments of my life. And not only that, but someone recorded it. Someone was there. That memory was supposed to only be mine and Peter\u2019s, but now it turns out there was some random Peeping Tom in the woods there with us. It\u2019s not just ours anymore. It feels tawdry now. It certainly looks that way. In the moment I felt free, and adventurous, maybe even sexy. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever felt sexy in my whole life. And now I just want to not exist.</p><p>I\u2019m lying in bed staring up at the ceiling, phone at my side. Margot and Kitty have forbidden me from looking at the video. They tried to take my phone away, but I told them I need it for when Peter calls. Then I snuck a look at the video, and so far there are over a hundred comments, none good.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s playing with Jamie Fox-Pickle on the floor and Margot\u2019s emailing Instagram customer service when Chris knocks on my window. Margot unlocks it for her, and Chris climbs inside, shivering and pink-cheeked. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s in shock,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in shock,\u201d I say. But maybe I am. Maybe this is shock. It\u2019s a queer, surreal sort of feeling, like I\u2019m numb, but also all my senses feel heightened.</p><p>Margot says to Chris, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you come in through the front door like a normal person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody answered.\u201d Chris yanks off her boots and sits down on the floor next to Kitty. Petting Jamie, she says, \u201cOkay, first of all, you can barely tell it\u2019s you. And second of all, it\u2019s really hot, so there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. I mean, you look great.\u201d</p><p>Margot makes a disgusted sound. \u201cThat\u2019s so beside the point I don\u2019t even know where to begin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just being honest! Objectively, it sucks, but also objectively, Lara Jean looks awesome in it.\u201d</p><p>Crawling under my quilt, I say, \u201cI thought you could barely even tell it was me! I knew I shouldn\u2019t have gone on that ski trip. I hate hot tubs. Why would I willingly get into a hot tub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, be glad you were in your pajamas,\u201d Chris says. \u201cYou could have been nude!\u201d</p><p>My head pops out from under the quilt and I glare at her. \u201cI would never be nude!\u201d</p> <p>Chris snorts. \u201cNever nude. Did you know that\u2019s a real thing? Some people call themselves never-nudes and they wear clothes at all times, even in the shower. Like, jean shorts.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my side, away from Chris.</p><p>The weight of my bed shifts as Margot climbs in. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she says, peeling back the blanket. \u201cWe\u2019ll get them to take the video down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter,\u201d I say. \u201cEveryone\u2019s already seen it. They all think I\u2019m a slut.\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s eyes go narrow. \u201cSo are you saying that if a girl has sex in a hot tub, that makes her a slut?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying; that\u2019s what other people are saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you saying?\u201d she demands.</p><p>I look at Kitty, who\u2019s braiding Chris\u2019s hair in microbraids. She\u2019s being extra quiet so we forget she\u2019s here and don\u2019t kick her out. \u201cI think that as long as you\u2019re ready and it\u2019s what you want to do and you\u2019re protecting yourself, then it\u2019s okay and you should do what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>Margot says, \u201cSociety is far too caught up in shaming a woman for enjoying sex and applauding a man. I mean, all of the comments are about how Lara Jean is a slut, but nobody\u2019s saying anything about Peter, and he\u2019s right there with her. It\u2019s a ridiculous double standard.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought of that.</p><p>Chris looks down at her phone. \u201cLike, three different people just texted the video to me as we were sitting here.\u201d</p> <p>I let out a sob and Margot says, \u201cChris, that\u2019s not helping. At all.\u201d To me she says, \u201cIf people say anything, just be really blas\u00e9, like it\u2019s beneath you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr just, like, lean into it,\u201d Chris says.</p><p>From behind her Kitty says, \u201cNobody will say anything to Lara Jean because she\u2019s Peter\u2019s girl. That means she\u2019s under his protection, like on The Sopranos.\u201d</p><p>Aghast, Margot says, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019ve seen The Sopranos? How have you seen The Sopranos? It\u2019s not even on TV anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched it on demand. I\u2019m on season three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty! Stop watching it!\u201d She shuts her eyes and shakes her head. \u201cNever mind. That\u2019s not what\u2019s important right now. We\u2019ll talk about it later. Kitty, Lara Jean doesn\u2019t need a boy to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Kitty has a good point,\u201d Chris says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the fact that Peter\u2019s a guy. Well, not completely. It\u2019s about the fact that he\u2019s popular and she isn\u2019t. That\u2019s where the protection comes into play. No offense, LJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d I say. It\u2019s slightly insulting, but it\u2019s also true, and now isn\u2019t the time for me to get my feelings hurt about something so miniscule in comparison to a would-be sex tape.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did Kavinsky say about it?\u201d Chris asks me.</p><p>\u201cNothing yet. He\u2019s still at lacrosse practice.\u201d</p><p>My phone immediately starts to buzz, and the three of us look at each other, wide-eyed. Margot picks it up and looks at it. \u201cIt\u2019s Peter!\u201d She hot-potatoes the phone to me. \u201cLet\u2019s give them some privacy,\u201d she says, nudging Chris. Chris shrugs her off.</p><p>I ignore both of them and answer the phone. \u201cHello.\u201d My voice comes out thin as a reed.</p><p>Peter starts talking fast. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve seen the video, and the first thing I\u2019m going to say to you is don\u2019t freak out.\u201d He\u2019s breathing hard; it sounds like he\u2019s running.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t freak out? How can I not? This is terrible. Do you know what they\u2019re all saying about me in the comments? That I\u2019m a slut. They think we\u2019re having sex in that video, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever read the comments, Covey! That\u2019s the first rule of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say \u2018Fight Club\u2019 to me right now, I will hang up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Okay, I know it sucks but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t \u2018suck.\u2019 It\u2019s a literal nightmare. My most private moment, for everybody to see. I\u2019m completely humiliated. The things people are saying\u2014\u201d My voice breaks. Kitty and Margot and Chris are all looking at me with sad eyes, which makes me feel even sadder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Lara Jean. Please don\u2019t cry. I promise you I\u2019m going to fix this. I\u2019m going to get whoever runs Anonybitch to take it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? We don\u2019t even know who they are! And besides, I bet our whole school\u2019s seen it by now. Teachers, too. I know for a fact that teachers look at Anonybitch. I was in the faculty lounge once and I overheard Mr. Filipe and Ms. Ryan saying how bad it makes our school look. And what about college admissions boards and our future employers?\u201d</p><p>Peter guffaws. \u201cFuture employers? Covey, I\u2019ve seen much worse. Hell, I\u2019ve seen worse pictures of me on there. Remember that picture of me with my head in a toilet bowl, and I\u2019m naked?\u201d</p><p>I shudder. \u201cI never saw that picture. Besides, that\u2019s you; that\u2019s not me. I don\u2019t do that kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trust me, okay? I promise I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>I nod, even though I know he can\u2019t see me. Peter is powerful. If anyone could fix such a thing, it would be him.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019ve gotta go. Coach is gonna kick my ass if he sees me on the phone. I\u2019ll call you tonight, okay? Don\u2019t go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hang up. I wish we could talk longer. \u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>When I hang up, Margot, Chris, and Kitty are all three staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Chris says.</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Smugly Kitty says, \u201cI told you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean, \u2018he\u2019ll take care of it\u2019?\u201d Margot asks. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t exactly proven himself to be responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault,\u201d Kitty and I say at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I know exactly who\u2019s responsible for this,\u201d Chris proclaims. \u201cMy she-devil cousin.\u201d</p><p>This knocks the wind out of me. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>She gives me an incredulous look. \u201cBecause you took her man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve\u2019s the one who cheated on Peter. That\u2019s why they broke up. It wasn\u2019t because of me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike that matters!\u201d Chris shakes her head. \u201cCome on, Lara Jean. Remember what she did to Jamila Singh? Telling everyone that her family had an Indonesian slave just because she had the balls to date Peter after they broke up? I\u2019m just saying, I wouldn\u2019t put a bitch move like this past her.\u201d</p><p>On the ski trip, Genevieve said she knew about the kiss, which has to mean that Peter told her about it at some point in their relationship\u2014though I doubt he told her that he was the one who kissed me and not the other way around! Even so, I find it hard to believe that she could do something so cruel to me. Jamila Singh and Genevieve never liked each other. But Gen and I were best friends once. Sure, we haven\u2019t talked much the last few years, but Gen was always loyal to her friends.</p><p>It had to have been one of the guys hanging out in the rec room, or maybe . . . I don\u2019t know. Maybe anyone!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never trusted her,\u201d Margot says. Then she says to Chris, \u201cNo offense. I know she\u2019s your cousin.\u201d</p><p>Chris snorts. \u201cWhy would I be offended? I can\u2019t stand her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s the one who scraped up the side of Grandma\u2019s car with her bike,\u201d Margot says. \u201cRemember, Lara Jean?\u201d</p><p>It was actually Chris, but I don\u2019t say so. Chris starts biting her nails and giving me panicky eyes and I say, \u201cI don\u2019t think Genevieve was the one who posted the video. It could\u2019ve been anybody who happened to see us that night.\u201d</p><p>Margot puts her arm around me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lara Jean. We\u2019ll get them to take the video down. You\u2019re underage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull it up again,\u201d I say. Kitty cues it up and pushes play. I feel the same sinking feeling in my stomach every time I watch it. I close my eyes so I don\u2019t have to. Thank God the only things you can hear are the sounds of the woods and the hot tub water bubbling. \u201cIs it . . . is it as bad as I\u2019m remembering? I mean, does it really look like we\u2019re having sex? Be honest.\u201d I open my eyes.</p><p>Margot\u2019s peering at it, head tilted. \u201cNo, it really doesn\u2019t. It just looks like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a hot makeout,\u201d Chris supplies.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Margot agrees. \u201cJust a hot makeout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys swear?\u201d</p><p>In unison they say, \u201cWe swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She bites her lip. \u201cIt looks like sex to me, but I\u2019m the only one here besides you who\u2019s never had sex, so what do I know?\u201d Margot lets out a gasp. \u201cSorry, I read your diary.\u201d Margot swats at her, and Kitty crawls away fast like a crab.</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cOkay. I can live with that. I mean, who cares about a hot makeout, right? That\u2019s just part of life, right? And you can barely even see my face? You\u2019d have to really know me to know it was me. My full name isn\u2019t on here anywhere, just Lara Jean. There must be a ton of Lara Jeans, right? Right?\u201d</p><p>Margot gives me an impressed nod. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody move through the five stages of grief that fast. You really do have an incredible bounce-back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, feeling a little proud.</p> <p>But then in the dark, when my sisters and Chris have left and Peter and I have said our good nights and he has assured me for the millionth time that everything will be fine, I look at Instagram again, at all the comments. And I am mortified.</p><p>I asked Peter who he thought could have done it; he said he didn\u2019t know. Probably just some horny pathetic guy, he said. I don\u2019t ask the thing I\u2019m still thinking about, the thing that\u2019s still stuck in my craw. Was it Genevieve? Could she really hate me so much that she\u2019d want to hurt me that badly?</p><p>I remember the day we exchanged friendship bracelets. \u201cThis proves that we\u2019re best friends,\u201d she said to me. \u201cWe\u2019re closer with each other than with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Allie?\u201d I asked. We\u2019d always been a trio, though Genevieve had taken to spending more time at my house, mainly because Allie\u2019s mom was strict about boys coming over and being on the Internet.</p><p>\u201cAllie\u2019s okay but I like you better,\u201d she\u2019d said, and I had felt guilty but honored. Genevieve liked me best. We were close, closer than with anyone else. The bracelets were proof. How cheaply I was bought then, with just a bracelet made out of string.</p><p>7</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING I DRESS for school with special care. Chris said I should lean into it, which would mean a look-at-me kind of outfit. Margot said I should be above it all, which means something mature like a pencil skirt or maybe my green corduroy blazer. But my instinct is to blend, blend, blend. Big sweater that\u2019s more like a blanket. Leggings, Margot\u2019s brown boots. If I could wear a baseball cap to school, I would, but no hats allowed.</p><p>I make myself a bowl of Cheerios with sliced banana on top, but I can only force down a few bites. I\u2019m too nervous. Margot notices and slips a cashew bar in my bag for later. I\u2019m lucky that she\u2019s still here to take such good care of me. She\u2019ll be heading back to Scotland tomorrow.</p><p>Daddy feels my forehead. \u201cAre you sick? You barely had any dinner last night either.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cProbably just cramps. My period\u2019s coming soon.\u201d I have only to say the magic word, \u201cperiod,\u201d and I know he won\u2019t push it further.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he says with a sage nod. \u201cAfter you get some food in your stomach, take two ibuprofen so you have it in your system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I say. I feel bad for the lie, but it\u2019s a tiny one, and it\u2019s for his own good. He can never know about that video, not ever.</p><p>Peter pulls up in front of our house right on time for once. He\u2019s really sticking to our contract. Margot walks me to the door and says, \u201cJust hold your head up high, all right? You haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I get in the car, Peter leans over and kisses me on the mouth, which still feels surprising somehow. I\u2019m taken off guard, so I accidentally cough into his mouth a little. \u201cSorry,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d he says, smooth as ever. He places his arm on the back of my seat as he puts the car in reverse; then he tosses me his phone. \u201cCheck Anonybitch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open up his Instagram and go to Anonybitch\u2019s page. I see the entry that was below ours, a picture of a passed-out guy with penises permanent-markered all over his face. It\u2019s the top of the feed now. I gasp. The hot tub video is gone! \u201cPeter, how did you do this?\u201d</p><p>Peter grins a peacocky kind of grin. \u201cI messaged Anonybitch last night and told them to take that shit down or we\u2019re suing. I told them how my uncle is a lawyer and you and I are both underage.\u201d He gives my knee a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cIs your uncle really a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He owns a pizza parlor in New Jersey.\u201d We both laugh, and it feels like such a relief. \u201cListen, don\u2019t worry about anything today. If anybody says anything, I\u2019ll kick their ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just wish I knew who did it. I could\u2019ve sworn we were alone that night.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we did anything so wrong! I mean, who cares if we made out in a damn hot tub? Who cares if we had sex in it?\u201d I frown and he quickly says, \u201cI know, I know. You don\u2019t want people thinking we did something when we didn\u2019t. We definitely didn\u2019t, and that\u2019s what I told that bitch Anonybitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different for guys and girls, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m going to find out who did this.\u201d He looks straight ahead, so serious and unlike himself; his profile is almost noble for all its good intent.</p><p>Oh, Peter, why do you have to be so handsome! If you weren\u2019t so handsome I never would have gotten in that hot tub with you. It\u2019s all your fault. Except it isn\u2019t. I\u2019m the one who took off my shoes and socks and got in. I wanted it too. I just appreciate that he\u2019s taking it as seriously as he is, writing emails on our behalf. I know this is the kind of thing that Genevieve wouldn\u2019t care about; she never had a problem with PDAs or being the center of attention. But I care, I care a lot.</p> <p>He turns his head and looks at me, studying my eyes, my face. \u201cYou don\u2019t regret it, do you, Lara Jean?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He smiles at me so sweetly I can\u2019t help but smile back. \u201cThanks for getting them to take the video down for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs,\u201d Peter corrects. \u201cI did it for us.\u201d He links our fingers together. \u201cIt\u2019s you and me, kid.\u201d</p><p>I tighten my fingers around his. If we just hold on tight enough, it will all be okay.</p><p>When we walk down the hall together, girls whisper. Boys snicker. One guy from the lacrosse team runs up and tries to high-five Peter, who swats him away with a growl.</p><p>Lucas comes up to me when I\u2019m alone at my locker trading out my books. \u201cI\u2019m not going to mince words,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just going to ask. Is the girl in the video really you?\u201d</p> <p>I take deep, calming breath. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lets out a low whistle. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . did you guys . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we definitely did not. We are not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m embarrassed by the question, though I know there\u2019s no reason for me to be. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never been in a position to talk about my sex life before, because who would ever have thought to ask me anything? \u201cWe aren\u2019t because we aren\u2019t. There\u2019s no big reason behind it, other than I\u2019m not ready yet and I don\u2019t know if he is either. We haven\u2019t even talked about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s a virgin. Not by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d Lucas makes his cerulean blue angel eyes go wide for emphasis. \u201cI know you\u2019re innocent, Lara Jean, but Kavinsky definitely isn\u2019t. I\u2019m saying this to you as a guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what that has to do with me,\u201d I say, even though I\u2019ve wondered and worried about this myself. Peter and I had a conversation about this once, about whether a guy and a girl who\u2019d dated for a long time were automatically having sex, but I don\u2019t remember if he ever said what his take on it was. I should have listened harder. \u201cLook, just because he and Genevieve did it like . . . like wild rabbits or whatever\u2014\u201d Lucas snickers at this, and I pinch him. \u201cJust because they did it doesn\u2019t mean we automatically are, or that he automatically even wants to.\u201d Does it?</p><p>\u201cHe definitely wants to.\u201d</p><p>Gulp. \u201cWell, too bad, so sad, if that\u2019s the case. But honestly, I don\u2019t think it is.\u201d In this very moment I decide that Peter and I will be the relationship equivalent of a brisket. Slow and low. We will heat up for each other over time. Confidently I say, \u201cWhat Peter and I have is completely different than what he and Genevieve were. Or had. Whatever. The point is, you shouldn\u2019t compare relationships, okay?\u201d Never mind the fact that I\u2019ve been doing that constantly in my head.</p><p>In French class, I hear Emily Nussbaum whisper to Genevieve, \u201cIf it turns out she\u2019s preggo, do you think Kavinsky will pay for the abortion?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve whispers back, \u201cNo way. He\u2019s too cheap. Maybe half.\u201d And everyone laughs.</p><p>My face burns in mortification. I want to scream at them, We didn\u2019t have sex! We are brisket! But that would only give them more satisfaction, to know they\u2019re getting a rise out of me. That\u2019s what Margot would say anyway. So I hold my chin up even higher, as high as I can, so high my neck hurts.</p><p>Maybe Gen did do it. Maybe she really does hate me that much.</p><p>Ms. Davenport grabs me on my way to my next class. She puts her arm around me and says, \u201cLara Jean, how are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>I know she doesn\u2019t care about me, not really. She just wants gossip. She\u2019s the biggest gossip of all the teachers, maybe even the students. Well, I\u2019m not going to be faculty-lounge fodder. \u201cI\u2019m great,\u201d I say sunnily. Chin up, chin up.</p><p>\u201cI saw the video,\u201d she whispers, eyes darting around to see if anyone\u2019s listening. \u201cOf you and Peter in the hot tub.\u201d</p><p>My jaw is clenched so tight my teeth hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou must be really upset about the comments, and I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d Ms. Davenport really needs to get a life if all she\u2019s doing over her winter break is looking at high school kids\u2019 Instagrams! \u201cKids can be very cruel. Trust me, I know this from personal experience. I\u2019m not that much older than you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine, but thanks for checking in.\u201d Nothing to see here, folks. Keep it moving.</p><p>Ms. Davenport\u2019s lower lip pushes out. \u201cWell, if you need to talk to someone, you know I\u2019m here for you. Let me be a resource. Come hang out with me anytime; I\u2019ll write you a note.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, Ms. Davenport.\u201d I slither out of from under her arm.</p><p>Mrs. Duvall, the guidance/college counselor stops me on my way to English. \u201cLara Jean,\u201d she begins, then falters. \u201cYou\u2019re such a bright, talented girl. You\u2019re not the type of girl to get caught up in these sorts of things. I\u2019d hate to see you go down a wrong path.\u201d</p><p>I can feel tears coming up the back of my throat, pushing their way to the surface. I respect Mrs. Duvall. I want her to think well of me. All I can do is nod.</p><p>She tips my chin up tenderly. Her perfume smells like dried rose petals. She\u2019s an older woman; she\u2019s worked at the school forever. Mrs. Duvall really cares about the students. She is the one kids come back and say hi to when they\u2019re home from college for winter break. \u201cNow is the time to buckle down and get serious about your future, not high school drama. Don\u2019t give colleges a reason to turn you down, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Again I nod.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d she says. \u201cI know you\u2019re better than that.\u201d</p><p>The words echo in my ears: Better than that. Better than what? Than who?</p><p>During lunch, I escape to the girls\u2019 bathroom so I don\u2019t have to speak to anybody. And of course there Genevieve is, standing in front of the mirror, dabbing on lip balm. Her eyes meet mine in the mirror. \u201cHi there.\u201d It\u2019s the way she says it\u2014hi there. So smug, so sure of herself.</p><p>\u201cWas it you?\u201d My voice echoes against the walls.</p> <p>Genevieve\u2019s hand goes still. Then she recovers, and screws the top back on her lip balm. \u201cWas what me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you send that video to Anonybitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she scoffs. Her mouth turns up to the right, the smallest of quivers. That\u2019s when I know she\u2019s lying. I\u2019ve seen her lie to her mom enough times to know her tell. Even though I suspected it, maybe even knew it deep down, this confirmation takes my breath away.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019re not friends anymore, but we used to be. You know my sisters, my dad. You know me. You knew how much this would hurt me.\u201d I clench my fists to keep from crying. \u201cHow could you do something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, but it honestly wasn\u2019t me.\u201d She gives me a pseudosympathetic shrug, and there it is again: The corner of her mouth turns up.</p><p>\u201cIt was you. I know it was. Once Peter finds out . . .\u201d</p> <p>She raises one eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019ll what? Kick my ass?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so angry my hands shake. \u201cNo, because you\u2019re a girl. But he won\u2019t forgive you either. I\u2019m glad you did it if it proves to him what kind of person you really are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows exactly what kind of person I am. And you know what? He still loves me more than he\u2019ll ever like you. You\u2019ll see.\u201d With that she turns on her heel and walks away.</p><p>This is when it dawns on me. She\u2019s jealous. Of me. She can\u2019t stand that Peter\u2019s with me and not her. Well, she just played herself, because once Peter finds out she\u2019s the one who did this to us, he\u2019ll never look at her the same way again.</p><p>When school lets out, I race to the parking lot, where Peter is in his car waiting for me with the heat on. As soon as I open the passenger side door, I gasp out, \u201cIt was Genevieve!\u201d I scramble inside. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who sent the video to Anonybitch. She just admitted it to me!\u201d</p><p>Soberly he asks me, \u201cShe said she took the video? She said those exact words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . no.\u201d What were her exact words? I walked away feeling like she\u2019d confessed, but now that I\u2019m going over it in my head, she never out-and-out admitted it. \u201cShe didn\u2019t admit it per se, but she practically did. Also, she did that thing with her mouth!\u201d I turn up the corner of my mouth. \u201cSee? That\u2019s her tell!\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow. \u201cCome on, Covey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d He starts the car.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I know the answer to this question, but I have to ask. \u201cHave any teachers said anything to you about the video? Maybe Coach White?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why? Has anyone said anything to you?\u201d</p><p>This is what Margot was talking about, this double standard. Boys will be boys, but girls are supposed to be careful: of our bodies, of our futures, of all the ways people judge us. Abruptly I ask him, \u201cWhen are you going to talk to Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go over there tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going over to her house?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. I have to see her face to know whether she\u2019s lying or not. I\u2019ll check out this \u2018tell\u2019 you\u2019re so excited about.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s starving, so we stop and get hamburgers and milkshakes on the way. When I finally get home, Margot and Kitty are waiting for me. \u201cTell us everything,\u201d Margot says, handing me a cup of cocoa. I check to see if she\u2019s put mini marshmallows inside, and she has.</p><p>\u201cDid Peter fix it?\u201d Kitty wants to know.</p><p>\u201cYes! He got Anonybitch to take the video down. He told them how he has an uncle who\u2019s a top lawyer, when in actuality he owns a pizza parlor in New Jersey.\u201d</p><p>Margot smiles at this. Then her face gets serious. \u201cWere people horrible at school?\u201d</p><p>Blithely I say, \u201cNah, it wasn\u2019t bad at all.\u201d I feel a swell of pride for putting on a brave face in front of my sisters. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure I know who did it.\u201d</p><p>In unison they say, \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, just like Chris said. I confronted her in the bathroom and she denied it, but then she did that thing she does with her mouth when she\u2019s lying.\u201d I demonstrate for them. \u201cGogo, do you remember that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so!\u201d she says, but I can tell she doesn\u2019t. \u201cWhat did Peter say when you told him it was Genevieve? He believed you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d I hedge, blowing on my hot cocoa. \u201cI mean, he says he\u2019s going to talk to her and get down to the bottom of it.\u201d</p><p>Margot frowns. \u201cHe should have your back no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does, Gogo!\u201d I grab her hand and link my fingers through hers. \u201cThis is what he did. He said, \u2018It\u2019s you and me, kid.\u2019 It was really romantic!\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cYou\u2019re hopeless. Don\u2019t ever change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you weren\u2019t leaving tomorrow,\u201d I sigh. I\u2019m homesick for her already. Margot being here, making judgments and doling out sage advice, makes me feel secure. It gives me strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLara Jean, you\u2019ve got this,\u201d she says, and I listen hard, look hard for any doubt or falseness in her, any hint that she\u2019s only saying it to bolster me. But there is none. Only confidence.</p><p>8</p><p>IT\u2019S MARGOT\u2019S LAST DINNER BEFORE she leaves for Scotland tomorrow. Daddy makes Korean short ribs and potatoes au gratin from scratch. He even bakes a lemon cake. He says, \u201cIt\u2019s been so gray and cold; I think we\u2019re all due a little sunshine by way of lemon cake.\u201d Then he puts an arm around my waist and pats my side, and though he isn\u2019t asking, I know he knows there\u2019s something up with me that\u2019s a lot bigger than my period.</p><p>We\u2019ve barely had a chance to put our forks to our lips before Daddy\u2019s asking, \u201cDoes this galbi jjim taste like Grandma\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBasically,\u201d I say. Daddy\u2019s mouth turns down and I quickly add, \u201cI mean, it might even be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tenderized the meat the way she said,\u201d Daddy says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not falling right off the bone the way hers does, you know? You shouldn\u2019t even need a knife to eat galbi jjim if it\u2019s prepared correctly.\u201d Margot was sawing away at a piece of meat with her steak knife, and she stops short. \u201cThe first time I ever had it was with your mom. She took me to a Korean restaurant on our first date and ordered everything for us in Korean and told me about each dish. I was so in awe of her that night. My one regret is that you girls didn\u2019t keep up with Korean school.\u201d The corners of his mouth turn down for just a moment, and then he\u2019s smiling again. \u201cEat up, girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, UVA has a Korean language program,\u201d I say. \u201cIf I get in, I\u2019m definitely going to take Korean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom would\u2019ve loved that,\u201d he says, and he gets that sad look in his eyes again.</p><p>Swiftly Margot says, \u201cThe galbi jjim is delicious, Daddy. They don\u2019t have good Korean food in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPack some seaweed to take back with you,\u201d Daddy suggests. \u201cAnd some of that ginseng tea Grandma brought us back from Korea. You should take the rice cooker too.\u201d</p><p>Kitty frowns. \u201cThen how will we have rice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can buy a new one.\u201d Dreamily he says, \u201cWhat I\u2019d really love to do is take a family vacation there. How great would that be? Your mom always wanted to take you girls on a trip to Korea. You still have a lot of family there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould Grandma come with us?\u201d Kitty asks. She keeps sneaking bites of meat to Jamie, who sits on his hind legs, looking at us with hopeful eyes.</p><p>Daddy nearly chokes on a bite of potatoes. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d he manages. \u201cShe\u2019d be a good tour guide.\u201d</p><p>Margot and I exchange a little smile. Grandma would drive Daddy crazy after a week. What I\u2019m excited about is the shopping. \u201cOh my gosh, just think of all the stationery,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd clothes. And hair pins. BB cream. I should make a list.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDaddy, you could take a Korean cooking class,\u201d Margot suggests.</p><p>\u201cYeah! Let\u2019s think about it for the summer,\u201d Daddy says. He\u2019s already getting excited, I can tell. \u201cDepending on everyone\u2019s schedules, of course. Margot, you\u2019re going to be here all summer, right?\u201d That\u2019s what she was saying last week.</p><p>She looks down at her plate. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Nothing\u2019s been decided yet.\u201d Daddy looks puzzled, and Kitty and I exchange a look. For sure this has to do with Josh, and I don\u2019t blame her. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance I could get an internship at the Royal Anthropological Institute in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you said you wanted to go back to work at Montpelier,\u201d Daddy says, his forehead creased in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still figuring things out. Like I said, I haven\u2019t decided anything yet.\u201d</p><p>Kitty interjects. \u201cIf you do the royal internship, would you get to meet any royal people?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, and Margot throws her a grateful look and says, \u201cI doubt it, Kitten, but you never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Lara Jean?\u201d Kitty asks, innocent and round-eyed. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be doing stuff this summer to look good for colleges?\u201d</p> <p>I shoot her a dirty look. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of time to figure things out.\u201d Under the table I pinch her hard, and she yelps.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be looking for an internship for this spring,\u201d Margot reminds me. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Lara Jean, if you don\u2019t act fast, all the good internships will be gone. Also have you emailed Noni yet about SAT tutoring? See if she\u2019s doing summer school or if she\u2019s going home for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be able to get you a job at the hospital gift shop,\u201d Daddy offers. \u201cWe could ride to work together, have lunch together. It would be fun hanging out all day with your old man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t you have any friends at work?\u201d Kitty asks. \u201cDo you sit by yourself at lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, not every day. Sometimes I suppose I do eat alone at my desk, but that\u2019s because I don\u2019t have much time to eat. If Lara Jean worked at the gift shop, I\u2019d make time, though.\u201d He taps his chopsticks on his plate absentmindedly. \u201cThere might also be a job for her at the McDonald\u2019s, but I\u2019d have to see.\u201d</p><p>Kitty pipes up, \u201cHey, if you got a job at McDonald\u2019s, I bet they\u2019d let you eat fries as much as you want.\u201d</p><p>I frown. I can see a preview into my summer, and I\u2019m not liking what I\u2019m seeing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work at McDonald\u2019s. And no offense, Daddy, but I don\u2019t want to work at the gift shop, either.\u201d I think fast. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about doing something more official at Belleview. Maybe I could be the activities director\u2019s intern. Or assistant. Margot, which sounds more impressive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssistant activities director,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>\u201cThat does sound more professional,\u201d I agree. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of ideas. Maybe I\u2019ll stop by this week and pitch them to Janette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Daddy asks me.</p><p>\u201cA scrapbooking class,\u201d I improvise. \u201cThey have so many pictures and tokens and things that they\u2019ve collected, I think it\u2019d be good to bind it all up in a book so nothing gets lost.\u201d Suddenly I\u2019m on a roll. \u201cAnd then maybe we could have a little exhibit, with all of the scrapbooks on display, and people can flip through them and see their life stories. I could make cheese puffs, there could be white wine . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an amazing idea,\u201d Margot says with an approving nod.</p><p>\u201cReally great,\u201d Daddy enthuses. \u201cObviously no white wine for you, but the cheese puffs, definitely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d we all chorus, because he loves it when we do that, when he gets to be the cheesy dad (pun intended!) and we all groan like we\u2019re exasperated and say \u201cOh, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>When we\u2019re doing the dishes, Margot tells me I should follow up with the Belleview idea for sure. \u201cThey need someone like you to take charge of things,\u201d she says, sudsing up the Dutch oven. \u201cFresh energy, new ideas. People can get burned out working at a retirement home. Janette will be relieved to have an extra set of hands.\u201d</p> <p>I mostly said all that stuff about Belleview to get everybody off my back, but now I\u2019m thinking I really should talk to Janette.</p><p>When I go back upstairs, I have a missed call from Peter. I call him back, and I can hear the TV on in the background. \u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d I hope hope hope he believes me now.</p><p>\u201cI talked to her.\u201d</p><p>My heart thuds. \u201cAnd? Did she admit it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I let out a breath. Okay. That was to be expected, I guess. Gen isn\u2019t the type to lie down in the street and die. She\u2019s a fighter. \u201cWell, she can say whatever she wants, but I know it was her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get all that from a look, Covey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a look. I know her. She used to be my best friend. I know how she thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know her better than you, and I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t think it was her. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>He does know her better; of course he does. But girl to girl, ex\u2013best friend to ex\u2013best friend, I know it was her. I don\u2019t care how many years it\u2019s been. There are things a girl knows in her gut, her bones. \u201cI trust you. I don\u2019t trust her. This is all her plan, Peter.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence, and I hear my last words ringing in my ears, and they sound crazy, even to me.</p> <p>His voice is heavy with patience as he says, \u201cShe\u2019s stressed out with family stuff right now; she doesn\u2019t even have time to plot against you, Covey.\u201d</p><p>Family stuff? Could that be? I feel a pang of guilt as I remember how Chris mentioned that their grandma broke her hip and the families were discussing whether or not to put her into a home. Genevieve was always close to her grandma; she said she was the favorite out of all the grandchildren because she looked just like her\u2014i.e., gorgeous.</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s her parents. Genevieve used to worry about them getting divorced.</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s all a lie. It\u2019s on the very tip of my tongue to say, and then he says, wearily, \u201cMy mom\u2019s calling me downstairs. Can we talk about this more tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say.</p><p>I mean, I guess it could be anything. Peter\u2019s right. Maybe I knew her well once, but not anymore. Peter is the one who knows her best now. And besides, isn\u2019t this the way one loses boyfriends, by acting paranoid and jealous and insecure? I\u2019m fairly certain this is not a good look on me.</p><p>After we hang up I resolve to put the video behind me once and for all. What\u2019s done is done. I have a boyfriend, a possible new job (unpaid, I\u2019m sure, but still), and my studies to think about. I can\u2019t let this bring me down. Besides, you can\u2019t even see my face in the video.</p><p>9</p> <p>THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE SCHOOL, we\u2019re packing up the car so Daddy can take Margot to the airport, and I keep looking up at Josh\u2019s bedroom window, wondering if he\u2019ll come down and say good-bye. It\u2019s the least he can do. But his lights are off, so he must still be asleep.</p><p>Ms. Rothschild comes out with her dog while Margot\u2019s saying her good-byes to Jamie Fox-Pickle. As soon as he sees her, he leaps out of Margot\u2019s arms and makes a run for it across the street. Daddy chases after him. Jamie is barking and jumping all over Ms. Rothschild\u2019s poor old dog Simone, who ignores him. Jamie is so excited he pees on Ms. Rothschild\u2019s green Hunter boots, and Daddy\u2019s apologizing, but she\u2019s laughing. \u201cIt\u2019ll wash right off,\u201d I hear her say. She looks pretty, her brown hair is in a high ponytail, and she\u2019s in yoga pants and a puffy bomber jacket that I think Genevieve has.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Daddy!\u201d Margot calls out. \u201cI need to be at the airport three hours early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree\u2019s a bit much,\u201d I say. \u201cTwo hours is plenty.\u201d We watch as Daddy tries to scoop up Jamie and Jamie tries to wriggle away. Ms. Rothschild snatches him up with one arm and plants a kiss on his head.</p><p>\u201cWith international flights you\u2019re supposed to be at the airport three hours early. I have bags to check \u0327 Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>Kitty doesn\u2019t say anything; she\u2019s just gazing across the street at all the dog drama.</p><p>When Daddy returns with a squirming Jamie in his arms, he says, \u201cWe\u2019d better get out of here before Jamie causes any more trouble.\u201d We three hug each other fiercely, and Margot whispers to me to be strong, and I nod, and then she and Daddy are gone for the airport.</p><p>It\u2019s still early, earlier than we would\u2019ve woken up on a school morning, so I make Kitty and me banana pancakes. She\u2019s still lost in thought. Twice I have to ask her if she wants one pancake or two. I make a few extra and wrap them in aluminum foil to share with Peter on the way to school. I do the dishes; I even send Janette over at Belleview a feeler email, and she writes back right away. Margot\u2019s replacement quit a month ago, so it\u2019s perfect timing, she says. Come in on Saturday and we\u2019ll talk about your responsibilities.</p><p>I feel like finally, I\u2019ve gotten it together: I\u2019ve hit my stride. I can do this.</p><p>So when I walk into school that cold January morning, holding Peter\u2019s hand, full on banana pancakes, with a new job and wearing Margot\u2019s Fair Isle sweater she left behind, I am feeling good. Great, even.</p><p>Peter wants to stop in the computer lab to print out his English paper, so that\u2019s our first stop. He logs in, and I gasp out loud when I see the wallpaper.</p><p>Someone has taken a still of the hot tub video, of me in Peter\u2019s lap in my red flannel nightgown, skirt hitched up around my thighs, and across the top it reads HOT HOT TUB SEX. And on the bottom\u2014YOU\u2019RE DOING IT WRONG.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Peter mutters, looking around the computer lab. Nobody looks up. He goes to the next computer\u2014same picture, different caption. SHE DOESN\u2019T KNOW ABOUT SHRINKAGE on top. HE\u2019S HAPPY WITH WHAT HE CAN GET across the bottom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We are a meme.</p><p>Over the next couple of days, the picture shows up all over the place. On other people\u2019s Instagrams, on their Facebook walls.</p><p>There\u2019s one with a dancing shark photoshopped in. Another one where our heads have been replaced by cat heads.</p><p>And then one that just says AMISH BIKINI.</p> <p>Peter\u2019s lacrosse friends think it\u2019s hilarious, but they swear they don\u2019t have anything to do with it. At the lunch table Gabe protests, \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to use Photoshop!\u201d</p><p>Peter stuffs half his sandwich into his mouth. \u201cFine, then who\u2019s doing it? Jeff Bardugo? Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Darrell says. \u201cIt\u2019s a meme. A lot of people could be throwing their hat in the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit, the cat-head one was pretty funny,\u201d Gabe says. Then he turns to me and says, \u201cMy bad, Large.\u201d</p><p>I stay quiet. The cat heads were kind of funny. But overall it is not. Peter tried to laugh the first one off, but now we are a few days in and I can tell it\u2019s bothering him. He isn\u2019t used to being the butt of the joke. I suppose I\u2019m not either, but only because I\u2019m not used to people paying this much attention to anything I\u2019m doing. But ever since I\u2019ve been with Peter, people are, and I wish they weren\u2019t.</p> <p>10</p><p>THAT AFTERNOON, WE HAVE A junior class assembly in the auditorium. Our class president, Reena Patel, is onstage giving a PowerPoint presentation on the state of the union\u2014how much money we\u2019ve fund-raised for prom, the proposal for senior class trip. I\u2019m sitting low in my seat, relieved for the respite, where people aren\u2019t looking at me, whispering and making judgments.</p><p>She clicks on the last slide, and that\u2019s when it happens. \u201cMe So Horny\u201d blasts out of the speakers and my video, mine and Peter\u2019s, flashes on the projector screen. Someone has taken the video from Anonybitch\u2019s Instagram and put their own soundtrack to it. They\u2019ve edited it too, so I bop up and down on Peter\u2019s lap at triple speed to the beat.</p><p>Oh no no no no. Please, no.</p><p>Everything happens at once. People are shrieking and laughing and pointing and going \u201cOooh!\u201d Mr. Vasquez is jumping up to unplug the projector, and then Peter\u2019s running onstage, grabbing the microphone out of a stunned Reena\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhoever did that is a piece of garbage. And not that it\u2019s anybody\u2019s fucking business, but Lara Jean and I did not have sex in the hot tub.\u201d</p> <p>My ears are ringing, and people are twisting around in their seats to look at me and then shifting back around to look at Peter.</p><p>\u201cAll we did was kiss, so fuck off!\u201d Mr. Vasquez, the junior class advisor, is trying to grab the mic back from Peter, but Peter manages to maintain control of it. He holds the mic up high and yells out, \u201cI\u2019m gonna find whoever did this and kick their ass!\u201d In the scuffle, he drops the mic. People are cheering and laughing. Peter\u2019s being frog-marched off the stage, and he frantically looks out into the audience. He\u2019s looking for me.</p><p>The assembly breaks up then, and everyone starts filing out the doors, but I stay low in my seat. Chris comes and finds me, face alight. She grabs me by the shoulders. \u201cUmmm, that was crazy! He freaking dropped the F bomb twice!\u201d</p><p>I am still in a state of shock, maybe. A video of me and Peter hot and heavy was just on the projector screen, and everyone saw. Mr. Vasquez, seventy-year-old Mr. Glebe who doesn\u2019t even know what Instagram is. The only passionate kiss of my life and everybody saw.</p><p>Chris shakes my shoulders. \u201cLara Jean! Are you okay?\u201d I nod mutely, and she releases me. \u201cHe\u2019s kicking whoever did it\u2019s ass? I\u2019d love to see that!\u201d She snorts and throws her head back like a wild pony. \u201cI mean, the boy\u2019s an idiot if he thinks for one second it wasn\u2019t Gen who posted that video. Like, wow, those are some serious blinders, y\u2019know?\u201d Chris stops short and examines my face. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody saw us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah . . . that sucked. I\u2019m sure that was Gen\u2019s handiwork. She must\u2019ve gotten one of her little minions to sneak it onto Reena\u2019s PowerPoint.\u201d Chris shakes her head in disgust. \u201cShe\u2019s such a bitch. I\u2019m glad Peter set the record straight, though. Like, I hate to give him credit, but that was an act of chivalry. No guy has ever set the record straight for me.\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s thinking of that boy from freshman year, the one who told everyone that Chris had sex with him in the locker room. And I\u2019m thinking of Mrs. Duvall, of what she said before. She would probably lump Chris in with the party girls, the girls who sleep around, the girls who aren\u2019t \u201cbetter than that.\u201d She would be wrong. We\u2019re all the same.</p> <p>After school, I\u2019m walking out of class when my phone buzzes in my purse. It\u2019s Peter.</p><p>I\u2019m out on parole. Meet me at my car!</p><p>I race to the parking lot, where Peter is in his car waiting for me with the heat on. Grinning at me, he says, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to kiss your man? I just got released from prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter! This isn\u2019t a joke. Are you suspended?\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cNah. I sweet-talked my way out of it. Principal Lochlan loves me. Still, I could\u2019ve been. If it had been anybody else . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh, Peter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t brag to me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I came out of Lochlan\u2019s office, there were a bunch of sophomore girls waiting for me to give me a standing O. They were like, \u2018Kavinsky, you\u2019re so romantic.\u2019\u201d He hoots, and I give him a look. He pulls me to his side. \u201cHey, they know I\u2019m taken. There\u2019s only one girl I want to see in an Amish bikini.\u201d</p><p>I laugh; I can\u2019t help it. Peter loves attention, and I hate to be another girl who gives it to him, but he makes it really hard sometimes. Besides, it was kind of romantic.</p><p>He plants a kiss on my cheek, nuzzles against my face. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I would take care of it, Covey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d I admit, patting his hair.</p><p>\u201cSo did I do a good job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d That\u2019s all it takes for him to be happy, me telling him that he did a good job. He\u2019s smiley all the way home. But I\u2019m still thinking about it.</p><p>I beg off the lacrosse party I was supposed to go to with Peter tonight. I say it\u2019s because I have to prepare for my meeting with Janette tomorrow, but we both know it\u2019s more than that. He could call me on it, remind me that we promised to always tell the truth to each other, but he doesn\u2019t. He knows me well enough to know that I just need to burrow in my little hobbit hole for a while, and when I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll come out again and be all right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That night I bake chai sugar cookies with cinnamon-eggnog icing\u2014they\u2019re like a hug in your mouth. Baking calms me; it\u2019s stabilizing. It\u2019s what I do when I don\u2019t want to think about anything hard. It is an activity that requires very little from you\u2014you just follow the directions, and then at the end you have created something. From ingredients to an actual dessert. It\u2019s like magic. Poof, deliciousness.</p><p>After midnight, I\u2019ve set the cookies on the cooling rack and put on my cat pajamas, and I\u2019m climbing into bed to read when there\u2019s a knock at my window. I think it\u2019s Chris, and I go to the window to check and see if I\u2019ve locked it, but it\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s Peter! I push the window up. \u201cOh my God, Peter! What are you doing here?\u201d I whisper, my heart pounding. \u201cMy dad\u2019s home!\u201d</p><p>Peter climbs in. He\u2019s wearing a navy beanie on his head and a thermal with a puffy vest. Taking off the hat, he grins and says, \u201cShh. You\u2019re gonna wake him up.\u201d</p><p>I run to my door and lock it. \u201cPeter! You can\u2019t be here!\u201d I am equal parts panicky and excited. I don\u2019t know if a boy has ever been in my room before, not since Josh, and that was ages ago.</p> <p>He\u2019s already taking off his shoes. \u201cJust let me stay for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms because I\u2019m not wearing a bra and say, \u201cIf it\u2019s only a few minutes, why are you taking off your shoes?\u201d</p><p>He dodges this question. Plopping down on my bed, he says, \u201cHey, why aren\u2019t you wearing your Amish bikini? It\u2019s so hot.\u201d I move to slap him upside the head, and he grabs my waist and hugs me to him. He buries his head in my stomach like a little boy. His voice muffled, he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry all this is happening because of me.\u201d</p><p>I touch the top of his head; his hair feels soft and silky against my fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Peter. I know it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d I glance at my moonbeam alarm clock. \u201cYou can stay for fifteen minutes, but then you have to go.\u201d Peter nods and releases me. I sink down on the bed next to him and put my head on his shoulder. I hope the minutes go slow. \u201cHow was the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring without you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>He laughs an easy kind of laugh. \u201cWhat did you bake tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I baked?\u201d</p><p>Peter breathes me in. \u201cYou smell like sugar and butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChai sugar cookies with eggnog icing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I take some with me?\u201d</p> <p>I nod, and we lean our backs against the wall. He slides his arm around me, safe and secure. \u201cTwelve minutes left,\u201d I say into his shoulder, and I feel rather than see him smile.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s make it good.\u201d We start to kiss, and I\u2019ve definitely never kissed a boy in my bed before. This is brand-new. I doubt I\u2019ll ever be able to think of my bed the same way again. Between kisses he says, \u201cHow much time do I have left?\u201d</p><p>I glance over at my clock. \u201cSeven minutes.\u201d Maybe I should tack on an extra five . . .</p><p>\u201cCan we lie down, then?\u201d he suggests.</p><p>I shove him in the shoulder. \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to hold you for a little bit! If I was going to try to do more, I\u2019d need more than seven minutes, trust me.\u201d</p><p>So we lie down, my back to his chest, him curved around me, his arms slung around mine. He snuggles his chin into the hollow between my neck and my shoulder. It might be my favorite thing we\u2019ve ever done. I like it so much I have to keep reminding myself to be vigilant that we don\u2019t fall asleep. I want to close my eyes but I keep them trained on my clock.</p><p>\u201cSpooning\u2019s the freaking best,\u201d he sighs, and I wish he didn\u2019t say it, because it makes me think of how many times he must have held Genevieve just like this.</p> <p>At the fifteen-minute mark, I sit up so fast he jumps. I clap him on the shoulder. \u201cTime to go, buddy.\u201d</p><p>His mouth falls into a sulk. \u201cCome on, Covey!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, resolute.</p><p>If you hadn\u2019t made me think of Genevieve, I would\u2019ve given you five minutes more.</p><p>After I send Peter off with a bag of cookies, I lie back down and close my eyes and imagine his arms are still around me, and that\u2019s how I fall asleep.</p><p>11</p><p>I GO TO JANETTE\u2019S OFFICE at Belleview the next day, armed with my notebook and my pen. \u201cI had an idea for a craft class. \u2018Scrapbooking to the Oldies.\u2019\u201d Janette nods at me and I continue. \u201cI can teach the residents how to scrapbook, and we\u2019ll go through all their old photos and mementos and listen to oldies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSo I could run that class and also I could take on Friday night cocktail hour?\u201d</p><p>Janette takes a bite of her tuna-fish sandwich and swallows. \u201cWe might cut the cocktail hour altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it?\u201d I repeat in disbelief.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cAttendance has been waning ever since we started offering a computer class. The residents have figured out Netflix. It\u2019s a whole new world out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we made it more of an event? Like, more special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really have the budget for anything fancy, Lara Jean. I\u2019m sure Margot\u2019s told you how we have to make do around here. Our budget\u2019s tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it could be really DIY stuff. Just simple little touches will make all the difference. Like we could make a jacket mandatory for the men. And couldn\u2019t we borrow glassware from the dining room instead of using plastic cups?\u201d Janette is still listening, so I keep on going. \u201cWhy serve peanuts right out of the can, when we can put them in a nice bowl, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeanuts taste like peanuts no matter the receptacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d taste more elegant served out of a crystal bowl.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve said too much. Janette is thinking this all sounds like too much trouble, I can tell. She says, \u201cWe don\u2019t have crystal bowls, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can scrounge one up at home,\u201d I assure her.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a lot of work for every Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014maybe it could just be once a month. That would make it feel even more special. Why don\u2019t we take a little hiatus and bring it back in full force in a month or so?\u201d I suggest. \u201cWe can give people a chance to miss it. Build the anticipation and then really do it right.\u201d Janette nods a begrudging nod, and before she can change her mind I say, \u201cThink of me as your assistant, Janette. Leave it all to me. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shrugs. \u201cHave at it.\u201d</p><p>Chris and I are hanging out in my room that afternoon when Peter calls. \u201cI\u2019m driving by your house,\u201d he says. \u201cWanna do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Chris shouts into the phone. \u201cShe\u2019s busy.\u201d</p><p>He groans into my ear.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I tell him. \u201cChris is over.\u201d</p><p>He says he\u2019ll call me later, and I\u2019ve barely set down the phone when Chris grouses, \u201cPlease don\u2019t become one of those girls who gets in a relationship and goes MIA.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m very familiar with \u201cthose girls,\u201d because Chris disappears every time she meets a new guy. Before I can remind her of this, she goes on. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be one of those lax groupies either. I fucking hate those groupies. Like, can\u2019t they find a better thing to be a groupie for? Like a band? Oh my God, I would be so good at being a groupie for an actual, important band. Like being a muse, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to that idea about you starting your own band?\u201d</p><p>Chris shrugs. \u201cThe guy who plays bass fucked up his hand skateboarding and then nobody felt like it anymore. Hey, do you want to drive to DC tomorrow night and see this band Felt Tip? Frank\u2019s borrowing his dad\u2019s van, so there\u2019s probably room.\u201d</p> <p>I have no idea who Frank is, and Chris has probably only known him for all of two minutes. She always says people\u2019s names like I should already know who they are. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014tomorrow\u2019s a school night.\u201d</p><p>She makes a face. \u201cSee, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about. You\u2019re already becoming one of \u2018those girls.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with it, Chris. A, my dad would never let me go to DC on a school night. B, I don\u2019t know who Frank is, and I\u2019m not riding in the back of his van. C, I have a feeling Felt Tip is not my kind of music. Is it my kind of music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admits. \u201cFine, but the next thing I ask you to do, you have to say yes. None of this A-B-C \u2018here are all of the reasons why\u2019 bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I agree, though my stomach does a little lurch, because with Chris you never know what you\u2019re getting yourself into. Though, also knowing Chris, she\u2019s already forgotten about it.</p><p>We settle onto the floor and get down to the business of manis. Chris grabs one of my gold nail pens and starts painting tiny stars on her thumbnail. I\u2019m doing a lavender base and dark purple flowers with marigold centers. \u201cChris, will you do my initials on my right hand?\u201d I hold up my hand for her. \u201cStarting with the ring finger down to my thumb. LJSC.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFancy font or basic?\u201d</p><p>I give her a look. \u201cCome on. Who are you talking to here?\u201d At the same time we both say, \u201cFancy.\u201d</p><p>Chris is good with doing script. So good, in fact, that as I\u2019m admiring her handiwork, I say, \u201cHey, I have an idea. What if we started doing manicures at Belleview? The residents would love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor free! You could think of it like community service but not mandatory. Out of the goodness of your heart. Some of the residents can\u2019t cut their own nails very well. Their hands get really gnarled. Toes, too. The nails get thick and . . .\u201d I trail off when I see the disgusted look on her face. \u201cMaybe we could have a tip jar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to cut old people\u2019s toenails for free. I\u2019m not doing it for less than fifty bucks a set at the very least. I\u2019ve seen my grandpa\u2019s feet; his toenails are like eagle talons.\u201d She gets back to my thumb, giving me a beautiful cursive C with a flourish. \u201cDone. God, I\u2019m good.\u201d She throws her head back and yells, \u201cKitty! Get your booty in here!\u201d</p><p>Kitty comes running into my room. \u201cWhat? I was in the middle of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018I was in the middle of something,\u2019\u201d Chris mimics. \u201cIf you go get me a Diet Coke, I\u2019ll do your nails for you like I did Lara Jean\u2019s.\u201d I display my hands lavishly like a hand model. Chris counts with her fingers. \u201cKitty Covey fits perfectly.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty bounds off, and I call after her, \u201cBring me a soda too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith ice!\u201d Chris screams. Then she sighs a wistful sigh. \u201cI wish I had a little sister. I would be amazing at bossing her around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty doesn\u2019t usually listen so well. It\u2019s only because she looks up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Chris picks at a fuzzy on her sock, smiling to herself.</p><p>Kitty used to look up to Genevieve, too. She was sort of in awe of her. \u201cHey,\u201d I say suddenly. \u201cHow\u2019s your grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all right. She\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s . . . the rest of your family? Everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Chris shrugs. \u201cSure. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. If Chris doesn\u2019t know, how bad could things be with Genevieve\u2019s family? Either not that bad or, more likely, just another one of Genevieve\u2019s deceptions. Even when we were little she lied a lot, whether it was to get out of trouble with her mom, in which case she\u2019d blame me, or to gain sympathy from adults.</p><p>Chris peers at me. \u201cWhat are you thinking about so hard? Are you still stressing over your sex tape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a sex tape if you\u2019re not having sex in it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Lara Jean. I\u2019m sure Peter\u2019s grandstanding did the trick and people will leave it alone. They\u2019ll be on to the next thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, there\u2019ll be someone or something new to obsess over by next week.\u201d</p><p>It turns out that Chris is right, that people have moved on to the next thing. On Tuesday, a sophomore boy named Clark is caught masturbating in the boys locker room, and it\u2019s all everyone can talk about. Lucky me!</p><p>12</p><p>ACCORDING TO STORMY, THERE ARE two kinds of girls in this world. The kind who breaks hearts and the kind who gets her heart broken. One guess as to which kind of girl Stormy is.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting cross-legged on Stormy\u2019s velvet fainting couch, going through a big shoe box of mostly black-and-white photos. She\u2019s agreed to join my scrapbooking class, and we\u2019re getting a head start organizing. I have several piles going. Stormy: the early years; her teenagehood; her first, second, and fourth weddings\u2014no pictures from her third wedding, because they eloped.</p><p>\u201cI am a heartbreaker, but you, Lara Jean, are a girl who gets her heart broken.\u201d She lifts her eyebrows at me for emphasis. I think she forgot to pencil them in today. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I mull this over. I don\u2019t want to be a girl who gets her heart broken, but I also don\u2019t really want to break boys\u2019 hearts. \u201cStormy, did you have a lot of boyfriends in high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Dozens. That\u2019s how we did it in my day. Drive-in on Friday with Burt and cotillion with Sam on Saturday. We kept our options open. A girl didn\u2019t settle down unless she was supremely, supremely sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure that she liked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure that she wanted to marry him. Otherwise what was the point in ending all the fun?\u201d</p> <p>I pick up a picture of Stormy in a sea-foam formal gown, strapless with a full skirt. She looks like she could be Grace Kelly\u2019s sneaky cousin, with her pale blond hair and the lift of her brow. There\u2019s a boy standing next to her, and he isn\u2019t very tall or particularly handsome, but there\u2019s something about him. A glint in his eye. \u201cStormy, how old were you in this one?\u201d</p><p>Stormy peers at it. \u201cSixteen or seventeen. About your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the boy?\u201d</p><p>Stormy takes a closer look, her face wrinkling like a dried apricot. She taps her red fingernail on the picture. \u201cWalter! We all called him Walt. He was a real charmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he your boyfriend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he was just a boy I saw from time to time.\u201d She waggles her pale eyebrows at me. \u201cWe went skinny-dipping out by the lake, and we got caught by the police. It was quite the scandale. I got to ride home in a police car in nothing but a blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so . . . did people gossip about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBien s\u00fbr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a little bit of a scandale of my own,\u201d I say. Then I tell her about the hot tub, and the video, and all the fallout. I have to explain to her what a meme is. She is delighted; she\u2019s practically vibrating from the salaciousness of it all.</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d she crows. \u201cI\u2019m so relieved you have some bite to you. A girl with a reputation is so much more interesting than a Goody Two-shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStormy, this is on the Internet. The Internet is forever. It\u2019s not just gossip at school. And also, I kind of am a Goody Two-shoes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, your sister Margaret\u2019s the Goody Two-shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargot,\u201d I correct.</p><p>\u201cWell, she certainly seems like a Margaret. I mean, really, every Friday night at a nursing home! I\u2019d have slit my wrists if I was a teenage girl spending all my beauty years at a damn nursing home. Excuse my French, darling.\u201d She fluffs up the pillow behind her. \u201cOldest children are always high-achieving bores. My son Stanley is a frightful bore. He\u2019s the worst. He\u2019s a podiatrist, for God\u2019s sake! I suppose it\u2019s my fault for naming him Stanley. Not that I had any say in it. My mother-in-law insisted we name him after her dead husband. Good Lord, she was a crone.\u201d Stormy takes a sip of her iced tea. \u201cMiddle children are supposed to have fun, you know. You and I, we have that in common. I was glad you hadn\u2019t been coming around as much. I was hoping you were getting into trouble. Sounds like I was right. Although you might\u2019ve come around a bit more.\u201d</p><p>Stormy\u2019s terrific at making a person feel guilty. She\u2019s mastered the art of the injured sniff.</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve got a proper job here, I\u2019ll be around a lot more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not too often.\u201d She perks up. \u201cBut next time bring that boy of yours. We could use some fresh blood around here. Give the place a jolt. Is he handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s very handsome.\u201d The handsomest of all the handsome boys.</p><p>Stormy claps her hands together. \u201cThen you must bring him by. Give me advance notice, though, so I look my absolute best. Who else have you got waiting in the wings?\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cNo one! I told you, I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d That\u2019s all she says, just \u201chmm.\u201d Then, \u201cI have a grandson who could be about your age. He\u2019s still in high school, anyhow. Maybe I\u2019ll tell him to come by and see you. It\u2019s good for a girl to have options.\u201d I wonder what a grandson of Stormy\u2019s might be like\u2014probably a real player, just like Stormy. I open my mouth to say no thank you, but she waves me off with a shh. \u201cWhen we\u2019re done with my scrapbook, I\u2019m going to transcribe my memoirs to you, and you\u2019ll type them up for me on the computer. I\u2019m thinking of calling it The Eye of the Storm. Or Stormy Weather.\u201d Stormy starts to hum. \u201cStormy weather,\u201d she sings. \u201cSince my man and I ain\u2019t together . . . keeps rainin\u2019 all the time. . . .\u201d She stops short. \u201cWe should have a cabaret night! Picture it, Lara Jean. You in a tuxedo. Me in a slinky red dress draped over the piano. It\u2019ll give Mr. Morales a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>I giggle. \u201cLet\u2019s not give him a heart attack. Maybe just a tremor.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and goes on singing, adding a shimmy to her hips. \u201cStormy weather . . .\u201d</p><p>She\u2019ll go off on a singing jag if I don\u2019t redirect her. \u201cStormy, tell me about where you were when John F. Kennedy died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a Friday. I was baking a pineapple upside-down cake for my bridge club. I put it in the oven and then I saw the news and I forgot all about the cake and nearly burned the house down. We had to have the kitchen repainted because of all the soot.\u201d She fusses with her hair. \u201cHe was a saint, that man. A prince. If I\u2019d met him in my heyday, we really could\u2019ve had some fun. You know, I flirted with a Kennedy once at an airport. He sidled up to me at the bar and bought me a very dry gin martini. Airports used to be so very much more glamorous. People got dressed up to travel. Young people on airplanes these days, they wear those horrible sheepskin boots and pajama pants and it\u2019s an eyesore. I wouldn\u2019t go out for the mail dressed like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich Kennedy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHmm? Oh, I don\u2019t know. He had the Kennedy chin, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip to keep from smiling. Stormy and her escapades. \u201cCan I have your pineapple upside-down cake recipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, darling. It\u2019s just yellow box cake with Del Monte pineapple and brown sugar and a maraschino cherry on top. Just make sure you get the rings and not the chunks.\u201d</p><p>This cake sounds horrible. I try to nod in a diplomatic way, but Stormy is onto me. Crossly she says, \u201cDo you think I had time to sit around baking cakes from scratch like some boring old housewife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never be boring,\u201d I say on cue, because it\u2019s true and because I know it\u2019s what she wants to hear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou could do with a little less baking and a little more living life.\u201d She\u2019s being prickly, and she\u2019s never prickly with me. \u201cYouth is truly wasted on the young.\u201d She frowns. \u201cMy legs ache. Get me some Tylenol PM, would you?\u201d</p><p>I leap up, eager to be in her good graces again. \u201cWhere do you keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen drawer by the sink.\u201d</p><p>I rummage around, but I don\u2019t see it. Just batteries, talcum powder, a stack of McDonald\u2019s napkins, sugar packets, a black banana. Covertly, I throw the banana in the trash. \u201cStormy, I don\u2019t see your Tylenol PM in here. Is there anywhere else it could be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForget it,\u201d she snaps, coming up behind me and pushing me to the side. \u201cI\u2019ll find it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to put on some tea?\u201d Stormy is old; that\u2019s why she\u2019s acting this way. She doesn\u2019t mean to be harsh. I know she doesn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>\u201cTea is for old ladies. I want a cocktail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right up,\u201d I say.</p><p>13</p> <p>MY SCRAPBOOKING TO THE OLDIES class has officially begun. I won\u2019t deny that I\u2019m disappointed with the turnout. So far it\u2019s just Stormy, Alicia Ito, who is sprightly and put-together\u2014short, buffed nails, pixie cut\u2014and wily Mr. Morales, who I think has a crush on Stormy. Or Alicia. It\u2019s hard to know definitively, because he flirts with everyone, but they both have full pages in the scrapbook he\u2019s working on. He\u2019s decided to title it \u201cThe Good Old Days.\u201d He\u2019s decorated Stormy\u2019s page with music notes and piano keys and a picture of the two of them dancing on Disco Night last year. Alicia\u2019s page he\u2019s still working on, but his focal point is a picture of her sitting on a bench in the courtyard, gazing off into space, and he\u2019s affixed some flower stickers around it. Very romantic.</p><p>I haven\u2019t got much of a budget, so I\u2019ve brought my own supplies. I\u2019ve also instructed the three of them to collect scraps from magazines and other little bobbles and buttons. Stormy\u2019s a pack rat like me, so she has all kinds of treasures. Lace from her kids\u2019 christening gowns, a matchbook from the motel where she met her husband (\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d she said), old ticket stubs to a cabaret she went to in Paris. (I piped up, \u201cIn 1920s Paris? Did you ever meet Hemingway?\u201d and she cut me with her eyes and said she obviously wasn\u2019t that old and I needed a history lesson.) Alicia\u2019s style is more minimalist and clean. With my black felt tip calligraphy pen, she writes descriptions in Japanese underneath each picture.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say here?\u201d I ask, pointing to a description below a picture of Alicia and her husband, Phil, at Niagara Falls, holding hands and wearing yellow plastic ponchos.</p><p>Alicia smiles. \u201cIt says \u2018the time we got caught in the rain.\u2019\u201d</p><p>So Alicia\u2019s a romantic too. \u201cYou must miss him a lot.\u201d Phil died a year ago. I only met him a couple of times, back when I\u2019d help out Margot with Friday cocktail hour. Phil had dementia, and he didn\u2019t talk much. He\u2019d sit in his wheelchair in the common room and just smile at people. Alicia never left his side.</p><p>\u201cI miss him every day,\u201d she says, tearing up.</p> <p>Stormy jostles her way between us, green glitter pen tucked behind her ear, and says, \u201cAlicia, you need to jazz up your pages more.\u201d She flicks a sheet of umbrella stickers Alicia\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Alicia says stiffly, flicking the page back at Stormy. \u201cYou and I have different styles.\u201d</p><p>Stormy\u2019s eyes narrow at this.</p><p>I quickly go over to the speakers and turn up the volume to lighten the mood. Stormy dances over to me and sings, \u201cJohnny Angel, Johnny Angel. You\u2019re an angel to me.\u201d We put our heads together and chorus, \u201cI dream of him and me and how it\u2019s gonna be . . .\u201d</p><p>When Alicia goes to the bathroom, Stormy says, \u201cUgh, what a bore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bore,\u201d I say.</p><p>Stormy points at me with her hot-pink manicured nail. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare go liking her better than me just because you\u2019re both Asian.\u201d</p><p>Hanging around a retirement home, I\u2019ve gotten used to the vaguely racist things old people say. At least Stormy doesn\u2019t use the word \u201cOriental\u201d anymore. \u201cI like you both equally,\u201d I tell her.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing,\u201d she sniffs. \u201cNo one can ever like anyone exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you love your kids the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought parents didn\u2019t have favorites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do. My favorite\u2019s my youngest, Kent, because he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. He visits with me every Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Loyally I say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think my parents had favorites.\u201d I say it because it seems like the right thing to say, but is it true? I mean, if somebody put a gun to my head and said I had to choose, who would I say was Daddy\u2019s favorite? Margot, probably. They\u2019re the most alike. She\u2019s genuinely into documentaries and bird-watching, just like him. Kitty\u2019s the baby, which automatically gives her an edge. Where does that leave me, the middle Song girl? Maybe I was Mommy\u2019s favorite. I wish I could know for sure. I\u2019d ask Daddy, but I doubt he\u2019d tell the truth. Margot might.</p><p>I\u2019d never be able to pick between Margot and Kitty. But if, say, they were both drowning and I could only throw one a life jacket, it would probably have to be Kitty. Margot would never forgive me otherwise. Kitty\u2019s both of ours to care for.</p><p>The thought of ever losing Kitty puts me in a kinder, more contemplative mood, and so that night after she\u2019s asleep, I bake off a tray of snickerdoodles, her favorite cookie. I have bags of cookie dough in the freezer, frozen into perfect cylindrical balls so that when any of us gets a taste for cookies, we can have them in twenty minutes flat. She\u2019ll have a nice surprise when she opens her lunch bag tomorrow.</p><p>I let Jamie have a cookie too, even though I know I shouldn\u2019t. But he keeps looking up at me with sorrowful puppy eyes and I can\u2019t resist.</p><p>14</p><p>\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DAYDREAMING ABOUT?\u201d Peter taps my forehead with his spoon to get my attention. We are at Starbucks doing homework after school.</p><p>I dump two raw sugar packets into my plastic cup and stir it all up with my straw. I take a long sip, and sugar granules crunch satisfyingly against my teeth. \u201cI was thinking about how it would be neat if people our age could be in love like it\u2019s the 1950s.\u201d Right away I wish I didn\u2019t say \u201cin love,\u201d because Peter\u2019s never said anything about being in love with me, but it\u2019s too late, the words are already out of my mouth, so I just press on and hope he didn\u2019t catch it. \u201cIn the 50s, people just dated, and it was as easy as that. Like one night Burt might take you to a drive-in movie, and the next night Walter might take you to a sock hop or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bemused, he says, \u201cWhat the hell is a sock hop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a dance, like in Grease.\u201d Peter looks back at me blankly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen Grease? It was on TV last night. Never mind. The point is, back then you weren\u2019t somebody\u2019s girl until you had a pin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pin?\u201d Peter repeats.</p><p>\u201cYes, a fellow would give a girl his fraternity pin, and it meant they were going steady. But you weren\u2019t official until you had the pin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not in a fraternity. I don\u2019t even know what a fraternity pin looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014are you saying you want a pin or you don\u2019t want a pin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it either way. I\u2019m just saying, don\u2019t you think there was something cool in the way it used to be? It\u2019s old-fashioned, but it\u2019s almost . . .\u201d What\u2019s Margot always saying? \u201cPostfeminist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. So do you want to go on dates with other guys?\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound upset, necessarily, just confused.</p> <p>\u201cNo! I just . . . I\u2019m just making an observation. I think it would be cool to bring back casual dating. There\u2019s something sweet about it, don\u2019t you think? My sister told me she wishes she didn\u2019t let things get so heavy with her and Josh. You said yourself how you hated how serious it got with Genevieve. If we break up, I don\u2019t want things to ever get so bad that we can\u2019t be in the same room together. I want to still be friends no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Peter dismisses this. \u201cWith me and Gen, it\u2019s complicated because of who Gen is. It\u2019s not like with me and you. You\u2019re . . . different.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my face get all flush again. I try not to sound too eager as I say, \u201cLike different how?\u201d I know I\u2019m digging for a compliment, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re easy to be with. You don\u2019t make me get all crazy and worked up; you\u2019re . . .\u201d Peter\u2019s voice trails off as he looks at my face. \u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d</p><p>My whole body feels tight and stiff. No girl wants to hear what he just said. No girl. A girl wants to get a boy crazy and worked up\u2014isn\u2019t that part of being in love?</p><p>\u201cI mean that in a good way, Lara Jean. Are you mad? Don\u2019t be mad.\u201d He rubs his face tiredly.</p> <p>I hesitate. Peter and I tell each other the truth; that\u2019s how it\u2019s been since the beginning. I\u2019d like it to stay that way, on both sides. But then I catch the sudden worry in his eyes, the uncertainty, and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m used to seeing on him. I don\u2019t like to see it. We\u2019ve only been back together a couple of weeks, and I don\u2019t want to start a new fight when I know he didn\u2019t mean any harm. I hear myself say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not mad,\u201d and just like that, I\u2019m not anymore. After all, I\u2019m the one who was worrying about going too far too fast with Peter. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing he doesn\u2019t get crazy and worked up over me.</p><p>The clouds in his face clear away instantly, and he is sunny and bright again. That\u2019s the Peter I know. He gulps at his tea. \u201cSee, that\u2019s what I mean, Lara Jean. That\u2019s why I like you. You just get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>EARLY MORNING BEFORE SCHOOL, JOSH is chiseling ice off his windshield when I run out to my car. Daddy\u2019s already scraped the ice off mine and started the engine and turned on the heat. By the looks of Josh\u2019s car, he\u2019s not going to make it to school on time.</p><p>We\u2019ve hardly seen Josh since Christmas; after all the strangeness with me and then the breakup with Margot, he\u2019s been a ghost in this house. He leaves a little earlier for school now, comes home a little later. He never reached out to me when all the video stuff happened either, though part of me was relieved for that. I didn\u2019t want to hear I told you so from Josh about how he was right about Peter.</p><p>I back out my driveway, and at the last second I open the window and lean toward it. \u201cDo you want a ride?\u201d I call out to Josh.</p> <p>His eyes widen in surprise. \u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d He throws his ice scraper into his car and grabs his backpack, then comes running over. Climbing in, he says, \u201cThanks, Lara Jean.\u201d He warms his hands on the heating vents.</p><p>We make our way out of the neighborhood, and I\u2019m driving carefully, because the roads are icy from the night before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten really good at driving,\u201d Josh says.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I have been practicing, on my own and with Peter. I still get nervous sometimes, but each time I get in the car and drive, it\u2019s a little bit less, because now I know I can do it. You only know you can do something if you keep on doing it.</p><p>We\u2019re a few minutes from school when Josh asks, \u201cWhen are we going to talk again? Just tell me so I have a general idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking right now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. What happened with me and Margot was between us\u2014can\u2019t you and I still be friends like we were before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh, of course we\u2019ll still be friends. But you and Margot have been broken up less than a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we broke up in August. She decided she wanted to get back together three weeks ago, and I said no.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWhy did you say no, though? Was it just the distance?\u201d</p><p>Josh sighs too. \u201cRelationships are hard work. You\u2019ll see. After you\u2019ve been in it with Kavinsky longer, you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re such a know-it-all. The biggest know-it-all I ever met, besides my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>I can feel a giggle bubbling up inside of me, which I push down. \u201cBoth. They\u2019re both know-it-alls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing.\u201d He hesitates, then keeps going. \u201cI was wrong about Kavinsky. The way he\u2019s handled this whole video thing, I can tell he\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Joshy. He really is.\u201d</p><p>He nods, and there is a comfortable quiet between us, and I\u2019m glad for the bad weather we had last night, glad for the ice on his windshield this morning.</p><p>16</p><p>AFTER SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY I\u2019m sitting on a bench, waiting for Peter out front, when Genevieve walks out the double doors on her phone. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell her, I will. I swear I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>My heart stills. Who is she talking to? Not Peter.</p><p>Her friends Emily and Judith burst out the doors then, and she abruptly hangs up. \u201cWhere the hell have you bitches been?\u201d she snaps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They exchange a look. \u201cGen, chill out,\u201d Emily says, and I can tell she is walking that tightrope, a little bit feisty but careful not to further incur her wrath. \u201cWe still have plenty of time to shop.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve notices me then, and her peevish expression disappears. Waving, she says, \u201cHey, Lara Jean. Are you waiting for Kavinsky?\u201d</p><p>I nod, and blow on my fingers just to have something to do. Also, it\u2019s cold.</p><p>\u201cThat boy\u2019s always running late. Tell him I\u2019ll call him later tonight, okay?\u201d</p> <p>I nod without thinking, and the girls walk away, arms linked.</p><p>Why did I nod? What is wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I ever come up with a good comeback? I\u2019m still berating myself when Peter appears. He slides onto the bench beside me and slings his arm around my shoulders. Then he ruffles the top of my head the way I\u2019ve seen him to do to Kitty. \u201cWhat up, Covey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for making me wait for you outside in the cold,\u201d I say, pressing my freezing fingers on his neck.</p><p>Peter yelps and jumps away from me. \u201cYou could\u2019ve waited inside!\u201d</p><p>He has a point. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m mad about anyway. \u201cGen says to tell you she\u2019ll call you later tonight.\u201d</p> <p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s such a shit stirrer. Don\u2019t let her get to you, Covey. She\u2019s just jealous.\u201d Standing up, he offers me his hands, which I accept begrudgingly. \u201cLet me take you for a hot chocolate to warm up your poor frozen body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I say.</p><p>In the car, he keeps sneaking peeks at me, checking to see if I\u2019m still annoyed. I don\u2019t keep up my chilly routine for much longer, though; it takes up too much energy. I let him buy me a hot chocolate and I even share it with him. But I tell him he can\u2019t have any of the marshmallows.</p><p>That night my phone buzzes on my nightstand, and I know without looking that it\u2019s Peter looking for more reassurance. I take off my headphones and pick it up. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d His voice is low; I can tell he\u2019s lying down.</p><p>\u201cMy homework. What about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in bed. I just called to say good night.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cHey, how come you never call me to say good night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I never thought of it. Do you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You don\u2019t have to\u2014I just wondered why not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated the whole \u2018last call\u2019 thing. Remember? You put it in the contract. You said that Genevieve insisted that she be your last call every night, and it was annoying.\u201d</p><p>He groans. \u201cCan we please not talk about her? Also, why is your memory so good? You remember everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my gift and my curse.\u201d I highlight a paragraph and try to balance the phone on my shoulder, but it keeps slipping. \u201cSo wait, do you want me to call you every night or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, just forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d I say, and I can hear him smiling through the phone.</p> <p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014can you bring me one of those yogurt drinks for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay pretty please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cByeeee.\u201d</p><p>It takes me another two hours to finish my homework, but when I fall asleep that night, I fall asleep smiling.</p><p>17</p><p>I THINK MY DAD IS on a date. tonight he said he had plans with a friend, and he shaved and put on a nice button-down shirt and not one of his ratty sweaters. He was in a hurry to leave, so I didn\u2019t ask who the friend was. Someone from the hospital, probably. Daddy doesn\u2019t exactly have wide social circles. He\u2019s shy. Whoever it is, this sounds like a good thing.</p><p>As soon as he leaves, I turn to Kitty, who is lying on the couch watching TV and licking the sour off sour gummies. Jamie lies asleep next to her. \u201cKitty, do you think Daddy\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a date? Duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Though I\u2019d rather it was with someone I knew and already liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he got married again? Would you be okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. So you can quit making your concerned-big-sister face at me, all right?\u201d</p><p>I try to smooth my face out like a blank sheet of paper. Serenely I say, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re okay with Daddy getting married again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a date, Lara Jean. People don\u2019t get married off of one measly date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they do off of a lot of dates.\u201d</p><p>A flash of worry crosses her face, and then she says, \u201cWe\u2019ll just wait and see. There\u2019s no point in getting all revved up yet.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m revved up, exactly, but I am curious. When I told Grandma I wouldn\u2019t mind if Daddy dated, I meant it, but I do want to know that she\u2019s good enough for him, whoever she is. I change the subject. \u201cWhat do you want for your birthday?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a list going,\u201d she says. \u201cA new collar for Jamie. Leather. With spikes. A treadmill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA treadmill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I want to teach Jamie how to walk on one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Daddy will go for a treadmill, Kitty. They\u2019re really expensive, and besides, where would we even put it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay fine. Scratch the treadmill. I also want night-vision goggles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should cc Margot on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kinds of special things can I get only from Scotland?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cGenuine Scottish shortbread. A tartan kilt. What else . . . golf balls. Loch Ness monster paraphernalia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s paraphernalia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stuffed Loch Ness monster. A Loch Ness T-shirt. Maybe a glow-in-the-dark poster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there. That\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019m gonna add that to my list.\u201d</p><p>After Kitty goes to bed, I clean up the kitchen\u2014I even scrub the stove with a Brillo pad and organize the refrigerator\u2014so that I can give Daddy the third degree the second he gets home. I\u2019m refilling the flour canister when Daddy walks through the door. Casually I say, \u201cHow was your date?\u201d</p><p>He frowns in confusion. \u201cDate? I went to the symphony with my colleague Marjorie. Her husband came down with the flu, and she didn\u2019t want the ticket to go to waste.\u201d</p><p>I deflate. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Humming, he pours himself a glass of water and says, \u201cI should go to the symphony more often. Any interest, Lara Jean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm . . . maybe,\u201d I say.</p><p>I make myself a stack of snickerdoodles, and I run up to my room and sit down at my desk. Munching on one, I open up my computer and type in \u201cdating for dads,\u201d and lo and behold I find a dating site for single parents.</p><p>I start drafting a profile. First things first, he\u2019ll need a profile pic. I start going through the photos of him on my computer. There are hardly any of him alone. I finally settle on two, which I bookmark: one from last summer at the beach\u2014a full-length shot, because that\u2019s one of the tips on the website\u2014and one of him from this past Christmas, wearing that Scandinavian sweater we got him. He\u2019s carving a roast chicken, and he looks daddish in a wholesome coffee-commercial way but still vital. The dim dining room light makes him look hardly wrinkled at all, just some crinkles around the eyes. Which reminds me: I should get on him about wearing sunscreen every day. A men\u2019s skin-care kit could be a good Father\u2019s Day gift. I make a note of it in my Reminders.</p><p>Daddy is only in his early forties. That\u2019s still plenty young enough to meet someone and fall in love, maybe two or three times over, even.</p> <p>18</p><p>WHEN KITTY WAS BORN, I said she looked like a kitten and not a Katherine, so that\u2019s the name that stuck. After we came home from visiting her and Mommy at the hospital, Margot and I made a HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KITTEN banner to make the time go faster. We got out all the paints and craft supplies, and Grandma got annoyed because there was a big mess to clean in the kitchen, colors dripping all over the floor, handprints everywhere. We have a picture of Mommy standing underneath the sign holding Kitty that very first day, eyes tired but bright. Happy.</p><p>It\u2019s our tradition to put the sign on Kitty\u2019s door so it\u2019s the first thing she sees when she wakes up. I get up really early and hang the sign with care, so the edges don\u2019t bend or rip. For breakfast I make her a muenster-cheese omelet. With a ketchup bottle I squeeze out a cat face with a heart around it. We have a \u201ccelebrations drawer,\u201d which is birthday candles, paper hats, tablecloths, emergency birthday cards. I take out the paper hats and put one on my head, jauntily to the side. I set one each by Kitty and Daddy\u2019s plate, and I put one on Jamie Fox-Pickle too. He is not into it, but I\u2019m able to get a picture before he knocks the hat off.</p><p>Daddy\u2019s prepared Kitty\u2019s favorite lunch to take to school. A Brie sandwich and chips, plus a red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting.</p><p>Kitty delights in the place settings and in her cat face omelet. She claps and laughs like a hyena when the rubber band on Daddy\u2019s hat snaps, and the hat springs off his head. Truly, there\u2019s no happier birthday girl than our Kitty.</p> <p>\u201cCan I wear your sweater with the daisies on it?\u201d she asks me, her mouth full of omelet.</p><p>I glance at the clock. \u201cI\u2019ll go get it, but you have to eat fast.\u201d He\u2019ll be here any minute.</p><p>When it\u2019s time to leave, we put on our shoes, kiss Daddy good-bye, and tumble out the front door. Waiting for us on the street in front of his car is Peter with a bouquet of cellophane-wrapped pink carnations. \u201cHappy birthday, kid,\u201d he says.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWho else would they be for? Hurry and get in the car.\u201d</p><p>Kitty turns to me, her eyes bright, her smile as wide as her face. I\u2019m smiling too. \u201cAre you coming too, Lara Jean?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, there\u2019s only room for two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my only girl today, kid,\u201d Peter says, and Kitty runs to him and snatches the flowers out of his hand. Gallantly, he opens the door for her. He shuts it and turns and winks at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous, Covey.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never liked him more than in this moment.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s birthday party with all her friends won\u2019t be for a few weeks. She insisted on a sleepover, and Daddy\u2019s on call for weekends in February. Tonight, we\u2019ll celebrate with a family dinner.</p><p>One of Daddy\u2019s most go-to dinners is roast chicken. He calls it the house specialty. He\u2019ll slather it in butter, pop an onion and an apple inside, sprinkle some poultry seasoning, and stick it in the oven. Usually a potato in some form as the side. Tonight I\u2019ve mashed sweet potatoes and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top, then put them under the broiler so the sugar burns like cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.</p><p>Kitty is in charge of setting the table and putting out the condiments: Texas Pete\u2019s hot sauce for Daddy, mustard for Kitty, strawberry jam for me. Chutney for Margot if she were here. \u201cWhat kind of sauce did Mommy like with her chicken?\u201d Kitty asks me suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI . . . can\u2019t remember,\u201d I say. We both look at Daddy, who is checking on the chicken.</p><p>\u201cDid she like mustard like me?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>Closing the oven door, Daddy says, \u201cHmm. Well, I know she liked balsamic vinegar. A lot. A lot a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust on chicken?\u201d Kitty asks.</p><p>\u201cOn everything, actually. Avocados, with butter on toast, tomatoes, steak.\u201d</p><p>I file this away under Misc. Facts about M.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys ready to eat?\u201d Daddy asks. \u201cI want to get this bird out while it\u2019s still nice and juicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Kitty says, and literally a minute later the doorbell rings. Kitty springs into action. She comes back with Ms. Rothschild from across the street. She\u2019s in skinny jeans and a black turtleneck sweater and high-heeled boots, a chunky black-and-gold necklace around her neck. Her mahogany brown hair is half up, half down. She\u2019s carrying a wrapped present in her hands. Jamie Fox-Pickle\u2019s puppy legs can\u2019t get to her fast enough; he is sliding all over the place, wagging his little tail.</p><p>Laughing, she says, \u201cWell, hello, Jamie.\u201d She sets her gift on the counter and kneels down and pets him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, everybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Ms. Rothschild,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTrina!\u201d Daddy says, surprised.</p><p>Ms. Rothschild lets out an awkward laugh. \u201cOh, did you not know I was coming? Kitty invited me when she was over with Jamie today. . . .\u201d She reddens. \u201cKitty,\u201d she chides.</p><p>\u201cI did tell him\u2014it\u2019s just that Daddy\u2019s absentminded,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Ms. Rothschild says, giving her a look, which Kitty pretends not to see. \u201cWell, thank you anyway!\u201d Jamie starts jumping all over her, another of his bad habits. Ms. Rothschild sticks her knee out and Jamie settles down immediately. \u201cSit, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>And then he actually sits! Daddy and I exchange an impressed look. Clearly Jamie needs to continue under Ms. Rothschild\u2019s tutelage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrina, what can I get you to drink?\u201d Daddy asks her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have whatever\u2019s open,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything open, but I\u2019m happy to open whatever you like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Rothschild likes pinot grigio,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cWith an ice cube.\u201d</p> <p>She turns even redder. \u201cGod, Kitty, I\u2019m not a lush!\u201d She turns to us and says, \u201cI\u2019ll have a small glass after work, but not every night.\u201d</p><p>Daddy laughs. \u201cI\u2019ll put some white wine in the freezer. It\u2019ll get cold soon.\u201d</p><p>Kitty looks pleased as punch, and when Daddy and Ms. Rothschild go into the living room, I grab her by the collar and whisper, \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she says, trying to squirm away.</p><p>\u201cIs this a setup?\u201d I hiss.</p> <p>\u201cSo what if it is? They\u2019d be a good match.\u201d</p><p>Huh! \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Kitty ticks off her fingers. \u201cShe loves animals, she\u2019s hot, she makes her own money, and I like her.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. All of that does sound good. Plus she lives across the street, which is convenient.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Ms. Rothschild watches documentaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares about dusty old documentaries? He can watch them with you or Margot. The important thing is chemistry.\u201d Kitty tries to jerk loose from my grip. \u201cLet go of me so I can see if they have any!\u201d</p> <p>I release her collar. \u201cNo, don\u2019t go in yet.\u201d Kitty huffs and flounces away and I say meaningfully, \u201cLet\u2019s let it simmer for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She stops short and then gives me an appreciative nod. \u201cLet\u2019s let it simmer,\u201d she repeats, savoring the words.</p><p>Kitty is sawing her way through a piece of white meat, the only kind she\u2019ll eat\u2014she likes it sliced thin like deli meat, and Daddy tries but it always ends up kind of shredded and sad-looking. I think maybe I\u2019ll get him an electric carving knife for this birthday. Personally, I like the thigh. I honestly don\u2019t know why anyone would bother eating anything but thigh if they had the choice.</p><p>When Ms. Rothschild shakes some hot sauce on her chicken, Kitty\u2019s eyes glow like a lightning bug. I make note of the way Ms. Rothschild laughs at Daddy\u2019s corny jokes with sincerity. I also appreciate the way she goes wild for my snickerdoodles. I threw some frozen ones in the oven when Daddy put the coffee on.</p><p>\u201cI love how this cookie is crunchy but also soft. You\u2019re telling me you made this from scratch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWell, give me the recipe, girl.\u201d Then she laughs. \u201cWait, don\u2019t bother. I know my strengths, and baking is not one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll share with you anytime\u2014we always have lots of cakes and cookies,\u201d Kitty says, which is rich coming from her, because it\u2019s not like Kitty ever helps. She only shows up for the fun parts, the decorating and eating.</p> <p>I sneak a look at Daddy, who is placidly sipping his coffee. I sigh. He\u2019s completely oblivious.</p><p>We all do the washing up and wrapping up of leftovers together, and it feels very natural. Without anyone telling her, Ms. Rothschild knows to hand-wash the wineglasses and not put them in the dishwasher, and on the first try she finds the aluminum foil and plastic wrap drawer. Which might say more about Margot\u2019s organizational skills than Ms. Rothschild\u2019s intuition, but still. I think I could see her fitting in with us pretty seamlessly. And, as I said, she does live across the street, which is convenient. People say absence makes the heart grow fonder, but I think they\u2019re wrong: Proximity makes the heart grow fonder.</p><p>As soon as Ms. Rothschild\u2019s gone home and Daddy\u2019s in his study, Kitty pounces on me in my room, where I\u2019m setting out school clothes. Navy sweater with a fox on it that I\u2019ve been saving for a rainy day, mustard-yellow skirt, knee socks.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demands. She has Jamie Fox-Pickle in her arms.</p><p>\u201cI like the way she started Saran-wrapping things; that was some good initiative,\u201d I say, pinning a tortoiseshell bow in my hair and checking it out in the mirror. \u201cShe also complimented my snickerdoodles a lot, which I appreciated. But I don\u2019t know if I necessarily saw any sparks with Daddy. I mean, did you think he seemed interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he could be if she gave him a chance. She was dating a guy from her office, but it didn\u2019t work out because he reminded her of her ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. \u201cIt sounds like you guys have had some serious talks.\u201d</p><p>Proudly Kitty says, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t treat me like a little kid.\u201d</p><p>If Kitty\u2019s that crazy about her, that says a lot. \u201cWell, she might not be Daddy\u2019s type, but if we keep throwing them together, who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she might not be Daddy\u2019s type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer style seems really different than Mommy\u2019s. Doesn\u2019t she smoke? Daddy hates that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to quit. She\u2019s got an electronic cigarette now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s keep inviting her to things and see what happens,\u201d I say, picking up my hairbrush. \u201cHey, do you think if you watched a video, you could give me a little side cornrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give it a shot,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cCurl the ends first and then check with me after I watch my shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>THE NEXT TIME MARGOT AND I video-chat, I break the news to her. She\u2019s sitting at her desk, wearing a Fair Isle sweater, light blue and hunter green, and her hair is wet. She has a Saint Andrews mug she\u2019s drinking tea out of. \u201cThat\u2019s a cute sweater,\u201d I say, nestling my laptop on my thighs and getting cozy against my pillows. \u201cSo guess who Kitty\u2019s been trying to set Daddy up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Rothschild.\u201d</p><p>Margot practically chokes on her tea. \u201cFrom across the street? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. That\u2019s literally the craziest thing I ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Kitty\u2019s been spending a lot of time with her because she\u2019s teaching her how to train Jamie. She seems pretty nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, sure, she\u2019s nice, but she wears so much makeup and she\u2019s always spilling hot coffee all over her cleavage and shrieking like a banshee. Remember how she and her ex-husband used to get into those screaming matches in their yard?\u201d Margot shudders. \u201cWhat would she and Daddy even have to talk about? She\u2019s like a Real Housewife of Charlottesville. Except she\u2019s divorced.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe did mention that Real Housewives is her favorite show,\u201d I admit, feeling like a tattletale. \u201cBut she said it\u2019s a guilty pleasure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think all of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, promise me you won\u2019t let her get her hooks in Daddy. He doesn\u2019t know the first thing about dating in the twenty-first century, and she\u2019ll just eat him alive. He needs to be with someone mature, someone with wisdom in her eyes.\u201d</p> <p>I snort. \u201cLike who? A grandma? If so, I know a few from Belleview I could set him up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but someone who\u2019s at least the same age as him! She should be sophisticated, but also enjoy nature and hiking and that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time Daddy hiked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for years, but that\u2019s the point\u2014he needs a woman who will encourage those kinds of interests. Keep him active, physically and mentally.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, I say, \u201cAnd . . . sexually?\u201d I simply cannot resist the joke, or the opportunity to gross Margot out.</p> <p>\u201cEw!\u201d she screams. \u201cYou\u2019re depraved!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up on you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. If Ms. Rothschild isn\u2019t the one, I was thinking he should try online dating. I\u2019ve found a dating site for him and everything. He\u2019s a handsome guy, you know. And at Thanksgiving, Grandma was bugging him about dating more. She says it\u2019s not good for a man to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfectly happy.\u201d She pauses. \u201cIsn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s perfectly . . . content? But that\u2019s not the same thing as happy, is it? Gogo, I hate to think of him being lonely . . . and the way Kitty\u2019s so bent on setting him up with Ms. Rothschild, it makes me think she\u2019s longing for a mother figure.\u201d</p> <p>Margot sighs and takes a sip of tea. \u201cOkay, work on his profile and send me the login info so I can weigh in on everything. We\u2019ll handpick a few and present him with a really curated selection so he doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively I say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we hold off until we see how this thing with Ms. Rothschild plays out? We should at least give her a chance, don\u2019t you think? For Kitty\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Margot sighs again. \u201cHow old do you think she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, thirty-nine? Forty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she dresses much younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hold that against her,\u201d I say, though I will admit to feeling slight discomfort when she said we shop at the same places. Does that mean she dresses too young or I dress too old? Chris has called my style \u201cgranny meets little-girl chic\u201d and \u201cLolita went to library school.\u201d Which reminds me. \u201cHey, if you see any cute kilts, will you bring one back for me? Red tartan, maybe with a big safety pin button?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my eyes open for you,\u201d she promises. \u201cMaybe I can find matching for the three of us. Actually, the four of us. It can be next year\u2019s Christmas card.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cDaddy in a kilt!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never know, he might be into it. He\u2019s always talking up his one-quarter Scottish heritage. He can put his money where his mouth is.\u201d She wraps both hands around her mug and takes a sip of tea. \u201cGuess what. I met a cute boy. His name is Samuel, and he\u2019s in my British pop culture class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. Does he have a posh accent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndubitably,\u201d she says in a posh English accent. We both giggle. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting up at a pub tonight. Wish me luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck!\u201d I shout.</p><p>I like seeing Margot like this, so light and happy and unserious. I think it must mean she\u2019s really and truly over Josh.</p><p>20</p><p>\u201cDON\u2019T STAND IN FRONT OF the tv,\u201d Kitty snaps.</p><p>I\u2019m dusting the bookshelves with a new feather duster that I ordered online. I don\u2019t know the last time anybody dusted in here. I whirl around and say, \u201cWhy are you being such a mean little crab apple today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just in a mood,\u201d she mutters, stretching her string-bean legs out in front of her. \u201cShanae was supposed to come over today and now she isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t take it out on me.\u201d</p><p>Kitty scratches her knee. \u201cHey, what would you think about me sending Ms. Rothschild a valentine on Daddy\u2019s behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d I shake my feather duster at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop with this meddling habit of yours, Katherine. It\u2019s not cute.\u201d</p><p>Kitty gives me a deep eye roll. \u201cUgh, I never should have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late now. Look, if two people are meant to be, they\u2019ll find their way to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you and Peter have \u2018found your way to each other\u2019 if I hadn\u2019t sent those letters?\u201d she challenges.</p><p>Point one for Kitty. \u201cProbably not,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not. You needed my little push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like sending my letters was some altruistic act on your part. You know you did it out of spite.\u201d</p><p>Kitty sails right past that and asks, \u201cWhat does \u2018altruistic\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfless, charitable, generous of spirit . . . a.k.a. the opposite of you.\u201d Kitty shrieks and lunges at me, and we struggle briefly, both of us breathless and giggling and bumping into the shelves. I used to be able to disarm her with not much effort, but she\u2019s gaining on me. Her legs are strong, and she\u2019s good at wriggling out of my grasp like a worm. I finally get both her arms behind her back, and she yells, \u201cI give, I give!\u201d As soon as I release her, she jumps up and attacks me again, tickling under my arms and going for my neck.</p><p>\u201cNot the neck, not the neck!\u201d I shriek. The neck is my weak spot, which everyone in my family knows. I fall to my knees, laughing so hard it hurts. \u201cStop, stop! Please!\u201d</p><p>Kitty stops tickling. \u201cAnd that\u2019s me being altru . . . altruistic,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s my altruicity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAltruism,\u201d I pant.</p><p>\u201cI think \u2018altruicity\u2019 works too.\u201d</p><p>If Kitty hadn\u2019t sent those letters, would Peter and I still have found our way to each other? My first impulse is to say no, but maybe we would have kept going down different paths and converged at some other fork in the road. Or maybe not, but either way, we\u2019re here now.</p><p>21</p><p>\u201cTELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR young man,\u201d Stormy says. We\u2019re sitting cross-legged on her floor, setting aside pictures and mementos for her scrapbook. She was the only one to show up for Scrapbooking to the Oldies today, so we moved it over to her apartment. I\u2019d worried Janette would notice the low attendance, but since I started volunteering, she hasn\u2019t so much as popped her head in. All the better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you want to know about him?</p><p>\u201cDoes he play any sports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe plays lacrosse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLacrosse?\u201d she repeats. \u201cNot football or baseball or basketball?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s very good. He\u2019s being recruited by colleges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see a picture of him?\u201d</p><p>I get my phone out and pull up a picture of the two of us in his car. He\u2019s wearing a hunter green sweater that I think he looks particularly handsome in. I like him in sweaters. I get the urge to cuddle and pet him like a stuffed animal.</p><p>Stormy looks at it closely. \u201cHuh,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, he is very handsome. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s as handsome as my grandson, though. My grandson looks like a young Robert Redford.\u201d</p><p>Whoa.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you if you don\u2019t believe me,\u201d she says, getting up and rooting around for a picture. She\u2019s opening drawers, moving papers around. Any other grandmother at Belleview would already have a picture of her beloved grandson on display. Framed, above the TV or on the mantel. Not Stormy. The only pictures she has framed are pictures of herself. There\u2019s a huge black-and-white bridal portrait in the entryway that takes up nearly the whole wall. Though I suppose if I was once that beautiful, I would want to show it off too. \u201cHuh. I can\u2019t find a picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can show me next time,\u201d I say, and Stormy lowers herself back down on the couch.</p><p>She puts her legs up on the ottoman. \u201cWhere do young people go these days for a little alone time? Is there no \u2018Lookout Point\u2019 type of place?\u201d She\u2019s digging, she\u2019s definitely digging for information. Stormy\u2019s a bloodhound when it comes to sniffing out juicy goods, but I\u2019m not giving up a thing. Not that I even have much juice to offer her.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know . . . I don\u2019t think so.\u201d I busy myself with cleaning up a pile of scraps.</p><p>She starts to cut up some trimmings. \u201cI remember the first boy I ever went parking with. Ken Newbery. He drove a Chevy Impala. God, the thrill of a boy putting his hands on you for the first time. There\u2019s nothing quite like it, is there, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm. Where\u2019s that stack of old Broadway playbills you had? We should do something with those, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey might be in my hope chest.\u201d</p><p>The thrill of a boy putting his hands on you for the first time.</p><p>I get a shivery feeling in my stomach. I do know that thrill. I remember it perfectly, and I would even if it hadn\u2019t been caught on camera. It\u2019s nice to think of it again as its own memory, separate from the video and everything that followed.</p><p>Stormy leans in close and says, \u201cLara Jean, just remember, the girl must always be the one to control how far things go. Boys think with their you-know-whats. It\u2019s up to you to keep your head and protect what\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Stormy. Isn\u2019t that kind of sexist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is sexist. If you were to get pregnant, you\u2019re the one whose life changes. Nothing of significance changes for the boy. You\u2019re the one people whisper about. I\u2019ve seen that show, Teen Moms. All those boys are worthless. Garbage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I shouldn\u2019t have sex?\u201d This whole time, Stormy has been telling me to stop being such a stick-in-the-mud, to live life, to love boys. And now this?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you should be careful. As careful as life and death, because that\u2019s what it is.\u201d She gives me a meaningful look. \u201cAnd never trust the boy to bring the condom. A lady always brings her own.\u201d</p> <p>I cough.</p><p>\u201cYour body is yours to protect and to enjoy.\u201d She raises both eyebrows at me meaningfully. \u201cWhoever you should choose to partake in that enjoyment, that is your choice, and choose wisely. Every man that ever got to touch me was afforded an honor. A privilege.\u201d Stormy waves her hand over me. \u201cAll this? It\u2019s a privilege to worship at this temple, do you understand my meaning? Not just any young fool can approach the throne. Remember my words, Lara Jean. You decide who, how far, and how often, if ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you were such a feminist,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cFeminist?\u201d Stormy makes a disgusted sound in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m no feminist. Really, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStormy, don\u2019t get worked up about it. All it means is that you believe men and women are equal, and should have equal rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any man is my equal. Women are far superior, and don\u2019t you forget it. Don\u2019t forget any of the things I just told you. In fact you should probably be writing it down for my memoirs.\u201d She starts to hum \u201cStormy Weather.\u201d</p><p>There was never a threat of things going too far when we were fake. But I see now how fast things can change without you even realizing it. It can go from a kiss to hands under my shirt in two seconds, and it\u2019s so feverish, so frenzied. It\u2019s like we\u2019re on a high-speed train that\u2019s going somewhere fast, and I like it, I do, but I also like a slow train where I can look out the window and appreciate the countryside, the buildings, the mountains. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to miss the little steps; I want it to last. And then the next second I want to grow up faster, more, now. To be as ready as everyone else is. How is everyone else so ready?</p><p>I still find it very surprising, having a boy in my personal space. I still get nervous when he puts his arm around my waist or reaches for my hand. I don\u2019t think I know how to date in the 2010s. I\u2019m confused by it. I don\u2019t want what Margot and Josh had, or Peter and Genevieve. I want something different.</p><p>I guess you could call me a late bloomer, but that implies that we\u2019re all on some predetermined blooming schedule, that there\u2019s a right or a wrong way to be sixteen and in love with a boy.</p><p>My body is a temple not just any boy gets to worship at.</p><p>I won\u2019t do any more than I want to do.</p><p>22</p><p>PETER AND I ARE AT Starbucks, sitting side by side, studying for our chemistry exam. Idly, he puts his arm around my chair and starts twisting my hair around his pencil and letting it unfurl like a slice of ribbon. I ignore him. He pulls my chair closer to his and plants a warm kiss on my neck, which makes me giggle. I scoot away from him. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate when you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you like when I play with your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I\u2019m trying to study.\u201d I look around and then whisper, \u201cBesides, we\u2019re in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s hardly anybody in here!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s the barista, and that guy over there by the door.\u201d I try to discreetly point with my pencil. Things have been quiet at school; the last thing we need is another meme flare-up.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, nobody\u2019s going to film us if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. We\u2019re not doing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you from the start I\u2019m not into PDAs,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>Peter smirks. \u201cReally? Let\u2019s not forget who kissed who in the hallway. You literally jumped on top of me, Covey.\u201d</p> <p>I blush. \u201cThere was a purpose for that and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a purpose now,\u201d he pouts. \u201cThe purpose is I\u2019m bored and I feel like kissing you. Is that a crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a baby,\u201d I say, pinching his nose hard. \u201cIf you stay quiet and study for forty-five more minutes, I\u2019ll let you kiss me in the privacy of your car.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s face lights up. \u201cDeal.\u201d His phone buzzes, and he reaches down to check it. He frowns and texts something, his fingers lightning quick.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>He nods, but he looks distracted, and he keeps texting, even as we\u2019re supposed to be studying. And now I\u2019m distracted too, wondering what it could be. Or who.</p><p>23</p><p>I\u2019M PUSHING MY GROCERY CART around, looking for condensed milk for key lime pie, when I spot Josh in the cereal aisle. I roll right up to him and bump him with my cart.</p><p>\u201cHey, neighbor,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey, so guess what.\u201d Josh grins a pleased, proud sort of grin. \u201cI got into UVA early.\u201d</p><p>I let out a high-pitched shriek and let go of my cart. \u201cJosh! That\u2019s amazing!\u201d I throw my arms around him and jump up and down. I shake his shoulders. \u201cBe more excited, you loon!\u201d</p> <p>He laughs and jumps up and down a few times too before releasing me. \u201cI am excited. My parents are out of their heads excited because now they don\u2019t have to pay out-of-state tuition. They haven\u2019t fought in days.\u201d Shyly he asks, \u201cWill you tell Margot? I feel like I can\u2019t call her myself, but she deserves to know. She\u2019s the one who helped me study all that time. It\u2019s partly because of her that this is even happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her. I know she\u2019ll be really happy for you, Josh. My dad and Kitty, too.\u201d I lift my hand for a high five, and he smacks it. I can\u2019t believe it\u2014Josh is going to college, and soon he won\u2019t be my neighbor anymore. Not like before. Now that he\u2019ll be graduating and leaving town, maybe his parents will finally get their divorce, and then they\u2019ll sell the house and he won\u2019t even be my sort-of neighbor. Things have been off with us for months, even before the Margot breakup, and we haven\u2019t hung out in ages . . . but I liked knowing that he was there, right next door if I needed him. \u201cOnce a little more time has passed . . . ,\u201d I begin. \u201cOnce we have the all clear from Margot, will you come over for dinner again like before? Everyone misses you. I know Kitty\u2019s dying to show you Jamie\u2019s new tricks. I\u2019ll tell you right now, it\u2019s nothing fancy, so don\u2019t get excited. But still.\u201d</p><p>A smile spreads across his face, that slow smile I know so well. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says.</p><p>24</p><p>THE SONG GIRLS TAKE VALENTINE making very seriously. A valentine is humble and sweet and sincere in its old-fashionedness, and as such, homemade is best. I have plenty of raw materials from my scrapbooking, but in addition I\u2019ve saved snippets of lace and ribbon and doilies. I have a tin with little beads and pearls and rhinestones in it; I have antiquey rubber stamps, too\u2014a Cupid, hearts of all kinds, flowers.</p><p>Historically, Daddy gets one valentine from the three of us. This year is the first that Margot will be sending one of her own. Josh will get one too, though I let Kitty take the lead on it and merely sign my name under hers.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent the better part of the afternoon on Peter\u2019s. It\u2019s a white heart, edged in white lace. In the center I\u2019ve stitched YOU\u2019RE MINE, PETER K in pink string. I know it will make him smile. It\u2019s lighthearted, teasing; it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, much like Peter himself. Still, it acknowledges the day and the fact that we, Peter Kavinsky and Lara Jean Song Covey, are in a relationship. I was going to make a much more extravagant card, big and beaded and lacy, but Kitty said it would be a bit much.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use all my pearls,\u201d I tell Kitty. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me years to build up my collection. Literally, years.\u201d</p> <p>Pragmatic as ever, Kitty says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of collecting them if you don\u2019t use them? All that work so they can just live in a little tin box where no one can even see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say, because she does have a point. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, only put pearls on the valentines of the people you really like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the purple rhinestones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse as many of those as you want,\u201d I say in a benevolent tone, much like a wealthy landowner to a less-fortunate neighbor. The purple rhinestones don\u2019t go with my motif. I\u2019m shooting for a Victorian look, and purple rhinestones are more Mardi Gras, but you won\u2019t see me saying that to Kitty. Kitty\u2019s temperament is such that when she knows you don\u2019t much value something, she grows suspicious of it too and the appeal is lost to her. For a long time I had her convinced that raisins were my absolute favorite, and she must never ever eat more than her share, when in actuality I hate raisins and was grateful someone else was eating them. Kitty used to hoard raisins; she was probably the most regular kid in kindergarten.</p><p>I\u2019m hot-gluing white bric-a-brac around a heart as I wonder aloud, \u201cShould we do a special breakfast for Daddy? We could buy one of those juicers at the mall and make fresh-squeezed pink grapefruit juice. And I think I saw heart waffle makers online for not very expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t like grapefruit,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cAnd we barely use our regular waffle maker as it is. How about we just cut the waffle into the shape of a heart instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would look so cheap,\u201d I scoff. But she\u2019s right. There\u2019s no sense in buying something we\u2019d only ever use once a year, even if it only costs $19.99. As Kitty gets older, I see that she is far more like Margot than me.</p><p>But then she says, \u201cWhat if we use our cookie cutter to make heart-shaped pancakes instead? And put in red food coloring?\u201d</p><p>I beam at her. \u201cAttagirl!\u201d So maybe she\u2019s got a little bit of me in her after all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kitty continues. \u201cWe could put red food coloring in the syrup, too, to make it look like blood. A bloody heart!\u201d</p><p>No, never mind. Kitty is all her own.</p><p>25</p><p>THE NIGHT BEFORE VALENTINE\u2019S DAY, I get it in my head that my card for Peter isn\u2019t enough and cherry turnovers would be a fantastic idea, so I wake up before the sun rises to bake them fresh, and now the kitchen looks like a crime scene. Cherry juice splattered all over the countertops and tiles. It\u2019s a bloodbath, a cherry-juice bloodbath. Worse than the time I made red velvet cake and got red food coloring in the backsplash tiles. I had to take a toothbrush to the grout.</p> <p>But my turnovers turn out so perfect, right out of a cartoon, each one so golden and homey, with their fork-tined edges and the little holes to let out steam. My plan is to bring these to the lunch table; I know that Peter and Gabe and Darrell will appreciate them. I\u2019ll give one to Lucas, too. And Chris, if she shows up for school.</p><p>I text Peter that I don\u2019t need a ride, because I want to get there early and put the valentine in his locker. There\u2019s something sweet about a valentine in a locker\u2014when you think about it, a locker is much like a mailbox, and everyone knows that letters sent in the mail are far more romantic than when they\u2019re unceremoniously handed over in person.</p><p>Kitty comes downstairs around seven, and the two of us set a beautiful Valentine\u2019s table setting for Daddy, with his valentines from me, Kitty, and Margot arranged around his plate. I leave him two turnovers. I miss the big reaction because I don\u2019t want to get to school after Peter. He always cuts it close, so I figure I\u2019m fine being just five minutes early.</p><p>When I get to school, I slip the valentine into Peter\u2019s locker, then head to the cafeteria to wait for him.</p><p>But when I walk in, he\u2019s already there, standing by the vending machines with . . . Genevieve. He has his hands on her shoulders, and he is talking to her intently. She\u2019s nodding, her eyes downcast. What could it be, this thing that has her so sad? Or is it just an act, a way to keep Peter close?</p> <p>Here it is Valentine\u2019s Day and I feel like I\u2019m interrupting my boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend. Is he really just being a good friend to her, or is it something more? With her I feel like it\u2019s always something more, whether he knows it or not. Have they exchanged Valentine\u2019s gifts, for old times\u2019 sake? Is that me being paranoid or is that a thing that exes who are still friends do?</p><p>She spots me then, says something to Peter, and walks past me and out of the cafeteria. He strides over to me. \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day, Covey.\u201d He puts his hands on my waist and picks me up for a hug like I weigh nothing. Setting me down, he says, \u201cCan we kiss in public since it\u2019s a holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my valentine first?\u201d I say, holding my hand out.</p><p>Peter laughs. \u201cDamn, it\u2019s in my backpack. Geez. So greedy.\u201d Whatever it is, I can tell he is excited to give it to me, which in turn excites me. He takes my hand and leads me over to the table where his backpack is. \u201cFirst sit down,\u201d he says, and I obey. He sits down next to me. \u201cClose your eyes and hold out your hand.\u201d</p><p>I do, and I hear him unzip his bag, and then he puts something in my hand, a piece of paper. I open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a poem,\u201d he says. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p> <p>The moon never beams without bringing me dreams</p><p>Of beautiful Lara Jean.</p><p>And stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes</p><p>Of beautiful Lara Jean.</p><p>I touch my hand to my lips. Beautiful Lara Jean! I can\u2019t even believe it. \u201cThis is my favorite thing anyone has ever done for me. I could squeeze you to death right now I\u2019m so happy.\u201d To picture him, sitting at his desk at home, scribbling away with a pen and paper, endears him to me so completely. It gives me shivers. Currents of electricity from my scalp down to my toes.</p><p>\u201cReally? You like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it!\u201d I throw my arms around him and squeeze with all my might. I will put this valentine in my hatbox, and when I\u2019m old like Stormy, I will take it out and look at it and remember this exact moment. Forget Genevieve; forget everything. Peter Kavinsky wrote me a poem.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only present I brought you. It\u2019s not even the best one.\u201d He peels away from me and pulls a little velvet jewelry box out of his backpack. I gasp. Pleased, he says, \u201cHurry up and open it already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it a pin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>My hands fly to my mouth. It\u2019s my necklace, the heart locket from his mom\u2019s antique store, the very same necklace I admired for so many months. At Christmas when Daddy said the necklace had been sold, I thought it was gone from my life forever. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d I whisper, touching the diamond chip in the middle.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me put it on for you.\u201d</p><p>I lift my hair up, and Peter comes around and fastens the necklace around my neck. \u201cCan I even accept this?\u201d I wonder aloud. \u201cIt was really expensive, Peter! Like, really really expensive.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI know how much it cost. Don\u2019t worry, my mom cut me a deal. I had to sign over a bunch of weekends to driving the van around picking up furniture for the store, but you know, no biggie. It\u2019s whatever, as long as you\u2019re into it.\u201d</p><p>I touch the necklace. \u201cI am! I\u2019m so, so into it.\u201d Surreptitiously I look around the cafeteria. It\u2019s a petty thought, a small thought, but I wish Genevieve were here to see this.</p><p>\u201cWait, where\u2019s my valentine?\u201d Peter asks me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in your locker,\u201d I say. Now I\u2019m sort of wishing I didn\u2019t listen to Kitty and let myself go a little overboard this first Valentine\u2019s Day with a boyfriend. With Peter. Oh, well. At least there are the cherry turnovers still warm in my backpack. I\u2019ll give them all to him. Sorry, Chris and Lucas and Gabe.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop looking at myself in this necklace. At school, I wear it over my sweater, so all can see and admire. That night I show it to Daddy, to Kitty, to Margot over video chat. As a joke I show it off to Jamie Fox-Pickle. Everyone\u2019s impressed. I don\u2019t take it off, ever: I wear it in the shower; I wear it to sleep.</p><p>It\u2019s like in Little House in the Big Woods, when Laura got a rag doll for Christmas. It had black button eyes, and berry-stained lips and cheeks. Red flannel stockings and a pink-and-blue calico dress. Laura couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of it. She held that doll tight and forgot the rest of the world. Her mother had to remind her to let the other girls hold it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s how I feel. When Kitty asks to try it on, I hesitate for a tiny second and then feel guilty for being so stingy. \u201cJust be careful with it,\u201d I tell her as I unclasp the necklace.</p><p>Kitty pretends to drop the locket off the chain and I shriek. \u201cJust kidding,\u201d she giggles. She goes over to my mirror and looks at herself, her head tilted, neck arched. \u201cNot bad. Aren\u2019t you so glad I set this whole you-and-Peter thing in motion?\u201d</p><p>I throw a pillow at her.</p><p>\u201cCan I borrow it for a special occasion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Then I think of Laura and the doll again. \u201cYes. If it\u2019s a very special occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kitty says. Then she cocks her head and looks at me with serious eyes. \u201cLara Jean, can I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about boys.\u201d</p><p>I try not to look too eager as I nod. Boys! So we\u2019re here already. All right. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you promise you\u2019ll answer honestly? Sister swear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Come sit by me, Kitty.\u201d She sits down next to me on the floor and I put my arm around her, feeling generous and warm and maternal. Kitty really is growing up.</p><p>She looks up at me, doe-eyed. \u201cAre you and Peter doing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shove her away. \u201cKitty!\u201d</p><p>Gleefully she says, \u201cYou promised you\u2019d answer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the answer is no, you sneaky little fink. God! Get out of my room.\u201d Kitty skips off, laughing like a mad hyena. I can hear her all the way down the hallway.</p> <p>26</p><p>JUST WHEN I THOUGHT THE hot-tub-video ordeal was well and truly over with, another version pops up and reminds me that this particular nightmare will never be over. Nothing on the Internet ever dies; isn\u2019t that what people say? This time I\u2019m in the library, and out of the corner of my eye I see two sophomore girls sharing a pair of earbuds, watching the video, giggling. There I am, in my nightgown, draped all over Peter\u2019s lap like a blanket. For a few seconds I just sit there, trapped in my indecision. To confront or not to confront. I remember Margot\u2019s words about rising above it and acting like I couldn\u2019t care less. And then I think, Screw it.</p><p>I stand up, stalk over to them, and snatch the earbuds out of the laptop. \u201cPart of Your World\u201d comes blasting out the speakers.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d the girl says, whirling in her seat.</p><p>Then she sees it\u2019s me, and she and her friend exchange a panicky look. She slams the laptop shut. \u201cGo ahead, play it,\u201d I say, crossing my arms.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d she says.</p><p>I reach over her and open it and push play. Whoever\u2019s made this video has spliced it with scenes from The Little Mermaid. \u201cWhen\u2019s it my turn? Wouldn\u2019t I love, love to explore that shore up above . . .\u201d I snap the computer shut. \u201cJust so you know, watching this video is the equivalent of child pornography, and you guys could be charged for it. Your IP address is already in the system. Think about that before you forward it on. That\u2019s distribution.\u201d</p><p>The red-haired girl gapes. \u201cHow is this child porn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m underage and so is Peter.\u201d</p><p>The other girl smirks and says, \u201cI thought you guys claimed you weren\u2019t having sex.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stumped. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll let the Justice Department sort that out. But first I\u2019m notifying Principal Lochlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re the only ones looking at it!\u201d the red-haired girl says.</p><p>\u201cThink about how you\u2019d feel if it were you in that video,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d feel great,\u201d the girl mutters. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky. Kavinsky\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Lucky. Right.</p><p>It catches me off guard how upset Peter is when I show him the Little Mermaid video. Because nothing bad ever sticks to Peter; it just rolls off his back. That\u2019s why people like him so much, I think. He\u2019s sure of himself; he\u2019s self-possessed. It sets people at ease.</p><p>But it\u2019s the Little Mermaid video that breaks him. We watch it in his car, on his phone, and he\u2019s so mad I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to throw the phone out the window. \u201cThose fuckers! How dare they!\u201d Peter punches the steering wheel, and the horn beeps. I jump. I\u2019ve never seen him upset like this. I\u2019m not sure what to say, how to calm him down. I grew up in a house full of women and one gentle dad. I don\u2019t know anything about teenage boys\u2019 tempers.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d he yells. \u201cI hate that I can\u2019t protect you from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to,\u201d I say, and I realize as I say it that it\u2019s true. I\u2019m coping on my own just fine.</p><p>He stares straight ahead. \u201cBut I want to. I thought I fixed it before, but here it is again. It\u2019s like fucking herpes.\u201d</p><p>I want to comfort him, to make him laugh and forget. Teasingly I ask him, \u201cPeter, do you have herpes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, it\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I put my hand on his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Peter starts the car. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere. Nowhere. Let\u2019s just drive.\u201d I don\u2019t want to run into anybody, I don\u2019t want any knowing looks or whispers. I want to hide. Peter\u2019s Audi, our little haven. To cover up my bleak thoughts, I give Peter a bright smile, bright enough to make him smile back, just.</p><p>The drive calms Peter down, and by the time we get to my house, Peter seems to be in good spirits again. I ask him if he wants to come inside and have pizza, it being pizza night and all. I tell him he can order whichever toppings he wants. But he shakes his head, says he should get home. For the first time he doesn\u2019t kiss me good-bye, and it makes me feel guilty, how bad he feels. It\u2019s partly my fault, I know it is. He feels like he has to make things right for me, and now he knows he can\u2019t, and it\u2019s killing him.</p><p>When I walk into the house, Daddy is waiting for me at the kitchen table, just sitting and waiting, eyebrows knit together. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been answering your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry . . . my battery died. Is everything okay?\u201d Judging by the serious look on his face, everything is definitely not okay.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, Lara Jean. Come sit down.\u201d</p><p>Dread hits me like a tidal wave. \u201cWhy, Daddy? What\u2019s wrong? Where\u2019s Kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her room.\u201d I put down my bag and make my way over to the kitchen table, feet moving as slow as I can make them. I sit down next to him and he sighs heavily, hands folded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as I say, \u201cIs this about the dating profile I set up for you? Because I haven\u2019t even activated it yet,\u201d he says, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me what was going on at school?\u201d</p><p>My heart drops all the way to the floor. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I\u2019m still hoping, praying this is about something else. Tell me I failed my chemistry test; say anything but the hot tub.</p><p>\u201cThe video of you and Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out?\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>\u201cYour guidance counselor called me. She was worried about you. Why didn\u2019t you tell me what was going on, Lara Jean?\u201d</p><p>He looks so stern, and so very disappointed, which I hate most of all. I feel pressure building behind my eyes. \u201cBecause . . . I was ashamed. I didn\u2019t want you to think of me that way. Daddy, I swear, all we were doing was kissing. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the video, and I won\u2019t. That\u2019s private, between you and Peter. But I wish you had used better judgment that day, Lara Jean. There are long-lasting consequences to our actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Tears roll down my cheeks.</p><p>Daddy takes my hand out of my lap and holds it in his. \u201cIt pains me that you didn\u2019t come to me when things were so hard for you at school. I knew you were going through something, but I didn\u2019t want to push too hard. I always try to think about what your mom would do if she were here. I know it\u2019s not easy, only having a dad to talk to\u2014\u201d His voice breaks, and I cry harder. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying. I really am trying.\u201d</p> <p>I jump out of my seat and throw my arms around him. \u201cI know you\u2019re trying,\u201d I cry.</p><p>He hugs me back. \u201cYou have to know you can come to me, Lara Jean. No matter what it is. I\u2019ve spoken to Principal Lochlan, and he\u2019s going to make an announcement tomorrow saying that anyone who watches or distributes the video will be suspended.\u201d</p><p>Relief floods over me. I should\u2019ve come to my dad in the first place. I stand up straight, and he reaches up and wipes my cheeks. \u201cNow, what\u2019s this about a dating profile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . \u201d I sit back down again. \u201cWell . . . I started one for you on Singleparentloveconnection.com.\u201d He\u2019s frowning, so I quickly say, \u201cGrandma doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s good for a man to be alone for so long, and I agree with her. I thought online dating could help you get back out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, I can handle my own dating life! I don\u2019t need my daughter managing my dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you never go on any.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my concern, not yours. I want you to take down that profile tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was never even active; I just set it up in case. It\u2019s a whole new world out there, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now we\u2019re talking about your love life, not mine, Lara Jean. Mine we\u2019ll save for another time. I want to hear about yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Primly, I fold my hands in front of me on the table. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>He scratches his neck. \u201cWell . . . are you and Peter pretty serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, I think I might love him. But maybe it\u2019s too early to say. How serious can you be in high school, anyway? Look at Margot and Josh and how that turned out.\u201d</p><p>Wistfully, Daddy says, \u201cHe never comes around here anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t want to be the girl crying in her dorm room over a boy.\u201d I stop suddenly. \u201cThat\u2019s something Mommy said to Margot. She said don\u2019t be the girl who goes to college with a boyfriend and then misses out on everything.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles a knowing kind of smile. \u201cThat sounds like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was her high school boyfriend? Did she love him a lot? Did you ever meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom didn\u2019t have a high school boyfriend. That was her roommate she was talking about. Robyn.\u201d Daddy chuckles. \u201cShe drove your mom crazy.\u201d</p><p>I rest back in my seat. All this time I thought Mommy was talking about herself.</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time I saw your mom. She was throwing a dinner in her dorm called Fakesgiving, and a buddy of mine and I went. It was a big Thanksgiving meal in May. She had on a red dress, and her hair was long back then. You know, you\u2019ve seen the pictures.\u201d He pauses, a smile flickering on his face. \u201cShe gave me a hard time because I brought canned green beans and not fresh ones. That\u2019s how you knew if she liked someone, if she teased them. Of course, I didn\u2019t know it at the time. I was pretty clueless about girls back then.\u201d</p><p>Ha! Back then. \u201cI thought you guys met in a psychology class,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAccording to your mom, we took the same class one semester, but I don\u2019t remember seeing her. It was in one of those lecture halls with hundreds of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she noticed you,\u201d I say. That, I\u2019ve heard before. She said she liked the way he paid attention in class, and how his hair was a little too long in the back, like an absent-minded professor.</p><p>\u201cThank God she did. Where would I be without her?\u201d</p><p>This gives me pause. Where would he be? Without us, certainly, but probably he wouldn\u2019t be a widower either. Would his life have been happier if he\u2019d married some other girl, made some other choice?</p><p>Daddy tips my chin. Firmly he says, \u201cI would be nowhere without her, because I wouldn\u2019t have my girls.\u201d</p><p>I call Peter and tell him Mrs. Duvall called my dad and he knows all about the video, but he\u2019s talked to Principal Lochlan and everything will be fine now. I expect him to be relieved, but he still sounds down. \u201cNow your dad probably hates me,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d I assure him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should say something to him? I don\u2019t know, like, apologize, man to man?\u201d</p><p>I shudder. \u201cDefinitely not. My dad is super awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop worrying, Peter. It\u2019s like I told you, my dad\u2019s sorted it all out. Principal Lochlan will make the announcement and people will leave us alone. Besides, there\u2019s nothing for you to apologize for. I was in it just as much as you were. You didn\u2019t make me do anything I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>We hang up soon after, and even though I feel better about the video, I still feel unsettled about Peter. I know he\u2019s upset about not being able to protect me, but I also know that part of why he\u2019s upset is because his pride was injured, and that has nothing to do with me. Is a boy\u2019s ego really such a fragile, breakable thing? It must be so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>27</p><p>THE LETTER COMES ON A Tuesday, but I don\u2019t see it until Wednesday morning before school. I\u2019m at the kitchen window seat, eating an apple, going through the stack of mail while I wait for Peter to pick me up. Electric bill, cable bill, a Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog, Kitty\u2019s issue of this month\u2019s Dog Fancy (For Kids!). And then a letter, in a white envelope, addressed to me. A boy\u2019s handwriting. A return address I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Dear Lara Jean,</p><p>A tree fell in our driveway last week and Mr. Barber of Barber Landscaping came by to haul it away. The Barbers are the family who moved into our old house in Meadowridge, and not to overstate, but they own a landscaping company. Mr. Barber brought your letter. I saw on the postmark you sent it way back in September, but I only just got it this week, because it was sent to my old house. That\u2019s why it took me so long to write back.</p> <p>Your letter made me remember all kinds of stuff I thought I\u2019d forgotten. Like that time your older sister made peanut brittle in the microwave and you guys decided we should have a break-dancing contest for who got the biggest piece. Or the time I got locked out of my house one afternoon and I went to the tree house and you and I just read until it got really dark and we had to use a flashlight. I remember your neighbor was grilling hamburgers and you dared me to go ask for one for us to share, but I was too chicken. When I went home I was in so much trouble because no one knew where I was, but it was worth it.</p><p>I stop reading. I remember that day we both got locked out! It was Chris and John and me, and then Chris had to leave and it was just John and me. My dad had been at a seminar; I don\u2019t remember where Margot and Kitty were. We got so hungry, we tore into the bag of Skittles that Trevor had stashed under a loose floorboard. I suppose I could have gone to Josh\u2019s for food and shelter, but there was something fun in being vagabonds with John Ambrose McClaren. It was like we were runaways.</p><p>I have to tell you, your letter blew me away, because when I was thirteen, I was still such a little kid, and here you were this actual person with complex thoughts and emotions. My mom still cut my apple up for me for afternoon snack. If I had written a letter to you in eighth grade it would have said, your hair is pretty. That\u2019s it. Just, your hair is pretty. I was so clueless. I had no idea you liked me back then.</p><p>A few months ago I saw you at a Model UN scrimmage at Thomas Jefferson. I doubt you recognized me, but I was there representing the Republic of China. You dropped off a note for me and I called your name but you kept walking. I tried to find you later, but you were gone. Did you see me?</p><p>I guess what I\u2019m most curious about is why you decided to send me the letter after all this time. So if you want to call me, or email me, or write me, please do.</p> <p>Yours truly, John</p><p>PS. Since you asked\u2014the only people that call me Johnny are my mom and my grandma, but feel free.</p><p>I let out a long sigh.</p><p>In middle school John Ambrose McClaren and I had all of two \u201cromantic\u201d encounters\u2014the spin-the-bottle kiss, which honestly wasn\u2019t the least bit romantic, and that day in the rain during gym, which up until this year was the most romantic moment of my life. I\u2019m sure John doesn\u2019t remember it that way. I doubt he remembers it at all. To get this letter from him, after all this time, it\u2019s like he\u2019s come back from the dead. It feels different from seeing him for those few seconds at Model UN in December. That was like seeing a ghost. This is a real, living person I used to know, who used to know me.</p><p>John was smart; he made the best grades of the boys, and I made the best grades of the girls. We were in honors classes together. He liked history best\u2014he always did his readings\u2014but he was good at math and science, too. I\u2019m sure that hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p>If Peter was the last boy in our grade to get tall, John was the first. I liked his yellow hair, sunny and fair like white summer corn. He was innocent and sweet-cheeked, he had the face of a boy who\u2019d never been in trouble, and the neighborhood mothers loved him best. He just had this look about him. That\u2019s what made him such a good partner in crime. He and Peter used to get into all kinds of mischief together. John was the clever one, he had the great ideas, but he was a little bit shy to talk because he used to have a stutter.</p> <p>He liked to play a supporting role, whereas Peter loved to be the star. So everyone always gave the credit, and the blame, to Peter, because he was the scamp and how could an angel like John Ambrose McClaren really be to blame for anything? Not that there was even much blame. People are so charmed by beautiful boys. Beautiful boys get an indulgent shake of the head and an \u201cOh, Peter,\u201d not even a slap on the wrist. Our English teacher Ms. Holt used to call them Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which none of us had ever heard of. Peter convinced her to show the movie to us in class one day, and then they argued all year over who got to be Butch and who had to be the Sundance Kid, even though it was very clear to everyone who was who.</p><p>I bet all the girls at his school like him. When I saw him at the Model UN scrimmage, he looked so assured, the way he sat tall in his seat, shoulders squared, utterly focused. If I went to John\u2019s school, I bet I would be right there at the front of the pack, with binoculars and a granola bar, camping out at his locker. I\u2019d have his schedule memorized; I\u2019d know his lunch by heart. Does he still eat double-decker peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on whole wheat bread? I wonder. There are so many things I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Peter\u2019s car honking out front is what shakes me out of my reverie. I jump guiltily at the sound. I have this crazy impulse to hide the letter, to tuck it away in my hatbox for safekeeping and never think about it again. But then I think, no, that would be crazy. Of course I\u2019ll write John Ambrose McClaren back. It would be rude not to.</p><p>So I tuck the letter in my bag, throw on my white puffer coat, and run outside to Peter\u2019s car. There\u2019s still a bit of snow on the ground from the last storm, but it looks shabby, like a threadbare rug. I\u2019m an all-or-nothing kind of girl when it comes to weather, I\u2019d much rather it all melt away or have feet and feet of snow, so deep your knees sink in.</p><p>When I get in Peter\u2019s car, he\u2019s texting on his phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just Gen. She wanted me to give her a ride, but I told her we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My skin prickles. It rankles that they still text so much, that they\u2019re in such easy contact, enough to ask for rides. But they\u2019re friends, just friends. That\u2019s what I keep telling myself. And he\u2019s telling me the truth, just like we promised we would. \u201cGuess who I got a letter from.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He backs out of the driveway. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . Margot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would that be surprising? No, not Margot. John Ambrose McClaren!\u201d</p> <p>Peter just looks confused. \u201cMcClaren? Why would he write you a letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wrote him one, remember? Same as I did to you. There were five love letters, and his was the only letter that never came back. I thought it was lost forever, but then a tree fell in John\u2019s driveway after this last ice storm, and Mr. Barber came to haul it away and he brought the letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Barber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the man who bought John\u2019s old house. He owns a landscaping company\u2014that\u2019s all beside the point, anyway. The point is, John only just got my letter last week; that\u2019s why it took him so long to write back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Peter says, messing with the heating vents. \u201cSo he wrote you an actual letter? Not an email?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it was a real letter that came in the mail.\u201d I watch to see if he is jealous, to see if this new development gets under his skin even a little.</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Peter says again. The second hm is bored-sounding, noncommittal. Not the slightest bit jealous. \u201cHow is the Sundance Kid anyway?\u201d He snickers. \u201cMcClaren used to hate when I called him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I say. We\u2019re at the stoplight; there\u2019s a line to get into school.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d the letter say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, just \u2018how are you,\u2019 the usual sort of things.\u201d I look out the window. I\u2019m feeling a bit stingy about sharing extra information because his ho-hum reaction hasn\u2019t merited any. Doesn\u2019t he have the decency to at least act like he cares?</p><p>Peter drums his fingers on the steering wheel. \u201cWe should hang out with him sometime.\u201d</p> <p>The thought of Peter and John Ambrose McClaren in the same space together again is discomfiting. Where would I even look? Vaguely I say, \u201cHmm, maybe.\u201d Perhaps bringing up the letter wasn\u2019t such a great idea.</p><p>\u201cI think he still has my old baseball glove,\u201d he muses. \u201cHey, did he say anything about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Like did he ask what I was up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Peter\u2019s mouth turns down into a miffed sort of expression. \u201cWhat\u2019d you write him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got it! I haven\u2019t had time to write anything back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I say hey when you do,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. I feel around in my bag to make sure the letter is still in there.</p><p>\u201cSo, wait, if you sent a love letter to five of us, does that mean you liked us all equally?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me with expectant eyes, and I know he thinks I\u2019m going to say I liked him best, but that wouldn\u2019t be true. \u201cYes, I liked you all exactly the same,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cBullshit! Who\u2019d you like best? Me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really impossible question to answer, Peter. I mean, it\u2019s all relative. I could say I liked Josh best, because I liked him longest, but you can\u2019t judge who you love the most by how long you love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou definitely said \u2018love.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I meant \u2018like.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about McClaren?\u201d he asks. \u201cHow much did you like him in comparison to the rest of us?\u201d</p><p>Finally! A little jealousy at last. \u201cI liked him . . .\u201d I\u2019m about to say \u201cthe same,\u201d but I hesitate. According to Stormy, no one can ever like anyone exactly the same. But how can you possibly quantify how much you like a person, much less two? Peter always has to be liked the best. He expects it. So I just say, \u201cIt\u2019s unknowable. But I like you best now.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s never had a boyfriend before, you really know how to work a guy.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. I know how to work a guy? That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard that in my life. Genevieve, Chris, they know how to work guys. Not me. Never me.</p><p>28</p><p>Dear John(ny),</p><p>First of all, thanks for writing me back. That was a really nice surprise. Second of all . . . the story behind the letter. I wrote you that letter in eighth grade, but I never meant for you to see it. It sounds crazy, I know, it was just a thing I used to do\u2014when I liked a boy, I\u2019d write the letter and then I\u2019d hide it away in my hatbox. The letters were just for me. But then my little sister Kitty\u2014remember her? Scrawny and willful?\u2014 sent them all out back in September, including yours.</p><p>I do remember that break-dancing contest. I think Peter won. He would\u2019ve taken the biggest piece of peanut brittle either way, though! This is random but do you remember how he used to always take the last piece of pizza? So annoying. Do you remember how he and Trevor got into a fight over it and they ended up dropping the pizza and nobody got to have it? Do you remember how all of us went to your house to say good-bye when you moved? I made a chocolate cake with chocolate peanut butter frosting, and I brought a knife but your forks and plates were all packed up, so we ate it on the front porch with our hands. When I got home, I realized that the corners of my mouth were stained brown from the chocolate. I was so embarrassed. It feels like such a long time ago.</p><p>I\u2019m not in Model UN but I was there that day and I did see you. Actually, I had a feeling you might be there because I remembered how into Model UN you were in middle school. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t stick around so we could catch up. I think I was just startled because it had been so long. You looked the same to me too. Much taller, though.</p><p>I have a favor to ask\u2014would you mind sending me back my letter? The other ones have found their way back to me, and though I\u2019m sure it will be excruciating, I\u2019d really like to know what I said.</p><p>Your friend, Lara Jean</p><p>29</p><p>IT\u2019S LATE, AND ALL THE lights are off at my house. Daddy\u2019s at the hospital; Kitty\u2019s at a sleepover. I can tell Peter wants to come inside, but my dad will be home soon and he might be freaked out if he gets home and it\u2019s just the two of us alone in the house so late. Daddy hasn\u2019t said anything in so many words, but since the video, something shifted just the tiniest fraction. Now when I go out with Peter, Daddy oh-so-casually asks what time I\u2019ll be home, where we\u2019ll be. He never used to ask those kinds of questions, though I suppose he never had much reason to before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look over at Peter, who has turned off the ignition. Suddenly I say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go up to Carolyn Pearce\u2019s old tree house?\u201d</p><p>Readily, he agrees. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s dark outside; I\u2019ve never been up here in such darkness. There was always a light on from the Pearces\u2019 kitchen or garage or from our house. Peter climbs up first and then shines his phone flashlight down on me as I make my way up.</p><p>He marvels at how, inside, nothing\u2019s changed. It\u2019s just like we left it. Kitty never had much interest in coming up here. It\u2019s just been sort of abandoned since we stopped using it in eighth grade. \u201cWe\u201d was the neighborhood kids my age: Genevieve, Allie Feldman, sometimes Chris, sometimes the boys\u2014Peter, John Ambrose McClaren, Trevor. It was just a private place; we weren\u2019t doing anything bad like smoke or drink. We\u2019d sit up there and talk.</p> <p>Genevieve was always thinking up games of Who Would You Choose. If we were on a deserted island, which of us here would you choose? Peter picked Genevieve without hesitation, because she was his girlfriend. Chris said she\u2019d pick Trevor because he was the meatiest and also the most obnoxious, and who knew if at some point she\u2019d have to resort to cannibalism. I said I\u2019d pick Chris because I\u2019d never get bored. Chris liked that; Genevieve frowned at me, but she\u2019d already been picked once. And besides, it was true: Chris would be the funner island companion, and probably more helpful around the island. I doubted Genevieve would help gather firewood or spear a fish. John took a long time to decide. He went around the circle, weighing all of our merits. Peter was a fast runner, Trevor was strong, Genevieve was crafty, Chris could handle herself in a fight, and for me he said I would never give up hope of being rescued. So he picked me.</p><p>It was the last summer we spent outside. Just, every day was outside. As you grow up, you spend less and less time outside. Nobody can say \u201cGo play outside\u201d anymore to you. But that summer we did. It was the hottest summer in a hundred years, they said. We spent most of it on bikes, at the pool. We played games.</p><p>Peter sits down on the floor and takes off his coat and spreads it out like a blanket. \u201cYou can sit here.\u201d</p><p>I sit down, and he pulls me toward him by my ankles, reeling me in carefully like a big fish that might jump off the line. When we\u2019re knees to knees, he kisses me: soft-lipped, we have all the time in the world kisses. I\u2019m shaking, but not from the cold. I feel jittery heart-palpitations kind of nerves. Peter bends his head and starts kissing my neck, making his way down to my collarbone. I\u2019m so keyed up, it doesn\u2019t even tickle the way it normally does when someone touches my neck. His mouth is warm, and it feels nice. I fall back against my hands, and he moves over me. Is this it? Is this when it\u2019s supposed to happen? On the floor of Carolyn Pearce\u2019s tree house?</p><p>When his hand moves under my blouse, but still over my bra, a panicky thought leaps into my head, one I haven\u2019t thought before\u2014Genevieve\u2019s boobs are definitely bigger than mine. Will he be disappointed?</p> <p>Suddenly I blurt out, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>His head jerks up in alarm. \u201cGod, Lara Jean! You scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just wanted to make that clear, in case it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was clear.\u201d Peter flashes a hurt look at me and sits up, his back ramrod straight. \u201cI\u2019m not some caveman. Damn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. I sit up and fix my necklace so the heart is in front. \u201cJust . . . I hope you weren\u2019t thinking that because you gave me this beautiful necklace, that . . .\u201d I stop talking because he\u2019s glaring at me. \u201cSorry, sorry. But . . . do you miss sex? Since you and Genevieve used to do it all the time, I mean?\u201d We\u2019ve all heard the stories about Kavinsky and Gen\u2019s sex life, how they did it in Steve Bledell\u2019s parents\u2019 bedroom at his last-day-of-school party, how she went on the pill in ninth grade. How can someone who\u2019s used to having sex 24/7 be content with someone like me, a virgin who\u2019s so far barely been to second base with him? Not content. \u201cContent\u201d is the wrong word. Happy.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do it all the time! I don\u2019t want to talk about this with you. It\u2019s too weird.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, since I\u2019ve never done it, but you\u2019ve done it a lot, is that, like, a void in your life? Do you maybe feel like . . . like you\u2019re missing out? Is it, like, if I never had an ice cream sundae, so I don\u2019t know how good it is, but then I finally try one and I\u2019m craving it all the time?\u201d I chew on my bottom lip. \u201cAre you . . . craving it all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe honest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I wish we were having sex? I mean, okay, yes. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to pressure you. I\u2019ve never even brought it up! And it\u2019s not like guys don\u2019t have other ways of . . .\u201d He goes red. \u201cOf release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . do you look at porn, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a naturally inquisitive personality! You know that about me. You used to answer all my questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before. Now it\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes Peter can say the most insightful thing and not even realize he\u2019s said it. Things are different. They were easier before. Before sex was ever up for discussion.</p><p>Haltingly I say, \u201cIn the contract we said we\u2019d always tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019m not talking to you about porn.\u201d I start to ask another question and Peter adds, \u201cAll I\u2019ll say about it is, any guy that says he never looks at porn is a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do.\u201d I nod to myself. Okay. Good to know. \u201cYou know those statistics people are always spouting off, about teenage boys thinking about sex every seven seconds? Is that really true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And I just want to point out that you\u2019re the one who keeps bringing up sex. I think teenage girls might be more obsessed than boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, and his eyes widen, all excited. Hastily I add, \u201cI mean, I\u2019m definitely curious about it. It\u2019s definitely a thought. But I don\u2019t see myself doing it anytime soon. With anybody. Including you.\u201d</p><p>I can tell Peter is embarrassed, the way he rushes to say, \u201cOkay, okay, I got it. Let\u2019s just change the subject.\u201d Under his breath he mutters, \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to talk about it in the first place.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s sweet that he\u2019s embarrassed. I didn\u2019t think he would be, with all his experience. I tug on his sweater sleeve. \u201cAt some point, when I\u2019m ready, if I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d And then I pull him toward me and press my lips against his softly. His mouth opens, and so does mine, and I think, I could kiss this boy for hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mid-kiss, he says, \u201cWait, so we\u2019re never having sex? Like ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say never. But not now. I mean, not until I\u2019m really, really sure. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a laugh. \u201cSure. You\u2019re the one driving this bus. You have been from the start. I\u2019m still catching up.\u201d He snuggles closer and sniffs my hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s this new shampoo you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stole it from Margot. It\u2019s juicy pear. Nice, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, I guess. But can you go back to the one you used to wear? The coconut one? I love the smell of that one.\u201d A dreamy look crosses his face, like evening fog settling over a city.</p><p>\u201cIf I feel like it,\u201d I say, which makes him pout. I\u2019m already thinking I should buy a bottle of the coconut hair mask, too, but I like to keep him on his toes. Like he said, I\u2019m the one driving this bus. Peter pulls me against him so he\u2019s curved around my back like shelter. I let my head rest on his shoulder, rest my arms on his kneecaps. This is nice. This is cozy. Just me and him, just for a while, apart from the rest of the world.</p><p>We\u2019re sitting there like that when suddenly I remember something, an important something. The time capsule. John Ambrose McClaren\u2019s grandmother gave it to him for his birthday in seventh grade. He\u2019d asked for a video game, but the time capsule was what he got. He said he was going to throw it away, but then he thought one of us girls might want it. I said I wanted it, and then Genevieve said she wanted it, so of course Chris chimed in too. And then I had the idea to bury it right there in the Pearces\u2019 backyard under the tree house. I got really excited and said everybody needed to put in something that they had on them at that very moment. I said we should come back the day we graduate from high school and open it up and reminisce.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that time capsule we buried?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah! McClaren\u2019s. Let\u2019s dig it up!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t open it without everybody else,\u201d I say. \u201cRemember, we were going to do it after high school graduation?\u201d This was when I still thought we\u2019d all be friends. \u201cYou, me, John, Trevor, Chris, Allie.\u201d I don\u2019t say Genevieve\u2019s name.</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t appear to notice. \u201cAll right, then we\u2019ll wait. Whatever my girl wants.\u201d</p><p>30</p><p>Dear Lara Jean,</p><p>I will give you your letter back on one condition. You have to make a solemn unbreakable vow that you will return it to me after you\u2019re done reading it. I need physical proof that a girl liked me in middle school, otherwise who would ever believe it?</p><p>And for what it\u2019s worth, that peanut butter chocolate cake you baked was the best I ever ate. I never had another cake quite like that one, with my name written in Reese\u2019s Pieces. I still think about it sometimes. A guy doesn\u2019t forget a cake like that.</p> <p>I have one question for you. How many letters did you write? Just wondering how special I should feel.</p><p>John</p><p>Dear John,</p><p>I, Lara Jean, hereby make a solemn vow\u2014nay, an unbreakable vow\u2014to return my letter to you, intact and unchanged. Now give me my letter back!</p><p>Also you\u2019re such a liar. You know very well that plenty of girls liked you in middle school. At sleepovers, girls would be like, are you Team Peter or Team John? Don\u2019t pretend like you didn\u2019t know that, Johnny!</p><p>And to answer your question\u2014there were five letters. Five meaningful boys in my whole life history. Though, now that I\u2019m writing it down, five sounds like a lot, considering the fact that I\u2019m only sixteen. I wonder how many there\u2019ll have been by the time I\u2019m twenty! There\u2019s this lady at the nursing home I volunteer at, and she\u2019s had so many husbands and lived so many lives. I look at her and I think, she must not have even one regret, because she\u2019s done and seen it all.</p><p>Did I tell you my older sister Margot\u2019s all the way in Scotland, at St. Andrews? It\u2019s where Prince William and Kate Middleton met. Maybe she\u2019ll meet a prince, too, haha! Where do you want to go to college? Do you know what you want to study? I think I want to stay in state. Virginia has great public schools and it\u2019ll be much cheaper, but I guess the main reason is I\u2019m very close to my family and I don\u2019t want to be too-too far away. I used to think I might want to go to UVA and live at home, but now I\u2019m thinking dorms are the way to go for a true college experience.</p><p>Don\u2019t forget to send back my letter, Lara Jean</p> <p>Daddy\u2019s at the hospital, but he\u2019s made a big pot of oatmeal, a vat of it like you see in a soup kitchen. By this time it\u2019s gummy and I have to put half a bottle of maple syrup and dried cherries on mine to make it palatable, and even then I\u2019m not sure if I like oatmeal. I make a bowl for me with some chopped-up pecans on top, and a bowl with just honey on top for Kitty. \u201cHave some gruel,\u201d I call out. She\u2019s in front of the TV, of course.</p><p>We sit on stools at the breakfast bar and eat our gruel. I will say there is something satisfying about it, the way it sticks to your insides like paste. As I eat, I keep my eyes toward the window.</p><p>Kitty snaps her fingers in my face. \u201cHello! I asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the mail come yet?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe mailman doesn\u2019t come until after twelve on Saturdays,\u201d Kitty says, licking honey off her spoon. Eyeing me she says, \u201cWhy have you been so excited about the mail all week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for a letter,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cFrom who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . no one important.\u201d A rookie mistake. I should\u2019ve made up a name, because Kitty\u2019s eyes narrow, and now she\u2019s really interested.</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t someone important, you wouldn\u2019t be so gaga looking out the window for it. Who\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you must know, it\u2019s actually a letter from me. One of those love letters of mine you sent out.\u201d I reach across the table and pinch her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s coming back my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the boy with the funny name. Ambrose. What kind of name is Ambrose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember him at all? He used to live on our street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had yellow hair,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cHe had a skateboard. He let me play with it once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like him,\u201d I say, remembering. Of all the boys, he had the most patience with Kitty, even though she was a pain.</p><p>\u201cStop smiling,\u201d Kitty commands. \u201cYou already have a boyfriend. You don\u2019t need two.\u201d</p><p>My smile slips. \u201cWe\u2019re just writing letters, Kitty. Also don\u2019t snap at me.\u201d I lean in to give her another pinch, and she jumps up before I can. \u201cWhat are you going to do today?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMs. Rothschild said she\u2019d take me and Jamie to the dog park,\u201d Kitty says, putting her dirty bowl in the sink. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go over and remind her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging out with her a lot lately.\u201d Kitty shrugs and gently I say, \u201cJust don\u2019t become a nuisance, all right? I mean, she\u2019s like, forty; she might have other things she wants to be doing with her Saturday. Like go to a winery or a spa. She doesn\u2019t need you harassing her about dating our dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Rothschild loves hanging out with me, so keep your little opinions to yourself.\u201d</p><p>I frown at her. \u201cSeriously, you have such bad manners, Kitty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlame my manners on you and Margot and Daddy, then. You\u2019re the ones who raised me this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess nothing will ever be your fault in life because of the shoddy way you were raised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>I let out a scream of frustration, and Kitty skips off, humming to herself, pleased as punch to have annoyed me.</p><p>Dear Lara Jean,</p> <p>For the record, the only reason girls ever paid me any attention was because I was Peter\u2019s best friend. It\u2019s why Sabrina Fox asked me to be her date to the eighth grade formal! She even tried to sit next to Peter at Red Lobster before the dance.</p><p>As for college, my dad went to UNC, so he\u2019s really pushing for that. He says I have tar in my blood. My mom wants me to stay in state. I haven\u2019t told anyone this, but I really want to go to Georgetown. Knock on wood. Studying for the SATs as we speak.</p><p>Anyway . . . here\u2019s your letter back. Don\u2019t forget your promise. I\u2019m really enjoying writing letters back and forth, but can I also have your phone number? You\u2019re pretty hard to find online.</p><p>My very first thought is: He hasn\u2019t seen the video. He can\u2019t possibly have! Not if he\u2019s saying I\u2019m so hard to find online. I suppose deep down I must have been worrying about it, because I feel so relieved to know for certain. What a comfort, to know that he can still have a certain idea of me in his head, the same as I have of him. And truly, John Ambrose McClaren isn\u2019t the type of boy to look at Anonybitch. Not the John Ambrose McClaren I remember.</p><p>I look back down at the letter, and there, at the bottom, is his phone number.</p><p>I blink. Letters were harmless enough, but if John and I started talking on the phone, would that be a betrayal of sorts? Is there even a difference between texting and letter writing? One is more immediate. But the act of writing a letter, of selecting paper and pen, addressing the envelope, finding a stamp, let alone putting pen to paper . . . it\u2019s far more deliberate. My cheeks heat up. It\u2019s more . . . romantic. A letter is something to keep.</p> <p>Speaking of which . . . I unfold the second piece of paper in the envelope. It\u2019s creased, a stationery I recognize well. Thick creamy paper with LJSC engraved in navy at the top. A birthday gift from my dad because of my delight in anything monogrammed.</p><p>Dear John Ambrose McClaren,</p><p>I know the exact day it all started. Fall, eighth grade. We got caught in the rain when we had to put all the softball bats away after gym. We started to run back to the building, and I couldn\u2019t run as fast as you, so you stopped and grabbed my bag too. It was even better than if you\u2019d grabbed my hand. I still remember the way you looked\u2014your T-shirt was stuck to your back, your hair wet like you just came out of the shower. When it started to pour, you whooped and hollered like a little kid. There was this moment\u2014you looked back at me, and your grin was as wide as your face. You said, \u201cCome on, LJ!\u201d</p><p>It was right then. That\u2019s when I knew, all the way down to my soaking-wet Keds. I love you, John Ambrose McClaren. I really love you. I might have loved you for all of high school. I think you might have loved me back. If only you weren\u2019t moving away, John! It\u2019s so unfair when people move away. It\u2019s like their parents just decide something and no one else gets a say in it. Not that I even deserve a say\u2014I\u2019m not your girlfriend or anything. But you at least deserve a say.</p><p>I was really hoping that one day I would get to call you Johnny. Your mom came to get you after school once, and a bunch of us were hanging out on the front steps. And you didn\u2019t see her car, so she honked and called out, \u201cJohnny!\u201d I loved the sound of that. Johnny. One day, I bet your girlfriend will call you Johnny. She\u2019s really lucky. Maybe you already have a girlfriend right now. If you do, know this\u2014once upon a time in Virginia, a girl loved you.</p><p>I\u2019m going to say it just this once, since you\u2019ll never hear it anyway. Good-bye, Johnny.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Lara Jean</p> <p>I let out a scream, so loud and so piercing that Jamie barks in alarm. \u201cSorry,\u201d I whisper, falling back against my pillows.</p><p>I cannot believe that John Ambrose McClaren read that letter. I didn\u2019t remember it to be so . . . naked. With so much . . . yearning. God, why do I have to be a person who yearns so much? How horrible. How perfectly horrible. I\u2019ve never been naked in front of a boy before, but now I feel like I have. I can\u2019t bear to look at it again, to even think about it. I scramble up and stuff it back inside the envelope and push it under my bed so it no longer exists. Out of sight, out of mind.</p><p>Obviously John won\u2019t be getting this letter back. In fact I don\u2019t know if I should write him back at all. Things feel . . . altered, somehow.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten that letter, how ardently I longed for him. How certain I was, how absolutely certain I believed we were meant to be, if only. The memory of that belief shakes me up; it leaves me feeling unsettled and even uncertain. Unmoored. What was it about him, I wonder, that made me so sure?</p><p>Strangely, there\u2019s no mention of Peter in my letter. In the letter I say I started liking him in the fall of eighth grade. I liked Peter in eighth grade too, so there was a definite crossover. When did one begin and the other end?</p><p>The one person who would know is the one person I could never ask.</p><p>She is the one who foretold that I would like John.</p><p>Genevieve slept over at my house most nights that summer. Allie was only allowed to sleep over on special occasions, so it was usually just the two of us. We\u2019d go over what happened that day with the boys, every detail. \u201cThis is going to be our crew,\u201d she said to me one night, her lips barely moving. We were doing Korean face masks my grandma had sent, the kind that look like ski masks, and drip with \u201cessence\u201d and vitamins and spa-like things. \u201cThis is what high school is going to be like. It\u2019ll be me and Peter and you and McClaren, and Chrissy and Allie can share Trevor. We\u2019ll all be power couples.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut John and I don\u2019t like each other like that,\u201d I said, teeth clenched to keep my face mask from shifting.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d she said. She said it like it was a preordained fact, and I believed her. I always believed her.</p><p>But none of it came to be, except for the Gen and Peter part.</p><p>31</p> <p>LUCAS AND I ARE SITTING cross-legged in the hallway, sharing a strawberry-shortcake ice cream bar. \u201cStick to your side,\u201d he reminds me as I lower my head for another bite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who bought it!\u201d I remind him. \u201cLucas . . . do you think it\u2019s cheating to write letters to someone? Not me, I\u2019m asking for a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas says. He raises both eyebrows. \u201cWait, are they sexy letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they the kind of letter you wrote me?\u201d</p> <p>A meek little \u201cno\u201d from me. He gives me a look like he isn\u2019t buying whatever I\u2019m selling. \u201cThen you\u2019re fine. Technically you\u2019re in the clear. So who are you writing to?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cDo you remember John Ambrose McClaren?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cOf course I remember John Ambrose McClaren. I had a crush on him in seventh grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a crush on him in eighth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. We all did. In middle school you either liked John or you liked Peter. Those were the two main choices. Like Betty and Veronica. Obviously John is Betty and Peter\u2019s Veronica.\u201d He pauses. \u201cRemember how John used to have that really endearing stutter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I mourned it a little when it went away. It was so sweet. So boyish. And do you remember how his hair was the color of pale butter? Like, the way I bet freshly churned butter looks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was more like moonlit corn silk, but yeah. So how did he turn out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. . . . It\u2019s strange because there\u2019s the him I remember from middle school, and that\u2019s just my memory of him, but then there\u2019s the him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you guys ever go out back then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no! Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s probably why you\u2019re curious about him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was curious.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gives me a look. \u201cYou basically did. I don\u2019t blame you. I\u2019d be curious too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to think about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cLucky how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky that you have . . . options. I mean, I\u2019m not officially \u2018out,\u2019 but even if I was, there are, like, two gay guys at our school. Mark Weinberger, who\u2019s a pizza face, and Leon Butler.\u201d Lucas shudders.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Leon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me by asking. I just wish our school was bigger. There\u2019s nobody for me here.\u201d He stares off into space moodily. Sometimes I look at Lucas and for a second I forget he\u2019s gay and I want to like him all over again.</p><p>I touch his hand. \u201cOne day soon you\u2019ll be in the world, and you\u2019ll have so many options you won\u2019t know what to do with them. Everyone will fall in love with you, because you\u2019re so beautiful and so charming, and you\u2019ll look back on high school as such a tiny blip.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiles, and his moodiness lifts away. \u201cI won\u2019t forget you, though.\u201d</p><p>32</p><p>\u201cTHE PEARCES FINALLY SOLD THEIR house,\u201d Daddy says, heaping more spinach salad on Kitty\u2019s plate. \u201cWe\u2019ll have new backyard neighbors in a month.\u201d</p><p>Kitty perks up. \u201cDo they have kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonnie says they\u2019re retired.\u201d</p><p>Kitty makes a gagging noise. \u201cOld people. Boring! Do they have grandkids, at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, but I don\u2019t think so. They\u2019re probably going to take down that old tree house.\u201d</p><p>I stop mid-chew. \u201cThey\u2019re demolishing our tree house?\u201d</p><p>Daddy nods. \u201cI think they\u2019re putting in a gazebo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gazebo!\u201d I repeat. \u201cWe used to have so much fun up there. Genevieve and I would play Rapunzel for hours. She always got to be Rapunzel, though. I just got to stand underneath it and call up\u201d\u2014I pause to put on my best English accent\u2014\u201cRapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of accent is that supposed to be?\u201d Kitty asks me.</p><p>\u201cCockney, I think. Why? Was it not good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I turn to Daddy. \u201cWhen are they tearing the tree house down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d imagine before they move in, but you never know.\u201d</p><p>There was this one time I looked out the window and saw that John McClaren was up in the tree house alone. He was just sitting by himself, reading. So I went out there with a couple of Cokes and a book and we read up there all afternoon. Later in the day Peter and Trevor Pike showed up, and we put the books away and played cards. At the time I was deep in the throes of liking Peter, so it wasn\u2019t romantic in the slightest, of that I\u2019m sure. But I do remember feeling that our quiet afternoon had been disrupted, that I\u2019d rather have just kept reading in companionable silence.</p><p>\u201cWe buried a time capsule under that tree house,\u201d I tell Kitty as I squeeze toothpaste onto my toothbrush. \u201cGenevieve, Peter, Chris, Allie, Trevor, me, and John Ambrose McClaren. We were going to dig it up after we graduated high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have a time capsule party before they demolish the tree house,\u201d Kitty says from the toilet. She\u2019s peeing and I\u2019m brushing my teeth. \u201cYou can send invitations and it can be a fun little thing. An unveiling.\u201d</p><p>I spit out toothpaste. \u201cI mean, in theory. But Allie moved, and Genevieve is a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitch with a b,\u201d she supplies.</p><p>I giggle. \u201cDefinitely a witch with a b.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scary. One time when I was little, she locked me in the towel closet!\u201d Kitty flushes the toilet and gets up. \u201cYou can still have a party, just don\u2019t invite Genevieve. It doesn\u2019t make sense for you to invite your boyfriend\u2019s ex-girlfriend to a time capsule party anyway.\u201d</p><p>As if there were some set etiquette for who to invite to a time capsule party! As if there were really such a thing as a time capsule party! \u201cI got you out of the closet right away,\u201d I remind her. I set my toothbrush back down. \u201cWash your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd brush your teeth.\u201d Before Kitty can open her mouth, I say, \u201cDon\u2019t say you were going to, because I know you weren\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kitty will do anything to get out of brushing her teeth.</p><p>We can\u2019t just let this tree house go without a proper send-off. It wouldn\u2019t be right. We always said we\u2019d come back. I will have a party, and it will be themed. Genevieve would sneer at that, how babyish\u2014but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m inviting her, so who cares what she thinks. It will just be Peter, Chris, Trevor, and . . . John. I\u2019ll have to invite John. As friends, just friends.</p><p>What did we eat that summer? Cheez Doodles. Melty ice cream sandwiches\u2014the chocolate wafer would stick to our fingers. Lukewarm Hawaiian Punch flowed freely. Capri Suns when we could get them. John always had a double-decker peanut butter and jelly sandwich with him in a ziplock bag that his mother packed. I\u2019ll be sure to have all of those snacks for the party.</p><p>What else? Trevor had portable speakers he used to carry around. His dad was big into Southern rock, and that summer Trevor played \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d so much that Peter threw his speakers out of the tree house and Trevor wouldn\u2019t speak to him for days. Trevor Pike had brown hair that curled when it was wet, and he was chubby in the way that middle school boys are (in the cheeks, around the middle) right before they have a big growth spurt and everything sort of evens out. He was always hungry and hanging around other people\u2019s cupboards. He\u2019d have to go pee, and he\u2019d come back with a Popsicle or a banana, or cheese crackers, whatever he could scam. Trevor was Peter\u2019s number three. It went John and Peter and then Trevor. They don\u2019t hang out so much anymore. Trevor\u2019s more friends with the track guys. We don\u2019t have any classes together; I\u2019m in all honors and APs and Trevor was never that into school or grades. He was fun, though.</p> <p>I remember the day Genevieve showed up at my house crying, saying she was moving. Not far, she\u2019d still go to school with us, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to ride her bike or walk over anymore. Peter was sad; he comforted her, put his arms around her. I remember thinking how grown-up they seemed in that moment, like real teenagers in love. And then Chris and Gen had a fight about something, a bigger fight than usual; I don\u2019t even remember what it was about. I think something with their parents. Whenever their parents weren\u2019t getting along, things trickled down to them like trash floating down a river.</p><p>Gen moved away, and we were still friends, and then, around the time of the eighth grade dance, she dropped me. I guess there was no place for me in her life anymore. I thought Genevieve was someone I would know forever. Those people in your life that you just always know, no matter what. But it\u2019s not that way. Here we are, three years later, and we\u2019re worse than strangers. I know she took that video; I know she sent it to Anonybitch. How could I forgive that?</p><p>33</p><p>JOSH HAS A NEW GIRLFRIEND: Liza Booker, a girl from his comic-book club. She has frizzy brown hair, nice eyes, big boobs, braces. She\u2019s a senior like Josh, smart like Josh. I just can\u2019t believe he\u2019s with a girl who\u2019s not Margot. Next to my sister, Liza Booker\u2019s nice eyes and big boobs are nothing.</p><p>I kept seeing a car I didn\u2019t recognize in Josh\u2019s driveway, and then today, when I was getting the mail, she and Josh came out of the house and he walked her to her car and then he kissed her. Just like how he used to kiss Margot.</p> <p>I wait until she\u2019s driven away and he\u2019s about to walk back inside his house before I call out to him. \u201cSo you and Liza are a thing now, huh?\u201d</p><p>He turns around and at least looks sheepish. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hanging out, yes. It\u2019s not serious or anything. But I like her.\u201d Josh comes a few feet closer, so we\u2019re not so far apart.</p><p>I can\u2019t resist saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no accounting for taste. I mean, that you\u2019d pick her over Margot?\u201d I let out a huffy little laugh that surprises even me, because Josh and I are fine now\u2014not like before, but fine. It was a mean thing to say. But I\u2019m not saying it to be mean to Liza Booker, who I don\u2019t even know; I\u2019m saying it for my sister. For what she and Josh used to be to each other.</p><p>Quietly he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t pick Liza over Margot and you know it. Liza and I barely knew each other in January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, why not Margot then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t going to work out. I still care about her. I\u2019ll always love her. But she was right to break things off when she left. It would only have been harder if we\u2019d kept it going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been worth it just to see? To know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve ended the same way even if she hadn\u2019t gone to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>His face has that stubborn look to it; that weak chin of his is firmly set. I know he isn\u2019t going to say anything more: It isn\u2019t really my business, not truly. It\u2019s his and Margot\u2019s, and maybe he doesn\u2019t even fully know, himself.</p><p>34</p><p>CHRIS SHOWS UP AT MY house with ombr\u00e9 lavender hair. Pulling her jacket hood all the way off, she asks me, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty,\u201d I say.</p><p>Kitty mouths, Like an Easter egg.</p><p>\u201cI mostly did it to piss off my mom.\u201d There\u2019s the tiniest bit of uncertainty in her voice that she\u2019s trying to conceal.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes you look sophisticated,\u201d I tell her. I reach out and touch the ends, and her hair feels synthetic, like Barbie doll hair after it\u2019s been washed.</p><p>Kitty mouths, Like a grandma, and I cut my eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cDoes it look like shit?\u201d Chris asks her, chewing on her bottom lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cuss in front of my sister! She\u2019s ten!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Does it look like crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kitty admits. Thank God for Kitty\u2014you can always count on her to tell the hard truths. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just go to a salon and have them do it for you?\u201d</p><p>Chris starts running her fingers through her hair. \u201cI did.\u201d She exhales. \u201cShi\u2014I mean, crap. Maybe I should just cut off the bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always thought you would look great with short hair,\u201d I say. \u201cBut honestly, I don\u2019t think the lavender looks bad. It\u2019s kind of beautiful, actually. Like the inside of a seashell.\u201d If I was as gutsy as Chris, I\u2019d chop my hair off short like Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina. But I\u2019m not that brave, and also, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d feel immediate remorse for my ponytails and braids and curls.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Maybe I\u2019ll keep it for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try deep-conditioning it and see if that helps,\u201d Kitty suggests, and Chris glares at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a Korean hair mask my grandma bought me,\u201d I say, putting my arm around her.</p><p>We go upstairs, and Chris goes to my room while I root around in the bathroom for the hair mask. When I get back to my room with the jar, Chris is sitting cross-legged on the floor, sifting through my hatbox.</p><p>\u201cChris! That\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was out in the open!\u201d She holds up Peter\u2019s valentine, the poem he wrote me. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p> <p>Proudly I say, \u201cThat\u2019s a poem Peter wrote for me for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>Chris looks down at the paper again. \u201cHe said he wrote it? He\u2019s so full of shit. This is from an Edgar Allan Poe poem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Peter definitely wrote it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from that poem called \u2018Annabel Lee\u2019! We studied it in my remedial English class in middle school. I remember because we went to the Edgar Allan Poe museum, and then we went on a riverboat called the Annabel Lee. The poem was framed on the wall!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe this. \u201cBut . . . he told me he wrote it for me.\u201d</p> <p>She cackles. \u201cClassic Kavinsky.\u201d When Chris sees that I\u2019m not cackling with her, she says, \u201cEh, whatever. It\u2019s the thought that counts, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept it isn\u2019t his thought.\u201d I was so happy to receive that poem. No one had ever written me a love poem before, and now it turns out it was plagiarized. A knockoff.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be pissed. I think it\u2019s funny! Clearly he was trying to impress you.\u201d</p><p>I should\u2019ve known Peter didn\u2019t write it. He hardly ever reads in his spare time, much less writes poetry. \u201cWell, the necklace is real, at least,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I shoot her a dirty look.</p> <p>When Peter and I talk on the phone that night, I\u2019m all set to confront him about the poem, to at least tease him about it. But then we get to talking about his upcoming away game on Friday. \u201cYou\u2019re coming, right?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI want to, but I promised Stormy I\u2019d dye her hair on Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just do it on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, the time capsule party is on Saturday, and she has a date that night. That\u2019s why her hair needs to be done on Friday. . . .\u201d It sounds like a weak excuse, I know. But I promised. And also . . . I wouldn\u2019t be able to ride on the bus with Peter, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable driving forty-five minutes away to a school I\u2019ve never been to. He doesn\u2019t need me there anyway. Not like Stormy needs me.</p><p>He\u2019s silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to the next one, I promise,\u201d I say.</p><p>Peter bursts out, \u201cGabe\u2019s girlfriend comes to every single game and she paints his jersey number on her face every game day. She doesn\u2019t even go to our school!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere have only been four games and I\u2019ve gone to two!\u201d Now I\u2019m annoyed. I know lacrosse is important to him, but it\u2019s no less important than my commitments at Belleview. \u201cAnd you know what? I know you didn\u2019t write that poem for me on Valentine\u2019s Day. You copied it off of Edgar Allan Poe!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never said I wrote it,\u201d he hedges.</p><p>\u201cYes you did. You acted like you wrote it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to, but then you were so happy about it! Sorry for trying to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I was going to bake you lemon cookies on game day, and now I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to make it to your tree-house party on Saturday. I might be too tired from the game.\u201d</p><p>I gasp. \u201cYou\u2019d better be there!\u201d This party is small as it is, and Chris isn\u2019t the most reliable person. It can\u2019t just be me and Trevor and John. Three people does not a party make.</p><p>Peter makes a harrumph sound. \u201cWell, then I\u2019d better see some lemon cookies in my locker come game day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>On Friday I bring his lemon cookies and wear his jersey number on my cheek, which delights Peter. He grabs me and throws me in the air, and his smile is so big. It makes me feel guilty for not doing it sooner, because it took so very little on my part to make him happy. I can see now that it\u2019s the little things, the small efforts, that keep a relationship going. And I know now too that in some small measure I have the power to hurt him and also the power to make it better. This discovery leaves me with an unsettling, queer sort of feeling in my chest for reasons I can\u2019t explain.</p><p>35</p><p>I\u2019D WORRIED IT WOULD BE too cold for us to stay in the tree house for long, but it\u2019s unseasonably warm, so much so that Daddy starts on one of his rants about climate change, to the point where Kitty and I have to tune him out.</p><p>After his rant I get a shovel from the garage and set about digging under the tree. The ground is hard, and it takes me a while to get into a good groove digging, but I finally hit metal a couple of feet in. The time capsule\u2019s the size of a small cooler; it looks like a futuristic coffee thermos. The metal has eroded from the rain and snow and dirt, but not as much as you\u2019d think, considering it\u2019s been nearly four years. I take it back to the house and wash it in the sink so it gleams again.</p><p>Close to noon, I load up a shopping bag with ice cream sandwiches, Hawaiian Punch, and Cheez Doodles and take it all out to the tree house. I\u2019m crossing our backyard to the Pearces\u2019, trying to juggle the bag and the portable speakers and my phone, when I see John Ambrose McClaren standing in front of the tree house, staring up at it with his arms crossed. I\u2019d know the back of his blond head anywhere.</p><p>I freeze, suddenly nervous and unsure. I\u2019d thought Peter or Chris would be here with me when he arrived, and that would smooth out any awkwardness. But no such luck.</p><p>I put down all my stuff and move forward to tap him on the shoulder, but he turns around before I can. I take a step back. \u201cHi! Hey!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He takes a long look at me. \u201cIs it really you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pen pal the elusive Lara Jean Covey who shows up at Model UN and runs off without so much as a hello?\u201d</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I at least said hello.\u201d</p><p>Teasingly he says, \u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right: I didn\u2019t. I was too flustered. Kind of like right now. It must be that distance between knowing someone when you were a kid and seeing them now that you\u2019re both more grown-up, but still not all the way grown-up, and there are all these years and letters in between you, and you don\u2019t know how to act. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell\u2014anyway. You look . . . taller.\u201d He looks more than just taller. Now that I can take the time to really look at him, I notice more. With his fair hair and milky skin and rosy cheeks, he looks like he could be an English farmer\u2019s son. But he\u2019s slim, so maybe the sensitive farmer\u2019s son who steals away to the barn to read. The thought makes me smile, and John gives me a curious look but doesn\u2019t ask why.</p><p>With a nod, he says, \u201cYou look . . . exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>Gulp. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? \u201cI do?\u201d I get up on my tiptoes. \u201cI think I\u2019ve grown at least an inch since eighth grade.\u201d And my boobs are at least a little bigger. Not much. Not that I want John to notice\u2014I\u2019m just saying.</p><p>\u201cNo, you look . . . just like how I remembered you.\u201d John Ambrose reaches out, and I think he\u2019s trying to hug me but he\u2019s only trying to take my bag from me, and there\u2019s a brief but strange dance that mortifies me but he doesn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cSo thanks for inviting me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take this stuff up for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say.</p><p>John takes the bag from me and looks inside. \u201cOh, wow. All of our old snacks! Why don\u2019t you climb up first and I\u2019ll pass it to you.\u201d So that\u2019s what I do: I scramble up the ladder and he climbs up behind me. I\u2019m crouched, arms outstretched, waiting for him to pass me the bag.</p><p>But when he gets halfway up the ladder, he stops and looks up at me and says, \u201cYou still wear your hair in fancy braids.\u201d</p> <p>I touch my side braid. Of all the things to remember about me. Back then, Margot was the one who braided my hair. \u201cYou think it looks fancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like . . . expensive bread.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cBread!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Or . . . Rapunzel.\u201d</p><p>I get down on my stomach, wriggle over to the edge, and pretend like I\u2019m letting down my hair for him to climb. He climbs up to the top of the ladder and passes me the bag, which I take, and then he grins at me and gives my braid a tug. I\u2019m still lying down but feel an electric charge like he\u2019s zapped me. I\u2019m suddenly feeling very anxious about the worlds that will be colliding, the past and the present, a pen pal and a boyfriend, all in this little tree house. Probably I should have thought this through a bit better. But I was so focused on the time capsule, and the snacks, and the idea of it\u2014old friends coming back together to do what we said we\u2019d do. And now here we are, in it.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d John asks, offering me his hand as I rise to my feet.</p> <p>I don\u2019t take his hand; I don\u2019t want another zap. \u201cEverything\u2019s great,\u201d I say cheerily.</p><p>\u201cHey, you never sent back my letter,\u201d he says. \u201cYou broke an unbreakable vow.\u201d</p><p>I laugh awkwardly. I\u2019d kind of been hoping he wouldn\u2019t bring that up. \u201cIt was too embarrassing. The things I wrote. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of another person seeing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I already saw it,\u201d he reminds me.</p><p>Luckily, Chris and Trevor Pike show up and break up the conversation about the letter. They immediately tear into the snacks. Meanwhile Peter\u2019s late. I text him a stern You better be on your way. And then: Don\u2019t text back if you\u2019re driving. That\u2019s dangerous.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m texting again, Peter\u2019s head pops up in the door and he climbs inside. I\u2019m about to give him a hug, but then right behind him is Genevieve. My whole body goes cold.</p><p>I look from him to her. She sails right past me and sweeps John into a hug. \u201cJohnny!\u201d she squeals, and he laughs. I feel the sharp twist of envy in my stomach. Must every boy be charmed by her?</p><p>While she\u2019s hugging John, Peter\u2019s looking at me with pleading eyes. He mouths, Don\u2019t be mad, and he clasps his hands in prayer. I mouth back, What the hell, and he grimaces. I never explicitly said I wasn\u2019t inviting her, but I would have thought it was pretty clear. And then I think, Wait a minute. They came here together. He was with her and he never said a word to me about it, and then he brought her here, here, to my house. Specifically to my neighbors\u2019 tree house. This girl who has hurt me, hurt us both.</p> <p>Then Peter and John are hugging and high-fiving and slapping each other on the back, like old war buddies, long-lost brothers in arms. \u201cIt\u2019s been too fucking long, man,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>Genevieve is already unzipping her puffy white bomber jacket and making herself comfortable. Whatever fleeting moment there was for me to kick her and Peter both out of my neighbors\u2019 tree house is gone. \u201cHi, Chrissy,\u201d she says, smiling as she settles on the ground. \u201cNice hair.\u201d</p><p>Chris glares at her. \u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d I love that she says this\u2014I love her.</p><p>\u201cPeter and I were hanging out and he told me about what you guys were doing today.\u201d Shrugging out of her jacket, Genevieve says to me, \u201cI guess my invitation got lost in the mail.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t reply, because what can I say in front of all these people? I just hug my knees to my chest. Now that I\u2019m sitting next to her, I realize how small this tree house has become. There\u2019s hardly enough room for all the arms and legs, and the boys are so big now. Before, we were more or less the same size, boys and girls.</p><p>\u201cGod, was this place always so tiny?\u201d Genevieve says to no one in particular. \u201cOr did we all just get really big?\u201d She laughs. \u201cExcept you, Lara Jean. You\u2019re still itty-bitty pocket-sized.\u201d She says it sweetly. Like sweetened condensed milk. Sweet and condescending. Poured on super thick.</p><p>I play along: I smile. I won\u2019t let her get a rise out of me.</p><p>John rolls his eyes. \u201cSame old Gen.\u201d He says it dryly, with weary affection, and she smiles her cute wrinkly-nose smile at him like he\u2019s paid her a compliment. But then he looks at me and raises one sardonic eyebrow, and I feel better about everything, just like that. In a strange way, maybe her presence here completes the circle. She can take whatever\u2019s hers in that time capsule, and this history of ours can be done.</p><p>\u201cTrev, throw me an ice cream sandwich,\u201d Peter says, squeezing in between Genevieve and me. He stretches his legs out into the center of the circle, and everyone else adjusts to make room for his long legs.</p><p>I push his legs over so I can set the time capsule down in the center. \u201cHere it is, everybody. All your greatest treasures from seventh grade.\u201d I try to whip off the aluminum top with a flourish, but it\u2019s really stuck. I\u2019m struggling with it, using my nails. I look over at Peter and he\u2019s digging into the ice cream bars, oblivious, so John gets up and helps me unscrew it. He smells like pine soap. I add this to the list of new things I\u2019ve learned about him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo how are we gonna do this?\u201d Peter asks me, his mouth full of ice cream. \u201cDo we dump it all out?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve given this some thought. \u201cI think we should take turns pulling something out. Let\u2019s make it last, like opening presents on Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve leans forward in anticipation. Without looking, I reach into the cylinder and pull out the first thing my fingers touch. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019d forgotten what I put inside, but I know what it is instantly; I don\u2019t have to look down. It\u2019s a friendship bracelet that Genevieve made for me when we were in our weaving phase in fifth grade. Pink, white, and light blue chevron. I made one for her too. Purple and yellow chevron. She probably doesn\u2019t even remember it. I look over at her, and her face is blank. No recognition.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Trevor asks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s a bracelet I used to wear.\u201d</p><p>Peter touches his shoe to mine. \u201cThat piece of string was your most treasured thing?\u201d he teases.</p><p>John is watching me. \u201cYou used to wear it all the time,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s sweet that he even remembers.</p><p>Once it goes on, it\u2019s never supposed to come off, but I sacrificed it to the time capsule because I loved it so much. Maybe this is where Gen\u2019s and my friendship went sour. The curse of the friendship bracelet. \u201cYou go next,\u201d I say to him.</p><p>He reaches inside the box and pulls out a baseball.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s mine,\u201d Peter crows. \u201cThat\u2019s from when I hit a home run at Claremont Park.\u201d John throws the ball to him, and Peter catches it. Examining it, he says, \u201cSee, I signed and dated it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that day,\u201d Genevieve says, tilting her head. \u201cYou came running off the field, and you kissed me in front of your mom. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . not really,\u201d Peter mumbles. He\u2019s staring down at the baseball, turning it in his hand like he\u2019s fascinated by it. I can\u2019t believe him. I really can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAwk-ward,\u201d Trevor says with a chortle.</p><p>In a soft voice, like no one else is here, she says to him, \u201cCan I keep it?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s ears are turning red. He looks at me, panicky. \u201cCovey, do you want it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d I say, keeping my head turned away from them. I grab the bag of Cheez Doodles and stuff a handful in my mouth. I\u2019m so mad all I can do is eat Cheez Doodles or else I\u2019ll scream at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019m gonna keep it,\u201d Peter says, putting the baseball in his coat pocket. \u201cOwen might want it. Sorry, Gen.\u201d He grabs the time capsule and starts rifling through it. He holds up a worn-out baseball cap. Orioles. Too loudly he says, \u201cMcClaren, look what I got here.\u201d</p><p>A smile spreads across John\u2019s face like a slow sunrise. He takes it from Peter and puts it on his head, adjusting the bill.</p><p>\u201cThat really was your most prized possession,\u201d I say. He wore it deep into the fall, too. I asked my dad to buy me an Orioles T-shirt because I thought John McClaren would be impressed. I wore it twice but I don\u2019t think he ever noticed. My smile fades when I notice Genevieve watching me. Our eyes meet; there is some knowing light in her gaze that makes me feel twitchy. She looks away; now she is the one smiling to herself.</p><p>\u201cThe Orioles suck,\u201d Peter says, leaning against the wall. He reaches for the box of ice cream sandwiches and pulls one out.</p><p>\u201cPass me one of those,\u201d Trevor says.</p><p>\u201cSorry, last one,\u201d Peter says, biting into it.</p><p>John catches my eye and winks. \u201cSame old Kavinsky,\u201d he says, and I laugh. I know he\u2019s thinking of our letters.</p> <p>Peter grins at him. \u201cHey, no more stutter.\u201d</p><p>I freeze. How could Peter bring that up so cavalierly? None of us ever talked about John\u2019s stutter back in middle school. He was so shy about it. But now John just flashes a smile and shrugs and says, \u201cI\u2019ll pass that along to my eighth grade speech therapist, Elaine.\u201d He\u2019s so confident!</p><p>Peter blinks, and I can see that he is caught off guard. He does not know this John McClaren. It used to be that Peter was the shot caller, not John. He followed Peter\u2019s lead. Peter might still be the same, but John has changed. Now Peter\u2019s the one who is less sure-footed.</p><p>Chris goes next. She pulls out a ring with a tiny pearl in the center. Allie\u2019s, a confirmation gift from her aunt. She loved that ring. I\u2019ll have to send it to her. Trevor pulls out his own treasure\u2014an autographed baseball card. Genevieve is the one to pull out Chris\u2019s\u2014an envelope with a twenty-dollar bill inside.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Chris screams. \u201cI was such a little genius.\u201d We high-five.</p><p>\u201cWhat about yours, Gen?\u201d Trevor asks.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t put anything in the capsule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you did,\u201d I say, brushing orange Cheez dust off my fingers. \u201cYou were there that day.\u201d I remember she went back and forth between putting in a picture of her and Peter or the rose he gave her for her birthday. I can\u2019t remember what she decided on.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing inside, so I guess I didn\u2019t. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>I look inside the time capsule just to be sure. It\u2019s empty.</p><p>\u201cRemember how we used to play Assassins?\u201d Trevor says, squeezing the last bit of juice out of his Capri Sun.</p><p>Oh, how I loved that game! It was like tag: Everybody picked a name out of a hat, and you had to tag the person out. Once you got your person, you had to take out whoever they had. It involved a lot of sneaking around and hiding. A game could last for days.</p><p>\u201cI was the Black Widow,\u201d Genevieve says. She does a little shoulder shimmy at Peter. \u201cI won more than anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Peter scoffs. \u201cI won plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Chris says.</p><p>Trevor points at me. \u201cL\u2019il J, you were the worst at it. I don\u2019t think you won once.\u201d</p><p>I make a face. L\u2019il J. I\u2019d forgotten he used to call me that. And he\u2019s right: I never did win. Not even once. The one time I came close, Chris tagged me out at Kitty\u2019s swim meet. I\u2019d thought I was safe because it was late at night. I was so close to that win, I could almost taste it.</p><p>Chris\u2019s eyes meet mine, and I know she\u2019s remembering too. She winks at me, and I give her a sour look.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean just doesn\u2019t have the killer instinct,\u201d Genevieve says, looking at her nails.</p><p>I say, \u201cWe can\u2019t all be black widows.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she says, and my teeth clench.</p><p>John says to Peter, \u201cRemember that one time I had you, and I was hiding behind your dad\u2019s car before school, but it was your dad that came out, not you? And I scared him, and he and I both screamed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we had to quit altogether when Trevor came to my mom\u2019s store in his ski mask,\u201d Peter guffaws.</p><p>Everyone laughs, except for me. I\u2019m still smarting from Genevieve\u2019s \u201ckiller instinct\u201d dig.</p> <p>Trevor\u2019s laughing so hard he can barely speak. \u201cShe almost called the cops!\u201d he manages to sputter.</p><p>Peter nudges my sneaker toe with his. \u201cWe should play again.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s trying to get back in my good graces, but I\u2019m not ready to let him, so I just shrug a chilly little shrug. I wish I weren\u2019t mad at him, because I really do want to play again. I want to prove I\u2019ve got the killer instinct too, that I\u2019m not some Assassins loser.</p><p>\u201cWe should do it,\u201d John says. \u201cFor old times\u2019 sake.\u201d He catches my eye. \u201cOne last shot, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I smile.</p> <p>Chris raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhat does the winner get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . nothing,\u201d I say. \u201cIt would just be for fun.\u201d Trevor makes a face at this.</p><p>\u201cThere should be a prize,\u201d Genevieve says. \u201cOtherwise what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>I think fast. What would be a good prize? \u201cMovie tickets? A baked good of the winner\u2019s choice?\u201d I blurt out. No one says a word.</p><p>\u201cWe could all put in a twenty,\u201d John offers. I throw him a grateful look and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cMoney\u2019s boring,\u201d Genevieve says, stretching like a cat.</p> <p>I roll my eyes. Who asked for her two cents? I didn\u2019t even ask for her to be here.</p><p>Trevor says, \u201cUm, how about the winner gets breakfast in bed every day for a week? It could be pancakes on Monday, omelet on Tuesday, waffle on Wednesday, and so forth. There are six of us, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shuddering, Genevieve says, \u201cI don\u2019t eat breakfast.\u201d Everyone groans.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you suggest something instead of shooting everybody down,\u201d Peter says, and I hide my face behind my braid so no one sees me smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Genevieve thinks for a minute, and then a smile spreads across her face. It\u2019s her Big Idea look, and it makes me nervous. Slowly, deliberately, she says, \u201cThe winner gets a wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom who?\u201d Trevor asks. \u201cEverybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom any one of us who are playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Peter interjects. \u201cWhat are we signing on for here?\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve looks very pleased with herself. \u201cOne wish, and you have to grant it.\u201d She looks like an evil queen.</p><p>Chris\u2019s eyes gleam as she says, \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin reason,\u201d I quickly say. This isn\u2019t at all what I had in mind, but at least people are willing to play.</p><p>\u201cReason is subjective,\u201d John points out.</p><p>\u201cBasically, Gen can\u2019t force Peter to have sex with her one last time,\u201d Chris says. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s thinking, right?\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. That wasn\u2019t what I was thinking, like at all. But now I am.</p><p>Trevor busts up laughing and Peter shoves him. Genevieve shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting, Chrissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only said what everyone was thinking!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m barely even listening at this point. All I can think is, I want to play this game and I want to win. Just once I want to beat Genevieve at something.</p><p>I only have one pen and no paper, so John tears up the ice cream sandwich box and we take turns writing our names down on our cardboard scraps. Then everybody puts their names in the empty time capsule, and I shake it up. We pass it around and I go last. I pull out the piece of cardboard, hold it close to my chest, and open it.</p><p>JOHN.</p><p>Well, that complicates things. I sneak a peek at him. He\u2019s carefully tucking his piece of cardboard in his jeans pocket. Sorry, (pen) pal, but you\u2019re going down. I take a quick look around the room for clues to who might have my name, but everyone\u2019s got their poker faces on.</p><p>36</p><p>THE RULES ARE: YOUR HOUSE is a safe zone. School is a safe zone, but not the parking lot. Once you step out the door, it\u2019s all fair game. You\u2019re out if you get hit with a two-hand touch.</p><p>And if you renege on your wish, your life is forfeit. Genevieve comes up with that last part and it gives me shivers. Trevor Pike shudders and says, \u201cGirls are scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, girls in their family are scary,\u201d Peter says, gesturing at Chris and Genevieve. They both smile, and in those smiles I see the family resemblance. Casting a sidelong glance at me, Peter says hopefully, \u201cYou\u2019re not scary, though. You\u2019re sweet, right?\u201d Suddenly I remember something Stormy said to me. Don\u2019t ever let him get too sure of you. Peter is very sure of me. As sure as a person could be.</p><p>\u201cI can be scary too,\u201d I quietly say back, and he blanches. Then, to everyone else, I say, \u201cLet\u2019s just have fun with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019ll be fun,\u201d John assures me. He puts his Orioles cap on his head and pulls the brim down. \u201cGame on.\u201d He catches my eye. \u201cIf you thought I was good at Model UN, wait till you see my Zero Dark Thirty skills.\u201d</p><p>I walk with everyone out front to their cars, and I hear Peter tell Genevieve to get a ride with Chris, which they both balk at. \u201cFigure it out amongst yourselves,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI\u2019m hanging out with my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve rolls her eyes and Chris groans. \u201cUgh. Fine.\u201d To Genevieve she says, \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s car is backing out of the driveway when John says to Peter, \u201cWho\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d My stomach does a dip.</p><p>\u201cCovey.\u201d Peter gives him a funny look. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know? That\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>Now they\u2019re both looking at me. Peter\u2019s confused, but John gets it, whatever \u201cit\u201d is.</p><p>I should have told him. Why didn\u2019t I tell him?</p><p>Everyone leaves soon after, except for Peter.</p><p>\u201cSo are we going to talk about this?\u201d he asks, trailing after me into the kitchen. I\u2019ve got the trash bag with all the ice cream wrappers and Capri Suns, and I refused his help carrying it down. Almost tripped going down the ladder with it, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s talk.\u201d I spin around and advance toward him, trash bag swinging in my hand. He lifts his hands up in alarm. \u201cWhy did you bring Genevieve here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peter grimaces. \u201cUgh, Covey, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you hanging out with her? Is that why you didn\u2019t come early to help me set up?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. \u201cYeah, I was with her. She called me crying, so I went over there, and then I couldn\u2019t just leave her by herself . . . so I brought her.\u201d</p><p>Crying? I\u2019ve never known her to cry. Even when her cat Queen Elizabeth died, she didn\u2019t cry. She must have been faking to get Peter to stay. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just leave her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s going through some shit right now. I\u2019m just trying to be there for her. As a friend. That\u2019s it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh, she really knows how to work you, Peter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always like that. She pulls the strings and you just . . .\u201d I dangle my arms and head like a marionette doll.</p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cThat was mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I feel mean right now. So watch out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mean, though. Not usually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just tell me? You know I won\u2019t tell anyone. I really want to understand it, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not for me to say. Don\u2019t try to make me tell you, because I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just doing this to manipulate you. It\u2019s what she does.\u201d I hear the jealousy in my voice, and I hate it, I hate it. This isn\u2019t me.</p><p>He sighs. \u201cNothing\u2019s happening with us. She just needs a friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has a lot of friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs an old friend.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. He doesn\u2019t get it. Girls understand each other in a way boys never will. It\u2019s how I know this is all just another one of her games. Showing up at my house today was just another way for her to exert dominance over me.</p><p>Then Peter says, \u201cSpeaking of old friends, I didn\u2019t realize you and McClaren were so buddy-buddy.\u201d</p><p>I flush. \u201cI told you we were pen pals.\u201d</p><p>Raising his eyebrows, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re pen pals but he doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never came up!\u201d Wait a minute\u2014I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to be mad at him right now, not the other way around. Somehow this whole conversation has flipped around, and now I\u2019m the one flailing.</p><p>\u201cSo that day you went to the Model UN thing a few months ago, I asked you if you saw McClaren and you said no. But then today he brought up Model UN, and you clearly did see him there. Did you not?\u201d</p> <p>I swallow. \u201cWhen did you turn into a prosecutor? Sheesh. I saw him there but we didn\u2019t even talk; I just handed him a note\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA note? You gave him a note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t from me\u2014it was from a different country, for Model UN.\u201d Peter opens his mouth to ask another question, and I quickly add, \u201cI just didn\u2019t mention it because nothing came of it.\u201d</p><p>Incredulous, he says, \u201cSo you want me to be honest with you, but you don\u2019t want to be honest with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that!\u201d I cry out. What is even happening here? How did our fight get so big so fast?</p><p>Neither of us says anything for a moment. Then, quietly, he asks, \u201cDo you want to break up?\u201d</p><p>Break up? \u201cNo.\u201d All of a sudden I feel shaky, like I could cry. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me first!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. Neither of us wants to break up, so we just move on.\u201d Peter sinks down on a chair at the kitchen table and rests his head on it.</p><p>I sit across from him. He feels so far away from me. My hand is itching to reach out and touch his hair, smooth it out, to make this fight be over and in our rearview.</p><p>He lifts his head; his eyes are sad and enormous. \u201cCan we hug now?\u201d</p><p>Shakily I nod, and we both get up and I wrap my arms around his middle. He holds me tight against him. His voice is muffled against my shoulder as he says, \u201cCan we never fight again?\u201d</p><p>I laugh a shaky kind of laugh, shaky and relieved. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s kissing me; his mouth is urgent against mine, like he\u2019s searching for some sort of reassurance, some kind of promise only I can give. In answer I kiss him back\u2014yes, I promise, promise, promise, let\u2019s never fight again. I start to lose my balance, and his arm locks around me tight, and he kisses me until I am breathless.</p><p>37</p><p>ON THE PHONE THAT NIGHT, Chris says, \u201cSpill it. Who do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling.\u201d I\u2019ve made this mistake in the past, telling Chris too much, only to have her tag her way to victory.</p><p>\u201cCome on! I\u2019ll help you if you help me. I want my wish!\u201d Chris\u2019s strength in this game is how bad she wants it, but it\u2019s also her weakness. You have to play Assassins in a cool, measured way, not go too hot too fast. I say this as someone who\u2019s observed all the nuances but has never personally won, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou might have my name. Besides, I want to win too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just help each other out on this first round of hits,\u201d Chris wheedles. \u201cI don\u2019t have your name, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear on your blankie that you won\u2019t let your mom throw away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear on my blankie Fredrick and I double swear on my new leather jacket that cost more money than my damn car. Do you have my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear on your ugly beret collection.\u201d</p><p>I make an indignant sound. \u201cI swear on my charming and jaunty beret collection! So who do you have then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got John McClaren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s team up to take them out,\u201d Chris suggests. \u201cOur alliance can last as long as this first round, and then it\u2019s every girl for herself.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Is she for real or is this all strategy? \u201cWhat if you\u2019re lying just to smoke me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swore on Fredrick!\u201d</p><p>I hesitate and then say, \u201cText me a picture of the name slip and then I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! Then text me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Tell me the truth. Does my hair look like shit? It doesn\u2019t, right? Gen\u2019s just a heinous troll. Right?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate the tiniest of beats. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Chris and I are slumped down in her car. We are one neighborhood over from mine; it\u2019s the neighborhood Trevor will drive through to shortcut to school for track practice. We\u2019re parked in some random person\u2019s driveway. She says, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re going to wish for if you win.\u201d The way she says it, I know she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m going to win. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought about the wish all last night when I was trying to fall asleep. \u201cThere\u2019s a craft expo in North Carolina in June. I could get Peter to drive me. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d take me otherwise. We could take his mom\u2019s van, so there\u2019s plenty of room for all the supplies and things that I\u2019ll buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA craft expo?\u201d Chris is giving me a look like I\u2019m a cockroach that flew into her car. \u201cYou would waste a wish on a craft expo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just getting warmed up with that idea,\u201d I lie. \u201cAnyway, if you\u2019re so smart, what would you wish for if you were me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would make it so that Peter never talks to Gen again. I mean, right? I\u2019m an evil genius, am I not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvil, yes; genius, hardly.\u201d Chris gives me a shove, and I giggle. We\u2019re both shoving each other when Chris stops short and says, \u201cTwo fifty-five. It\u2019s go time.\u201d Chris unlocks the doors and gets out and hides behind an oak tree in the yard.</p><p>My adrenaline is pumping as I hop out of Chris\u2019s car, grab Kitty\u2019s bike out of her trunk, and push it a few houses. Then I set it on the ground and drape myself over it in a dramatic heap. Then I pull out the bottle of fake blood I bought for this very purpose and squirt some on my jeans\u2014old jeans I\u2019ve been planning on giving to Goodwill. As soon as I see Trevor\u2019s car approaching, I start to pretend sob. From behind the tree Chris whispers, \u201cTone it down a little!\u201d I immediately stop sobbing and start moaning.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s car pulls up beside me. He rolls down the window. \u201cLara Jean? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I whimper. \u201cNo . . . I think I might have sprained my ankle. It really hurts. Can you give me a ride home?\u201d I\u2019m willing myself to tear up, but it\u2019s harder to cry on cue than I would have thought. I try to think about sad things\u2014the Titanic, old people with Alzheimer\u2019s, Jamie Fox-Pickle dying\u2014but I can\u2019t focus.</p><p>Trevor regards me suspiciously. \u201cWhy are you riding your bike in this neighborhood?\u201d</p> <p>Oh no, I\u2019m losing him! I start talking fast but not too fast. \u201cIt\u2019s not my bike; it\u2019s my little sister\u2019s. She\u2019s friends with Sara Healey. You know, Dan Healey\u2019s little sister? They live over there.\u201d I point to their house. \u201cI was bringing it to her\u2014oh my God, Trevor. Do you not believe me? Are you seriously not going to give me a ride?\u201d</p><p>Trevor looks around. \u201cDo you swear this isn\u2019t a trick?\u201d</p><p>Gotcha! \u201cYes! I swear I don\u2019t have your name, okay? Please just help me up. It really hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst show me your ankle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor! You can\u2019t see a sprained ankle!\u201d I whimper and make a show of trying to stand up, and Trevor finally turns the car off and gets out. He stoops down and pulls me to my feet and I try to make my body heavy. \u201cBe gentle,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSee? I told you I didn\u2019t have your name.\u201d</p><p>Trevor pulls me up by my armpits, and over his shoulder Chris creeps up behind him like a ninja. She dives forward, both hands out, and claps them on his back hard. \u201cI got you!\u201d she screams.</p> <p>Trevor shrieks and drops me, and I narrowly escape falling for real. \u201cDamn it!\u201d he yells.</p><p>Gleefully Chris says, \u201cYou\u2019re done, sucker!\u201d She and I high-five and hug.</p><p>\u201cCan you guys not celebrate in front of me?\u201d he mutters.</p><p>Chris holds her hand out. \u201cNow gimme gimme gimme.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Trevor shakes his head and says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I fell for that, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I pat him on the back. \u201cSorry, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I had had your name?\u201d he asks me. \u201cWhat would you have done then?\u201d</p><p>Huh. I never thought of that. I shoot Chris an accusing glare. \u201cWait a minute! What if he had had my name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was a chance we were willing to take,\u201d she says smoothly. \u201cSo Trev, what was your wish going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say if you don\u2019t want,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI was gonna wish for tickets to a UVA football game. McClaren\u2019s dad has season tickets! Damn you, Chris.\u201d</p><p>I feel bad. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll take you anyway. You should ask. . . .\u201d</p><p>He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet and hands her a small piece of folded cardboard. Before Chris opens it, I quickly say, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, if it\u2019s my name, you can\u2019t tag me. This is a demilitarized zone right here.\u201d</p><p>Chris nods, opens the cardboard, and then grins.</p><p>I can\u2019t resist. \u201cIs it me?\u201d</p><p>Chris stuffs it in her pocket.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s me, you can\u2019t take me out!\u201d I start to back away from her. \u201cWe agreed to be allies this first round, and you haven\u2019t helped me with mine yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. But I don\u2019t have your name.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not entirely convinced. This is how she beat me another time we played. She can\u2019t be trusted, not in this game. I should have remembered that. It\u2019s why I always lose; I don\u2019t look down the line far enough.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean! I just told you, I don\u2019t have your name!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cJust get in the car, Chris. I\u2019ll ride Kitty\u2019s bike home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m playing to win this time.\u201d</p><p>Chris shrugs. \u201cHave it your way. I\u2019m not helping you with your kill, then, if you don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d I say, and swing my leg over Kitty\u2019s bike.</p><p>38</p><p>PETER AND I ARE ONLY talking on the phone and at school until one of us gets tagged out. It won\u2019t be me. I\u2019ve been super careful. I drive myself to and from school. I look around before I jump out of my car and run like the wind to our front door. I\u2019ve enlisted Kitty as my scout\u2014she always gets out of the car or the house first and makes sure the coast is clear for me. I\u2019ve already promised her that whatever I wish for if I win, she\u2019ll get a piece of.</p><p>But so far I\u2019ve only been playing defense. I haven\u2019t tried to tag out John McClaren yet. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m afraid\u2014not of the game, anyway. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say to him. I\u2019m embarrassed. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t even need to say anything; maybe I\u2019m being presumptuous even thinking he might be interested in me.</p><p>After lunch, Chris comes flying down the hall and skids to a stop when she sees me and Lucas on the floor at our lockers. Today we\u2019re sharing a grape Popsicle. Chris sinks down to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m out,\u201d she says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gasp. \u201cWho got you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn freaking McClaren!\u201d She snatches the Popsicle out of Lucas\u2019s hands and finishes it in a gulp.</p><p>\u201cRude,\u201d Lucas says.</p><p>\u201cTell us everything,\u201d I urge.</p> <p>\u201cJohn tailed me on the way to school this morning.

I didn\u2019t even know he was following me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, how did he know you were going to stop for gas?\u201d Lucas asks. He knows all about the game, which will hopefully come in handy if it comes down to Genevieve and me, seeing as how he lives in her neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cHe siphoned gas out of my tank!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d I breathe. It warms my heart that John is taking it so seriously. I\u2019d worried people wouldn\u2019t, but it seems like they are. I wonder what John\u2019s wish is? It must be something good to go to all this trouble.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s legit,\u201d Lucas says with a nod.</p> <p>\u201cI almost can\u2019t be mad because it\u2019s so hard-core.\u201d She blows her hair out of her face. \u201cI\u2019m just so pissed I can\u2019t make Gen give me our grandma\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cThat\u2019s what you were going to wish for? A car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat car holds a lot of sentimental value for me,\u201d Chris says. \u201cOur grandma used to take me to the beauty parlor with her in it on Sunday afternoons. By all rights it should be mine.

I put my arm around her. \u201cWant me to buy you another Popsicle?\u201d</p><p>Chris shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019ve got to wear a crop top tonight. I can\u2019t have a gut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re out, who does John have now?\u201d Lucas asks.</p><p>\u201cKavinsky,\u201d Chris says. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to get him because he\u2019s always with fucking Gen, and I thought for sure Gen had me.\u201d She glances at me. \u201cSorry, LJ.\u201d</p><p>Lucas and Chris are looking at me with pity eyes.</p><p>If Chris had Peter, and John took her out, that means John has Peter now. Which means either Peter or Genevieve has me. And since I have John, that means one of them has the other\u2014which means they must be in an alliance. That means they\u2019ve confided in each other, told each other who they have.</p><p>Swallowing, I say, \u201cI knew from the start they were still friends. And, she\u2019s going through a hard time, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she going through?\u201d Chris asks, one eyebrow way high up.</p><p>\u201cPeter said family stuff.\u201d She looks blank. \u201cSo you haven\u2019t heard anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, she was acting kind of weird at Aunt Wendy\u2019s birthday dinner last week. Like, more of a bitch than usual. She barely said a word all night to anybody.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cSo something probably is up, but I don\u2019t know what.\u201d Chris blows her hair out of her face. \u201cDamn it. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not getting that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take John McClaren out for you,\u201d I vow. \u201cYour death will not be in vain.\u201d</p><p>She gives me side-eye. \u201cIf you\u2019d have gotten him out sooner, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives half an hour away! I don\u2019t even know how to get to his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, I still partially blame you.\u201d The bell rings and Chris stands up. \u201cLater, chicas.\u201d She heads off down the hall, in the opposite direction of her next class.</p><p>\u201cShe just called me chica,\u201d Lucas says, frowning at me. \u201cDid you tell her I\u2019m gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, because I told you that in confidence. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, of course I remember!\u201d Now I\u2019m nervous\u2014did I ever say anything to Chris? I\u2019m almost one hundred percent sure not, but he has me doubting myself all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever.\u201d He rises to his feet and offers his hand to help me up. He is ever the gentleman.</p><p>39</p><p>IT\u2019S MY FIRST OFFICIAL FRIDAY night cocktail hour at Belleview and the night isn\u2019t going . . . as well as I\u2019d hoped. We\u2019re already half an hour in and it\u2019s just Stormy, Mr. Morales, Alicia, and Nelson, who has Alzheimer\u2019s and whose nurse brought him in for a change of scenery. He is, however, wearing a dapper navy sport coat with copper buttons. Not that many people came when Margot was in charge, either\u2014Mrs. Maguire was a regular, but she was moved to a different nursing home last month, and Mrs. Montero died over the holidays. But I made such a fuss to Janette about how I would breathe new life into cocktail hour, and now look at me. I feel a little olive pit of dread in the bottom of my stomach, because if Janette catches wind of how low the attendance is, she might cancel Friday night social after all, and I had the funnest idea for the next one\u2014a USO party. If tonight\u2019s a flop, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll let me run it. Also, throwing a party and having four people show up, one of whom is dozing off, feels like a huge failure. Stormy either doesn\u2019t notice or doesn\u2019t mind; she just keeps singing and playing the piano. The show must go on, as they say.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to keep busy, keep a smile on my face: Tra-la-la, everything is loverly. I\u2019ve lined up the glassware in neat rows so it looks like a real bar and brought a bunch of things from home\u2014our one good tablecloth (no gravy stains, freshly ironed), a little bud vase I put next to the plate of peanut butter cookies (at first I hesitated at peanut butter, what with allergies and all, but then I remembered that old people don\u2019t have as many food allergies), Mommy and Daddy\u2019s silver ice bucket with their monogram, a matching silver bowl with cut-up lemons and limes.</p><p>I\u2019ve already gone around knocking on doors of some of the more active residents, but most weren\u2019t home. I guess if you\u2019re active, you\u2019re not staying in your apartment on a Friday night.</p><p>I\u2019m pouring salted peanuts into a heart-shaped crystal bowl (a contribution from Alicia, who brought it out of storage, along with her ice tongs) when John Ambrose McClaren walks into the room in a light blue Oxford shirt and navy sport coat, not dissimilar to Nelson\u2019s! I nearly scream out loud. Clapping my hands to my mouth, I drop to the floor, behind the table. If he sees me, he might run off. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing here, but this is my perfect chance to take him out. I crouch behind the table, running through options in my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then the piano music stops and I hear Stormy call out, \u201cLara Jean? Lara Jean, where are you? Come out from behind the table. I want to introduce you to someone.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I rise to my feet. John McClaren is staring at me. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks me, tugging on his shirt collar like it\u2019s choking him.</p><p>\u201cI volunteer here,\u201d I say, still keeping a safe distance. Don\u2019t want to spook him.</p><p>Stormy claps her hands. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d</p> <p>John says, \u201cWe\u2019re friends, Grandma. We used to live in the same neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStormy\u2019s your grandma?\u201d My mind is blown. So John is her grandson she wanted to set me up with! Of all the nursing homes in all the towns in all the world! My grandson looks like a young Robert Redford. He does; he really does.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my great-grandmother by marriage,\u201d John says.</p><p>Stormy\u2019s eyes dart around the room. \u201cHush up! I don\u2019t want people knowing you\u2019re my great-anything.\u201d</p><p>John lowers his voice. \u201cShe was my great-grandpa\u2019s second wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy favorite of all my husbands,\u201d Stormy says. \u201cMay he rest in peace, that old buzzard.\u201d She looks from John to me. \u201cJohnny, be a dear and bring me a vodka soda with lots of lemons.\u201d She sits back at the piano bench and starts to play \u201cWhen I Fall in Love.\u201d</p><p>John starts toward me and I point at him. \u201cStop right there, John Ambrose McClaren. Do you have my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I swear I don\u2019t. I have\u2014I\u2019m not saying who I have.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWait a minute. Do you have mine?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, innocent as a little lost lamb. He still looks suspicious, so I busy myself with making Stormy\u2019s drink. I know just how she likes it. I drop in three ice cubes, an eight-second pour of vodka, and a splash of soda water. Then I squeeze three lemon slices and drop them in the glass. \u201cHere,\u201d I say, holding out the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou can put it on the table,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cJohn! I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t have your name!\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head. \u201cTable.\u201d</p><p>I set the glass back down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t believe me. I feel like I remember you being a trusting kind of person who sees the good in people.\u201d</p><p>Sober as a judge, John says, \u201cJust . . . stay on your side of the table.\u201d</p><p>Shoot. How am I supposed to take him out if he makes me stay ten feet away all night?</p><p>Airily I say, \u201cFine by me. I don\u2019t know if I believe you, either, so! I mean, this is a pretty big coincidence, you showing up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStormy guilted me into coming!\u201d</p><p>I snap my head in Stormy\u2019s direction. She\u2019s still playing the piano, looking over at us with a big smile.</p><p>Mr. Morales sidles up to the bar and says, \u201cMay I have this dance, Lara Jean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou may,\u201d I say. To John I warn, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare come close to me.\u201d</p><p>He throws his hands out like he\u2019s warding me off. \u201cDon\u2019t you come close to me!\u201d</p><p>As Mr. Morales leads me in a slow dance, I press my face against his shoulder to hide my smile. I\u2019m really quite good at this espionage thing. John McClaren is sitting on a love seat now, watching Stormy play and chatting with Alicia. I\u2019ve got him right where I want him. I can\u2019t even believe how lucky I am. I\u2019d been planning on showing up at his next Model UN meeting, but this is so much better.</p><p>I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll come up from behind him, take him by surprise, when Stormy stands up and declares she needs a piano break, she wants to dance with her grandson. I go turn on the stereo and cue up the CD we decided on for her break.</p><p>John is protesting: \u201cStormy, I told you I don\u2019t dance.\u201d He used to try and fake sick during the square-dancing unit in gym\u2014that\u2019s how much he hates dancing.</p><p>Stormy doesn\u2019t listen, of course. She pulls him off the love seat and starts trying to teach him how to fox-trot. \u201cPut your hand on my waist,\u201d she orders. \u201cI didn\u2019t wear heels to sit behind a piano all night.\u201d Stormy\u2019s trying to teach him the steps, and he keeps stepping on her feet. \u201cOuch!\u201d she snaps.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop giggling. Mr. Morales is too. He dances us over closer. \u201cMay I cut in?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d John practically pushes Stormy into Mr. Morales\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cJohnny, be a gentleman and ask Lara Jean to dance,\u201d Stormy says as Mr. Morales twirls her.</p><p>John gives me a searching look, and I have a feeling he\u2019s still suspicious of me and whether or not I have his name.</p><p>\u201cAsk her to dance,\u201d Mr. Morales urges, grinning at me. \u201cShe wants to dance, don\u2019t you, Lara Jean?\u201d</p><p>I shrug a sad kind of shrug. Wistful. The very picture of a girl who is waiting to be asked to dance.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the young people dance!\u201d Norman yells.</p><p>John McClaren looks at me, one eyebrow raised. \u201cIf we\u2019re just swaying back and forth, I probably won\u2019t step on your feet.\u201d</p><p>I feign hesitation and then nod. My pulse is racing. Target acquired.</p><p>We step toward each other, and I thread my arms around his neck, and he puts his around my waist, and we sway, off beat. I\u2019m short, not even five-two, and he looks just under six feet tall, but in my heels we\u2019re a good height for dance partners. From across the room Stormy smiles knowingly at me, which I pretend not to see. I should probably go ahead and take him out before he\u2019s onto me, but the residents are so enjoying watching us dance. It couldn\u2019t hurt to hold off just a few minutes.</p><p>As we sway, I\u2019m remembering the eighth grade formal, how everyone paired up and no one asked me to go. I\u2019d thought Genevieve and I were riding over together, but then she said Peter\u2019s mom was taking them, and they were going to a restaurant first, like a real date, and it would be awkward if I tagged along. So it ended up being her and Peter and Sabrina Fox and John. I\u2019d hoped John McClaren would ask me for a slow dance, but he didn\u2019t; he didn\u2019t dance with anyone. The only guy who really danced was Peter. He was always in the center of the cool-people dance circle.</p><p>John\u2019s hand is pressed against my back, leading me, and I think he\u2019s forgotten all about the game. I\u2019ve got him in my crosshairs now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad,\u201d I tell him. Song\u2019s halfway over. I\u2019d better hop to the beat. I\u2019ve got you in five, four, three, two\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo . . . you and Kavinsky, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s distracted me completely, and I\u2019ve forgotten all about the game for a moment. \u201cYeah . . .\u201d</p><p>Clearing his throat, he says, \u201cI was pretty surprised that you guys were together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m not his type?\u201d I say it casually, like it\u2019s nothing, a fact, but it stings like a little pebble thrown directly at my heart.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why?\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure John\u2019s going to say \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t think he was your type,\u201d just like Josh did.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cThat day you came to Model UN, I tried to follow you out to the parking lot, but you were already gone. Then I got your letter, and I wrote you back, and you wrote me back, and then you invited me to the tree-house thing. I guess I didn\u2019t know what to think. You know what I mean?\u201d He looks at me expectantly, and I feel like it\u2019s important that I say yes.</p><p>All the blood rushes to my face, and I hear a pounding in my ears, which I belatedly realize is the sound of my heart beating really fast. My body is still dancing, though.</p><p>He keeps talking. \u201cMaybe it was dumb to think that, because all that stuff was such a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>All what stuff? I want to know, but it wouldn\u2019t be right to ask. \u201cDo you know what I remember?\u201d I ask suddenly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe time Trevor\u2019s shorts split open when you guys were playing basketball. And everybody was laughing so hard that Trevor started getting mad. But not you. You got on your bike and you rode all the way home and brought Trevor a pair of shorts. I was really impressed by that.\u201d</p><p>He has a faint half smile on his face. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Then we\u2019re both quiet and still dancing. He\u2019s an easy person to be quiet with. \u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>I look up at him. \u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you. I mean, I have your name. In the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d John looks genuinely disappointed, which makes me feel guilty.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. Sorry.\u201d I press my hands against his shoulders. \u201cTag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you have Kavinsky. I was really looking forward to taking him out, too. I had a whole plan and everything.\u201d</p><p>All eagerness I ask, \u201cWhat was your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I tell the girl who just tagged me out?\u201d he challenges, but it\u2019s a weak challenge, just for show, and we both know he\u2019s going to tell me.</p><p>I play along. \u201cCome on, Johnny. I\u2019m not just the girl who tagged you out. I\u2019m your pen pal.\u201d</p> <p>John laughs a little. \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>The song ends and we step apart. \u201cThanks for the dance,\u201d I say. After all this time, I finally know what it\u2019s like to dance with John Ambrose McClaren. \u201cSo what would you have asked for if you won?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t hesitate even one beat. \u201cYour peanut butter chocolate cake with my name written in Reese\u2019s Pieces.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in surprise. That\u2019s what he would have wished for? He could have anything and he wants my cake? I give him a curtsy. \u201cI\u2019m so honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was a really good cake,\u201d he says.</p><p>40</p><p>ON THE PHONE A FEW nights later, Peter suddenly says, \u201cYou have me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I haven\u2019t told him I took out John over the weekend. I don\u2019t want him\u2014or Genevieve, for that matter\u2014to have any extra info. It\u2019s down to the three of us now.</p><p>\u201cSo you do have me!\u201d He lets out a groan. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play this game anymore. It\u2019s making me lonely and really . . . frustrated. I haven\u2019t seen you outside of school for a week! When is this going to be over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I don\u2019t have you. I have John.\u201d I feel a little guilty for lying, but this is how winners play this game. You can\u2019t second-guess yourself.</p><p>There\u2019s a silence on the other end. Then he says, \u201cSo are you going to drive over to his house to tag him out? He lives in the middle of nowhere. I could take you if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t figured out my game plan yet,\u201d I say. \u201cWho do you have?\u201d I know it has to be me or Genevieve.</p><p>He gets quiet. \u201cI\u2019m not saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have you told anyone else?\u201d Like, say, Genevieve?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. \u201cOkay, well, I just told you, so you obviously owe me that same courtesy.\u201d</p><p>Peter bursts out, \u201cI didn\u2019t make you, you offered up that information yourself, and look, if it was a lie and you have me, please just freaking take me out already! I\u2019m begging you. Come to my house right now, and I\u2019ll let you sneak up to my room. I\u2019ll be a sitting duck for you if it means I can see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to win like that. When I get your name, I want to have the satisfaction of knowing I beat you fair and square. My first ever Assassins win can\u2019t be tainted.\u201d I pause. \u201cAnd besides, your house is a safe zone.\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out an aggravated sigh. \u201cAre you at least coming to my lacrosse game on Friday?\u201d</p><p>His lacrosse game! That\u2019s the perfect place to take him out. I try to keep my voice calm and even as I say, \u201cI can\u2019t come. My dad has a date, and he needs me to watch Kitty.\u201d A lie, but Peter doesn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cWell, can\u2019t you bring her? She\u2019s been asking to go to one of my games.\u201d</p><p>I think fast. \u201cNo, because she has a piano lesson after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when does Kitty play the piano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecently, in fact. She heard from our neighbor that it helps with training puppies; it calms them down.\u201d I bite my lip. Will he buy it? I hurry to add, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be at the next game no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Peter groans, this time even louder. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Covey.\u201d</p><p>Soon, my dear Peter.</p><p>I will surprise him at the game; I\u2019ll get all decked out in our school colors; I\u2019ll even paint his jersey number on my face. He\u2019ll be so happy to see me, he won\u2019t suspect a thing!</p><p>I can\u2019t fully explain why this game of Assassins is so important to me. I only know that with each passing day I want it more and more\u2014the win. I want to beat Genevieve, yes, but it\u2019s more than that. Maybe it\u2019s to prove that I\u2019ve changed too: I\u2019m not a soft little marshmallow; I\u2019ve got some fight in me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After Peter and I hang up, I text John my idea, and he offers to drive me to the game. It\u2019s at his school. I ask if he\u2019s sure he doesn\u2019t mind coming all the way to get me, and he says it\u2019ll be worth it to see Kavinsky get taken down. I\u2019m relieved, because the last thing I need is to get lost on the way there.</p><p>After school on Friday, I rush home to get ready. I change into school colors\u2014light blue T-shirt, white shorts, white and light blue striped knee socks, a blue ribbon in my hair. I paint a big 15 on my cheek and outline it with white eyeliner.</p><p>I run outside as soon as John pulls into our driveway. He\u2019s wearing his faded old Orioles baseball cap, pulled down low. He eyes me as I climb inside.</p><p>Smiling, John says, \u201cYou look like a rally girl.\u201d</p> <p>I tap him on the bill of his hat. \u201cYou used to wear this, like, every day that one summer.\u201d</p><p>As he backs out of our driveway, John grins like he has a secret. It\u2019s contagious. Now I\u2019m smiling too, and I don\u2019t even know why. \u201cWhat? Why are you smiling?\u201d I ask, pulling up my knee socks.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says.</p><p>I jab him in the side. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom gave me a really bad haircut at the beginning of summer, and I was embarrassed. I never let my mom cut my hair again after that.\u201d He checks the time on the dashboard. \u201cWhat time did you say the game started? Five?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup!\u201d I\u2019m practically bouncing up and down in my seat I\u2019m so excited. Peter will be proud of me for pulling this off, I know he will.</p><p>We get to John\u2019s school in under half an hour, and there\u2019s still time before the school bus arrives, so John jogs inside to get us snacks out of the vending machine. He comes back with two cans of soda and a bag of salt-and-vinegar chips to share.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t been back long before a tall black guy in a lacrosse uniform comes jogging over to the car. He calls out, \u201cMcClaren!\u201d He bends down and puts his face up close to the window, and he and John bump fists. \u201cAre you coming to Danica\u2019s after this?\u201d he asks.</p><p>John glances over at me and then says, \u201cNah, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His friend notices me then; his eyes widen. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lara Jean, I don\u2019t go here,\u201d I say, which is dumb, because he probably knows that already.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lara Jean!\u201d He nods enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you. You\u2019re why McClaren\u2019s hanging around a nursing home, am I right?\u201d</p><p>I blush and John laughs an easy sort of laugh. \u201cGet outta here, Avery.\u201d</p><p>Avery reaches over John and shakes my hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Lara Jean. See you around.\u201d Then he runs off toward the field. As we sit and wait, a few more people come up to John\u2019s car to say hi, and I see it\u2019s just like I thought: He has lots of friends, lots of girls who admire him. A group of girls walks by the car, toward the field, and one in particular stares into the car and right at me, questions in her eyes. John doesn\u2019t seem to notice. He is asking me what TV shows I watch, what I\u2019m going to do for spring break in April, summer vacation. I tell him about Daddy\u2019s idea to go to Korea.</p><p>\u201cI have a funny story about your dad,\u201d John says, looking at me sideways.</p><p>I groan. \u201cOh no. What did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him; it was me.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cThis is embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I rub my hands together in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cSo, I went over to your house to ask you to eighth grade formal. I had this whole extravagant plan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never asked me to formal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m getting to that part. Are you going to let me tell the story or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a whole extravagant plan,\u201d I prompt.</p><p>John nods. \u201cSo I gathered a bunch of sticks and some flowers and I arranged them into the letters FORMAL? in front of your window. But your dad came home while I was in the middle of it, and he thought I was going around cleaning people\u2019s yards. He gave me ten bucks, and I lost my nerve and I just went home.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI . . . can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d I can\u2019t believe that this almost happened to me. What would that have felt like, to have a boy do something like that for me? In the whole history of my letters, of my liking boys, not once has a boy liked me back at the same time as I liked him. It was always me alone, longing after a boy, and that was fine, that was safe. But this is new. Or old. Old and new, because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m hearing it.</p><p>\u201cThe biggest regret of eighth grade,\u201d John says, and that\u2019s when I remember\u2014how Peter once told me that John\u2019s biggest regret was not asking me to formal, how elated I was when he said it, and then how he quickly backtracked and said he was only joking.</p><p>The school bus pulls up then. \u201cShowtime,\u201d I say. I\u2019m giddy as we watch the players get off the bus\u2014I see Gabe, Darrell, no Peter yet. But then the last person gets off the bus and still no Peter. \u201cThat\u2019s weird . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould he have driven his own car?\u201d John asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHe never does.\u201d I grab my phone out of my bag and text him.</p><p>Where are you?</p><p>No reply. Something\u2019s wrong, I know it. Peter never misses a game. He even played when he had the flu.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I tell John, and I jump out of the car and run for the field. The guys are warming up. I find Gabe on the sideline lacing his cleats. I call out, \u201cGabe!\u201d</p><p>He looks up, surprised. \u201cLarge! What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Breathlessly I ask him, \u201cWhere\u2019s Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, scratching the back of his neck. \u201cHe told Coach he had a family emergency. It sounded pretty legit. Kavinsky wouldn\u2019t miss a game if it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already running back to the car. As soon as I\u2019m in, I pant, \u201cCan you drive me to Peter\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>I see her car first. Parked on the street in front of his house. The next thing I see is the two of them, standing together on the street for all to see. He has his arms wrapped around her; she is leaning in to him like she can\u2019t stand on her own two feet. Her face is buried in his chest. He is saying something in her ear, petting her hair tenderly.</p><p>It all happens in the span of seconds, but it feels like time goes in slow-motion, like I\u2019m moving through water. I think I stop breathing; my head goes fuzzy; everything around me blurs. How many times have I seen them stand just like that? Too many to count. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeep driving,\u201d I manage to say to John, and he obeys. He drives right past Peter\u2019s house; they don\u2019t even look up. Thank God they don\u2019t look up. Quietly I say, \u201cCan you take me home?\u201d I can\u2019t even look at John. I hate that he saw too.</p><p>John begins, \u201cIt might not be . . .\u201d Then he stops. \u201cIt was just a hug, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Whatever it was, he missed his game for her.</p><p>We\u2019re almost at my house when he finally asks, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking it over this whole ride. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell Peter to come over tonight, and then I\u2019m going to tag him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still playing?\u201d He sounds surprised.</p><p>I stare out the window, at all the familiar places. \u201cSure. I\u2019m going to take him out and then I\u2019m going to take Genevieve out and I\u2019m going to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to win so badly?\u201d he asks me. \u201cIs it the prize?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer him. If I open my mouth, I will cry.</p> <p>We\u2019re at my house now. I mumble, \u201cThanks for the ride,\u201d and I get out of the car before John can reply. I run into the house, kick off my shoes, and run up the stairs to my room, where I lie down and stare at the ceiling. I put glow-in-the-dark stars up there years ago, and I scraped most of them off except for one, which hung on tight as a stalactite.</p><p>Star light, star bright, the first star I see tonight. I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight. I wish not to cry.</p><p>I text Peter: Come over after you\u2019re finished hanging out with Genevieve.</p><p>He writes back one word: Okay.</p><p>Just \u201cokay.\u201d No denials, no explanations or clarifications. All this time I\u2019ve been making excuses for him. I\u2019ve been trusting Peter and not trusting my own gut. Why am I the one making all these concessions, pretending to be okay with something I\u2019m not actually okay with? Just to keep him?</p><p>In the contract we said we\u2019d always tell each other the truth. We said we\u2019d never break each other\u2019s hearts. So I guess two times now he\u2019s broken his word.</p> <p>41</p><p>PETER AND I ARE SITTING on my front porch; I can hear the TV on in the living room. Kitty\u2019s watching a movie. There is an interminably long silence between us, only the sound of crickets chirping.</p><p>He speaks first. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think, Lara Jean; it really isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I take a moment to gather my thoughts together, to string them into something that makes any kind of sense. \u201cWhen we first started all this, I was really happy just being at home with my sisters and my dad. It was cozy. And then we started hanging out, and it was like . . . it was like you brought me out into the world.\u201d At this his eyes go soft. \u201cAt first it was scary, but then I liked it too. Part of me wants to just stay next to you forever. I could easily do that. I could love you forever.\u201d</p><p>He tries to make his voice light. \u201cThen just do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I take a shaky breath. \u201cI saw you two. You were holding her; she was in your arms. I saw everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d seen everything, you\u2019d know that it wasn\u2019t anything like what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he begins. I just stare at him, and his face falls. \u201cCome on. Don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s the only way I can look at you right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGen needed me today, so I was there for her, but just as a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use, Peter. She laid claim to you a long time ago, and there\u2019s just no room for me here.\u201d My eyesight is going fuzzy with tears. I wipe my eyes with my jacket sleeve. I can\u2019t be here anymore, around him. It\u2019s hurting me too much to look at his face. \u201cI deserve better than that, you know? I deserve . . . I deserve to be someone\u2019s number one girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. She is. You\u2019re still protecting her, her secret, whatever that is. From what, though? From me? What have I ever done to her?\u201d</p><p>He spreads his hands helplessly. \u201cYou took me away from her. You became my most important person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not, though. That\u2019s the thing. She is.\u201d He sputters and tries to deny it, but there\u2019s no use. How could I believe him when the truth is right in front of me? \u201cYou know how I know she\u2019s your most important person? You pick her every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit!\u201d he explodes. \u201cWhen I found out she took that video, I told her that if she ever hurt you again, we were done.\u201d Peter\u2019s still talking, but I don\u2019t hear anything more that comes out of his mouth.</p><p>He knew.</p><p>He knew it was Genevieve who posted that video; he knew and he never told me.</p><p>Peter isn\u2019t talking anymore; he\u2019s peering at me. \u201cLara Jean? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>His face goes gray. \u201cNo! It\u2019s not like how you think. I haven\u2019t known this whole time.\u201d</p><p>I wet my lips and press them together. \u201cSo at some point you found out the truth, and you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d It\u2019s hard to breathe. \u201cYou knew how upset I was, and you kept defending her, and then you found out the truth, and you never told me.\u201d</p><p>Peter starts talking very fast. \u201cLet me explain it. It\u2019s only recently I found out Gen was behind the video. I asked her about it, and she broke down and admitted everything to me. That night at the ski trip, she saw us in the hot tub; she took the video. She\u2019s the one who sent it to Anonybitch and played it at the assembly.\u201d</p><p>I knew it, and I let myself go along with Peter and pretend not to know what I knew. And for what? For him?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been really fucked up over stuff she\u2019s going through with her family, and she was jealous, and she took it out on you and me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? What is she going through?\u201d I don\u2019t ask expecting an answer; I know he won\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m asking to prove a point.</p><p>He looks pained. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t tell you. Why do you keep putting me in a position where I have to say no to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put yourself in that position. You have her name, don\u2019t you? In the game, you have her name and she has mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares about the stupid game? Covey, we\u2019re talking about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care about the stupid game.\u201d Peter is loyal to her first, me second. It\u2019s first Genevieve, then me. That is the deal. That\u2019s always been the deal. And I\u2019m sick of it. Something clicks in my head. Suddenly I ask him, \u201cWhy was Genevieve outside that night at the ski trip? All of her friends were in the lodge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peter closes his eyes briefly. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d</p><p>I think back to that night in the woods. How he looked surprised to see me. Startled, even. He wasn\u2019t waiting for me. He was waiting for her. He still is. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gone out to apologize that night, would you have kissed her?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Those three words confirm everything for me. They take my breath away. \u201cIf I win . . . do you know what I would wish for?\u201d Don\u2019t say it, don\u2019t say it. Don\u2019t say the thing you can\u2019t take back. \u201cI\u2019d wish we never started any of this.\u201d The words echo in my head, in the air.</p> <p>He sucks in his breath. His eyes get small; so does his mouth. I\u2019ve hurt him. Is that what I wanted? I thought so, but now, looking at his face, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to win the game to have that, Covey. You can have that right now if you want it.\u201d</p><p>I reach out, put both hands on his chest. My eyes fill. \u201cYou\u2019re out. Who do you have?\u201d I already know the answer.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve.\u201d</p><p>I stand up. \u201cBye, Peter.\u201d And then I walk into my house and shut the door. I don\u2019t look back, not once.</p><p>We broke so easily. Like it was nothing. Like we were nothing. Does that mean it was never meant to be in the first place? That we were an accident of fate? If we were meant to be, how could we both walk away just like that?</p> <p>I guess the answer is, we weren\u2019t.</p><p>42</p><p>PETER AND ME, OUR BREAKUP, it\u2019s all so very high school. By that I mean it\u2019s ephemeral. Even this pain will be fleeting, finite. Even the sharp sting of this betrayal I should hold on to and remember and cherish, because it is my first true breakup. It\u2019s all just part of it, the process of falling in love. And it\u2019s not like I thought we\u2019d stay together forever; we\u2019re only sixteen and seventeen. One day I will look back on all of this fondly.</p><p>This is what I keep telling myself, even as tears are filling my eyes, even as I\u2019m lying in bed that night, crying myself to sleep. I cry until my cheeks sting from wiping away my tears. This well of sadness, it starts with Peter but it doesn\u2019t end there.</p><p>Because over and over one thought runs in my head on a loop: I miss my mother. I miss my mother. I miss her so much. If she were here, she would bring me a cup of Night-Night tea, she would sit at the foot of my bed. She would put my head in her lap, and run her fingers through my hair, and whisper in my ear, It will all be fine, Lara Jean. It will all be fine. And I would believe her, because her words were always true.</p><p>Oh, Mommy. How I miss you. Why aren\u2019t you here, when I need you most?</p> <p>So far I\u2019ve saved a napkin Peter drew a little sketch of my face on, a ticket stub from the first time we went to the movies, the poem he gave me on Valentine\u2019s Day. The necklace. Of course the necklace. I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to take it off. Not yet.</p><p>I lie in bed all day Saturday, only getting up for snacks and to let Jamie out to pee in the backyard. I fast-forward to the sad parts of romantic comedies. What I should be doing is coming up with a plan to take Genevieve out, but I can\u2019t. It hurts every time I think of her, of the game, of Peter most of all. I resolve to put it out of my mind until I can really concentrate.</p><p>John texts me once to see if I\u2019m all right, but I can\u2019t bring myself to reply. I put that off for later too.</p><p>The only time I leave the house is on Sunday afternoon to go to Belleview for a party planning committee meeting. With a little cajoling on Stormy\u2019s part, Janette has okayed my USO party idea, and the show must go on, breakups be damned.</p><p>Stormy says the whole retirement community is abuzz about it. She\u2019s particularly excited because there\u2019s been talk that Ferncliff, the other big nursing home in town, might bus over some of their residents. Stormy says they have at least one eligible widower that she knows from the seniors book club at the local library. This gets the other female residents stirred up. \u201cHe\u2019s a very distinguished silver,\u201d she keeps telling everyone. \u201cHe still drives, too!\u201d I make sure to spread that info around myself. Anything to build excitement.</p><p>At the party everyone will get five \u201cwar bonds,\u201d which you can use for a cup of whiskey punch, a little flag pin, or a dance. That was Mr. Morales\u2019s idea. Actually, his exact idea was one war bond for a dance with a lady, but we all slapped him down for being sexist and said that it should be a dance with a man or a lady. Alicia, pragmatic as ever, said, \u201cThere will be many more women than men, so it\u2019s the women who will be in charge anyway.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been going from apartment to apartment asking people to lend pictures from the forties if they have them, especially in uniform or at a USO party. One resident sniffed at me and said, \u201cExcuse me, but I was six in 1945!\u201d Hastily I told her that pictures of her parents would be welcome too, of course\u2014but she was already closing the door in my face.</p><p>Scrapbooking to the Oldies has turned into a de facto dance-planning committee. I printed out war bonds, and Mr. Morales is using my paper cutter to cut them. Maude, who is new to the group and is Internet savvy, is clipping news articles from the war to decorate the refreshments table. Her friend Claudia is working on the playlist.</p> <p>Alicia will have a little table of her own. She\u2019s making a paper-crane garland, all different-colored papers, lilac and peach and turquoise and floral. Stormy balked at the deviation from the red, white, and blue theme, but Alicia held firm and I backed her up. Classy as always, her pictures of Japanese Americans in internment camps are in fancy silver frames.</p><p>\u201cThose pictures are really going to bring the mood down,\u201d Stormy stage-whispers to me.</p><p>Alicia whirls around. \u201cThese pictures are meant to educate the ignorant.\u201d</p><p>Stormy gathers herself up to her full five feet three inches, five-six in heels. \u201cAlicia, did you just call me ignorant?\u201d I wince. Stormy\u2019s been putting a lot of work into this party, and she\u2019s been a little extra Stormy lately.</p><p>I just can\u2019t take another fight between them right now. I\u2019m about to plead for peace when Alicia fixes Stormy with a steely look and says, \u201cIf the muumuu fits.\u201d</p><p>Stormy and I both gasp. Then Stormy stalks over to Alicia\u2019s table and sweeps Alicia\u2019s paper cranes to the floor with a flourish. Alicia screams, and I gasp again. Everyone else in the room looks up. \u201cStormy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking her side? She just called me ignorant! Stormy Sinclair might be a lot of things, but I am not ignorant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking anybody\u2019s side,\u201d I say, bending down to pick up the paper cranes.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re taking a side, it should be mine,\u201d Alicia says.

Was it over another boy?\u201d She looks hopeful, and I know she is thinking of John.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t over another boy. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, it\u2019s never that complicated,\u201d Stormy says. \u201cIn my day\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alicia glares at her. \u201cWill you just let her talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter never got over his ex-girlfriend, Genevieve,\u201d I say, sniffling. \u201cShe was the one who posted that video of us in the hot tub, and Peter found out and he didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he wanted to spare your feelings,\u201d Alicia says.</p><p>Vehemently Stormy shakes her head, so hard her earrings whoosh. \u201cThe boy is a dog, pure and simple. He ought to treat you like a queen, not this other girl Genevieve.\u201d</p> <p>Alicia accuses, \u201cYou just want Lara Jean to date your great-grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if I do!\u201d With a gleam in her eye she says, \u201cSay, Lara Jean. Have you got any plans tonight?\u201d</p><p>At that we all laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t think about any boy but Peter right now,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you still remember your first love?\u201d</p><p>Stormy\u2019s had so many\u2014could she possibly? But she nods. \u201cGarrett O\u2019Leary. I was fifteen and he was eighteen and we only ever had a dance, but the way I felt when he looked at me . . .\u201d She shivers.</p><p>I look to my left at Alicia. \u201cAnd yours was your husband, Phillip, right?\u201d</p><p>To my surprise she shakes her head. \u201cMy first love was named Albert. He was my older brother\u2019s best friend. I thought I would marry him. But it was not to be. I met my Phillip.\u201d She smiles. \u201cPhillip was the love of my life. And yet I never forgot Albert. How young I was once! Stormy, can you believe we were ever so young?\u201d</p><p>Stormy does not give her usual blithe reply. Her eyes go moist, and as softly as I\u2019ve ever heard her speak she says, \u201cIt\u2019s all a million lifetimes ago. And yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Alicia echoes.</p> <p>They both smile at me fondly, with such true and genuine affection that new tears come to my eyes. \u201cWhat will I do now that Peter\u2019s not my boyfriend anymore?\u201d I wonder out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just do what you did before he was your boyfriend,\u201d Alicia says. \u201cYou\u2019ll go about your day, and you will miss him at first, but over time it will ease. It will lessen.\u201d She reaches out, touches her papery hand to my cheek. A smile plays at her lips. \u201cAll you need is time, and you, little one, have all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a comforting thought, but I don\u2019t know if I believe it is true, not completely. I think that time might be different for young people. The minutes longer, stronger, more vibrant. All I know is that every minute without him feels interminably long, like I\u2019m waiting, just waiting for him to come back to me. I, Lara Jean, know he isn\u2019t, but my heart doesn\u2019t seem to understand it\u2019s over.</p><p>After, energies renewed, tears dried, I am with Janette in her office, going over party details. When she offhandedly mentions the sitting room, I freeze. \u201cJanette, the sitting room isn\u2019t going to be big enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you. The main activities room is booked for bingo. They have a standing Friday night reservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this party is a huge event! Can\u2019t the bingo people be in the sitting room just for one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, I can\u2019t move bingo. People from all over the community come here for that, including the leasing agent\u2019s own mother. There are a lot of politics at play here. My hands are tied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what about the dining room?\u201d We could move all the tables and set up the dance floor at the center of the room and then put the refreshments on a long table against the wall. It could work.</p><p>Janette gives me a look like Girl, please. \u201cAnd who\u2019s going to put away all the tables and chairs? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, me, and I\u2019m sure I could round up some volunteers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have one of the residents put out their back and sue the home? No, gracias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t need to put away all of the tables, just half. Couldn\u2019t you get the staff to help?\u201d Janette\u2019s already shaking her head when inspiration hits me. \u201cJanette, I heard that Ferncliff might bus over some of their residents. Ferncliff. They already call themselves the premier retirement community of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Ferncliff is a dump. The people who work at that place are garbage. I have a master\u2019s. \u2018Premier retirement community of the Blue Ridge Mountains\u2019? Ha! My ass.\u201d</p><p>Now I just need to bring it home. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Janette, if this dance isn\u2019t up to par, it\u2019s going to make us look like fools. We can\u2019t let that happen. I want those Ferncliff residents to walk or wheel out of here wishing they were Belleview!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019ll get the janitors to help set up the dining room.\u201d Janette shakes her finger at me. \u201cYou\u2019re like a dog with a bone, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t regret it,\u201d I promise her. \u201cFor the pictures alone. We\u2019ll put them all over the website. Everyone will want to be us!\u201d</p><p>At this Janette\u2019s eyes narrow with satisfaction, and I let out the breath I\u2019ve been holding. This party has to go right. It just has to. It is my one bright spot.</p><p>43</p><p>SUNDAY NIGHT I CURL MY hair. Curling your hair is an intrinsically hopeful act. I like to curl mine at night and think about all the things that could happen tomorrow. Also, it generally looks much better slept on and not so poofy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve got half of it clipped and I\u2019m almost done with one side when Chris comes climbing through my window. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be grounded right now, so I have to wait until my mom falls asleep before I go home,\u201d she says, taking off her motorcycle jacket. \u201cAre you still depressed over Kavinsky?\u201d</p><p>I wind another section of hair around the curling iron barrel. \u201cYes. I mean, it hasn\u2019t even been forty-eight hours yet.\u201d</p><p>Chris puts her arm around me. \u201cI hate to say it, but this has been a train wreck from the start.\u201d</p><p>I give her a wounded look. \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. The way you guys got together was weird, and then the whole hot tub video thing.\u201d She takes the curling iron from me and starts curling her own hair. \u201cAlthough, I will say that it was probably good for you to go through all that. You were really sheltered, hon. You can be very judgmental.\u201d</p><p>I snatch the curling iron back from her and make like I\u2019m going to bonk her over the head with it. \u201cAre you here to cheer me up or to tell me all of my flaws?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry! I\u2019m just saying.\u201d She offers me a cheery smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad for too long. It\u2019s not your style. There are other guys besides Kavinsky. Guys who aren\u2019t my cousin\u2019s sloppy seconds. Guys like John McClaren. He\u2019s hot. I\u2019d go for him myself if he wasn\u2019t into you.\u201d</p><p>Softly, I say, \u201cI can\u2019t think about anyone else right now. Peter and I just broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s heat between you and Johnny boy. I saw it with my own two eyes at the time capsule thing. He wants you.\u201d She bumps her shoulder against mine. \u201cYou liked him before. Maybe there\u2019s still something there.\u201d</p> <p>I ignore her and keep curling my hair, one lock at a time.</p><p>Peter still sits in front of me in chemistry. I didn\u2019t know you could miss someone even more acutely when they\u2019re only a few feet away. Maybe it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t look at me, not even once. I didn\u2019t fully comprehend what a big part of my life he\u2019d become. He\u2019d become so . . . familiar to me. And now he\u2019s just gone. Not gone, still here, just not available to me, which might be even worse. For a minute there it was really good. It was really, really good. Wasn\u2019t it good? Maybe really, really good things aren\u2019t meant to last for too long; maybe that\u2019s what makes them all the more sweet, the temporariness of them. Maybe I\u2019m just trying to make myself feel better. It\u2019s working, barely. Barely is enough for now.</p><p>After class is over, Peter lingers at his desk, and then he turns around and says, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>My heart leaps. \u201cHey.\u201d I have this sudden, wild thought that if he wants me back, I\u2019ll say yes. Forget my pride, forget Genevieve, forget it all.</p><p>\u201cSo I want my necklace back,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>My fingers fly to the heart locket hanging from around my neck. I wanted to take it off this morning, but I couldn\u2019t bear to.</p> <p>Now I have to give it back? Stormy has a whole box of trinkets and tokens from old boyfriends. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to return my one token from a boy. But it was expensive, and Peter is practical. He could get his money back, and his mom could resell it. \u201cOf course,\u201d I say, fumbling with the clasp.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean you had to give it back right this second,\u201d he says, and my hand stills. Maybe he\u2019ll let me keep it awhile longer, or even forever. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t get the clasp undone, and it\u2019s taking forever, and it\u2019s excruciating because he\u2019s just standing there. Finally he comes up behind me and pulls my hair away from my neck so it rests on one shoulder. It might be my imagination, but I think I hear his heart beating. His is beating and mine feels like it\u2019s breaking.</p><p>44</p><p>KITTY FLIES INTO MY BEDROOM. I\u2019m at my desk, doing homework. It\u2019s been so long since I sat here and did homework; Peter and I usually go to Starbucks after school. Life is lonely already.</p><p>\u201cDid you and Peter break up?\u201d Kitty demands.</p><p>I flinch. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just answer the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell . . . yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve him,\u201d she spits out.</p><p>I reel backward in my seat. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re my sister\u2014it\u2019s not fair for you to take Peter\u2019s side. You haven\u2019t even heard my side. Not that you should have to. Don\u2019t you know that you never take a side against your sister?\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s your side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy side is, it\u2019s complicated. Peter still has feelings for Genevieve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think of her that way anymore. Don\u2019t make an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see what I saw, Kitty!\u201d I burst out.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d she challenges, chin thrust out like a weapon. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just what I saw. It\u2019s what I knew all along. Just\u2014never mind. You wouldn\u2019t understand it, Kitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see him kiss her? Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing.\u201d She squints at me. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with that guy with the weird name? John Amberton McClaren or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Why would you say that?\u201d I let out a gasp. \u201cWait a minute! Have you been reading my letters again?\u201d</p><p>She screws up her face, and I know she has, the fiend. \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject! Do you like him or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with John McClaren. It\u2019s just about me and Peter.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell her that he knew it was Genevieve who made that video, spread it around. He knew and he still protected her. But I can\u2019t mar her little-girl notion of who Peter is. It would be too cruel a thing to do to her. \u201cKitty, it doesn\u2019t matter. Peter still has feelings for Genevieve, and I\u2019ve always known it. And besides, what\u2019s even the point of a serious thing with Peter when we\u2019re only going to break up like Margot and Josh did? High school romances hardly ever last, you know. And for a good reason. We\u2019re too young to be so serious.\u201d Even as I\u2019m saying the words, tears are leaking out the corners of my eyes.</p><p>Kitty softens. She puts her arm around me. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying. I\u2019m tearing up a little.\u201d</p><p>Sighing heavily, she says, \u201cIf this is love, no thanks. I don\u2019t want any part of it. When I\u2019m older, I\u2019m just going to do my own thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Kitty shrugs. \u201cIf I like a boy, fine, I\u2019ll date him, but I\u2019m not going to sit at home and cry over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty, don\u2019t act like you never cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cry over important things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cried the other night because Daddy wouldn\u2019t let you stay up to watch TV!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, that was important to me.\u201d</p><p>I sniffle. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m arguing over this stuff with you.\u201d She\u2019s too little to understand. Part of me hopes she never does. It was better when I didn\u2019t.</p><p>That night, Daddy and I are doing the dishes when he clears his throat and says, \u201cSo Kitty told me about the big breakup. How are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>I rinse off a glass and set it in the dishwasher. \u201cKitty has such a big mouth. I was going to tell you about it later.\u201d Maybe deep down I was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it? I can make some Night-Night tea. Not as good as Mommy\u2019s, but still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later,\u201d I say, just to be kind. His version of Night-Night tea isn\u2019t the best.</p><p>He puts his arm around my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019ll get easier, I promise. Peter Kavinsky isn\u2019t the only boy in the world.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I say, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to hurt like this ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to protect yourself against heartbreak, Lara Jean. That\u2019s just a part of life.\u201d He kisses me on the top of my head. \u201cGo upstairs and rest. I\u2019ll finish up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Daddy.\u201d I leave him alone in the kitchen, humming to himself as he dries a pan with a dishcloth.</p> <p>My dad said Peter isn\u2019t the only boy in the world. I know this is true, of course it\u2019s true. But look at Daddy. My mom was the only girl in the world for him. If she wasn\u2019t, he\u2019d have found somebody new by now. Maybe he\u2019s been trying to protect himself from heartbreak too. Maybe we\u2019re more alike than I ever realized.</p><p>45</p><p>IT\u2019S RAINING AGAIN. I\u2019D HAD the thought that I might take Kitty and Jamie to the park after school, but that\u2019s out now. Instead I sit in bed and curl my hair and watch the rain shoot down like silver pellets. Weather to match my mood, I suppose.</p><p>In the midst of our breakup, I forgot about the game. Well, now I\u2019m remembering all too well. I will win. I will take her out. She can\u2019t have Peter and win the game. It\u2019s too unfair. And I will think of some perfect wish, some perfect something to take from her. If only I knew what to wish for!</p><p>I need help. I call Chris, and she doesn\u2019t pick up. I\u2019m about to call again, but at the last second I text John:</p><p>Will you help me take out Genevieve?</p><p>It takes a few minutes for him to write back.</p><p>It would be my honor.</p> <p>John settles into the couch and leans forward, looking at me intently. \u201cAll right, so how do you want to do this? Do you want to flush her out? Go black ops on her?\u201d</p><p>I set down a glass of sweet tea in front of him. Sitting next to him, I say, \u201cI think we have to run surveillance on her first. I don\u2019t even know what her schedule is like.\u201d And . . . if in winning this game, I find out her big secret, well, that would be a nice bonus.</p><p>\u201cI like where your head is at,\u201d John says, tipping his head back and drinking his tea.</p><p>\u201cI know where they keep the emergency key. Chris and I had to pick up a vacuum cleaner from her house once. What if . . . what if I try to get under her skin? Like I could leave a note on her pillow that says I\u2019m watching you. That would really creep her out.\u201d</p><p>John nearly chokes on his iced tea. \u201cWait, what would that even get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019re the expert at this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpert? How am I an expert? If I was really any good, I\u2019d still be in the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could have known I\u2019d be at Belleview,\u201d I point out. \u201cThat was just your bad luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot of coincidences. Belleview. You being at Model UN that day.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my hands. \u201cThat . . . wasn\u2019t a total coincidence. It actually wasn\u2019t a coincidence at all. I went there looking for you. I wanted to see how you turned out. I knew you\u2019d be in Model UN. I remembered how much you liked it in middle school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I joined was so I could work on my public speaking. For my stutter.\u201d He stops. \u201cWait. Did you say you went there for me? To see how I turned out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I . . . I always wondered.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s not saying anything; he\u2019s just staring at me. He sets down his glass abruptly. Then he picks it back up and puts a coaster under it. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said what happened with you and Kavinsky that night after I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. We broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke up,\u201d he repeats, his face blank.</p><p>That\u2019s when I notice Kitty lurking in the doorway like a little spy. \u201cWhat do you want, Kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . is there any red pepper hummus left?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014go check.\u201d</p><p>John is wide-eyed. \u201cThis is your little sister?\u201d To Kitty he says, \u201cThe last time I saw you, you were still a little kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I grew up,\u201d she says, not even a little bit nicely.</p><p>I throw her a look. \u201cBe polite to our guest.\u201d Kitty turns on her heels and runs upstairs. \u201cSorry about my sister. She\u2019s really close with Peter and she gets crazy ideas. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy ideas?\u201d John repeats.</p><p>I could slap myself. \u201cYeah, I mean, she thinks that something\u2019s going on with us. But obviously there isn\u2019t, and you don\u2019t, like, like me like that, so, yeah, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d Like, why do I speak? Why did God give me a mouth if I\u2019m just going to say dumb stuff with it?</p><p>It\u2019s so quiet I open my mouth to say more dumb stuff, but then he says, \u201cWell . . . it\u2019s not that crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! I mean, I didn\u2019t mean crazy\u2014\u201d My mouth snaps shut, and I stare straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that time we played spin the bottle in my basement?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI was nervous to kiss you, because I\u2019d never kissed a girl before,\u201d he says, and picks up the glass of sweet tea again. He takes a swig, but there\u2019s no tea left, just ice. His eyes meet mine, and he grins. \u201cAll the guys gave me such a hard time afterward for whiffing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t whiff it,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think that was around when Trevor\u2019s old brother told us he made a girl . . .\u201d John hesitates, and I nod eagerly so he\u2019ll go on. \u201cHe claimed he gave a girl an orgasm just by kissing her.\u201d</p><p>I let out a shrieky laugh and clap my hands to my mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest lie I ever heard! I never saw him talk to even one girl. Besides, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even possible. And if it was possible, I highly doubt Sean Pike was capable of it.\u201d</p><p>John laughs too. \u201cWell, I know it\u2019s a lie now, but at the time we all believed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, was it a great kiss? No, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d John winces and I quickly continue. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t an altogether terrible one. I swear. And listen, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m an expert on kissing anyway. Who am I to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay okay, you can stop trying to make me feel better.\u201d He sets down his glass. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten much better at it. That\u2019s what the girls tell me.\u201d</p><p>This conversation has taken a strange and confessional turn, and I\u2019m nervous but not in a bad way. I like sharing secrets, being coconspirators. \u201cOh, so you\u2019ve kissed that many, huh?\u201d</p><p>He laughs again. \u201cA respectable number.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you even remember that day. You were so into Kavinsky, I don\u2019t think you even noticed who else was there.\u201d</p><p>I push him in the shoulder. \u201cI was not \u2018so into Kavinsky\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you were. You kept your eyes on that bottle the whole game, like this.\u201d John picks up the bottle and lasers his eyes at it. \u201cWaiting for your moment.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m bright red, I know I am. \u201cOh, be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he says, \u201cLike a hawk on its prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Now I\u2019m laughing too. \u201cHow do you even remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was doing the same thing,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou were staring at Peter too?\u201d I say it like a joke, to tease, because this is fun. For the first time in days I\u2019m having fun.</p><p>He looks right at me, navy-blue eyes sure and steady, and my breath catches in my chest. \u201cNo. I was looking at you.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a humming in my ears, and it\u2019s the sound of my heart beating in triple measure. In memory, everything seems to happen to music. One of my favorite lines from The Glass Menagerie. If I close my eyes I can almost hear it, that day in John Ambrose McClaren\u2019s basement. Years from now, when I look back on this moment, what music will I hear then?</p><p>His eyes hold mine, and I feel a flutter that starts in my throat and moves across my collarbone and chest. \u201cI like you, Lara Jean. I liked you then and I like you even more now. I know you and Kavinsky just broke up, and you\u2019re still sad, but I just want to make it unequivocally clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . okay,\u201d I whisper. His words\u2014they come clearly; they don\u2019t miss in either direction. Not even a trace of a stutter. Just\u2014unequivocally clear.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Let\u2019s win you a wish.\u201d He takes out his phone and pulls up Google Maps. \u201cI looked up Gen\u2019s address before I came over here. I think you\u2019re right\u2014we should take our time, assess the situation. Not go in half-cocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I\u2019m in a sort of dream state; it\u2019s hard to concentrate. John Ambrose McClaren wants to make it unequivocally clear.</p><p>I snap out of it when Kitty jostles her way back into the living room, balancing a glass of orange soda, the tub of red pepper hummus, and a bag of pita chips. She makes her way over to the couch and plonks down right between us. Holding out the bag, she asks, \u201cDo you guys want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d John says, taking a chip. \u201cHey, I hear you\u2019re pretty good at schemes. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>Warily she says, \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who sent out Lara Jean\u2019s letters, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Kitty nods. \u201cThen I\u2019d say you\u2019re pretty good at schemes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah. I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. We need your help.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s ideas are a bit too extreme\u2014like slashing Genevieve\u2019s tires, or throwing a stink bomb in her house to smoke her out, but John writes down every one of Kitty\u2019s suggestions, which does not go unnoticed by Kitty. Very little does.</p><p>46</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, KITTY IS dawdling over her peanut butter toast, and from behind his newspaper, Daddy says, \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss the bus if you don\u2019t hurry.\u201d</p><p>She merely shrugs and takes her time going upstairs to get her book bag. I\u2019m sure she thinks she can just catch a ride with me if she misses the bus, but I\u2019m running late too. I overslept and then I couldn\u2019t find my favorite jeans so I had to settle for my second favorite.</p><p>As I\u2019m rinsing my cereal bowl, I look out the window and see Kitty\u2019s school bus drive by. \u201cYou missed the bus!\u201d I yell upstairs.</p><p>No reply.</p><p>I stuff my lunch in my bag and call out, \u201cIf you\u2019re coming with me, you\u2019d better hustle! Bye, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m putting on my shoes by the front door when Kitty shoots right past me and out the door, book bag bouncing against her shoulder. I follow after her and close the door behind me. And there, across the street, leaning against his black Audi, is Peter. He grins broadly at Kitty, and I stand there just completely blindsided. My first thought is, Is he here to see me? No, couldn\u2019t be. My second thought is, Could this be a trap? My eyes dart around, looking for any sign of Genevieve. There is none, and I feel guilty for thinking he could ever be that cruel.</p><p>Kitty waves madly and runs up to him. \u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to go, kid?\u201d he asks her.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d She turns back to look at me. \u201cLara Jean, you can come with us. I\u2019ll sit in your lap.\u201d</p><p>Peter is looking at his phone, and what little hope I had that maybe he partly came to see me is dashed. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s only room for two.\u201d</p><p>He opens the passenger-side door for her, and Kitty scrambles in. \u201cGo fast,\u201d she tells him.</p><p>He barely spares me a glance before they\u2019re gone. Well. I suppose that\u2019s that, then.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of cake are you making me?\u201d Kitty sits on a stool and watches me. I\u2019m baking the cake tonight so it\u2019s all set for tomorrow\u2019s party. I\u2019ve got it in my head that Kitty\u2019s slumber party has to be just the best night ever, partly because the party is so belated and should therefore be worth the wait, and partly because ten is a big year in a girl\u2019s life. Kitty may not have a mom, but she will have a spectacular birthday sleepover if I\u2019ve got anything to do with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you, it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d I dump my premeasured flour into a mixing bowl. \u201cSo how was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I got an A-minus on my math quiz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yay! Anything else cool happen?\u201d</p><p>Kitty shrugs her shoulders. \u201cI think Ms. Bertoli accidentally farted when she was taking attendance. Everybody laughed.\u201d</p> <p>Baking powder, salt. \u201cCool, cool. Did, um, Peter drive you straight to school, or did you stop somewhere along the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took me to get donuts.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. Did he say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Life.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty rolls her eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything about you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering about.\u201d</p><p>This stings. \u201cI wasn\u2019t wondering about that at all,\u201d I lie.</p><p>Kitty and I have the whole sleepover planned down to a T. Zombie makeovers. Photo booth with props. Nail art.</p><p>I chose Kitty\u2019s cake with utmost care. It\u2019s chocolate with raspberry jam and white chocolate frosting. I\u2019ve made three different kinds of dips. Sour cream and onion, red pepper hummus, and cold spinach dip. Crudit\u00e9s. Pigs in a blanket. Salty caramel popcorn for the movie. Lime sherbet punch, the kind you pour ginger ale over. I even scrounged up an old glass punch bowl in the attic, which will also be perfect for the USO theme party. For breakfast in the morning I\u2019m making chocolate chip pancakes. I know all of these details are important to Kitty, too. Already she\u2019s mentioned to me that at Brielle\u2019s birthday, her mom made strawberry smoothies for their snack, and who could forget how Alicia Bernard\u2019s mom made crepes when she\u2019s mentioning it all the time?</p><p>Daddy\u2019s banished to his room for the night, which he looks relieved about\u2014but not before I made him drag down the little vintage chest of drawers I have in my room. I artfully arrange my collection of nightgowns and pj\u2019s and footie long underwear, plus fuzzy slippers. Between Kitty, Margot, and me, we have a lot of fuzzy slippers.</p><p>Everyone changes into pajamas right away, giggling and screaming and fighting over who gets what.</p> <p>I am wearing a pale pink peignoir set I got from a thrift store brand-new with the tags still on. I feel like Doris Day in The Pajama Game. The only thing I\u2019m missing are furry slippers with a kitten heel. I tried to convince Kitty that we should have an old movie night, but she shot that idea down right away. To be funny, I put my hair in rollers. I offer to put the girls\u2019 hair in rollers too, but everyone shrieks and says no.</p><p>They\u2019re so loud I keep having to say, \u201cGirls, girls!\u201d</p><p>Halfway into the mani session I notice that Kitty is hanging back. I thought she\u2019d be in her element, belle of the birthday ball, but she\u2019s ill at ease and playing with Jamie.</p><p>When all the girls run upstairs to my room to do the mud packs I\u2019ve prepared, I grab Kitty\u2019s elbow. \u201cAre you having fun?\u201d I ask. She nods and tries to dart away, but I give her stern eyes. \u201cSister swear?\u201d</p><p>Kitty hesitates. \u201cShanae\u2019s gotten really good friends with Sophie,\u201d she says, her eyes welling up. \u201cLike better friends than me and her. Did you see how they did matching manicures? They didn\u2019t ask me if I wanted to do matching manicures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they meant to leave you out,\u201d I say.</p><p>She shrugs her bony shoulders.</p><p>I put my arm around her, and she just stands there stiffly, so I push her head down on my shoulder. \u201cIt can be tough with best friendships. You\u2019re both growing and changing, and it\u2019s hard to grow and change at the same rate.\u201d</p> <p>Her head pops up, and I push it back down on my shoulder. \u201cIs that what happened with you and Genevieve?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know what happened with me and Genevieve. She moved away, and we were still friends, and then we weren\u2019t.\u201d I realize belatedly that it\u2019s not the most comforting thing to say to someone who\u2019s feeling left out by her friends. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that will never happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Kitty lets out a defeated little sigh. \u201cWhy can\u2019t things just stay the same as before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen nothing would ever change and you wouldn\u2019t grow up; you would have stayed nine forever and never have turned ten.\u201d</p><p>She wipes her nose with the back of her arm. \u201cI might not mind that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d never get to drive, or go to college, or buy a house and adopt a bunch of dogs. I know you want to do all that stuff. You have an adventurous spirit, and being a kid can get in the way of that, because you have to get other people\u2019s permission. When you\u2019re older, you can do what you want and you won\u2019t have to ask anybody.\u201d</p><p>Sighing she says, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>I smooth her hair away from her forehead. \u201cWant me to put on a movie for you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA horror one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s perking up, going into bargaining mode like the business lady she is. \u201cIt has to be rated R. No kid stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but if you guys get scared, you aren\u2019t sleeping with me in my room. Last time you guys kept me up all night. And if any parents call to complain, I\u2019m telling them you guys snuck the movie on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>I watch her fly up the stairs. Impossible as she is, I like Kitty just as she is. I wouldn\u2019t have minded if she\u2019d stayed nine forever. Kitty\u2019s cares are still manageable; they can fit in the palm of my hand. I like that she still depends on me for things. Her cares and her needs make me forget my own. I like that I am needed, that I am beholden to somebody. This breakup with Peter, it\u2019s not as big as Katherine Song Covey turning ten. She has sprung up like a weed, without a mother, just two sisters and a dad. That is no small feat. That\u2019s something extraordinary.</p><p>But ten, wow. Ten isn\u2019t a little girl anymore. It\u2019s right in between. The thought of her getting older, outgrowing her toys, her art set . . . it makes me feel a bit melancholy. Growing up really is bittersweet.</p><p>My phone buzzes, and it\u2019s a pitiful text from Daddy:</p><p>Is it safe to come downstairs? I\u2019m so thirsty.</p><p>Coast is clear.</p><p>Roger that.</p><p>47</p><p>FOLLOWING GENEVIEVE AROUND IS A strangely familiar feeling. Nothing little observations come flooding back. It\u2019s a heady combination of the things I used to know about her and the things I don\u2019t. She goes through the drive-thru at Wendy\u2019s, and without even looking, I know what\u2019s in the bag. Small Frosty, small fries to dip, six-piece chicken nuggets, also to dip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>John and I follow Genevieve around town for a bit, but we lose her at a stoplight so we just head over to Belleview. There\u2019s a USO party planning meeting I have to get to. With the party so close, we\u2019re all doubling our efforts to have everything ready in time. Belleview has become my solace, my safe place throughout all this. In part because Genevieve doesn\u2019t know about it, so she can\u2019t tag me out, but also because it\u2019s the one place I won\u2019t run into her and Peter, free to do whatever they want together now that he\u2019s single again.</p><p>It starts snowing at the beginning of our meeting. Everyone crowds around the windows to look, shaking their heads and saying, \u201cSnow in April! Can you believe it?\u201d and then we go back to work on USO decorations. John helps with the banner.</p><p>By the time we\u2019re done, there are a few inches of snow on the ground, and the snow has turned to ice. \u201cJohnny, you can\u2019t drive in this weather. I absolutely forbid it,\u201d Stormy says.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d John says. \u201cI\u2019m a good driver.\u201d</p> <p>Stormy delivers a stinging smack on his arm. \u201cI told you never to call me Grandma! Just Stormy. The answer is no. I\u2019m putting my foot down. The both of you will stay at Belleview tonight. It\u2019s far too dangerous.\u201d She sends me a stern look. \u201cLara Jean, you call your father right now and tell him I won\u2019t allow you out in this weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can come get us,\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cAnd have that poor widower get into a car accident on the way here? No. I won\u2019t have it. Give me your phone. I\u2019ll call him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014there\u2019s school tomorrow,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCancelled,\u201d Stormy says with a smile. \u201cThey just announced it on the TV.\u201d</p> <p>I protest, \u201cI don\u2019t have any of my things! No toothbrush, or pajamas, or anything!\u201d</p><p>She puts her arm around me. \u201cLie back and let Stormy take care of everything. Don\u2019t you worry your pretty little head.\u201d</p><p>So that is how it came to be that John Ambrose McClaren and I are spending the night together at a retirement home.</p><p>A snowstorm in April is a magical thing. Even if it is because of climate change. A few pink flowers have already sprouted in the gardens outside Stormy\u2019s living room window, and snow is shaking down on it hard, the way Kitty shakes powdered sugar on pancakes\u2014fast and a lot. Soon you can\u2019t even see the pink of the flowers; it\u2019s all just covered in white.</p><p>We\u2019re playing checkers in Stormy\u2019s living room, the big kind of checkers you can buy at Cracker Barrel. John has beaten me twice and he keeps asking me if I\u2019m hustling him. I\u2019m coy about it, but the answer is no, he\u2019s just better than me at checkers. Stormy serves us pi\u00f1a coladas that she mixes in her blender with \u201cjust a splash of rum to warm us up,\u201d and she microwaves frozen spanakopita that neither of us touches. Bing Crosby is playing on her stereo. By nine thirty Stormy is yawning and saying she\u2019ll need her beauty sleep soon. John and I exchange a look\u2014it\u2019s still so early, and I don\u2019t know the last time I went to bed before midnight.</p><p>Stormy insists I stay with her and John stay with Mr. Morales in his spare bedroom. I can tell John isn\u2019t crazy about this idea, because he asks, \u201cCan\u2019t I just sleep on your floor?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m surprised when Stormy shakes her head. \u201cI hardly think Lara Jean\u2019s father would appreciate that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think my dad would mind, Stormy,\u201d I say. \u201cI could call him if you want.\u201d</p><p>But the answer is a firm and resounding no: John must bunk with Mr. Morales. For a lady who\u2019s always telling me to be wild and have adventures and bring the condom, she\u2019s far more old-fashioned than I thought.</p><p>Stormy hands John a face towel and a pair of foam earplugs. \u201cMr. Morales snores,\u201d she tells him as she kisses him good night.</p><p>John raises an eyebrow at her. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know!\u201d She shimmies off into the kitchen like the grand dame she truly is.</p><p>In a low voice John says to me, \u201cYou know what? I really, really wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I bite the cushiony part of my cheek to keep from laughing.</p> <p>\u201cKeep your phone on vibrate,\u201d John says before he goes out the door. \u201cI\u2019ll text you.\u201d</p><p>I hear the sound of Stormy snoring and the whispery sound of icy snowflakes hitting the windowsill. I keep getting twisted up in Stormy\u2019s sleeping bag, twisted and hot and wishing Stormy didn\u2019t have the heat turned up so high. Old people are always complaining about how cold it is at Belleview, how the heat is \u201cpiss-poor,\u201d as Danny in the Azalea building says. Feels plenty hot to me. Stormy\u2019s peach high-neck satin nightgown she insisted I wear isn\u2019t helping matters. I\u2019m lying on my side, playing Candy Crush on my phone, wondering when John will hurry up and text me.</p><p>Wanna play in the snow?</p><p>I text back right away:</p><p>YES! It\u2019s really hot in here.</p><p>Meet me in the hallway in two min?</p><p>K.</p><p>I stand up so fast in my sleeping bag I nearly trip. I use my phone to find my coat, my boots. Stormy is snoring away. I can\u2019t find my scarf, but I don\u2019t want to keep John waiting, so I run out without it.</p><p>He\u2019s already in the hallway waiting for me. His hair is sticking up in the back, and on that basis alone I think I could fall in love with him if I let myself. When he sees me, he holds his arms out and sings, \u201cDo you want to build a snowman?\u201d and I burst out laughing so hard John says, \u201cShh, you\u2019re going to wake up the residents!\u201d which only makes me laugh harder. \u201cIt\u2019s only ten thirty!\u201d</p><p>We run down the long carpeted hallway, both of us laughing as quietly as we can. But the more you try to laugh quietly, the harder it is to stop. \u201cI can\u2019t stop laughing,\u201d I gasp as we run through the sliding doors and to the courtyard.</p><p>We\u2019re both out of breath; we both stop short.</p><p>The ground is blanketed in thick white snow, thick as sheep\u2019s wool. It\u2019s so beautiful and hushed, my heart almost hurts with the pleasure of it. I\u2019m so happy in this moment, and I realize it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t thought of Peter once. I turn to look at John, and he\u2019s already looking at me with a half smile on his face. It gives me a nervous flutter in my chest.</p><p>I spin around in a circle and sing, \u201cDo you want to build a snowman?\u201d And then we\u2019re both giggling again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get us kicked out of here,\u201d he warns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grab his hands and make him spin around with me as fast as I can. \u201cQuit acting like you really belong in a nursing home, old man!\u201d I yell.</p><p>He drops my hands and we both stumble. Then he grabs a fistful of snow off the ground and starts to pack it into a ball. \u201cOld man, huh? I\u2019ll show you an old man!\u201d</p><p>I dart away from him, slipping and sliding in the snow. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare, John Ambrose McClaren!\u201d</p><p>He chases after me, laughing and breathing hard. He manages to grab me around the waist and raises his arm like he\u2019s going to put the snowball down my back, but at the last second he releases me. His eyes go wide. \u201cOh my God. Are you wearing my grandma\u2019s nightgown under your coat?\u201d</p> <p>Giggling, I say, \u201cWanna see? It\u2019s really racy.\u201d I start to unzip my coat. \u201cWait, turn around first.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, John says, \u201cThis is weird,\u201d but he obeys. As soon as his back is turned, I snatch a handful of snow, form it into a ball, and put it in my coat pocket.</p><p>\u201cOkay, turn around.\u201d</p><p>John turns, and I lob the snowball directly at his head. It hits him in the eye. \u201cOuch!\u201d he yelps, wiping it with his coat sleeve.</p><p>I gasp and move toward him. \u201cOh my God. I\u2019m so sorry. Are you okay\u2014\u201d</p> <p>John\u2019s already scooping up more snow and lunging toward me. And so begins our snowball fight. We chase each other around, and I get in another great hit square in his back. We call a truce when I nearly slip and fall on my butt. Luckily, John catches me just in time. He doesn\u2019t let go right away. We stare at each other for a second, his arm around my waist. There\u2019s a snowflake on his eyelashes. He says, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you were still hung up on Kavinsky, I would kiss you right now.\u201d</p><p>I shiver. Up until Peter, the most romantic thing that ever happened to me was with John Ambrose McClaren, in the rain, with the soccer balls. Now this. How strange that I\u2019ve never even dated John, and he\u2019s in two of my most romantic moments.</p><p>John releases me. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing. Let\u2019s go back inside.\u201d</p><p>We go to the parlor on Stormy\u2019s floor to sit and thaw out. There\u2019s only one reading light on, so it\u2019s dim and quiet. All the residents are in their apartments for the night, it seems. It feels strange to be here without Stormy and everyone, like being at school at night. We sit on the fancy French-style couch, and I take off my boots so my feet can get warm. I wriggle my toes to get the feeling back.</p><p>\u201cToo bad we can\u2019t start a fire,\u201d John says, stretching his arms and looking at the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fake,\u201d I say. \u201cThere must be some sort of nursing-home law about fireplaces, I bet. . . .\u201d My voice trails off as I see Stormy, in her silky kimono, tiptoeing out of her apartment and down the hall. To Mr. Morales\u2019s apartment. Oh my God.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d John asks, and I slap my hand over his mouth. I duck down low in my seat and slide all the way off the couch to the floor. I pull him down next to me. We stay down until I hear the door click closed. He whispers, \u201cWhat is it? What did you see?\u201d</p><p>Sitting up, I whisper back, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God. What? Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Stormy in her red kimono, sneaking into Mr. Morales\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p><p>John chokes. \u201cOh my God. That\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>I give him sympathetic eyes. \u201cI know. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he leans back against the couch, his legs stretched out long in front of him. \u201cWow. This is rich. My great-grandmother has a way more active sex life than I do.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t resist asking, \u201cSo then . . . I guess, have you not had sex with that many girls?\u201d Hastily I say, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m a very inquisitive person.\u201d I scratch my cheek. \u201cSome might say nosy. You don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll answer. I\u2019ve never had sex with anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I can\u2019t believe it. How can that be?</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so shocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess I thought all guys were doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve only had one girlfriend, and she was religious, so we never did it, which was fine. Anyway, trust me, not all guys are having sex. I\u2019d say the majority aren\u2019t.\u201d John pauses. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done it either,\u201d I say.</p><p>He frowns, confused. \u201cWait, I thought you and Kavinsky . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would you think that?\u201d Oh. The video. I swallow. I thought maybe he was the one person who hadn\u2019t seen it. \u201cSo you\u2019ve seen the hot tub video, huh.\u201d</p><p>John hesitates and then, says, \u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t know it was you at first, not until after the time capsule party when I figured out you guys were together. Some guy showed it to me in homeroom, but I didn\u2019t look at it that closely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just kissing,\u201d I say, ducking my head. \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I liked the thought of you looking at me a certain kind of way. I feel like people see me differently now, but you still thought of me as the old Lara Jean. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is how I see you,\u201d John says. \u201cYou\u2019re still the same to me. I\u2019ll always see you that way, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>His words, the way he is looking at me\u2014it makes me feel warm inside, golden, all the way to my frozen toes. I want him to kiss me. I want to see if it\u2019s different from Peter, if it will make the hurt recede. Make me forget him, just for a while. But maybe he senses it\u2014that Peter is somehow here with us, in my thoughts, that it wouldn\u2019t just be about him and me\u2014because John doesn\u2019t make a move.</p><p>Instead he asks a question. \u201cWhy do you always call me by my full name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess that\u2019s how I think of you in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re saying you think about me a lot?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo, I\u2019m saying that when I think about you, which isn\u2019t very often, that\u2019s how I think of you. On the first day of school, I always have to explain to teachers that Lara Jean is my first name and not just Lara. And then, do you remember how Mr. Chudney started calling you John Ambrose because of that? \u2018Mr. John Ambrose.\u2019\u201d</p><p>In a fake hoity-toity English accent, John says, \u201cMr. John Ambrose McClaren the Third, madam.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I giggle. I\u2019ve never met a third before. \u201cAre you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s annoying. My dad\u2019s a junior, so he\u2019s JJ, but my extended family still calls me Little John.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cI\u2019d much rather be John Ambrose than Little John. Sounds like a rapper or that guy from Robin Hood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family\u2019s so fancy.\u201d I only ever saw John\u2019s mom when she was picking him up. She looked younger than the other mothers, she had John\u2019s same milky skin, and her hair was longer than the other moms\u2019, straw-colored.</p><p>\u201cNo. My family isn\u2019t fancy at all. My mom made Jell-O salad last night for dessert. And, like, my dad only has steak cooked well-done. We only ever take vacations we can drive to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought your family was kind of . . . well, rich.\u201d I feel immediate shame for saying \u201crich.\u201d It\u2019s tacky to talk about other people\u2019s money.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s really cheap. His construction company is pretty successful, but he prides himself on being a self-made man. He didn\u2019t go to college; neither did my grandparents. My sisters were the first in our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that about you,\u201d I say. All these new things I\u2019m learning about John Ambrose McClaren!</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to tell me something I don\u2019t know about you,\u201d John says.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou already know more than most people. My love letter made sure of that.\u201d</p> <p>The next morning, I sneeze as I\u2019m putting on my coat, and Stormy raises one pencil-drawn eyebrow at me. \u201cCatch a cold playing in the snow last night with Johnny?\u201d</p><p>I squirm. I\u2019d hoped she wouldn\u2019t bring it up. The last thing I want to do is discuss her midnight rendezvous with Mr. Morales! We watched Stormy go back to her apartment and then waited half an hour before John went back to Mr. Morales\u2019s. Weakly, I say, \u201cSorry we snuck out. It was so early, and we couldn\u2019t fall asleep, so we thought we\u2019d play in the snow.\u201d</p><p>Stormy waves a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I hoped would happen.\u201d She winks at me. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made Johnny stay with Mr. Morales, of course. What\u2019s the fun in anything if there aren\u2019t a few roadblocks to spice things up?\u201d</p><p>In awe, I say, \u201cYou\u2019re so crafty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, darling.\u201d She\u2019s quite pleased with herself. \u201cYou know, he\u2019d make a great first husband, my Johnny. So, did you French him, at least?\u201d</p><p>My face burns. \u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can tell me, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStormy, we didn\u2019t kiss, and even if we had, I wouldn\u2019t discuss it with you.\u201d</p><p>Stormy\u2019s nose goes thin and haughty. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that so very selfish of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go, Stormy. My dad\u2019s waiting for me out front. See you!\u201d</p><p>As I hurry out the door, she calls out, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I\u2019ll get it out of Johnny! See you both at the party, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>When I step outside, the sun is shining bright and much of the snow has already melted away. It\u2019s almost like last night was a dream.</p><p>48</p><p>THE NIGHT BEFORE THE USO party, I call Chris on speakerphone as I\u2019m rolling a log of shortbread dough in sage sugar. \u201cChris, can I borrow your Rosie the Riveter poster?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can have it but what do you want it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the 1940s USO party I\u2019m throwing at Belleview tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, I\u2019m bored. God, all you ever talk about is Belleview!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, should I get a job?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. Every conversation we have turns back to Chris and the concerns of Chris. \u201cHey, speaking of fun jobs for you, what do you think about being a cigar girl for the party? You could wear a cute outfit with a little hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal cigars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, chocolate ones. Cigars are bad for old people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be booze?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to say yes, but only for the residents, but I think better of it. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It could be a dangerous combination with their medications and their walkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I can\u2019t give up a Friday night for this. Something better will definitely come up on a Friday. A Tuesday, maybe. Can you change it to next Tuesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Can you just please bring the poster to school tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you have to text me with a reminder.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d I blow my hair out of my face and start slicing the cookie roll. I still have to chop carrots and celery for the crudit\u00e9s and also pipe my meringues. I\u2019m doing red-white-and-blue-striped meringue kisses, and I\u2019m nervous about the colors blending together. Oh well. If they do, then people will just have to live with purple meringue kisses. There are worse things. Speaking of worse things . . . \u201cHave you heard anything from Gen? I\u2019ve been so careful, but it seems like she\u2019s barely playing.\u201d There\u2019s silence on the other end.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably too busy doing sex voodoo on Peter,\u201d I say, half-hoping Chris will chime in. She\u2019s always the first in line to rip on Gen.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t. All she says is \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go\u2014my mom\u2019s bitching at me to take out the dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the poster!\u201d</p><p>49</p><p>AFTER SCHOOL KITTY AND I set up camp in the kitchen, where there\u2019s the best light. I bring down my speakers and play the Andrews Sisters to get us in the right spirit. Kitty puts down a towel and lays out all my makeup, bobby pins, hair spray.</p><p>I hold up a packet of individual false eyelashes. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get these from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrielle stole them from her sister and she gave me a pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t notice. She has tons!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just take people\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take it\u2014Brielle did. Anyway, I can\u2019t give it back now. Do you want me to put them on you or not?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cDo you even know how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve watched her sister put them on plenty of times.\u201d Kitty takes the eyelashes out of my hand. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to use them on you, fine. I\u2019ll save them for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . all right then. But no more stealing.\u201d I frown. \u201cHey, do you guys ever take my stuff?\u201d Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t seen my cat-ears knit beanie in months. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShh, no more talking,\u201d she says.</p><p>The hair is what takes the longest. Kitty and I have watched countless hair tutorials to figure out the logistics of the victory rolls. There\u2019s a lot of teasing and hair spray and hair rollers involved. And bobby pins. Lots of bobby pins.</p><p>I stare at myself in the mirror. \u201cDon\u2019t you think my hair looks a little . . . severe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018severe\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt kind of looks like I have a cinnamon bun on top of my head.\u201d</p><p>Kitty thrusts the iPad in my face. \u201cYeah, so does this girl\u2019s. That\u2019s the look. It\u2019s got to be authentic. If we water down the look, it won\u2019t be true to the theme, and nobody will know what you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d I\u2019m nodding slowly; she has a point. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m going over to Ms. Rothschild\u2019s for a Jamie training session. I don\u2019t have time to start all over again.\u201d</p><p>For my lipstick, we achieve the perfect shade of cherry red by blending two different reds\u2014one brick and one fire engine\u2014with a hot pink powder to set it. I look like I kissed a cherry pie.</p><p>I\u2019m blotting my lips when Kitty asks, \u201cIs that pretty boy John Amber McAndrews picking you up, or are you meeting him at the nursing home?\u201d</p><p>I wave my tissue in her face warningly. \u201cHe\u2019s picking me up, and you\u2019d better be nice. Also he\u2019s not a pretty boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty boy compared to Peter,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be honest. They\u2019re both pretty. It\u2019s not like Peter has a tattoo or huge muscles. In fact he\u2019s very vain.\u201d We never passed a window or a glass door Peter didn\u2019t check himself out in.</p><p>\u201cWell, is John vain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty, stop making this a competition of John versus Peter. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s prettier.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty keeps going like she didn\u2019t hear me. \u201cPeter has a much nicer car. What does Johnny boy drive, a boring SUV? Who cares about an SUV? All they do is guzzle gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, I think it\u2019s a hybrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure like to defend him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Peter\u2019s mine,\u201d she says.</p><p>Getting dressed is an intricate process, and I enjoy each step. It\u2019s all about anticipation, hope for the night. Slowly I put on the seamed stockings so I don\u2019t get a run in them. It takes me forever to get the seams straight down the backs of my legs. Then the dress\u2014navy with white sprigs and little holly berries and floaty cap sleeves. Last the shoes. Clunky red heels with a bow at the toe and an ankle strap.</p><p>Put all together, it goes great, and I have to admit that Kitty was right about the victory roll on top of my head. Anything less wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>On my way out Daddy makes a big fuss over how great I look, and he takes about a million photos, which he promptly texts Margot. She immediately video-chats us so she can see for herself. \u201cMake sure you get a picture of you and Stormy together,\u201d Margot says. \u201cI want to see what sexy getup she\u2019s wearing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually not that sexy,\u201d I say. \u201cShe sewed it herself, off a 1940s dress pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll find a way to bring the sexy,\u201d Margot says. \u201cWhat\u2019s John McClaren wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. He says it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a very suggestive hmm, which I ignore.</p><p>Daddy\u2019s taking one last shot of me on the front porch when Ms. Rothschild comes over. \u201cYou look amazing, Lara Jean,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cShe does, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Daddy says fondly.</p><p>\u201cGod, I love the forties,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the Ken Burns documentary The War?\u201d Daddy asks her. \u201cIf you have any interest in World War Two, it\u2019s a must-see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should watch it together,\u201d Kitty pipes up, and Ms. Rothschild shoots her a warning look.</p><p>\u201cDo you have it on DVD?\u201d she asks Daddy. Kitty is aglow with excitement.</p><p>\u201cSure, you can borrow it anytime,\u201d Daddy says, oblivious as ever, and Kitty scowls, and then her mouth falls open.</p><p>I turn to see what she\u2019s looking at, and it\u2019s a red convertible Mustang driving down our street, top down\u2014with John McClaren at the wheel.</p><p>My jaw drops at the sight of him. He is in full uniform: tan dress shirt with tan tie, tan slacks, tan belt and hat. His hair is parted to the side. He looks dashing, like a real soldier. He grins at me and waves. \u201cWhoa,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhoa is right,\u201d Ms. Rothschild says, googly-eyed beside me. Daddy and his Ken Burns DVD are forgotten; we are all staring at John in this uniform, in this car. It\u2019s like I dreamed him up. He parks the car in front of the house, and all of us rush up to it.</p><p>\u201cWhose car is this?\u201d Kitty demands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my dad\u2019s,\u201d John says. \u201cI borrowed it. I had to promise to park really far away from any other car, though, so I hope your shoes are comfortable, Lara Jean\u2014\u201d He breaks off and looks me up and down. \u201cWow. You look amazing.\u201d He gestures at my cinnamon bun. \u201cI mean, your hair looks so . . . real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is real!\u201d I touch it gingerly, I\u2019m suddenly feeling self-conscious about my cinnamon-bun head and red lipstick.</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014I mean, it looks authentic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCan I sit in it?\u201d Kitty butts in, her hand on the passenger-side door.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d John says. He climbs out of the car. \u201cBut don\u2019t you want to get in the driver\u2019s seat?\u201d</p><p>Kitty nods quickly. Ms. Rothschild gets in too, and Daddy takes a picture of them together. Kitty poses with one arm casually draped over the steering wheel.</p><p>John and I stand off to the side, and I ask him, \u201cWhere did you ever get that uniform?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ordered it off of eBay.\u201d He frowns. \u201cAm I wearing the hat right? Do you think it\u2019s too small for my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I think it looks exactly the way it\u2019s supposed to look.\u201d I\u2019m touched that he went to the trouble of ordering a uniform for this. I can\u2019t think of many boys who would do that. \u201cStormy is going to flip out when she sees you.\u201d</p><p>He studies my face. \u201cWhat about you? Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>I flush. \u201cI do. I think you look . . . super.\u201d</p><p>It turns out that Margot is, as ever, right. Stormy has shortened the hem on the dress; it\u2019s well above the knee. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the gams,\u201d she gloats, twirling. \u201cMy best feature, from all the horseback riding I did as a girl.\u201d She\u2019s showing a little cleavage, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A silver-haired man who rode over in the van from Ferncliff is making appreciative eyes at her, and Stormy is pretending not to notice, all the while batting her lashes and preening with one hand on her hip.

Life is short.\u201d For once, Alicia and Stormy are on the same page.</p><p>Stormy is now straightening John\u2019s tie, his little hat. She even licks her finger and tries to smooth his hair, but he ducks away. Our eyes meet, and he makes a frantic face like, Help me.</p><p>\u201cSave him,\u201d Alicia says. \u201cI\u2019ll finish the table. My internment camp display is already done.\u201d She\u2019s set that up by the doors, so it\u2019s the first thing you see when you walk in.</p><p>I hurry over to John and Stormy. Stormy beams at me. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she look like an absolute doll?\u201d She swans off.</p><p>With a straight face John says, \u201cLara Jean, you\u2019re an absolute doll.\u201d</p> <p>I giggle and touch the top of my head. \u201cA cinnamon roll\u2013headed doll.\u201d</p><p>People are starting to mill in, even though it isn\u2019t seven yet. I\u2019ve observed that old people, as a rule, tend to show up early for things. I still have to set up the music. Stormy says that when hosting a party, music is absolutely the first order of business, because it sets the mood the second your guest walks in. I can feel my nerves starting to pulse. There\u2019s still so much to do. \u201cI\u2019d better finish setting up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need done,\u201d John says. \u201cI\u2019m your second-in-command at this shindig. Did people say \u2018shindig\u2019 in the forties?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cProbably!\u201d In a rush I say, \u201cOkay, can you set up my speakers and iPod? They\u2019re in the bag by the refreshments table. And can you pick up Mrs. Taylor in 5A? I promised her an escort.\u201d</p><p>John gives me a salute and runs off. Tingles go up and down my spine like soda water. Tonight will be a night to remember!</p><p>We\u2019re an hour and a half in, and Crystal Clemons, a lady from Stormy\u2019s floor, is leading everyone in a swing-dancing lesson. Of course Stormy is up front, rock-stepping for all she\u2019s worth. I\u2019m following along from the refreshments table: one-two, three-four, five-six. Early on I danced with Mr. Morales, but only once, because the women were cutting their eyes at me for taking an eligible, able-bodied man off the circuit. Men are in short supply at old-age homes, so there aren\u2019t enough male dance partners, not enough by half. I\u2019ve heard a few of the women whispering how rude it is for a gentleman not to dance when there are ladies without partners\u2014and looking pointedly at poor John.</p> <p>John is standing at the other end of the table, drinking Coke and nodding his head to the beat. I\u2019ve been so busy running around, we\u2019ve hardly had a chance to talk. I lean over the table and call out, \u201cHaving fun?\u201d</p><p>He nods. Then, quite suddenly, he bangs his glass down on the table, so hard the table shakes and I jump. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s do or die. D-day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d John says.</p><p>Shyly I say, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to. I didn\u2019t take swing-dancing lessons from Stormy for nothing.\u201d</p><p>I widen my eyes. \u201cWhen did you take swing dance lessons from Stormy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says. \u201cJust dance with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell . . . do you have any war bonds left?\u201d I joke.</p><p>John fishes one out of his pants pocket and slaps it on the refreshments table. Then he grabs my hand and marches me to the center of the dance floor, like a soldier heading off to the battlefield. He\u2019s all grim concentration. He signals to Mr. Morales, who is manning the music because he\u2019s the only one who can figure out my phone. Glenn Miller\u2019s \u201cIn the Mood\u201d comes blaring out of the speakers.</p><p>John gives me a determined nod. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>And then we\u2019re dancing. Rock-step, side, together, side, repeat. Rock-step, one-two-three, one-two-three. We step on each other\u2019s feet about a million times, but he\u2019s swinging me around\u2014twirl, twirl\u2014and our faces are flushed and we\u2019re both laughing. When the song is over, he pulls me in and then throws me back out one last time. Everyone is clapping. Mr. Morales screams, \u201cTo the young ones!\u201d</p><p>John picks me up and lifts me into the air like we\u2019re ice dancers, and the crowd erupts. I\u2019m smiling so hard my face feels like it could break.</p><p>After, John helps me take down all the decorations and pack everything up. He goes out to the parking lot with the two big boxes, and I stay behind to say good-bye to everyone and make sure we have everything. I still feel sort of a high from the night. The party went so well, and Janette was so pleased. She came up and squeezed my shoulders and said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Lara Jean.\u201d And then the dance with John . . . Thirteen-year-old me would have died. Sixteen-year-old me is floating down the nursing-home hallway, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m in a dream.</p><p>I\u2019m floating out the front entrance when I see Genevieve and Peter walking up, her arm linked in his, and it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a time machine and the past year never happened. We never happened.</p><p>They\u2019re coming closer. Now they are about ten feet away, and I am frozen to this spot. Is there no way out of this? Out of this humiliation, and out of losing yet again? I got so caught up in the USO party and John that I forgot all about the game. What are my options here? If I turn and run back into the nursing home, she\u2019ll just wait in the parking lot for me all night. Just like that, I am a rabbit under her paw again. Just like that, she wins.</p><p>And then it\u2019s too late. They\u2019ve spotted me. Peter drops Genevieve\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks me. \u201cAnd what\u2019s with all the makeup?\u201d He gestures at my eyes, my lips.</p><p>My cheeks burn. I ignore the comment about my makeup and just say, \u201cI work here, remember? I know why you\u2019re here, Genevieve. Peter, thanks a lot for helping her take me out. You\u2019re a real stand-up guy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCovey, I didn\u2019t come here to help her tag you out. I didn\u2019t even know you\u2019d be here. I told you, I don\u2019t give a shit about this game!\u201d He turns to Genevieve. Accusingly he says, \u201cYou said you needed to pick something up from your grandma\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is just an amazing coincidence. I guess I win, huh?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so smug, so sure of herself and her victory over me. \u201cYou haven\u2019t tagged me yet.\u201d Should I just make a run for it back inside? Stormy would let me spend the night if I needed to.</p><p>Just then, John\u2019s red Mustang convertible comes roaring up through the parking lot. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he says, and Peter\u2019s and Gen\u2019s mouths drop. It\u2019s only then that I think of how strange we must look together, John in his World War II uniform with his jaunty little hat, me with my victory roll and my red lipstick.</p> <p>Peter eyes him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Blithely John says, \u201cMy great-grandmother lives here. Stormy. You may have heard of her. She\u2019s a friend of Lara Jean\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t remember,\u201d I say.</p><p>Peter frowns at me, and I know he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s just like him not to. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the outfits?\u201d he says, his voice gruff.</p><p>\u201cUSO party,\u201d John says. \u201cVery exclusive. VIPs only\u2014sorry, guys.\u201d Then he tips his hat at him, which I can tell makes Peter mad, which in turn makes me glad.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is a USO party?\u201d Peter asks me.</p><p>John stretches his arm out onto the passenger seat luxuriously. \u201cIt\u2019s from World War Two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you; I was asking her,\u201d Peter snaps. He looks at me, his eyes hard. \u201cIs this a date? Are you on a date with him? And who the hell\u2019s car is this?\u201d</p><p>Before I can answer, Genevieve makes a move toward me, which I dodge. I run behind the pillar. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a baby, Lara Jean,\u201d she says. \u201cJust accept that you lose and I win!\u201d</p><p>I peek from behind the pillar, and John is giving me a look\u2014a look that says, Get in. Quickly I nod. Then he throws open the passenger door, and I run for it, as fast as I can. I\u2019ve barely got the door closed before he\u2019s driving off, Peter and Gen in our dust.</p><p>I turn back to look. Peter is staring after us, his mouth open. He\u2019s jealous, and I\u2019m glad. \u201cThanks for the save,\u201d I say, still trying to catch my breath. My heart is pounding in my chest so hard.</p> <p>John is looking straight ahead, a broad smile on his face. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>We stop at a stoplight, and he turns his head and looks at me, and then we\u2019re looking at each other, laughing like crazy, and I\u2019m breathless again.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the looks on their faces?\u201d John gasps, dropping his head on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cIt was classic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a movie!\u201d He grins at me, jubilant, blue eyes alight.</p><p>\u201cJust like a movie,\u201d I agree, leaning my head back against the seat and opening my eyes wide up at the moon, so wide it hurts. I\u2019m in a red Mustang convertible sitting next to a boy in uniform, and the night air feels like cool satin on my skin, and all the stars are out, and I\u2019m happy. The way John is still grinning to himself, I know he is too. We got to play make-believe for the night. Forget Peter and Genevieve. The light turns green, and I throw my arms in the air. \u201cGo fast, Johnny!\u201d I shout, and he guns it and I let out a shriek.</p><p>We zoom around for a bit, and at the next stoplight he slows and puts his arm around me, pulling me closer to his side. \u201cIsn\u2019t this how they did it in the fifties?\u201d he asks, one hand on the steering wheel and the other around my shoulders.</p><p>My heart rate picks back up again. \u201cWell, technically we\u2019re dressed for the forties\u2014\u201d and then he kisses me. His lips are warm and firm against mine, and my eyes flutter shut.</p> <p>When he pulls away just a fraction, he looks down at me and says, half serious, half not, \u201cBetter than the first time?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m dazed. He\u2019s got some of my lipstick on his face now. I reach up and wipe his mouth. The light turns green; we don\u2019t move; he\u2019s still looking at me. Someone honks a horn behind us. \u201cThe light\u2019s green.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t make a move; he\u2019s still looking at me. \u201cAnswer first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d John pushes his foot on the gas, and we\u2019re moving again. I\u2019m still breathless. Into the wind I shout, \u201cOne day I want to see you make a Model UN speech!\u201d</p><p>John laughs. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be something to see. I bet you\u2019d be . . . grand. You know, out of all of us, I think you\u2019ve changed the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to be sort of quiet. In your own head. Now you\u2019re so confident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still get nervous, Lara Jean.\u201d John has a cowlick, a little piece of hair that won\u2019t stay down; it is stubborn. It\u2019s this piece more than anything else that makes my heart squeeze.</p><p>50</p><p>AFTER JOHN DROPS ME OFF at home, I run across the street to pick up Kitty from Ms. Rothschild\u2019s. And she invites me in for a cup of tea. Kitty is asleep on the couch with the TV on low in the background. We settle on the other couch with our cups of Lady Grey, and she asks me how the party went. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m still on a high from the night, or maybe it\u2019s the bobby pins so tight on my head that I feel woozy, or it could be the way her eyes light up with genuine interest as I begin to talk, but I tell her everything. The dance with John, how everyone cheered, Peter and Genevieve, even the kiss.</p><p>She starts fanning herself when I tell about the kiss. \u201cWhen that boy drove up in that uniform\u2014ooh, girl.\u201d She whistles. \u201cIt made me feel like a dirty old lady, because I knew him when he was little. But dear God he is handsome!\u201d</p><p>I giggle as I pull the bobby pins from the top of my head. She leans forward and helps me along. My cinnamon bun unravels, and my scalp tingles with relief. Is this what it\u2019s like to have a mother? Late-night boy talk over tea?</p><p>Ms. Rothschild\u2019s voice gets low and confidential. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. My one piece of advice to you. You have to let yourself be fully present in every moment. Just be awake for it, do you know what I mean? Go all in and wring every last drop out of the experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you not have any regrets, then? Because you always went all in?\u201d I\u2019m thinking of her divorce, how it was the talk of the neighborhood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh God, no. I have regrets.\u201d She laughs a husky laugh, the sexy kind that only smokers or people with colds get to have. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m sitting here trying to give you advice. I\u2019m a single divorc\u00e9e and I\u2019m forty. Two. Forty-two. What do I know about anything? That\u2019s a rhetorical question, by the way.\u201d She lets out a sigh filled with longing. \u201cI miss cigarettes so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty will check your breath,\u201d I warn, and she laughs that husky laugh again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to cross that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Though she be but little, she is fierce,\u2019\u201d I intone. \u201cYou\u2019re wise to be afraid, Ms. Rothschild.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, Lara Jean, will you please just call me Trina? I mean, I know I\u2019m old, but I\u2019m not that old.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cOkay. Trina . . . do you like my dad?\u201d</p><p>She goes a little red. \u201cUm. Yeah, I think he\u2019s a great guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not my usual type. And also he hasn\u2019t shown any particular interest in me, either, so, ha-ha!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know Kitty\u2019s been trying to set you two up. Which, if that\u2019s unwelcome, I can definitely make her stop.\u201d I correct myself. \u201cI can definitely try to make her stop. But I think she might be onto something. I think you and my dad could be good together. He loves to cook, and he likes to build fires, and he doesn\u2019t mind shopping because he brings a book. And you, you seem fun, and spontaneous and just really . . . light.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me. \u201cI\u2019m a mess is what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessiness can be good, especially for someone like my dad. It\u2019s worth a date, at least, don\u2019t you think? What\u2019s the harm in just seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDating neighbors is tricky. What if it doesn\u2019t work out and then we\u2019re stuck living across the street from each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tiny inconsequential risk compared to what could be gained. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you wave politely when you see each other and then you keep on walking. No big deal. And I know I\u2019m biased, but my dad is really worth it. He\u2019s the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know it. I see you girls and I think, God, any man who could raise those girls is something special. I\u2019ve never seen a man so devoted to his family. You three are the pearls in his crown, you know? And that\u2019s how it should be. A girl\u2019s relationship with her father is the most important male relationship of her life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about a girl\u2019s relationship with her mother?\u201d</p><p>Ms. Rothschild tilts her head, contemplating. \u201cYeah, I would say a girl\u2019s relationship with her mom is the most important female relationship. Her mom or her sisters. You\u2019re lucky to have two of them. I know you know this already, better than most people, but your parents won\u2019t always be there. If it happens the way it\u2019s supposed to, they\u2019ll go first. But your sisters are yours for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have one?\u201d</p><p>She nods, a hint of a smile forming on her tanned face. \u201cI have a big sister. Jeanie. We didn\u2019t get along as well as you girls do, but as we get older, she looks more and more like our mom. And so when I\u2019m missing my mom a lot, I go visit Jeanie and I get to see my mom\u2019s face again.\u201d She wrinkles her nose. \u201cDoes that sound creepy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think it sounds . . . lovely.\u201d I hesitate. \u201cSometimes when I hear Margot\u2019s voice\u2014like, she\u2019s downstairs, and she calls us down to hurry up and get in the car, or she says that dinner\u2019s ready\u2014sometimes she sounds so much like my mom, it tricks me. Just for a second.\u201d Tears spring to my eyes.</p><p>Ms. Rothschild has tears in her eyes too. \u201cI don\u2019t think a girl ever gets over losing her mom. I\u2019m an adult and it\u2019s completely normal and expected for my mom to be dead, but I still feel orphaned sometimes.\u201d She smiles at me. \u201cBut that\u2019s just inescapable, right? When you lose someone and it still hurts, that\u2019s when you know the love was real.\u201d</p><p>I wipe my eyes. With Peter and me, was the love real? Because it does still hurt, it does. But maybe that\u2019s just part of it. Sniffling, I ask, \u201cSo, just to make sure, if my dad asks you out, you\u2019ll say yes?\u201d</p><p>She roars with laughter, then claps her hand over her mouth when Kitty stirs on the couch. \u201cNow I see where Kitty gets it from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrina, you didn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself. Yes.</p><p>By the time I wash off all my makeup and get into my pajamas, it\u2019s nearly three in the morning. I\u2019m not tired, though. What I really want to do is talk to Margot, go over every single detail of the night. Scotland is five hours ahead, which means it\u2019s almost eight a.m. over there. She\u2019s an early riser, so I figure it\u2019s worth a shot.</p><p>I catch her as she\u2019s getting ready to go have breakfast. She sets her computer on her dresser so we can talk as she puts on sunscreen and mascara and lip balm.</p><p>I tell her about the party, about Peter and Genevieve\u2019s appearance, and most importantly the kiss with John. \u201cMargot, I think I could be a person who is in love with more than one person at a time.\u201d I might even be a girl that falls in love twelve hundred times. I get a sudden picture in my head of myself as a bee, sipping nectar from a daisy to a rose to a lily. Each boy sweet in his own way.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d She stops putting her hair in a ponytail and taps her finger to the screen. \u201cLara Jean, I think you half-fall in love with every person you meet. It\u2019s part of your charm. You\u2019re in love with love.\u201d</p><p>This may be true. Perhaps I am in love with love! That doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad way to be.</p><p>51</p><p>OUR TOWN\u2019S SPRING FAIR IS tomorrow, and Kitty has promised the PTA a cake for the cake walk on my behalf. At a cake walk, music plays while kids walk around a circle of numbers, like musical chairs. When the music stops, a number is picked at random, and the kid standing in front of the corresponding number gets the cake. This was always my favorite carnival game, of course, because I liked looking at all of the homemade cakes and also for the sheer luck of it. Certainly, the kids crowd around the cake table and earmark the cake they most want and try to walk slowly when they come upon the number, but beyond that there isn\u2019t much to it. It\u2019s a game that does not require any skill or know-how: You literally just walk around a circle to old-timey music. Sure, you could go to the bakery and pick out the exact cake you want, but there is a thrill in not being sure what you\u2019ll end up with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My cake will be chocolate, because kids and people in general prefer chocolate to any other flavor. The frosting is where I\u2019ll get fancy. Possibly salted caramel, or passion fruit, or maybe a mocha whip. I\u2019ve been toying with the idea of doing an ombr\u00e9 cake, where the frosting goes from dark to light. I have a feeling my cake will be in demand.</p><p>When I picked up Kitty from Shanae\u2019s house this morning, I asked her mom what cake she was baking for the cake walk, because Mrs. Rodgers is vice president of the elementary school PTA. She heaved a sigh and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be baking whatever Duncan Hines I can find in my pantry. Either that or Food Lion.\u201d Then she asked me what I was baking and I told her, and she said, \u201cI\u2019m voting you Teen Mom of the Year,\u201d which made me laugh and also further spurred me to bake the best cake so everyone knows what Kitty\u2019s working with. I never mentioned this to Daddy or Margot, but in middle school my English teacher sponsored a mother-daughter tea in honor of Mother\u2019s Day. It was after school, an optional thing, but I really wanted to go and have the tea sandwiches and scones she said she was bringing. It was just for mothers and daughters, though. I suppose I could have asked Grandma to come\u2014Margot did that a few times for miscellaneous events\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t have been the same. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the kind of thing that would bother Kitty, but it\u2019s still something I think about.</p><p>The cake walk is in the elementary school\u2019s music room. I\u2019ve volunteered to be in charge of the walking music, and I\u2019ve made a playlist with all sugar-related songs. Of course \u201cSugar, Sugar\u201d by the Archies, \u201cSugar Shack,\u201d \u201cSugar Town,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch).\u201d When I walk into the music room, Peter\u2019s mom and another mom are setting up the cakes. I falter, unsure of what to do.</p><p>She says, \u201cHello, Lara Jean,\u201d but her smile doesn\u2019t quite reach her eyes, and it gives me a sinking feeling in my stomach. It\u2019s a relief when she leaves.</p> <p>There\u2019s a decent crowd all day, with some people playing more than once for the cake of their dreams. I keep steering people toward my caramel cake, which is still in rotation. There\u2019s a German chocolate cake that has people entranced, which I\u2019m pretty sure is store-bought, but there\u2019s no accounting for taste. I\u2019ve never been a fan of German chocolate cake myself, because who wants wet coconut flakes? Shudder.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s been running around with her friends, and she\u2019s deigned to help me out at the cake walk for an hour when Peter walks in with his little brother, Owen. \u201cPour Some Sugar on Me\u201d is playing. Kitty goes over to say hello, while I busy myself looking at my phone as she\u2019s showing them the cakes. I\u2019ve got my head down, pretend-texting, when Peter comes up beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhich cake is yours? The coconut one?\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up. \u201cI would never buy a grocery-store cake for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was joking, Covey. Yours is the caramel one. I can tell by the way you frosted it so fancy.\u201d He stops talking and shoves his hands in his pockets. \u201cSo, just so you know, I didn\u2019t go to the nursing home with Gen to help her tag you out.\u201d</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cFor all I know you\u2019ve already texted her and told her I\u2019m here, so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t give a shit about this game. I think it\u2019s dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m still planning on winning.\u201d I put on the next song for the cake walk, and all the kids run into position. \u201cSo are you and Genevieve back together?\u201d</p><p>He makes a rude sound. \u201cWhat do you care?\u201d</p><p>Again I shrug. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be back with her eventually.\u201d</p><p>Peter smarts at this. He turns like he\u2019s going to leave, but then he stops. Rubbing the back of his neck, he says, \u201cYou never answered my question about McClaren. Was that a date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flare. \u201cI fucking care because you were my girlfriend up until a few weeks ago. I don\u2019t even remember why we broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t remember, then I don\u2019t know what to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell the truth. Don\u2019t dick me around.\u201d His voice cracks on the word \u201cdick.\u201d Any other time we would have laughed about it. I wish we could now. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and McClaren?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a lump in my throat that\u2019s making it hard to talk all of a sudden. \u201cNothing.\u201d Just a kiss. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. He\u2019s been helping me with the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow convenient. First he\u2019s writing you letters, now he\u2019s driving you around town and hanging out with you at a nursing home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t care about the letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen maybe you should have said so.\u201d Kitty\u2019s looking over at us, her forehead pinched. \u201cI don\u2019t walk to talk about this anymore. I\u2019m here to work.\u201d</p><p>Peter eyes me. \u201cHave you kissed him?\u201d</p><p>Do I tell the truth? Do I have to? \u201cYes. Once.\u201d</p><p>He blinks. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me I\u2019ve been living the life of a celibate person ever since we started this stupid game\u2014before, even\u2014and meanwhile you\u2019re fooling around with McClaren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re broken up, Peter. Meanwhile, when we were actually together, you were with Genevieve\u2014\u201d</p><p>He throws his head back and yells, \u201cI didn\u2019t kiss her!\u201d Some of the adults turn and look at us.</p><p>\u201cYou had your arms around her,\u201d I whisper-yell. \u201cYou were holding her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was comforting her. God! She was crying! I told you! Did you do it to get back at me?\u201d Peter wants me to say yes. He wants it to have been about him. But I wasn\u2019t thinking about Peter when I kissed John. I kissed him because I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw twitches. \u201cWhen we broke up, you said you wanted to be someone\u2019s number one girl, but look at you. You don\u2019t want to have a number one guy.\u201d He gestures rudely at the cake table. \u201cYou want to have your cake and eat it too.\u201d</p><p>His words sting just the way he intends them to. \u201cI hate that saying. What does it even mean? Of course I want to have my cake and eat it too\u2014otherwise what\u2019s the point of having cake?\u201d</p><p>He frowns at me. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about and you know it.\u201d</p><p>The song finishes then, and the kids come over to claim their cakes. Kitty and Owen, too. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Owen says to Peter. He\u2019s got my caramel cake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peter glances down at him and then back at me, his eyes hard. \u201cI don\u2019t want that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one you told me to get!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want it anymore. Put it back and get the Funfetti down there at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have it,\u201d Kitty tells him. \u201cThat\u2019s not how a cake walk works. You take the cake with the number you were standing on.\u201d</p> <p>Peter\u2019s mouth falls open in shock. \u201cAw, come on, kid.\u201d</p><p>Kitty moves closer to me. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>After Peter and his brother leave, I hug Kitty from behind. She was on my side after all. Song girls stick together.</p><p>52</p><p>KITTY WANTED TO STAY LONGER at the fair, so it\u2019s just me driving alone when I spot Genevieve\u2019s car on the road. And just like that, I\u2019m following her. It\u2019s time to take this girl down.</p> <p>She\u2019s still daring. The way she zips through traffic lights, I almost lose her a few times. I\u2019m not a good enough driver for this, I want to scream at her.</p><p>We finally end up at an office building, one I recognize as her dad\u2019s. She goes inside, and I park in the same strip mall, but not too close. I turn off the engine and recline my seat back so she can\u2019t see me.</p><p>Ten minutes pass, and nothing. I don\u2019t even know why she\u2019d be at her dad\u2019s office on a weekend. Maybe she\u2019s helping her dad\u2019s secretary? I might be stuck here for a while. But I will wait forever if need be. I will win, no matter what. I don\u2019t even care about the prize. I just want the win.</p><p>I\u2019m about to doze off when two people come out of the building\u2014her dad, in a suit and a camel coat, and a girl. I duck low in my seat. At first I think it\u2019s Genevieve, but this girl is taller. I squint. I recognize her. She was Margot\u2019s year; I think they were in Key Club together. Anna Hicks. They walk out to the parking lot together; he walks her to her car. She\u2019s fumbling for her keys. He grabs her arm and turns her face to his. And then they\u2019re kissing. Passionately. Tongue. Hands everywhere.</p><p>Oh my God. She\u2019s Margot\u2019s age. Just eighteen. Genevieve\u2019s dad is kissing her like she\u2019s a grown woman. He\u2019s a dad. She\u2019s somebody\u2019s daughter.</p><p>I feel sick inside. How could he do this to Genevieve\u2019s mom? To Gen? Does she know? Is this the hard thing she\u2019s been going through? If my dad ever did such a thing, I could never look at him the same way. I don\u2019t know that I could look at my life the same way. It would be such a betrayal, not just of our family, but of himself, of who he is as a person.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to see any more. I keep my head down until they both drive out of the parking lot, and I\u2019m about to start my car too when Genevieve walks out, her arms crossed, shoulders bent.</p><p>Oh dear God. She\u2019s spotted me. Her eyes are narrow; she\u2019s heading straight for me. I want to drive away, but I can\u2019t. She\u2019s standing right in front of me, angrily motioning for me to roll down the window. So I do, but it\u2019s hard to look her in the eyes.</p><p>She snaps out, \u201cDid you see?\u201d</p><p>Weakly I say, \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t see anything . . .\u201d</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s face goes red; she knows I\u2019m lying. For a second I am terrified she is going to cry, or hit me. I wish she would just hit me. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she manages. \u201cTag me out. That\u2019s what you came here for.\u201d I shake my head, and then she grabs my hands off the steering wheel and slaps them on her collarbone. \u201cThere. You win, Lara Jean. Game over.\u201d</p><p>And then she runs to her car.</p><p>There\u2019s a Korean word my grandma taught me. It\u2019s called jung. It\u2019s the connection between two people that can\u2019t be severed, even when love turns to hate. You still have those old feelings for them; you can\u2019t ever completely shake them loose of you; you will always have tenderness in your heart for them. I think this must be some part of what I feel for Genevieve. Jung is why I can\u2019t hate her. We\u2019re tied.</p><p>And jung is why Peter can\u2019t let her go. They\u2019re tied too. If my dad did what her dad did, wouldn\u2019t I reach out to the one person who never turned me away? Who was always there, who loved me more than anyone? Peter is that person for Genevieve. How can I begrudge her that?</p> <p>53</p><p>WE\u2019RE IN THE KITCHEN CLEANING up after pancake breakfast when Daddy says, \u201cI believe another one of the Song girls has a birthday coming up.\u201d He sings, \u201cYou are sixteen, going on seventeen . . .\u201d I feel a strong surge of love for him, my dad who I am so lucky to have.</p><p>\u201cWhat song are you singing?\u201d Kitty interrupts.</p><p>I take Kitty\u2019s hands and spin her around the kitchen with me. \u201cI am sixteen, going on seventeen; I know that I\u2019m naive. Fellows I meet may tell me I\u2019m sweet; willingly I believe.\u201d</p><p>Daddy throws his dish towel over his shoulder and marches in place. In a deep voice he baritones, \u201cYou need someone older and wiser telling you what to do . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis song is sexist,\u201d Kitty says as I dip her.</p><p>\u201cIndeed it is,\u201d Daddy agrees, swatting her with the towel. \u201cAnd the boy in question was not, in fact, older and wiser. He was a Nazi in training.\u201d</p><p>Kitty skitters away from both of us. \u201cWhat are you guys even talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from The Sound of Music,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou mean that movie about the nun? Never seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow have you seen The Sopranos but not The Sound of Music?\u201d</p><p>Alarmed, Daddy says, \u201cKitty\u2019s been watching The Sopranos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the commercials,\u201d Kitty quickly says.</p><p>I go on singing to myself, spinning in a circle like Liesl at the gazebo. \u201cI am sixteen going on seventeen, innocent as a rose. . . . Fellows I meet may tell me I\u2019m sweet, and willingly I believe. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you just willingly believe some random fellows you don\u2019t even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the song, Kitty, not me! God!\u201d I stop spinning. \u201cLiesl was kind of a ninny, though. I mean, it was basically her fault they almost got captured by the Nazis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would venture to say it was Captain von Trapp\u2019s fault,\u201d Daddy says. \u201cRolfe was a kid himself\u2014he was going to let them go, but then Georg had to antagonize him.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cGeorg von Trapp, he had quite the ego. Hey, we should do a Sound of Music night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThis movie sounds terrible,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cWhat kind of name is Georg?\u201d</p><p>We ignore her. Daddy says, \u201cTonight? I\u2019ll make tacos al pastor!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going over to Belleview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Kitty?\u201d Daddy asks.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s mom is teaching us how to make latke cakes,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cDid you know that you put applesauce on top of them and it\u2019s delicious?\u201d</p><p>Daddy\u2019s shoulders slump. \u201cYes, I did know that. I\u2019m going to have to start booking you guys a month in advance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr you could invite Ms. Rothschild over,\u201d Kitty suggests. \u201cHer weekends are pretty lonely too.\u201d</p><p>He gives her a funny look. \u201cI\u2019m sure she has plenty she\u2019d rather do than watch The Sound of Music with her neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Brightly I say, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the tacos al pastor! Those are a draw, too. And you, of course. You\u2019re a draw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely a draw,\u201d Kitty pipes up.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Daddy begins.</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say. \u201cLet me just say one thing. You should be going on some dates, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go on dates!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone on, like, two dates ever,\u201d I say, and he falls silent. \u201cWhy not ask Ms. Rothschild out? She\u2019s cute, she has a good job, Kitty loves her. And she lives really close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s exactly why I shouldn\u2019t ask her out,\u201d Daddy says. \u201cYou should never date a neighbor or a coworker, because then you\u2019ll have to keep seeing them if things don\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>Kitty asks, \u201cYou mean like that quote \u2018Don\u2019t shit where you eat\u2019?\u201d When Daddy frowns, Kitty quickly corrects herself. \u201cI mean \u2018Don\u2019t poop where you eat.\u2019 That\u2019s what you mean, right, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose that\u2019s what I mean, but Kitty, I don\u2019t like you using cuss words.\u201d</p> <p>Contritely she says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But I still think you should give Ms. Rothschild a chance. If it doesn\u2019t work out, it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d hate to see you get your hopes up,\u201d Daddy says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s life,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cThings don\u2019t always work out. Look at Lara Jean and Peter.\u201d</p><p>I give her a dirty look. \u201cGee, thanks a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to make a point,\u201d she says. Kitty goes over to Daddy and puts her arms around his waist. This kid is really pulling out all the stops. \u201cJust think about it, Daddy. Tacos. Nuns. Nazis. And Ms. Rothschild.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cI\u2019m sure she has plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me if you asked her out, she\u2019d say yes,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>Daddy startles. \u201cShe did? Are you sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . then maybe I will ask her out. For a coffee, or a drink. The Sound of Music is a bit long for a first date.\u201d</p><p>Kitty and I both whoop and high-five each other.</p><p>54</p><p>BIRTHDAY BREAKFAST AT THE DINER was a bit of a tradition with Margot and Josh and me. If my birthday was on a weekday, we\u2019d wake up early and go before school. I\u2019d order blueberry pancakes, and Margot would put a candle in them, and they\u2019d sing.</p><p>The day of my seventeenth birthday, Josh sends me a Happy Bday text, but I get that we won\u2019t be going to the diner. He has a girlfriend now, and it would be weird, especially with no Margot. The text is enough.</p><p>For breakfast Daddy makes chorizo scrambled eggs, and Kitty\u2019s made me a big card with pictures of Jamie pasted all over it. Margot video-chats me to wish me happy birthday and to tell me my present should be arriving that afternoon or the next.</p><p>At school Chris and Lucas put a candle in the donuts they got out of the vending machine and they sing me \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d in the hallway. Chris gives me a new lipstick: red for when I want to be bad, she says. Peter doesn\u2019t say anything to me in chemistry class; I doubt he knows it\u2019s my birthday, and besides, what could I even expect him to say after the way things ended between us? Still, it\u2019s a nice day, uneventful in its niceness.</p><p>But then, as I\u2019m leaving school, I see John parked out front. He\u2019s standing in front of his car; he hasn\u2019t seen me yet. In this bright afternoon light, the sun warms John\u2019s blond head like a halo, and suddenly I\u2019m struck with the visceral memory of loving him from afar, studiously, ardently. I so admired his slender hands, the slope of his cheekbones. Once upon a time I knew his face by heart. I had him memorized.</p><p>My steps quicken. \u201cHi!\u201d I say, waving. \u201cHow are you here right now? Don\u2019t have you school today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left early,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou? John Ambrose McClaren cut school?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI brought you something.\u201d John pulls a box out of his coat pocket and thrusts it at me. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I take it from him, it\u2019s heavy and substantial in my palm. \u201cShould I . . . should I open it right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>I can feel his eyes on me as I rip off the paper, open the white box. He\u2019s anxious. I ready a smile on my face so he\u2019ll know I like it, no matter what it is. Just the fact that he thought to buy me a present is so . . . dear.</p><p>Nestled in white tissue paper is a snow globe the size of an orange, with a brass bottom. A boy and girl are ice-skating inside. She\u2019s wearing a red sweater; she has on earmuffs. She\u2019s making a figure eight, and he\u2019s admiring her. It\u2019s a moment caught in amber. One perfect moment, preserved under glass. Just like that night it snowed in April.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I say, and I do, so much. Only a person who really knew me could give me this gift. To feel so known, so understood. It\u2019s such a wonderful feeling, I could cry. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll keep forever. This moment, and this snow globe.</p><p>I get on my tiptoes and hug him, and he wraps his arms around me tight and then tighter. \u201cHappy birthday, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to get into his car when I see Peter striding over to us. \u201cHold up a second,\u201d he says, a pleasant half smile on his face.</p><p>Warily I say, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Kavinsky,\u201d John says.</p><p>Peter gives him a nod. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to say happy birthday, Covey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014you saw me in chem class . . . ,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, you left in a hurry. I have something for you. Open up your hands.\u201d He takes the snow globe out of my hand and gives it to John. \u201cHere, can you hold this?\u201d</p><p>I look from Peter to John. Now I\u2019m nervous.</p><p>\u201cHold your hands out,\u201d Peter prompts. I look at John one more time before I obey, and Peter pulls something out of his pocket and drops it into my palms. My heart locket. \u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly I say, \u201cI thought you returned the necklace to your mom\u2019s store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Wouldn\u2019t look right on another girl.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cPeter, I can\u2019t accept this.\u201d I try to give it back, but he shakes his head; he won\u2019t take it. \u201cPeter, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When I get you back, I\u2019m gonna put that necklace back around your neck and pin you.\u201d He tries to hold my eyes with his own. \u201cLike the 1950s. Remember, Lara Jean?\u201d</p> <p>I open my mouth and then close it. \u201cI don\u2019t think pin means what you think it means,\u201d I tell him, holding the necklace out to him. \u201cPlease, just take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what your wish is,\u201d he urges. \u201cWish for anything, and I\u2019ll give it to you, Lara Jean. All you have to do is ask.\u201d</p><p>I feel dizzy. All around us, people are exiting the building, walking to their cars. John is standing beside me, and Peter is looking at me like we\u2019re the only two people here. Anywhere.</p><p>It\u2019s John\u2019s voice that makes me break away. \u201cWhat are you doing, Kavinsky?\u201d John says, shaking his head. \u201cThis is pathetic. You treated her like garbage and now you decide you want her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, Sundance Kid,\u201d Peter snaps. To me he says softly, \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t break my heart. In the contract you said you wouldn\u2019t, but you did, Covey.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve never heard him sound so sincere, so heartfelt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, my voice whisper-thin. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look back at Peter as I get into the car, but his necklace is still dangling from my fist. At the last second I turn around, but we\u2019re too far away; I can\u2019t see if Peter\u2019s still there or not. My heart is racing. What would I regret losing more? The reality of Peter or the dream of John? Who can\u2019t I live without?</p><p>I think back to John\u2019s hand on mine. Lying next to him in the snow. The way his eyes looked even bluer when he laughed. I don\u2019t want to give that up. I don\u2019t want to give up Peter, either. There are so many things to love about them both. Peter\u2019s boyish confidence, his sunny outlook on life, the way he is so kind to Kitty. The way my heart flips over every time I see his car pull up in front of my house.</p><p>We drive in silence for a few minutes, and then, looking straight ahead, John says, \u201cDid I even have a shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could fall in love with you so easily,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m halfway there already.\u201d His Adam\u2019s apple bobs in his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re so perfect in my memory, and you\u2019re perfect now. It\u2019s like I dreamed you into being. Of all the boys, you\u2019re the one I would pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut . . . I still love Peter. I can\u2019t help it. He got here first and he . . . he just won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>He sighs a defeated kind of sigh that hurts my heart. \u201cGoddamn it, Kavinsky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I like you, too, John, I really do. I wish . . . I wish we got to go to that eighth grade formal.\u201d</p><p>And then John Ambrose McClaren says one last thing, a thing that makes my heart swell. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was our time then. I guess it isn\u2019t now, either.\u201d John looks over at me, his gaze steady. \u201cBut one day maybe it will be.\u201d</p><p>55</p><p>I\u2019M IN THE GIRLS\u2019 BATHROOM, retying a bow around my ponytail, when Genevieve walks in. My mouth goes dry. She freezes, and then she turns on her heel to go inside a stall. When I say, \u201cYou and I are always meeting in the bathroom,\u201d she doesn\u2019t reply. \u201cGen . . . I\u2019m sorry for the other day.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve whirls around and advances on me. \u201cI don\u2019t want your apology.\u201d She grabs my arm. \u201cBut if you tell one single person, I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t!\u201d I cry out. \u201cI won\u2019t! I would never do that.\u201d</p> <p>She releases my arm. \u201cBecause you feel sorry for me, right?\u201d Genevieve laughs bitterly. \u201cYou\u2019re such a little phony. Your whole sugary sweet routine makes me sick, you know that? You\u2019ve got everyone fooled, but I know who you really are.\u201d</p><p>The venom in her voice stuns me. \u201cWhat did I ever do to you? Why do you hate me so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Stop. Quit acting like you don\u2019t know. You need to own the shit you did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat I did to you? You\u2019re the one who put a sexy video of me on the Internet! You don\u2019t get to change the story because you feel like it. I\u2019m \u00c9ponine; you\u2019re Cosette! Don\u2019t make me out to be the Cosette!\u201d</p><p>Her lip curls. \u201cWhat the fuck are you even talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLes Mis!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t watch musicals.\u201d She turns like she\u2019s going to leave, and then she stops and says, \u201cI saw you guys that day in seventh grade. I saw you kiss him.\u201d</p><p>She was there?</p><p>She sees my surprise; she revels in it. \u201cI left my jacket down there, and when I went back to get it, I saw the two of you kissing on the couch. You broke the most basic rule of girl code, Lara Jean. Somehow in your mind you\u2019ve made me out to be the villain. But what you should know is I wasn\u2019t being a bitch just for the sake of being a bitch. You deserved it.\u201d</p><p>My head is spinning. \u201cIf you knew, why did you keep being my friend? You didn\u2019t stop being my friend until later.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve shrugs. \u201cBecause I liked throwing it in your face. I had him and you didn\u2019t. Believe me, we weren\u2019t friends anymore from that moment on.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s odd that out of all the things she\u2019s ever said to me, this hurts the most. \u201cJust so you know, I didn\u2019t kiss him. He kissed me. I didn\u2019t even think of him that way, not before that kiss.\u201d</p><p>Then she says, \u201cThe only reason he even kissed you that day was because I wouldn\u2019t. You were second choice.\u201d She runs her hand through her hair. \u201cIf you had admitted it back then, I might have forgiven you. Might have. But you never did.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cI wanted to. But it was my first kiss, and it was with the wrong guy, and I knew he didn\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>It all makes sense. Why she went to such lengths to keep me and Peter apart. Leaning on him, making him prove she was still his first choice. It\u2019s no excuse for all the things she\u2019s done, but I see my part in it now. I should\u2019ve told her about the kiss right away, way back in seventh grade. I knew how much she liked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Genevieve. I truly am. If I could take it back, I would.\u201d Her eyebrow twitches, and I know she\u2019s not unmoved. Impulsively I say, \u201cWe were friends once. Can we\u2014do you think we can ever be friends again?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looks at me with such complete and utter disdain, like I\u2019m a child who\u2019s asked for the moon. \u201cGrow up, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>In a lot of ways, I feel like I have.</p><p>56</p><p>I\u2019M LYING DOWN ON MY back in the tree house, looking out the window. The moon is carved so thin, it\u2019s a thumbnail clipping in the sky. Tomorrow, no more tree house. I\u2019ve barely thought about this place, and now that it\u2019s disappearing, I\u2019m sad. It\u2019s like all childhood toys, I suppose. It doesn\u2019t become important until you don\u2019t have it anymore. But it\u2019s more than just a tree house. It\u2019s good-bye, and it feels like the end of everything.</p> <p>As I sit up, I see it, purple string poking out of a floorboard, sprouting forth like a blade of grass. I tug on the end and it pulls free. It\u2019s Genevieve\u2019s friendship bracelet, the one I gave to her.</p><p>Believe me, we weren\u2019t friends anymore from that moment on.</p><p>That isn\u2019t true. We still had sleepovers, birthdays; she still cried to me the time she thought her parents were getting divorced. She couldn\u2019t have hated me that whole time. I won\u2019t believe it. This friendship bracelet proves it.</p><p>Because it\u2019s what she put in the time capsule, her most treasured thing, just like it was mine. And then, at the party, she took it out, she hid it; she didn\u2019t want me to see. But now I know. I was important to her then too. We were true friends once. Tears spring to my eyes. Good-bye, Genevieve, good-bye middle school years, good-bye tree house and everything that was important to me that one hot summer.</p><p>People come in and out of your life. For a time they are your world; they are everything. And then one day they\u2019re not. There\u2019s no telling how long you will have them near. A year ago I could not have imagined that Josh would no longer be a constant for me. I couldn\u2019t have conceived of how hard it would be to not see Margot every day, how lost I would feel without her\u2014or how easily Josh could slip away, without me even realizing. It\u2019s the good-byes that are hard.</p> <p>\u201cCovey?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice calls up to me from outside, down below in the dark.</p><p>I sit up. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He climbs up the ladder quickly, ducking so his head doesn\u2019t hit the ceiling. He crawls over to the tree-house wall opposite from me, so we are sitting on either side. \u201cThey\u2019re bulldozing the tree house tomorrow,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re going to put up a gazebo. You know, like in The Sound of Music?\u201d</p><p>Peter squints one eye at me. \u201cWhy did you call me over here, Lara Jean? I know it wasn\u2019t to talk about The Sound of Music.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know about Genevieve. Her secret, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He leans his back against the tree-house wall, and his head drops back with a slight thud. \u201cHer dad\u2019s an asshole. He\u2019s cheated on her mom before. Just never with someone so young.\u201d He speaks in a rush, like it\u2019s a relief to finally say the words out loud. \u201cWhen things got really bad with her parents, Gen would find ways to hurt herself. I had to be the one to protect her. That was my job. Sometimes it scared me, but I liked being, I don\u2019t know . . . needed.\u201d Then he sighs and says, \u201cI know she can be manipulative\u2014I\u2019ve always known that. In some ways it was easier for me to default back to what I knew. I think maybe I was scared.\u201d</p><p>My breath catches. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf disappointing you.\u201d Peter looks away. \u201cI know sex is a big deal to you. I didn\u2019t want to mess it up. You\u2019re so innocent, Lara Jean. And I have all this shit in my past.\u201d</p><p>I want to say, I never cared about your past. But that isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s only then that I realize: Peter wasn\u2019t the one who needed to get over Genevieve. It was me. All this time with Peter, I\u2019ve been comparing myself to her, all the ways I don\u2019t measure up. All the ways our relationship pales next to theirs. I\u2019m the one who couldn\u2019t let her go. I\u2019m the one who didn\u2019t give us a chance.</p><p>Suddenly he asks, \u201cWhat do you wish for, Lara Jean? Now that you\u2019ve won. Congrats, by the way. You did it.\u201d</p><p>I feel a rush of emotion in my chest. \u201cI wish that things could go back to the way they were between us. That you could be you and I could be me, and we\u2019d have fun with each other, and it would be a really sweet first romance that I\u2019ll remember my whole life.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m blushing as I say this last bit, but I\u2019m glad I did, because it makes Peter\u2019s eyes go soft and caramelly at me for just a second, and I have to look away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like it\u2019s doomed already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to. The first isn\u2019t necessarily the last, but it will always be the first, and that\u2019s special. Firsts are special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not first,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut you\u2019re the most special to me, because you\u2019re the girl I love, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>Love. He said \u201clove.\u201d I feel dizzy. I am a girl who is loved, by a boy, and not just her sisters and father and dog. A boy with beautiful eyebrows and a sleight of hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been going crazy without you.\u201d He scrubs the back of his head. \u201cCan\u2019t we just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I drive you crazy too?\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>He groans. \u201cI\u2019m saying you drive me more crazy than any girl I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>I crawl toward him, and I reach out and trace my finger along his eyebrow that feels like silk. I say, \u201cIn the contract we said we wouldn\u2019t break each other\u2019s hearts. What if we do it again?\u201d</p><p>Fiercely he says, \u201cWhat if we do? If we\u2019re so guarded, it\u2019s not going to be anything. Let\u2019s do it fucking for real, Lara Jean. Let\u2019s go all in. No more contract. No more safety net. You can break my heart. Do whatever you want with it.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand to his chest, over his heart. I can feel it beating. I let my hand fall away. His heart is mine, just mine. I believe it now. Mine to protect and care for, mine to break.</p><p>So much of love is chance. There\u2019s something scary and wonderful about that. If Kitty had never sent those letters, if I hadn\u2019t gone to the hot tub that night, it might\u2019ve been him and Gen. But she did send those letters, and I did go out there. It could have happened lots of ways. But this is the way it happened. This is the path we took. This is our story.</p><p>I know now that I don\u2019t want to love or be loved in half measures. I want it all, and to have it all, you have to risk it all.</p><p>So I take Peter\u2019s hand; I put it on my heart. I tell him, \u201cYou have to take good care of this, because it\u2019s yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>He looks at me in such a way that I know for sure\u2014he\u2019s never looked at another girl quite like this.</p><p>And then I\u2019m in his arms, and we\u2019re hugging and kissing, and we\u2019re both shaking, because we both know\u2014this is the night we become real.</p><p>\u201cReal isn\u2019t how you are made,\u201d said the Skin Horse. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing that happens to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d asked the Rabbit.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. \u201cWhen you are Real you don\u2019t mind being hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u2014MARGERY WILLIAMS</p>   </body></html>"]
