My gaze quickly fell on Jack, sprawled on the bed next to me, looking so content as he slept. The mere sight of him made my heart beat in double time, and I resisted the urge to wake him for round two. Or was it three? All the emotions from last night jumbled within me and before I could fully process them, I realized I actually felt happy. Apparently happiness had been eluding me for months now.</p><p>My new reality flooded my brain. Jack had appeared at my door last night after six months of no communication wearing a Mets jersey and holding a dozen red roses. He looked me in the eye and told me he was sorry, that he loved me, and that he would earn my trust again. I couldn\u2019t believe he was standing there, and it took everything in me to not fall apart at the mere sight of him. I wanted to take him back into my life, but I needed to know that this time it would be forever.</p> <p>And now he was lying next to me in bed. I had questions about why it took him so long to get here and why he never contacted me, but honestly, at that moment, none of it mattered.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what I tried to tell myself.</p><p>My questions could wait, but I knew they couldn\u2019t wait for long. I didn\u2019t have it in me to let things slide without an explanation. And honestly, Jack still had a lot of explaining to do.</p><p>Slowly, I rolled out of bed, trying not to wake him. I had just put my feet on the floor when he flung his strong arms around my waist, pulling me back into bed.</p><p>\u201cAnd where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Jack breathed against my neck.</p> <p>\u201cWherever I want, it\u2019s my apartment,\u201d I fired back with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you could leave the bed.\u201d He sounded so determined, I couldn\u2019t help but snicker.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your permission,\u201d I shot back, and he rolled on top of me before kissing the tip of my nose.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much I\u2019ve missed your feisty attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t missed the way you try to kill me with your body weight. Ugh, get off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d His face twisted in a devilish smirk as he slid his hand up the length of my bare thigh.</p> <p>I swatted his shoulder before rolling my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re such a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But I\u2019m your pig.\u201d He leaned down, pressing his lips against mine. Instinctively, I turned my head from him, narrowing my lips into a tight, impenetrable wall. Jack leaned away from me, rolling onto his side. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, covering my mouth with my hand. \u201cI can\u2019t kiss you like that in the morning. I have to brush my teeth first.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his head in agreement. \u201cYou do smell like a dragon.\u201d</p><p>My jaw fell open, but I quickly snapped it closed, trying my best to breathe as little as possible. \u201cI do not. Shut up!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and I lost myself in his gorgeous dimples. I\u2019d missed those.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, Kitten. You smell like roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow I ever missed your annoying attitude is beyond me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. This is what we do. You\u2019re a pain the ass, and I put up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d I pushed myself up from the bed, throwing him my best dirty look before I scurried out the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m teasing! You\u2019re a fucking angel for putting up with my shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I am, and don\u2019t you forget it!\u201d I shouted from the hallway.</p><p>I brushed my teeth in my tiny, one-person bathroom before returning to the bedroom. Jack hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. His blue eyes locked on mine, sending chills of anticipation shooting through my veins. It was crazy how I both loved and hated the effect he had on me. I hated the way he knew what he did to me. But I loved the way he made me feel.</p><p>I should probably seek psychiatric help.</p><p>Holding back a sigh, I sat on the edge of the bed before reclining on my side and turning to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Kitten?\u201d He furrowed his brows, two lines forming between them.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cI know you better than that, Cass. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d he said, his tone sincere.</p><p>I hesitated, unsure if I wanted to broach this subject already. He had just gotten here. I had just taken him back. But my mind was relentless. It wouldn\u2019t stop with the constant demand for answers, and I knew I\u2019d never fully be content until I had them. \u201cWhat happened after I left California to come to New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jack. It took you six months to get here. Six months!\u201d My tone sounded harsher than I intended, and I watched as he shifted his gaze away from mine. He exhaled slowly and ran his hands through his dark hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack. I just need to talk about this, or I\u2019ll bury it inside me and eventually explode.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, a small, rueful smile on his face. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. You deserve answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have time? I mean, do you have to go the field today?\u201d After all, he was a professional baseball player, and the season was in full swing.</p><p>\u201cThe team\u2019s on the road. They flew me here to get settled instead of flying me there. I have to report in tomorrow morning at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. So, we can talk about this now then?\u201d My pulse raced as nerves filled my body. Jack was here, with me, in my bed. He loved me, and he\u2019d never stopped. So, why was I so nervous?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after I left for New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a play-by-play for the entire six months? I might end up boring you back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, and he frowned. \u201cJust tell me the good parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this were a story filled with good parts, Kitten, I would have been here a long time ago,\u201d he teased, reaching out to caress my cheek with his thumb.</p><p>I leaned into his hand and closed my eyes, lost in the comfort his touch provided. \u201cI meant the parts that made you take so long. Give me the CliffsNotes version,\u201d I asked softly, unsure of what words would follow.</p><p>Jack snuggled me against him, and began to tell me the story.</p><p>And just like that, she was gone. But not before saying the two fucking words that plagued my nightmares. This girl always asked me to \u201cprove it,\u201d to prove my love and devotion for her. I deserved it after everything I put her through. She didn\u2019t trust me anymore.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t trust me either.</p><p>It\u2019s ironic though, right? That I was the one left standing all alone in a parking lot that time. I swear if my heart could have leaped out of my chest and into my hands, it would have. I imagined that for a moment... the blood trickling through my fingertips, splashing onto the concrete below as I watched it slowly pound out its last beats before stopping altogether.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>My life does not make sense without this girl. And now she\u2019s gone.</p><p>Again.</p><p>How is it that I\u2019m always losing her?</p><p>I unbuttoned my game jersey and let it fall around the top of my uniform\u2019s sliding pants. I glanced behind me toward the apartment door at the top of the stairs and slowly started to make my way there, my cleats clanging loudly on the pavement with each step. I wasn\u2019t ready to go back to the hotel with my team. Not right then. They\u2019d be celebrating the night\u2019s win, and I needed to grieve the night\u2019s loss.</p><p>The vision of Cassie disappearing from view in that taxi played over and over again in my mind. I closed my eyes, willing the hateful image to disappear. The sound of feminine laughter and my brother\u2019s familiar voice woke me from my Cassie-filled daze.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. Jack?\u201d Melissa\u2019s sympathy came through loud and clear, both in her eyes and in her tone.</p><p>I glanced up at Cassie\u2019s best friend standing on the stairs with my little brother. Dean was only a couple years younger than I was, but he\u2019d always be little to me, even if he did almost match my height. My eyes were heavy, my head pounded, and I simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome on, bro, let\u2019s get you inside.\u201d Dean wrapped an arm around my back and propelled me up the cement staircase as Melissa unlocked the front door to her apartment and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cDid you see her?\u201d she asked, tossing all her crap on top of the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cI saw her,\u201d I responded coolly, adding my hat to the mess as I dropped into a chair at the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, what the hell happened? What did she say?\u201d she demanded, gesturing wildly.</p><p>\u201cShe left.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s moving to New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course she\u2019s moving to New York,\u201d she said, her voice turning cold.</p><p>Dean placed a hand on my shoulder, before explaining, \u201cMelissa just means that Cassie has to start living her life for herself. She has to make decisions that have nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>The words hurt like hell. I jerked my head up, glaring at my little brother. \u201cI know that. You think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? Do you really, or did you think she\u2019d just leap into your arms and you\u2019d live happily ever after?\u201d Dean shot back, his voice filled with accusation.</p><p>A quick huff ripped from my lips, and I smiled sheepishly. \u201cI thought there might be some leaping,\u201d I admitted, shrugging one shoulder.</p><p>Melissa\u2019s usually sweet mouth twisted into a snarl. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Jack. You expect her to give up her career because you asked her to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask her to give up her career. I just figured she\u2019d at least talk to me. Postpone her flight. Give me a fucking chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the way you gave her a chance before you married that skank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa,\u201d Dean chastised softly, touching her arm in a way that somehow managed to erase the anger from her face.</p><p>My chest tightened and my jaw clenched as Melissa\u2019s assumptions pierced me like the daggers they were. \u201cYou think it didn\u2019t fucking kill me to leave Cassie that night? All I wanted to do was stay with her, beg for her forgiveness and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t! You didn\u2019t stay with her. You left her crying in a parking lot alone while you left with that bitch!\u201d Melissa screamed as she released every ounce of frustration she\u2019d built up on behalf of Cassie, her recrimination drilling into my skull and my heart.</p><p>\u201cI know what I did!\u201d I shouted back, my neck throbbing. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t fucking know what I did? I have to live with it every second of every day. I fucked up, OK? We all know I fucked up!\u201d I slammed my palms against the table and watched as some loose change rattled and rolled onto the carpet below, bringing back memories of my first date with Cassie. My mind filled with the image of her sitting across from me in that small booth in the back of the restaurant. I remembered pulling the paper bag from my jacket and pouring the quarters out onto the tabletop, proud of my cleverness, as several rolled onto the tiled floor below. All of the memories that used to bring me joy now filled my heart with pain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just know what you did if you want to make it right. You have to know what it did to her,\u201d Melissa said, her voice starting to soften. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glared at her, willing my temper to subside. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knew what you\u2019d done by the time Cassie got back from visiting you in Alabama. It was all over the newspapers that you were getting married. And on Facebook. Did you know that the stupid school magazine she worked for had the balls to call and ask her for pictures of you? They said they only had old ones and wanted to know if she had any newer ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d I spat out in disgust.</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p> <p>My hands balled into fists. \u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill them, the inconsiderate little\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pointed an accusing finger at me, stopping me in mid-rant. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the newspapers, Facebook, and the magazine. It was everywhere she went. School was the worst. Cassie couldn\u2019t even walk across campus without people making comments and snide remarks. She had the most personal and painful moments of her life on display for everyone to see and judge. And trust me, everyone had an opinion about your breakup.\u201d</p><p>I cringed. Just hearing this was painful enough; I couldn\u2019t imagine my girl having to live through it. \u201cI had no idea that was happening or I would have done something to stop it. I would have made sure no one ever said another negative word to her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you this to make you feel bad, Jack. I\u2019m telling you this so you\u2019ll understand the repercussions your actions had on her. You made the mistake, but she had to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my head into my hands and pulled at my hair in frustration, my fingers twisting the strands as I fought back the tears forming in my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou broke her, Jack.\u201d Melissa added the final blow as my stomach dropped to my feet. I\u2019d hurt Cassie in ways I\u2019d never imagined. Ways I\u2019d never meant to. Ways I\u2019d never be able to forgive myself for.</p><p>\u201cI broke me too,\u201d I admitted, brushing away the lone tear that dared sneak down my face.</p><p>\u201cJack, look.\u201d Melissa sat down across from me and folded her arms on the table. \u201cI love you, I really do. But you have to let her go do this.\u201d</p><p>My chest constricted with the truth of her words as I swallowed hard. \u201cI want her back. I need her. It\u2019s either Cassie for me or no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one you have to convince.\u201d She reached out her hand, her fingertips brushing over my knuckles before I pulled away.</p><p>I ripped my gaze from her bright blue eyes and glanced at my brother. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe still loves you,\u201d Dean said, before taking a pull from his bottle of water. My eyes narrowed and he reacted with, \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t believe that? She does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether or not Cassie loves him,\u201d Melissa said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit about that, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation,\u201d Dean said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHave you even been paying attention?\u201d she teased, her hair bouncing along her shoulders as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDean\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t have a fighting chance if she didn\u2019t love me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you gonna do?\u201d Melissa\u2019s expression challenged me.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m going to get that marriage annulled. Then I\u2019m going to hop on a plane to New York and get my girl back,\u201d I said with newfound determination.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>I ran my hand through my hair and let out a huff. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>Uncertainty lingered in the air, awkward in its silence. Pressure gnawed at me, insisting that this time I get it right. If I was going after this girl and begging her for another chance, I\u2019d better make sure it counted. Because if I messed this up, we\u2019d be over for good. I knew at least that much.</p><p>\u201cCan I use the bathroom?\u201d I asked before standing, needing an excuse to go into Cassie\u2019s room, longing to be surrounded by any parts of her that she left.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I use hers?\u201d I don\u2019t know why I was asking if I could use Cassie\u2019s bathroom. What the hell was Melissa going to tell me\u2014no? Like I\u2019d listen to her even if she did.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d she said, with an eye roll she knew would annoy me.</p><p>I stepped into Cassie\u2019s bedroom and scanned the walls, my insides aching at the emptiness. All her photos were gone; there wasn\u2019t much left aside from her furniture. But then my eyes caught a glimpse of it, and my heart pounded out a ragged beat. I inched toward her bed, sitting down on the edge before reaching for her nightstand. The Mason jar filled with quarters sat there mocking me, almost filled to the top. The same one I\u2019d given her, the quarters intended to \u201cpay\u201d her for every time I touched her. I flashed back to grabbing her arm the first time I saw her at the fraternity party that night. She ripped herself from my grip and practically shouted, \u201cIt costs fifty cents every time you touch me. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d I wanted that sassy little mouth back in my life.</p><p>My eyes refocused on the Mason jar; the handwritten note that read \u201cKitten\u2019s Quarters\u201d was still attached. She didn\u2019t take it with her. Why the fuck didn\u2019t she take it? This was a bad sign. She moved all the way across the freaking country and left a piece of us here. A very important piece.</p><p>The jar in my hands mocked me, boasting its fullness while my heart remained empty. I turned the glass with my fingers, running my thumb across its smooth surface. I thought about smashing it against the wall and watching it burst into a hundred pieces so it mirrored my fractured emotions, but knew I\u2019d instantly regret it.</p><p>The roller coaster of my relationship with Cassie needed to stop. It\u2019s not that I wanted to get off the ride. I simply wanted it to be less like the bone-rattling, headache-inducing, rickety wooden roller coasters of the past, and more like the fluid smoothness of the state-of-the-art steel coasters of modern day.</p><p>I set the jar back in its place and walked out of her room, leaving what was left of my heart somewhere between the nightstand and the bedroom floor.</p><p>\u201cHow come some of her stuff\u2019s still here?\u201d I stared into Melissa\u2019s blue eyes as I reentered the living room.</p><p>\u201cWe figured it would be easier to leave it here for now. We don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s staying there, and I\u2019m not moving anytime soon. Besides, finding a fully furnished apartment in New York is easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean that you don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s staying there?\u201d I asked, eager for every piece of information I could gather about Cassie\u2019s future plans.</p><p>\u201cShe might hate living there. Or the job might not work out. She just didn\u2019t know for sure, you know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, averting my eyes as my mind replayed memories of being in this apartment with her. A quick vision of her in that white sundress before I brought her home to meet my family for the first time flashed in my head and I winced, squeezing my eyes shut against the sharp pain that followed.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Melissa\u2019s voice forced my eyes to reopen.</p><p>Swallowing hard, I said, \u201cJust fighting ghosts.\u201d</p><p>I needed to leave.</p><p>I needed out of that apartment where Cassie\u2019s scent and my memories of her lingered. It hurt to be there without her, and I suddenly realized what it must have been like for her when I was gone and living with someone else. How painful it must have been to live here with the knowledge of everything I\u2019d done to us. How much she must have suffered for my actions. She was innocent in all of this, so why had she paid the highest price?</p><p>\u201cI gotta get back to my hotel before they freak out and think I\u2019ve gone AWOL or something.\u201d I headed for the front door, my head throbbing with each battered beat of my heart.</p><p>\u201cYou need me to drop you off?\u201d Dean asked, his eyebrows pinching together.</p><p>\u201cUnless you want me to take your car back to the hotel. But, you\u2019ll have to pick it up first thing tomorrow so it doesn\u2019t get towed,\u201d I noted, gently reminding him that the team was scheduled to head back to Arizona in the morning.</p><p>Dean glanced at Melissa before flashing me a smile. \u201cNope. I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack? Don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m here too. You can call me anytime, and I\u2019ll help you if I can,\u201d Melissa said with a sympathetic smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna hold you to that.\u201d I forced a half smile in return.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because even though you\u2019re a stupid jerk-face, you\u2019re her stupid jerk-face and you two belong together,\u201d she whispered, before wrapping her arms around my waist and squeezing me with more force than I realized her tiny frame could provide.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Funsize,\u201d I choked out, and she giggled.</p><p>Dean tossed an arm around her shoulders and squeezed as he looked down at her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d she said, and I didn\u2019t miss the look in her eyes. Or his.</p><p>I grabbed the keys from the table, pulled my Diamondbacks hat back onto my head, and turned for the door.</p><p>We walked in silence toward the gunmetal color Mustang I\u2019d bought for Dean, the tinted windows looking almost pitch black in the darkness. He\u2019d complained at first, insisting he didn\u2019t need it, but I knew it was his dream car and wanted to do something nice for him when I got my signing bonus. I tossed him the keys and waited at the passenger door. He clicked the remote, two beeps filled the night air, and we both slid into the chilly leather seats.</p><p>The engine purred to life as I stared out the window, my mind racing with at least a dozen thoughts all vying for my undivided attention. I shook my head and focused on my brother. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up with you and Meli?\u201d I asked, eager for a distraction.</p><p>He grinned as he pulled out of the parking lot, but wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cNothing. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d I punched him playfully in the arm, causing him to yank the steering wheel and the car to swerve with a jerk.</p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d He glanced at me quickly before turning his attention back on the road.</p><p>\u201cTell me, what\u2019s up with you two? I saw the way she was looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way? How was she looking at me?\u201d Dean straightened up in the driver\u2019s seat. I clearly had his attention.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? You don\u2019t see the way she looks at you? With her eyes all hot like she wants to eat you up. Are you really that clueless?\u201d</p><p>Dean snorted. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we even related? Dude, she wants you. Trust me on this. I know women.\u201d</p><p>The roar of the car\u2019s engine as he accelerated on the highway was the only sound in the car. Dean focused intently on the road ahead, before glancing at me and letting out a long sigh.</p><p>\u201cI tried to kiss her once. I thought I\u2019d read all the signs right. But she stopped me,\u201d he admitted, his voice dejected.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask her why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just apologized.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Leave it to my brother to be sorry for trying to kiss the girl he\u2019d spent every spare moment with. \u201cJesus, Dean. I\u2019d bet a thousand bucks that she wants you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t she let me kiss her?\u201d He glanced at me again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question. You should ask her,\u201d I said. \u201cTime to grow a pair, little brother. How are you going to feel if she starts dating someone else?\u201d</p><p>I watched his knuckles turn white as his grip on the steering wheel tightened. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>Dean pulled into the hotel parking lot, and I hopped out of the car, half praying that my teammates would be in their rooms instead of the hotel bar. I walked around to the driver\u2019s side and extended my hand toward my brother, before he grabbed it and pulled me in for an awkward through-the-window hug. I pulled back, and we slapped each other on the shoulders before sharing a long look. I broke eye contact and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cIt will all work out. You\u2019ll get her back,\u201d Dean predicted with naive confidence.</p><p>I breathed deeply before saying, \u201cI fucking better, or I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d Dean grinned up at me with a smile that looked eerily like my own.</p><p>I nodded and admitted, \u201cI\u2019ll need it.\u201d Giving him one last pat, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlright. Take care.\u201d</p><p>I watched as he drove off, his hand sticking out of the window in a good-bye wave. I raised my arm, waving back before he was out of view.</p><p>With a deep sigh, I headed indoors. All hopes for a quiet entrance were dashed as the sound of my last name filtered through the hotel bar and into the lobby.</p><p>\u201cCarter! Carterrrrr! Get in here!\u201d</p><p>I glanced to my right, noticing a few of my teammates getting comfortable with a group of good-looking women. I shook my head before walking over, making no attempt to hide the disapproval on my face.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you run off to tonight, kid?\u201d my teammate Costas asked, his head peering around the scantily clad woman currently sitting on his lap. I thought about his wife, staying home with their kids while he traveled with the team, and forced my judgment into quiet submission.</p> <p>\u201cI had some personal shit to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a drink with us,\u201d he said and gestured for the blonde bartender. She finished drying the glass in her hands before setting it down and heading our way.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cMore drinks for us, then.\u201d Costas winked, and my stomach turned. I wanted to lose my shit on him, just grab him by his smug face and ask if he realized what he was doing, what he was risking. How just one girl... one meaningless night... could cause his world to crumble around him. But I couldn\u2019t get pissed at Costas for my mistakes, my loss.</p><p>\u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d I turned away from the bar, their comments following behind me.</p><p>\u201cPoor rookie, did you see his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the big leagues, kid... women in every state. No offense, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Idiots.</p> <p>They\u2019d misread the disgust on my face as shock. Maybe if they were ever forced to lose the one person who meant everything to them, they\u2019d understand what my face was truly saying.</p><p>I made my way into my hotel room and collapsed onto the bed. With my cell phone in hand, I stared at the screen for what seemed like hours, resisting the urge to dial Cassie\u2019s number, or send her a text message. I realized it wasn\u2019t going to be easy to stay away from her when everything in my body wanted her back.</p><p>Suddenly, I shot up from my bed and made my way toward the desk in my room. Using the hotel\u2019s complimentary stationery and pen, I did something I couldn\u2019t remember ever doing in my life.</p><p>I wrote her a letter.</p><p>Kitten,</p><p>I\u2019ve realized that the only way I\u2019ll be able to stop myself from calling you, or texting you, or e-mailing you, or sending a carrier pigeon to your fucking window, is to write to you. Which sort of makes me feel like a pussy, honestly. But if I don\u2019t do this, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll ruin it all before I even get the chance to fix it.</p><p>You\u2019re probably wondering what happened tonight. I know you didn\u2019t expect to see me, and I don\u2019t even know how you\u2019re feeling about the whole thing, but I hope it\u2019s the same way I feel. I never stopped loving you. I know I may have a funny way of showing it, but I\u2019ll make it up to you. You\u2019ll see.</p><p>I\u2019m dying to get on the next flight to New York and win you back. But I can\u2019t do that until I\u2019m free and clear from all my past attachments. I\u2019m just trying to do the right thing by you. I realize that my idea of the right thing isn\u2019t always everyone else\u2019s, but I hope in this case you\u2019ll agree with me.</p><p>So... I hope you\u2019ll understand that I won\u2019t come and ask for your forgiveness while I\u2019m still legally married to someone else.</p><p>You probably think that\u2019s stupid, right?</p><p>I\u2019ll always love you.</p><p>Jack</p><p>He finished telling me about the night I left, and I blinked back the tears forming in my eyes. \u201cYou wrote me a letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote you a lot of letters.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, I mumbled, \u201cI\u2019d like to see those someday.\u201d</p><p>Through my shock, I literally ached for a subject change. I knew I\u2019d asked for this, but it hurt. Talking about our past shouldn\u2019t matter for our future. But that was my dumb heart talking. My heart... my little, keep-me-in-a-box-wrapped-in-cotton-behind-a-wall-built-with-bricks-and-stone-and-concrete-where-no-one-can-ever-hurt-me, stupid heart. My mind was at war with that beating thing. I fully believed that if my heart and my head could wage a battle within me, they would. And eventually, I\u2019d die from it.</p><p>No, Cassie.</p><p>You need to hear this.</p><p>The only way to move forward without regret was to accept what happened. I couldn\u2019t change our past, but I could change our future. And in order for me to truly forgive him and learn to trust him again, I needed to hear what took him so long. Truthfully, I longed to begin my own internal healing.</p><p>\u201cSo, then what?\u201d My demeanor turned serious with my tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean... so, then what?\u201d he asked, his expression showing he was perplexed by my question.</p><p>\u201cThat was only the night I left. Then what happened? We have six months of CliffsNotes to get through here, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to get kicked off the team the next day,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>I propped myself up immediately. \u201cShut the hell up. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Tired and bleary-eyed, I flung the strap of my bag over my shoulder and pressed the Down button on the elevator. I fidgeted with my tie, straightening my jacket as the doors dinged before opening, and I stepped inside the empty compartment.</p><p>The lobby filled quickly with chatter as the rest of my team filtered in, dragging duffle bags, and some even dragging their kids behind them.</p><p>I checked out, tugged on my hat, and walked out toward the waiting charter bus.</p><p>\u201cCarter, come here.\u201d Coach\u2019s voice startled me, and I dropped the bag at my side.</p><p>I walked over to him, and he tossed his arm around my shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d he said.</p><p>Shit. Is he sending me back down to the minor leagues already?</p><p>Coach leaned in and locked his gaze with mine. \u201cYou\u2019re a good kid, Carter. I like you. But don\u2019t ever bolt out of my clubhouse again before I tell you that you can go. You understand me?\u201d His voice was kind, but there was steel underneath it he wanted me to hear.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m really sorry about that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, kid. Just don\u2019t let it happen again or I\u2019ll send your ass down to the minors so quick your head\u2019ll spin,\u201d he threatened, making sure I understood my position on the team totem pole. Message received, loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cYes, Coach,\u201d I answered respectfully, thankful that no one else was close enough to hear our conversation.</p><p>\u201cGo get on the bus.\u201d He patted my shoulder with a slight shove.</p><p>\u201cI would have cried,\u201d I told him with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t have. But I was scared shitless,\u201d he admitted with an uncomfortable laugh.</p><p>\u201cI bet. OK, so you flew back to Arizona for the game. We both know how that went.\u201d I paused, referring to the game they lost that ended his postseason for the year. \u201cThen what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re enjoying this a little too much.\u201d He pulled the pillow out from under me, and my head crashed against the mattress.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I yelled, stretching for the pillow he held just out of reach. \u201cJack, really. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>He threw my pillow across the room and then patted the top of his invitingly. Forcing me to share his pillow, he pressed his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cYou want to hear how I starting stalking you as soon as I got back to Arizona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, absolutely,\u201d I practically squealed, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you over breakfast. I\u2019m starving.\u201d He winked and planted a kiss on my forehead before hopping out of bed. Then he stretched his arms above him and his muscles flexed and bulged. My gaze locked onto his defined, tanned abs. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, I\u2019ve seen better,\u201d I said playfully, refusing to feed the beast that is Jack Carter\u2019s ego.</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt it.\u201d He ran a hand down the length of his well-chiseled stomach. \u201cThis is Grade-A certified goods right here. You\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t charge admission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what? The gun show?\u201d I pointed at his arms, my lips curling up in amusement.</p><p>\u201cExactly! The gun show,\u201d he teased, before jumping on the bed and pinning me beneath him. He held me tight as I squirmed, trying to wriggle out of his hold. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were eating,\u201d I said with attitude, cocking my head to one side.</p><p>He released a hard breath, pushing himself off the bed. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then. You\u2019re the one who can\u2019t stop looking at me like I\u2019m a piece of meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called yourself Grade-A! That\u2019s a meat label!\u201d I shouted, my voice animated as I picked up a pillow and tossed it at him.</p><p>He snagged it effortlessly from the air. \u201cAre you done playing? I thought you wanted to hear the rest of the story.\u201d He smirked before walking out of the bedroom, leaving me alone with my thoughts.</p><p>Stalker</p><p>Jack</p><p>When she finally walked into the kitchen wearing nothing but my T-shirt, I almost turned her ass around and marched her right back into the bedroom. Ignoring the throbbing in my shorts, I stared into her nearly empty refrigerator. \u201cYou have no food,\u201d I complained, closing the door.</p><p>\u201cI eat out a lot.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut I have cereal. And bread.\u201d</p><p>She put four slices of bread in the toaster, and I led her by the hand to the kitchen table, pulling her chair out for her. I placed an empty bowl and spoon in front of her, followed by the milk and a box of cereal. Then I sat next to her, filling my bowl to the top with the crunchy shit.</p><p>\u201cCan I hear about the stalking now,\u201d she pleaded as she poured milk into her bowl.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, Kitten, you have to understand that I made myself a compromise. I had to put you in the back of mind until the season was over. I knew that if I lost both baseball and you, I\u2019d have nothing in my life. I\u2019d never be able to survive that much loss.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was sure she understood this, knowing me as well as she did, but it still needed to be said. The mere thought of not having baseball or my Kitten gutted me inside and left me hollow.</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d Her eyes softened with understanding before narrowing devilishly. \u201cNow get to the stalking.\u201d</p><p>Slowly I spooned a large heaping of cereal into my mouth before saying another word. My pace of storytelling was torturing her and I knew it. I liked having the upper hand in a situation where I really had no hand at all. I was lucky she didn\u2019t slam the door in my face last night. Normally not one for second chances, this girl broke all her rules for me. I\u2019d give her anything she fucking wanted. I\u2019d answer every question twice if she needed me too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalling,\u201d she said, rising from her chair to grab the toast.</p> <p>My compromise ended the moment we lost the last home game and our postseason finished. I had two weeks to pack up my temporary apartment in Arizona and move out. I didn\u2019t have very many things there since most of my stuff still sat unattended at the house in Alabama. The house I\u2019d shared with that bitch Chrystle. I knew I\u2019d have to head back there to pack it all up before my life could move forward again, but I dreaded the very thought. If I could help it, I\u2019d never step foot in that fucking state again. Thank God Alabama doesn\u2019t have a major league baseball team.</p><p>Grabbing a bottle of water, I walked into the living room and fell onto the couch. I reached for my cell, searching for my lawyer\u2019s name in my contacts. I selected his number, pressed Call, and relaxed into the cushions, pushing my head into the pillows.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack, what\u2019s up?\u201d Marc\u2019s voice rang out loudly, cutting through the noise in the background.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a minute? I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Hold on a sec.\u201d With the slamming of a door, the previous distractions were silenced. \u201cOK, I\u2019m here. What\u2019s going on? Are you OK?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, forgetting for a minute that he couldn\u2019t see me through the phone. \u201cYeah. I just want to talk to you about what I need to do to end the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Marc responded quickly, and then I heard him typing. \u201cOK. So, obviously your two options are a divorce or an annulment.\u201d</p><p>I realized my jaw was clenched, and I tried to relax it. The fact that I was even having this conversation pissed me off. \u201cAn annulment means the marriage never happened, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you can only file for one under certain circumstances.\u201d He continued typing.</p><p>\u201cChrystle lied about being pregnant,\u201d I said, longing to make this bullshit marriage disappear completely. I hated waiting this long to deal with everything, but I couldn\u2019t take the necessary steps during baseball season. If I needed to be in court to testify or make a statement, I wouldn\u2019t be available while we were in play-offs. My personal life outside of my baseball had to wait.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The rapid tapping continued as I waited. \u201cOK, here\u2019s the deal. We\u2019ll file the dissolution of marriage under the fraud category, and the burden of proof is on us, if necessary. I\u2019ll file the paperwork first thing tomorrow morning. It should be a no-brainer.\u201d</p> <p>I sucked in a deep breath. \u201cAwesome. Thank you, Marc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is there anything else I have to do? How long does it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything yet. I\u2019ll find out if you have to make a legal statement in front of a judge or not. As soon as Chrystle signs it, we submit the paperwork, and it should only take a few weeks to finalize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Seriously? Only a few weeks?\u201d My mouth dropped open before transforming into a huge grin.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s just a process, but it\u2019s not a long one. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Thanks again, Marc. Talk to you later.\u201d I pressed End before tossing my phone onto the coffee table and reaching for my laptop.</p><p>Only a few weeks. Fuck, yes!</p> <p>I opened my Internet browser and typed a name in the online search engine: \u201cCassie Andrews.\u201d</p><p>When a ridiculous amount of options appeared, I narrowed down my search: \u201cCassie Andrews photographer.\u201d</p><p>Her name came up first with a link to her new position in New York. I clicked it and found myself on a page filled with her contact information. I scrambled for a pen and something to write on, as if I didn\u2019t get it down on paper immediately, it would disappear forever and I\u2019d never get it back. I jotted down her work number, followed by her work e-mail address just in case.</p><p>Just in case what?</p><p>You cannot call her until you have your shit together. Until Chrystle is out of your life for good. No calling or e-mailing Cassie until you\u2019re rid of all your baggage.</p><p>I glanced at the clock on my DVD player. Eight p.m. That made it eleven in New York.</p><p>I thought we just covered this?</p><p>Desperation coursed through me at the very idea of hearing how she sounded. I suddenly needed to hear Cassie\u2019s voice. Convinced there was no way she\u2019d still be in the office, I dialed her work number, my heart thundering in my chest with each ring.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve reached the desk of Cassie Andrews, junior photographer.\u201d</p><p>My abs contracted as the sound of her voice coursed into my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed your call, but please leave me a detailed message and I\u2019ll return it as soon as possible. If this is urgent, please press zero to return to reception. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>A beep played, and I quickly pressed the End button on my cell, my breathing ragged. She sounded happy... cheerful, even. My heart pinched with pain at the realization that she could be just fine without me. I longed for her happiness, but in all honesty, I wanted to be a part of it. She had become a permanent fixture within me. I struggled to remember what it felt like before she burrowed herself into my soul. I couldn\u2019t remember existing without her. Every part of me had become tied to her. It was in that very moment I realized how fucking desperate I was for her to feel the same way about me, and how I honestly had no idea if she still did.</p><p>\u201cYou called my work phone and hung up? I love it.\u201d She leaned her head against my shoulder before pressing her soft lips against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI did that a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much is a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost every night,\u201d I admitted, reaching my hand through the open space in the chair and resting it on the small of her back. I hoped she\u2019d think my actions were cute instead of creepy.</p><p>\u201cYou called my work voice mail almost every night, but you never called the real me?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cNot while I was still...\u201d I paused, not wanting to say the word \u201cmarried.\u201d I shuddered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn sometimes,\u201d she chastised.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I swear my heart\u2019s in the right place.\u201d As if I hadn\u2019t asked her to understand enough already, I longed for her to understand this part as well.</p><p>\u201cYour heart and I are going to have a chat later. Get on the same page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d I raised my eyebrows, and she swatted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSo, once your season was over, did you move back home with Gran and Gramps in California? I think I remember Melissa telling me that you were back there.\u201d</p><p>I pushed my chair back from the table, grabbed both of our bowls, and placed them in the sink. I\u2019d wash them later. And for the record, I do not do dishes. But for Cassie I\u2019d do the whole city\u2019s dishes if she asked. \u201cYeah. I flew back to stay with Gran and Gramps right after the season ended. I really missed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet they missed you too.\u201d Her green eyes twinkled with her words. I love how they do that sometimes when she\u2019s excited or reminiscing.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice being home, you know? Surrounded by people who actually give a shit about you and your future.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my hands on a dish towel before leading her toward the living-room couch. I pulled her head onto my chest and sighed as she wrapped her arm around me, her fingers gripping my skin.</p><p>\u201cIs it weird that I miss your grandparents more than I miss my own parents?\u201d She giggled against my chest.</p><p>\u201cNah, your parents sorta suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do yours,\u201d she shot back defensively, her body tensing.</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t we a pair?\u201d She relaxed her shoulders and my nerves eased.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d I kissed the top of her head, breathing in her shampoo. She always smelled so damn good.</p><p>\u201cWere Gran and Gramps freaking out about everything?\u201d</p><p>My stomach tightened at the memories currently flooding my mind. \u201cThey were really sad, mostly. I think Gran took it the hardest. It hurt her knowing something was happening to me that she couldn\u2019t fix or make better.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s head nodded into my chest. \u201cPoor Gran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It sucked. I felt fucking horrible. I still do.\u201d My breath hitched.</p><p>She arched her neck, pulling back her head to look at me as cold air filled the now empty space on my chest. \u201cDon\u2019t do that to yourself, Jack. It\u2019s over now.\u201d Her mouth formed into a smile, and I tried to smile back but failed.</p><p>\u201cDo they know you\u2019re here? With me?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. What the hell would Cassie have to be nervous about when it comes to my grandparents? They adore her. She had to know that.</p><p>\u201cThey know. They\u2019re over-fucking-joyed about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Were they scared at all that I wouldn\u2019t take you back?\u201d Her eyes focused on mine with intent.</p><p>I grinned. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped slightly. \u201cWhat do you mean, not really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran said she knew real love when she saw it. She was convinced that you\u2019d forgive me. That it might not be easy, but eventually you\u2019d come around.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s lips formed a closed-mouth smirk. \u201cGran\u2019s smart.\u201d</p><p>My fingers twisted through long blonde strands of her hair as my mind drifted for a moment, convinced this was only a dream. I\u2019d waited to be right here, holding this girl in my arms, for so long now I almost couldn\u2019t believe it was really happening.</p><p>\u201cBack to the story.\u201d Her words cut through my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you!\u201d Gran squeezed me before looking me up and down. \u201cYou look healthy, so that\u2019s good.\u201d The smile expanded across her whole face until her eyes were scrunched into half moons.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, Gran.\u201d I leaned down to plant a kiss on her well-aged cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou look bigger,\u201d Gramps said with a nod of approval, and I laughed, hugging him tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working out. I have to at this level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always worked out,\u201d Dean said as he walked out of his bedroom and into the living room. Since I left home to play ball, I don\u2019t think Dean ever planned to move out. I couldn\u2019t blame him really. Gran and Gramps were the best.</p><p>I reached for him and pulled him into a tight bear hug before he choked out an unrecognizable sound.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNot like this. Not to this level, this many days or hours. It\u2019s literally a whole new ballgame being in the majors.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it harder?\u201d Dean asked.</p><p>\u201cWay harder. They can hit my ninety-four-mile-per-hour fastball. And they can hit it far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond. \u201cHow\u2019s the kitten?\u201d Gramps interrupted with a cheeky grin, and my smile fell.</p> <p>Gran tapped her foot against the carpet. \u201cLet Jack put his things in his room. We can talk about all of this over dinner.\u201d</p><p>I shot Gran a look that screamed \u201cthank you\u201d before walking down the hallway to my old room. I looked around at my things, untouched since I\u2019d been gone. A framed picture of Cass and me sat on my nightstand. I reached for it, running my finger across the curves of her face. Overcome with the desire to call her, I grabbed some loose paper and started writing. I\u2019d only do this sort of bullshit for her. No one else. Ever.</p><p>Kitten,</p><p>The postseason is officially over. I was going to move out of my apartment in Arizona and fly straight to Alabama to pack my stuff, but I missed Gran and Gramps. So I\u2019m sitting in my bedroom at home, thinking about the last time we were all here together. I miss you almost as much as Gramps does. Ha!</p><p>I forgot how much being home makes me feel secure. Maybe it\u2019s just nice to be surrounded by people who genuinely love and care about you, instead of people trying to take advantage of you. Who would have thought I\u2019d be so easy to manipulate?</p> <p>I talked to Marc the other day about the annulment and he got the paperwork started. Hopefully it will all be over soon, and I\u2019ll be there before you know it, begging for your forgiveness and praying you\u2019ll take me back.</p><p>Please don\u2019t give up on us.</p><p>I\u2019ll always love you.</p><p>Jack</p><p>P.S. I saw your photographs online today. They\u2019re really beautiful, Cass. I\u2019m so proud of you.</p><p>Heading into the kitchen, Dean and Gramps were already sitting while Gran finished up at the stove.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help you, Gran?\u201d I asked before reaching my seat.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear. You sit down and start talking.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cTalking? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know what! What\u2019s going on with everything? When will your divorce from that awful woman be finalized?\u201d The spoon in Gran\u2019s hand shook with her anger as she mumbled something under her breath.</p><p>\u201cMarc filed the paperwork for an annulment. We\u2019re just waiting for her to sign it.\u201d I shrugged, feeling the weight of Dean\u2019s and Gramps\u2019s stares on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShe will sign it, right?\u201d Dean asked, his tone concerned.</p><p>The weight of my little brother\u2019s question was something that hadn\u2019t occurred to me until he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I said, looking around the small kitchen I\u2019d spent most of my life in before locking eyes with Gran.</p><p>Dean choked back a laugh. \u201cI do. Have you met her? She\u2019s a total bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDean! Language!\u201d Gran\u2019s forehead furrowed as she waved her wooden spoon in his direction.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Gran.\u201d Dean slumped lower into his chair.</p><p>I leaned forward, placing my elbows on the table before adding, \u201cBut it\u2019s so over between us. She signed a prenup before we were married, so she doesn\u2019t gain anything by not signing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept control,\u201d Dean remarked.</p><p>My temper flared. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I need to remind you both to watch your mouths?\u201d Gramps interrupted before giving Gran a nod.</p><p>I huffed out a long sigh, willing my temper to calm. \u201cSorry, Gran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just meant that she\u2019d have control over you if she didn\u2019t sign the papers. She knows how badly you want out of this marriage, so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she pulled a bunch of sh\u2014\u201d Dean paused before continuing, \u201cstuff just to mess with you.\u201d</p><p>I considered my brother\u2019s words carefully as Gran appeared, placing dishes filled with steaming food in front of each of us.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Jack. She\u2019s been so evil from the very start. What\u2019s to stop her from being difficult now?\u201d Gran asked, her voice shaky.</p><p>I reached out my hand, placing it on Gran\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m just hoping that she knows this is over and there\u2019s no point in delaying the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d she said with a sympathetic smile.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the kitten doing? Have you talked to her since she moved to New York?\u201d I watched as Gramps\u2019s face lit up like a kid at Christmas.</p><p>\u201cGramps, if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think you had a thing for my girl,\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cYour girl?\u201d Gramps teased back.</p><p>My fork clanged against the side of the plate. \u201cUh-huh. My girl.\u201d</p><p>Dean laughed. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll make her my girl. Keep her in the family.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, the heat instantly spreading across my cheeks. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll disown you before I kick your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Dean shoved a spoonful of rice into his mouth as he grinned at me. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky she\u2019s like a sister to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I\u2019d say you\u2019re the lucky one. \u2019Cause I\u2019d kill you if you touched her and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your only brother and this is how you treat me?\u201d</p><p>I tried to stop the smile from spreading across my face as Gramps interjected, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to take the man\u2019s kitten, Dean.\u201d</p><p>Gran laughed and my smile widened.</p><p>\u201cWorry about your own nonexistent girlfriend, little brother, and leave my girl alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d Gran\u2019s focus shot to Dean as her eyes widened.</p><p>Dean shot me a warning look through narrowed eyes. \u201cNo. Jack\u2019s just talking about Melissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Cassie\u2019s best friend, right?\u201d Gran asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to her yet?\u201d I asked, putting him on the spot for once.</p><p>He shrugged one shoulder. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to talk to her,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI told you she\u2019s not into me,\u201d he snapped back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crap and you know it. She is definitely into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Gramps dropped his chin into his hand, his gaze shifting back and forth between me and Dean.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She says she doesn\u2019t want a boyfriend, but I think she just doesn\u2019t want me as a boyfriend. Can we talk about something else now?\u201d Dean fidgeted in his chair as he filled his mouth with more food.</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want you as a boyfriend? Rubbish,\u201d our ever-loyal Gran said with a huff.</p><p>\u201cCan we please talk about something else? Anything else,\u201d Dean pleaded.</p><p>Taking pity on my poor, uncomfortable brother, I changed the subject. \u201cI found some of Cassie\u2019s photographs online today.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the air as everyone stopped chewing their food, directing their stares at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find them?\u201d Gramps asked, blotting the corner of his mouth with a napkin.</p><p>\u201cI went to her magazine\u2019s website. They had a feature online about moving to New York, and all the photographs in the article were hers.\u201d My chest swelled with pride as I talked about her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic news! I want you to show me after dinner.\u201d Gramps\u2019s eyes lit up with enthusiasm as he slapped his hand against the table.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Dean tilted his head as a smirk appeared. \u201cYou follow her magazine online?\u201d</p><p>I squared my gaze, meeting his directly. \u201cYou\u2019re goddamned right I do. I want to know what she\u2019s doing every second she\u2019s not with me. And if there\u2019s a photograph she takes for that magazine, I want to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s sweet,\u201d Gran said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s psycho,\u201d Dean countered.</p><p>I changed the topic of conversation for him and this is how he repays me? \u201cReally, Dean? After everything Cassie and I have been through, you think my following her work online is psycho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little weird, don\u2019t you think? You won\u2019t even talk to her in real life, but you\u2019ll follow her online?\u201d</p><p>The chair scraped against the floor as I shoved back, jumping to my feet. My breathing hitched as my defenses rose. No one talked about me and Cassie like that. Not even my brother.</p><p>\u201cJack, sit down!\u201d Gran said sternly. \u201cAnd Dean, stop calling your brother names! You two are acting like little boys.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled a sharp breath before sliding the chair back toward the table and sitting down. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to her until I\u2019m not married anymore, OK? So until then, yeah, I will follow everything she does online. And if that magazine can give me a glimpse into how she\u2019s seeing the world, I\u2019ll take it. Because until I\u2019m back in her life, that\u2019s the only Cassie I get. And if that makes me psycho, then I don\u2019t give a fuck. Sorry, Gran,\u201d I offered before she swatted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ground you! I don\u2019t care how old you are,\u201d she threatened with a slight chuckle.</p><p>\u201cHe started it,\u201d I said, nodding my head toward my brother. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about Melissa some more.\u201d</p><p>Dean waved his arms in the air in defeat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Truce?\u201d</p><p>Before I could respond, Gran asked, \u201cHow long are you planning to stay home?\u201d</p><p>Gramps looked up from his plate and directly into my eyes. \u201cYour whole off-season?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed my last bite of food. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I figured I\u2019d wait for Marc to call me about the annulment, and then I\u2019d go to Alabama to sign the papers and pack up the house at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d Dean asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to bring my stuff back here, but I want to get to New York as soon as possible to make things right with Cass,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI only have a few months before I have to be back in Arizona for spring training, and I still need to find a place to rent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not much time.\u201d Gramps sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you planning on saying to Cassie?\u201d Gran tilted her head toward me. \u201cHow are you going to win her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. But it will be something along the lines of how much I suck and how much she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gramps laughed at my words, and I smiled.</p><p>\u201cVery romantic.\u201d Dean sarcastically popped two thumbs up in the air.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Dean. No one likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019ll have to give her more than just some nice words, dear,\u201d Gran said as she eyed me meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Gran. I know.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s face relaxed as she leaned up to kiss my cheek. \u201cI like that you followed me online. I followed you too.\u201d</p><p>My adrenaline started racing as I adjusted my position on the couch. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. I still loved you, Jack. I cared about you. I wanted to see how you were. It was a big deal that you\u2019d made it into the major leagues. I wasn\u2019t going to miss it,\u201d she explained, her shoulders shrugging like she had no choice in the matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t think I\u2019m psycho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d she teased playfully.</p><p>I pounced on her before she could get away, pinning her body beneath mine and against the couch cushions. Her chest moved heavily up and down, and it took everything in me to not rip her shirt off and lose myself in her body. My shorts tightened as I leaned down to kiss her, brushing my tongue along her bottom lip. She moaned slightly as she arched her head back, her lips parting. I pressed my mouth against hers, my tongue and hers touching erotically in a playful tease of push and pull.</p><p>I wanted to tear her clothes off and devour her inch by inch. I sucked on her neck, the taste of her skin almost sending me into a frenzy. She ran her hands down the length of my back as she pulled my shirt up. She pressed her fingers into my skin as I kissed and licked her ear and neck before working my way back to her mouth. Jesus, I wanted this girl. She fired me up like no one else. Trying to maintain some semblance of self-control, I pulled back from the kiss, and her hands tightened around my neck. I chuckled and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to hear more?\u201d</p> <p>Her grip tightened as she pulled my face to hers. \u201cIn a minute,\u201d she said, as she grazed her tongue across my lips.</p><p>My hands explored the length of her body, stopping at the top of her thigh. \u201cI want you so fucking bad. You make me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take me.\u201d She sucked her bottom lip into her mouth, and I longed to put something of mine in there instead.</p><p>I grabbed the bottom of her top and lifted it over her head, unable to get it off fast enough. She reached for my shirt, tugging and pulling before I sat up and tore it off myself. My insides flared as she ran her hands down my bare chest, stopping at the button of my shorts. When her fingertips gently grazed over my hardness, I shuddered. Just that single touch from her and I almost came unglued.</p><p>It\u2019s twisted how much she owns me. She always fucking has, but still.</p> <p>I kicked my shorts off, silently giving myself a pat on the back when I noticed where Cassie\u2019s eyes were locked. Half tempted to make some smartass remark about how much she loves looking at my dick, I stopped myself. I hadn\u2019t even been back in her life for twenty-four hours; no need to screw it up already.</p><p>My gaze moved from her eyes down to her naked body. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking sexy.\u201d I meant the words, but they came out in a lusty growl and she bit her bottom lip again. I dropped my mouth to hers, sucking that lip between my teeth, my body falling to meet hers.</p><p>Heat shot through me as we touched. The feeling of her skin pressed against mine caused my lust to hungrily take over. I curled my fingers in her hair, forcefully tugging her head back so I could kiss her throat and jaw.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Jack. I want you inside me. Please. Stop teasing.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my hardness against her, and when she howled with pleasure, I pulled it away. \u201cGoddammit, Jack. Stop fucking around.\u201d Her fingers dug into my backside as she forcefully guided me to her.</p><p>Without another word I pushed inside, my body shivering as the warmth of her completely enveloped me. \u201cJesus Christ, Cassie. Why do you always feel so amazing?\u201d My breath was labored as I worked in and out of her. The sight of her nipple drew me, so I traced a finger gently around it before I sucked it into my mouth, my tongue flicking around it.</p> <p>Cassie moaned, her body arching beneath me as she clawed her fingernails down the length of my back.</p><p>\u201cYou better stop that,\u201d I breathed out.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d she teased, running her fingers along my back once more.</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll be done before you are,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen behave,\u201d I demanded, grabbing her arms and pinning them above her head, as my thrusting continued. She laughed beneath me, and I swept my tongue across her lips before pushing it into her hot mouth. She mumbled something unintelligible against me, and I kissed her harder.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she whispered, her breathing quickening as her hips rose up and down to meet mine. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She moaned again as her body shuddered against mine.</p> <p>Thank fucking God.</p><p>I rocked into her one last time before exploding. My thrusting slowed as I collapsed on top of her, my weight pushing her body further into the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you enjoy suffocating me?\u201d she said, swatting my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI like lying with you this way.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cWhat way? With me dead?\u201d</p><p>A quick laugh ripped from my throat. \u201cNo. I like being inside of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, get out.\u201d She smirked. \u201cI need to pee.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out slowly and she scooted out from under me, hurrying to the bathroom.</p><p>Stay</p><p>Cassie</p><p>I walked back into the living room wearing a new thong and nothing else. Jack was sitting on the couch, his shorts pulled up but still unbuttoned, his shirt pooled on the floor next to the one I had been wearing. I reached for the crumpled shirt, slipping it back over my head before plopping down next to him.</p><p>\u201cThat was a nice distraction,\u201d I said, leaning my body into his waiting arms.</p><p>His fingers combed through my messy strands of hair before tucking them behind my ear. \u201cMore stories or more distractions?\u201d he asked with a mischievous tone.</p><p>My cell phone beeped in the background, and I eyed him, contemplating whether I should see who was texting me. \u201cI\u2019m gonna see who that is.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and smacked my ass as I ran into the bedroom. I settled back into his arms before tapping the screen on my phone. \u201cOooh, it\u2019s from Melissa.\u201d I turned, looking into his deep brown eyes. \u201cDoes she know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cThe trade would be reported by now, so she might be wondering.\u201d</p><p>Another sound beeped and this time, Jack reached for his phone before laughing. \u201cText message from Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so predictable.\u201d</p><p>Pressing the buttons, I read the message from Melissa:</p><p>OH MY GOD! CASSIE! JACK GOT TRADED TO THE METS!!!! DID YOU KNOW THAT? IS HE THERE? IF HE\u2019S NOT, HE PROBABLY WILL BE SOON SO HEADS UP! AND CALL ME ASAP!!!!!!!!</p><p>I chuckled out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d Jack asked, his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cWell, she used all caps so this is a very serious message.\u201d I smiled, handing my phone to him so he could read it.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s yelling at you. Isn\u2019t that what all caps means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I think that\u2019s her way of showing me she\u2019s freaking out. Or excited. Or yelling,\u201d I agreed with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHeads up. I might be on my way over.\u201d Jack pressed his lips against my forehead, and I closed my eyes with his touch. So much had happened between us. So much more than any one couple should ever go through, but there we were. Together.</p><p>\u201cI should probably text her back or she won\u2019t ever stop.\u201d I quickly typed out a response.</p><p>He\u2019s here. We\u2019re talking. Working through things. Call you from the office Monday.</p><p>I lowered the volume button on my phone before it beeped again.</p><p>MONDAY?!?! Like hell you\u2019re making me wait that long!</p><p>I laughed and typed out one last message before turning my phone to silent.</p><p>You\u2019ll survive. I can\u2019t talk now. Talk later. Love you.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Dean say?\u201d</p><p>He scanned the phone screen before smiling and handing it to me.</p><p>Dude, you got traded to the Mets and didn\u2019t tell me? Is this because of Cassie? Of course it\u2019s because of Cassie. How the hell did you get them to let you do it? Good luck. Call me after you see her.</p><p>\u201cHow can you not love Dean?\u201d I handed him back his phone, smiling.</p><p>He straightened his back and pushed away from me slightly. \u201cGood question. Speaking of Dean, why doesn\u2019t Melissa love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My tone came out more surprised than I meant.</p><p>\u201cNo, really. What\u2019s her deal? Dean\u2019s totally into her, but she\u2019s not having it. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s demeanor and tone gave away the fact that this situation bothered him. I found it sweet, if you wanted to know the truth. He cared about his little brother, and since I didn\u2019t have any siblings to care about me, I found it inspiring. \u201cShe\u2019s always been like that.\u201d I knew I\u2019d answered his question unsatisfactorily, but it\u2019s all I had when it came to her.</p><p>He shook his head, not accepting my answer. \u201cYou\u2019ve known her forever, Kitten. Hasn\u2019t she ever had a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I scratched my head, contemplating his question and forming my response. \u201cNot really. I mean, she\u2019s always hooked up with guys, but she\u2019s never really had a serious boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked, apparently determined to get to the bottom of this mystery.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you, of all people, not know? You\u2019re her best friend. You\u2019re chicks. Chicks talk about this kind of shit all the time.\u201d</p><p>My body prickled with heat as my defenses quickly rose. \u201cFirst of all, calm down. Second of all, I don\u2019t fucking know. I\u2019ve never really thought about it before. Guys have always liked Melissa, and she makes out with them or whatever, but she\u2019s never really said anything to me about liking them back. I never questioned it because I just accepted it. That\u2019s the way she is. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know when it will change. And I don\u2019t know why the fuck she doesn\u2019t fall head over heels in love with Dean. Maybe you should ask her instead of sitting here grilling me.\u201d</p><p>I started to get off the couch, but he grabbed my arm and pulled me right back down. He reached for my face, turning it, forcing me to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kitten. I didn\u2019t mean to get so fired up about it. I just don\u2019t get it. My brother\u2019s a good guy. And I know he likes her. It just makes no sense to me why she doesn\u2019t like him back.\u201d</p><p>He loosened his hold on my face, but I refused to turn away from him. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d I shrugged, my annoyance fading.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to yell.\u201d Jack\u2019s lips twisted into a smile, forcing his dimples to appear.</p><p>I am such a sucker for those dimples.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to our story,\u201d he suggested. With his emphasis on the word our, my anger quickly disappeared.</p><p>\u201cOK. But now I\u2019m too pissed off to remember where we were,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me, and I allowed him to pull me close. \u201cWe were talking about Gran and Gramps. Don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched. \u201cFine,\u201d I relented, feeling my annoyance fade with his nearness. I hated how he affected me sometimes. \u201cSo, how long did you stay there with them?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled a long breath before releasing it against the top of my head, causing strands of my hair to fall in front of my eyes. I pushed them away as I waited for his response. \u201cA lot longer than I intended. My plan was to stay there for a couple weeks before heading back to Alabama to pack up my stuff and finalize the annulment. I honestly figured two to three weeks was enough time. That the bitch would sign it and I\u2019d be on my way here before Christmas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood thing I didn\u2019t hold my breath.\u201d</p><p>He huffed. \u201cYeah. The past six months has been nothing but drama, Kitten. I\u2019m not sorry for leaving you out of it, but I am sorry for letting it go on for so long.\u201d</p><p>I leaned away from the warmth of his body and into the cold cushions, squaring my shoulders toward him. \u201cWhy did it take so long? How could she fight the annulment, anyway?\u201d</p><p>My cell phone rang, waking me from a deep sleep and forcing my eyes to pop open. Anticipation rushed through me as Marc\u2019s name appeared on the screen. \u201cHey, Marc,\u201d I said, my voice groggy.</p> <p>\u201cJack, we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d I asked, scooting my back up against the wall.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Who won\u2019t?\u201d I stopped short before continuing. \u201cWhat do you mean, she won\u2019t sign? I thought this was a done deal? An easy fix?\u201d My heart slammed itself against my rib cage.</p><p>\u201cHer lawyer\u2019s stating your claims are ridiculous. That no fraud was committed and therefore his client won\u2019t sign under those terms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? What terms will she sign under?\u201d I fought to keep my anger under control.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t sign an annulment. But she\u2019ll consider signing divorce papers, although his client would rather work things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork things out? Are you fucking joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to fix this, Marc. She faked a pregnancy to force me to marry her. How is that not fraud?\u201d I threw the magazine sitting next to me against the wall and watched it fall to the ground.</p><p>\u201cIt is. But the burden of proof is on us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s prove it then,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a hard time doing that since she has plenty of documentation supporting her claims,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of documentation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, doctor\u2019s reports, for starters.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten about the fact that Chrystle had doctor\u2019s prescriptions, appointments, and paperwork.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we sue the doctor for malpractice or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would have to prove that he lied as well, which would be extremely difficult given the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>When people allege that anger has the ability to shoot through them with such force that they see red... well, it\u2019s true. I saw red. Literally.</p><p>\u201cThis is so fucked up. What can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Jack. Right now I want you to stay where you are and let me handle this,\u201d he said, his tone calm and professional.</p><p>I gripped the edge of the mattress, my fingers digging into it. \u201cAll my stuff\u2019s still in Alabama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t step foot in that state until I tell you it\u2019s OK. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>I cringed as he told me what to do. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, it\u2019s my job to look out for you. For once, let me do that. Please.\u201d His voice sounded strained, and I sighed.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p><p>I pressed the End button on my cell phone and threw it against the wall. Why the fuck was this girl so hell-bent on ruining my life? I can\u2019t move past this one mistake if I can\u2019t put it in the past. Why couldn\u2019t she be a decent human being and sign the damn papers?</p><p>Knuckles rapped on my bedroom door. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Dean walked in and glanced at the phone on the floor before closing the door behind him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I heard you yelling.\u201d</p><p>I looked him straight in the eyes. \u201cYou were right. She won\u2019t sign the papers.\u201d</p><p>He moved toward my bed, sitting down at the opposite end. \u201cShit, Jack. I\u2019m sorry. So, what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, pinching the skin at the bridge of my nose to relieve the stress. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Marc\u2019s working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go out or something? Get out of the house for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to be alone right now.\u201d</p><p>Dean stood up from my bed without another word and left my room. I grabbed the notebook sitting on my dresser and flipped it open to a blank page. How quickly this whole letter-writing thing turned into habit. It helped to put my thoughts somewhere when all I wanted to do was pick up the phone and dial Cassie\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. That bitch! She had a doctor give her falsified pregnancy paperwork?\u201d My eyes widened as the shock and anger sunk into my bones.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d was all he managed in response.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you believed her,\u201d I said, shaking my head</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d His body tensed and his jaw tightened.</p><p>\u201cWell, I never really understood why you believed that she was pregnant in the first place. Without checking or making sure, I mean,\u201d I tried to explain.</p><p>Jack cracked his neck as tension visibly poured from his body and rolled onto mine. \u201cYou thought I just stupidly accepted her at her word? Married her without any proof? Why didn\u2019t you just ask me?\u201d</p><p>His bitter tone shocked me, causing my defenses to rise. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe because I was too caught up in my own heartbreak to ask you when I had the chance. And it\u2019s not like we were really talking at the time.\u201d</p><p>He reached a hand out to touch me, laying it on my leg. That one single movement shattered my defenses and I wanted to take back everything I\u2019d just accused him of. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d His hand raised in a defeated gesture in the space between us. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there. You didn\u2019t know what was going on. I\u2019m sure it looked shady as hell from the outside.\u201d</p><p>A shudder ripped through me. I never again wanted to be on the \u201coutside\u201d of anything when it came to Jack Carter. \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t have just assumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she had doctor visits and stuff?\u201d My mind still raced to wrap around the elaborate plotting and lies. How could one girl be so malicious?</p><p>\u201cAppointments, paperwork, vitamins, baby books, charts, schedules\u2014she had it all.\u201d He exhaled, and I grabbed his hand in mine, our fingers intertwining as I leaned back into him.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something else?\u201d My voice sounded muffled against his chest.</p><p>He kissed the top of my head. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think the baby wasn\u2019t yours? I mean, I get that you thought she was pregnant, but did you ever think it was someone else\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a very convincing liar. She agreed with no reservations to do a DNA test after the baby was born. I honestly thought that if she were lying, she would have been nervous, or at least fighting me on the whole thing, but she encouraged it.\u201d</p><p>And then he took me back to when his world first started crashing down around him. When he was living in Alabama and playing on the Triple A team for the Diamondbacks. The night after he pitched his perfect game when Chrystle came on to him at the bar where he was celebrating with his teammates and he finally stopped resisting her. He gave in to her advances that night, and my life as I knew it would never be the same. I shuddered as I remembered the way my world started to spin around me and my heart felt like it was shattering inside of my chest when Jack called that afternoon to deliver the news. Not only had he cheated on me, but also the girl he had slept with was pregnant.</p><p>I ignored the knock at the apartment door, assuming that one of my roommates would answer, and continued folding my clothes. When I heard the sound of Chrystle\u2019s voice filtering through the entryway and into my room, my whole body tightened. So we\u2019d had a drunken one-night stand, and I threw her out when I came to my senses. What was she doing here?</p><p>She tapped on my bedroom door before walking in and closing it behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Get out of my room,\u201d I snapped, refusing to give her the time of day.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d Her voice shook as she spoke.</p><p>I exhaled through my nose, my impatience clear. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she whispered, tears falling down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cSo? How is that my problem?\u201d I asked before the realization punched me square in the gut.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s yours,\u201d she said before sitting on my bed.</p><p>I sucked in a breath, my mind refusing to believe her. \u201cBullshit,\u201d I shot back.</p><p>\u201cBullshit nothing, Jack! I haven\u2019t been with anyone else since you. Ask anyone if they\u2019ve seen me around. Or if they\u2019ve hooked up with me. I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will ask. I\u2019ll fucking ask right now.\u201d I stormed out of my bedroom and into the living room, where three of my teammates were eating lunch and watching TV. When I asked them if Chrystle had been with any of them, they all shook their heads and threw their hands up in the air in denial. I asked if they\u2019d seen her with anyone lately, and once again, they all answered no. And then they proceeded to inform me that come to think of it, they hadn\u2019t seen her around at all the past few weeks.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>My legs trembled as I stepped back into my room. My world spun around me as I willed my stomach to stop twisting. I didn\u2019t want this. Not with her. Not now. Not ever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, Jack. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I never wanted this to happen.\u201d She buried her head in her hands, her body shaking with each sob.</p><p>I lacked the desire to comfort her, so I finished folding my clothes. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I asked, my tone cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She peered up at me, her face red and wet.</p><p>\u201cI mean, are you planning on keeping it?\u201d</p><p>I watched as her jaw dropped open. \u201cOf course you\u2019d ask me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know each other. Why the hell would you want to keep it?\u201d My temper flared in a vain attempt to drown out the fact that I was scared shitless.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a baby, Jack! It\u2019s a life, and I\u2019ll love it even if you won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to leave.\u201d</p><p>This cannot be fucking happening. Please don\u2019t let this be happening.</p><p>She stood up, wiping her eyes with her hand before saying, \u201cWay to be a man about this.\u201d</p><p>The heat flooded my body as I stepped toward her, my fists clenched in anger. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be a man about it, alright. I\u2019ll drive you to the clinic. I\u2019ll pay for it. And then I\u2019ll even drive you home. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re an asshole.\u201d She tried to push me aside, but I refused to budge.</p><p>\u201cI am an asshole. An asshole who doesn\u2019t want to have a baby with a complete stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a little late for that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>My room circled around me as the life that existed five minutes prior disappeared from view. Terror consumed me. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Chrystle. Please don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t ruin both our lives over a drunken mistake.\u201d</p><p>I watched as she winced, pulling back her head with disgust. \u201cI\u2019m not ruining anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re ruining everything.\u201d My voice rose barely above a whisper as thoughts of Cassie filled my head. Cassie was my girl, my world, and I knew she\u2019d never trust me again. There was no way she\u2019d ever forgive me for this. I\u2019d never forgive myself. I didn\u2019t deserve her, and she deserved a hell of a lot better than a screwup like me. I couldn\u2019t believe I tossed away the best thing to ever happen to me for a piece of ass. I should never have gotten that drunk. It wasn\u2019t an excuse, but my defenses were down, and I gave in. And I fucking hated myself for it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you see it that way. Hopefully you\u2019ll change your mind. Maybe after the shock wears off. I\u2019ll be in touch, Jack,\u201d she said as she walked out the door.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>If Chrystle kept the baby, there was no way she\u2019d move away from her family. I would have to live here, in Alabama. Or at least have a place here if I wanted to see my own kid. I could kiss California good-bye for good. I\u2019d have to spend all of the off-season here. My body sank to the carpet, my back firm against the bed, as my world crashed down around me. I wouldn\u2019t be like my father. I wouldn\u2019t leave my child the same way he left me and Dean. I\u2019d experienced firsthand how a parent willingly leaving can royally fuck up a person. I\u2019m a prime example. I wouldn\u2019t do that to my own flesh and blood. I wouldn\u2019t follow in my father\u2019s footsteps, leaving personal damage in my wake. I would be better than he ever was.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. I wished harder than I ever wished for anything that it was all a nightmare. That I\u2019d wake up any second and my body would flood with relief at it being all in my mind. But no matter what I did, I couldn\u2019t make it stop being real.</p><p>\u201cThis story sucks.\u201d I sucked in a breath before frowning.</p><p>\u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t happy,\u201d he said, his hand running down my side, giving me chills.</p><p>\u201cAre we almost to last night yet?\u201d I gazed up at him, my expression hopeful.</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I need another break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d He winked suggestively.</p><p>My lips formed a pretend snarl as I narrowed my eyes to glare at him. \u201cJack, really. We just did that.\u201d</p><p>Reliving our time apart was honestly a lot to take in. I longed for all this information, but to say it didn\u2019t cause my breath to catch every few minutes would be a lie. It also scared me. If one small-town girl could be so vicious, what were big-city women capable of?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get out of the house for a bit? Maybe go grab a slice?\u201d I used my newly acquired New Yorker lingo for a piece of pizza.</p><p>\u201cI could eat,\u201d he answered with a large grin, and I leaned in to kiss each dimple.</p> <p>I pulled away slowly, the rich chocolate color of his eyes mesmerizing me, as a thought hit me. \u201cWait. Where are you staying? Do you have an apartment or a hotel that you need to check in to?\u201d</p><p>Nerves raced through me as I anticipated his answer. I knew I should have been more reserved or cautious or careful, but the truth was that I wanted him to stay with me and never leave again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t book anything yet. I came straight here.\u201d</p><p>Yet. He planned to live somewhere else, and I was just the first stop. \u201cOh. Well, did you want to do that first?\u201d I tried to hide my disappointment, but my tone betrayed me.</p><p>His thumb traced along my jawline before resting beneath my chin. \u201cNot really. Anything that involves leaving you I\u2019d rather put off until later.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over me. My lips pressed into a tight smile as I closed my eyes. \u201cThen don\u2019t leave,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to leave you again,\u201d he admitted, as the warmth of his lips brushed across mine.</p><p>\u201cYou could live here.\u201d The words spilled out before I consciously thought them.</p> <p>Jack\u2019s face relaxed, a peaceful calm spreading across it. \u201cYeah? You want to live together?\u201d</p><p>His questioning inflection contradicted the happy look on his face, causing me to silently curse myself for being so vulnerable. \u201cIt was just an offer. Don\u2019t get all full of yourself over it.\u201d</p><p>He choked back a laugh. \u201cNothing would make me happier, Kitten, than to know my home is where you are.\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped and thumped against my chest with such force I was surprised I didn\u2019t topple over. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d His grin widened. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to leave, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t move all the way across the country to live alone. I moved here to be with you. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. Be. With. You.\u201d He stared into my eyes with conviction.</p><p>My insides trembled with desire, heat spreading between my thighs at his confident demeanor. \u201cWhat if I told you no?\u201d I teased.</p><p>He pressed his forehead to mine, his eyes piercing right through me. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t. You want me here just as much as I want to be here, and I know it. I\u2019m not leaving and you won\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really arrogance when you\u2019re right?\u201d His lip curled up on one side before crushing his mouth against mine. He swept his tongue teasingly across my bottom lip before he pulled away.</p><p>After all the heartache he\u2019d put me through, nothing could compare to the way I lived in Jack\u2019s presence. The cracks and chips in my heart slowly dragged themselves together whenever he was around. My soul pretended the past damage didn\u2019t matter, as it tugged and pulled itself whole again. I had been shattered and broken, but my body insisted on mending itself for him.</p><p>For Jack.</p><p>Because being with him, no matter how illogical it seemed considering he was responsible for my internal carnage, completed me. We made sense together. Melissa couldn\u2019t have been more right when she described us as \u201cthe perfect mess.\u201d I realized her assessment held more truth now than it ever had before.</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d I suggested again, longing for a change of location.</p><p>\u201cWill you at least put on some clothes?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, knowing it would piss him off. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>Best Friends</p><p>Jack</p><p>I grabbed Cassie\u2019s hand in mine, locking our fingers together as we walked outside. I glanced around the city, noting the buildings and how different they were from everything back in Southern California. New York looked as old as it was. But it was cool as shit. Even in the chilly air, the city buzzed with an energy I\u2019d never experienced before. New York had swagger. I liked it here already.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d Cassie said with a smile, pointing toward a small green awning up ahead.</p><p>That was quick.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d It looked small as hell. I hustled in front of Cass, pulling the door open before ushering her inside, my hand firmly placed on her ass.</p><p>The smell of fresh bread, cheese, and sauces overwhelmed my senses. My stomach growled as I perused the menu on the wall, the old man behind the counter studying me. I\u2019d gotten used to being stared at, but I convinced myself this guy couldn\u2019t possibly know who I was already. Sure, the trade was reported in the papers and online, but I hadn\u2019t started playing with the team yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting, babe?\u201d I asked my girl, mesmerized by the long blonde hair that spilled down her back.</p><p>She\u2019s so fucking hot. I just want to tie that hair in a knot to my bedpost.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get a couple of slices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to just get a whole pizza and then we can bring the rest home for later?\u201d</p><p>She nodded enthusiastically. \u201cYes! Great idea! You\u2019re so smart,\u201d she said, before rising to her toes to kiss my cheek.</p><p>\u201cSmart and starving. You have no food at your place. You\u2019ll kill me, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are!\u201d The man\u2019s expression turned joyful as he waved a fat finger in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re our new pitcher! Jack...\u201d he paused, his eyes squinting, \u201c... Carter, right?\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s mouth dropped open as she looked in shock between me and the man behind the counter. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d I replied with a quick nod. His hand reached across the cold steel counter for mine before he extended his hand toward Cass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sal, sweetheart,\u201d he grinned widely, taking her in.</p><p>See, Kitten, even old men think you\u2019re hot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cassie. It\u2019s nice to meet you. How\u2019d you know who he was?\u201d Cassie asked, her voice slightly stressed.</p><p>He released her hand. \u201cI\u2019m a huge Mets fan. I follow everything about the team. We\u2019re all really excited to have you here. Welcome to New York!\u201d</p><p>His voice boomed with such sincere enthusiasm that it soaked straight through my skin and into my bones. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m really happy to be here.\u201d I looked directly at Cassie, saying the last words.</p><p>\u201cHow come you aren\u2019t with the team in Chicago?\u201d His gray eyes fixed on me quizzically.</p><p>\u201cThey did me a favor and didn\u2019t put me on rotation until Monday night. I flew straight here to get settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. You two living in the Lower East?\u201d</p><p>My eyes met Cassie\u2019s quickly before responding, \u201cWe are for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m Sal. Anything you want is on the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Sal, you don\u2019t have to do that. Thank you, though,\u201d Cassie answered sweetly before I could respond. That was one of the things about being well-known, or famous, or whatever you wanted to call it that never made any sense to me. People enjoyed giving you free things when you could clearly afford them. The irony of giving free things to people with plenty of money wasn\u2019t lost on me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Sal. And really, we\u2019re more than happy to support your business, since I assume you\u2019ll be supporting mine.\u201d I smirked, noting the Mets banners and framed posters hanging on the walls.</p><p>\u201cSo, what can I get for you two?\u201d</p><p>Cassie glanced toward me. \u201cI just want pepperoni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get two large pepperoni pizzas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Jack.\u201d Sal turned toward the kitchen behind him and shouted, \u201cTwo large pepperoni pies.\u201d</p><p>Pies?</p><p>As if reading my mind, Cassie leaned into my ear and whispered, \u201cThey call them pies here. And if you want a piece of pizza, they call it a slice.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, thankful for my first lesson in New York slang. I kissed the top of her head, taking in the tiny restaurant. Two small tables huddled with old green chairs next to the oversized window. \u201cYou wanna sit?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, choosing a table and then sitting down. I almost pinched myself to ensure this was really happening. Having Cass back in my life renewed me. I felt like a new fucking man... like I could do anything simply because this girl was with me.</p><p>I placed my hand on the table before Cass reached hers out, laying it on top of mine. Her fingers moved across my skin, and I was instantly aroused.</p><p>Get it together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still blown away that she fought the annulment. And had all that fake paperwork and stuff. It\u2019s crazy to me,\u201d she said as she shook her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s insane is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd vindictive. And malicious. And horrible.\u201d</p><p>I released a quick breath. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s all those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when did you finally go to Alabama?\u201d</p> <p>I pulled away from her grip, leaning back and linking my hands behind my head as I stared into her green eyes. \u201cI was just sitting there, waiting. A whole month had gone by and she still hadn\u2019t signed the papers. I felt like I had no control in my own life, and I was getting pretty pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dean. Question: How long is your winter break?\u201d I asked my kid brother over dinner.</p><p>\u201cUh, we go back at like the end of January, why? What\u2019s up?\u201d He cocked his head and continued chewing his food.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna fly out to Alabama and help me move my shit back here?\u201d I lifted my chin at him.</p><p>\u201cJack! Language.\u201d Gran swatted my arm.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Gran.\u201d I pressed my lips together as Gramps laughed at my discomfort.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage him.\u201d Gran tossed an evil look in Gramps\u2019s direction, and he quickly choked back another chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll go,\u201d Dean said, ignoring everyone else. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Christmas, we\u2019ll head back. I want to get out of that state as soon as possible,\u201d I said, my voice filled with disgust.</p><p>Gran reached out and squeezed my arm. \u201cDid she sign the papers yet, dear?\u201d</p><p>I averted my eyes and shook my head. \u201cShe\u2019s still fighting it. Says I can\u2019t prove that there was fraud involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut she faked her pregnancy! She tricked you.\u201d Gran\u2019s voice rose as her cheeks reddened with indignation.</p><p>\u201cI know, but she has records that confirm she was pregnant.\u201d I sighed, shoveling a fork full of Gran\u2019s delicious cooking into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow can she even do that?\u201d Gramps looked up from his plate, his eyes heavy with worry, and guilt rushed through me at the thought of causing him or Gran any unpleasantness.</p><p>I swallowed before responding. \u201cI have no idea. Maybe the doctor was an old family friend? Her family goes back generations in that town so they\u2019re pretty well respected.\u201d</p><p>Gran let out a disgusted grunt. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know the meaning of the word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, wait.\u201d Dean wiped at his mouth with a napkin before placing it back in his lap. \u201cAre you saying that there\u2019s nothing you can do to fight it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying that the burden of proof is on me. And how do I prove all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one messed-up bi\u2014\u201d Dean stopped short as Gran jerked her head, glaring at him. \u201cgirl. I was gonna say, that\u2019s one messed-up girl.\u201d</p> <p>I realized my teeth were clenched. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried, Jack. This is taking so long. The longer it takes, the more you have to lose,\u201d Gran added.</p><p>I knew what her underlying concern was. Gran was worried about me and Cassie. I\u2019ll admit I was worried too, but I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d let that little bitch win. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it, Gran. Don\u2019t worry. She\u2019ll sign the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything foolish now,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cJack, your pies will be up in a minute, OK?\u201d Sal\u2019s gravelly voice echoed throughout the small restaurant, shaking me free from my memories.</p><p>\u201cSounds good, Sal. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Marc say about going to Alabama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, running her fingers through her hair, and I wanted to reach out and touch every fucking part of her. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on! He would have advised me not to go. I was still paying rent on a house I wasn\u2019t living in. I needed to get my stuff before spring training started in February, and that was only a little more than a month away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you freaking out?\u201d Her forehead creased with worry, and I wanted so badly to take it all away, but remembering Cassie\u2019s relationship deal-breaker rules, I refused to lie.</p><p>Rule number one: Don\u2019t lie.</p><p>I closed my eyes before opening them again. \u201cI was definitely freaking out. You see, Kitten, aside from all the bullshit going on... my stuff still being in Alabama... Chrystle not signing the annulment... it was always about you. All I cared about was getting back to you. And I am sorry that time slipped away from me so fast, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that to yourself,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI understand better now.\u201d</p><p>I shoved my hand into my hair, tugging at the strands like I tended to do around her. \u201cI know that I probably should have called you. But while it was all going on, I was so caught up in fixing everything. I was obsessed with every detail being in perfect order before I came here. There were no exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re here now. And that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Her gorgeous eyes glistened, and I knew I\u2019d lose my shit right here in front of Sal if she cried. Her tears could absolutely fucking gut me.</p><p>\u201cTo go, right?\u201d Sal shouted toward us, and I coughed my emotions in check.</p><p>I glanced at Cass, who nodded her agreement. \u201cTo go, Sal. Thanks,\u201d I answered.</p><p>I pushed my chair back and walked toward the small counter. \u201cDo you have a car, Jack?\u201d Sal tilted his head in my direction, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Initially confused by his odd question, I leaned back and thought for a moment. \u201cNo,\u201d I said haltingly, wondering why a stranger was asking if I had a car.</p><p>\u201cI only ask because my little cousin Matteo is a driver. You don\u2019t want to take the train to the stadium every day, and forget trying to take a taxi. I\u2019ll write down the number of his car company and you ask for him directly. He\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Sal scribbled Matteo\u2019s name and number on the back of a business card before shoving it toward me.</p><p>Relief washed over me. Sal wasn\u2019t some creepy stalker; he was just a nice guy. \u201cThank you. I hadn\u2019t even thought about that,\u201d I said with a smile, tucking the card into my back pocket and making a mental note to call the number later.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. You two just make sure you come back in here and visit me every once in a while, OK?\u201d He slid the two large boxes in my direction.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d I reached out my hand, and he gripped it firmly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you soon. Thank you.\u201d Cassie smiled before holding the door open for me and our large pies.</p><p>See? I catch on quick.</p><p>We walked back toward our apartment as Cassie started laughing. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he knew who you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was crazy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders while balancing the pizzas. \u201cI\u2019ve always heard New Yorkers are intense.\u201d</p><p>Cassie stopped briefly, her eyebrows raised. \u201cOh. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Her tone made me smile. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll learn soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just better win your games, mister,\u201d she warned, her tone sounding half-teasing, half-nervous.</p><p>We walked into the apartment building where the elevator doors waited in the open position. Cassie pressed the button and as the doors drew closed, I found myself wanting to drop the boxes to the ground and pin her against the elevator wall. My pants tightened as my thoughts took off on their own. In my mind, I\u2019d leaned over and pressed my lips to her neck, licking and nibbling my way up her jaw as moans escaped from her lips. I thought about pressing my mouth against hers, silencing her sweet little cries as our tongues played a game of hide and seek. She cleared her throat, and I looked up to see her holding the elevator doors open.</p><p>\u201cDo you and the elevator need some time alone?\u201d she asked, her eyes flicking to the bulge in my pants.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about all the things I\u2019d like to do to you in here.\u201d I winked and bit my bottom lip, hoping for a reaction from her.</p><p>She cocked her head to one side, her lips puckering in that cute little way that always turns me on. \u201cOh, really? Elevators are nasty. You\u2019re gross.\u201d She turned her back to me and jangled her keys toward the door as I let out a slight laugh.</p><p>Once inside, I placed the hot-as-hell pizza boxes on the kitchen table and shook the heat from my hands. \u201cAs soon as you sit down, I\u2019ll tell you the best parts,\u201d I shouted at her retreating back.</p><p>\u201cOooh, really?\u201d She looked back at me from the bathroom doorway with a smile. \u201cJust let me wash my hands.\u201d</p><p>After a quick search, I grabbed two plates from the cupboard and placed them on the counter before pouring two glasses of water.</p><p>Note to self: get some beer.</p><p>Cassie walked into the kitchen, her face all smiles. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said, grabbing both of the waters as she practically skipped to the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Dean was sitting on the couch, and I punched him on the arm as I walked past.</p><p>\u201cMelissa,\u201d he answered, raising his eyebrows with her name. \u201cMeli, hold on a sec.\u201d Dean covered his cell phone with his hand and lowered it toward his thigh. \u201cShe wants to come with us.\u201d I eyed him, my face clearly confused. \u201cTo Alabama,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, not understanding why she would possibly want to take that trip.</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019s bored at home without Cassie. And she wants to help. Personally, I think she just misses me.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>I thought for a second before realizing that the idea of Melissa coming with us didn\u2019t annoy me. \u201cShe can come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dean broke out in a big smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t care,\u201d I said quickly. It would be fun with her there. And she\u2019d probably be really helpful. She was a girl, after all, and girls like to organize, clean, and take care of shit. Right?</p><p>\u201cShe did not go with you to Alabama,\u201d Cassie said, her jaw dropping wide open.</p><p>\u201cYes, she did. She even met Chrystle,\u201d I told her with a large grin before stuffing a slice in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her shoulders dropped. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me a thing!\u201d</p><p>I reached across the table for her, cupping her cheek in my hand. \u201cI told her not to. I made her promise she wouldn\u2019t tell you anything until I could come get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s my best friend,\u201d she whined. \u201cAnd she knew how much I was hurting. If she would have just told me what was going on, I wouldn\u2019t have had to go through all of that. The waiting, the not knowing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Cass, she fought with me a lot about it. She wanted to tell you every day, and every day I had to make her promise she wouldn\u2019t. I threatened to stop filling her in on things and she said if I did, she\u2019d call you that second and tell you everything.\u201d I half smiled to hide my discomfort. \u201cSo basically, we had an understanding. As long as I kept her in the loop, she kept her mouth shut.\u201d It didn\u2019t feel wrong when I asked Melissa to keep all this from Cassie at the time, but sitting here now, saying it all out loud, the fact that I had been a complete dick overwhelmed me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Cassie crossed her arms across her chest and pouted. My eyes followed her arms but stopped abruptly on her chest. Just one look and my manhood started to wake up. I forced myself to look away and think about anything other than the woman I loved sitting across from me, her breasts heaving up and down with each disgruntled breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just couldn\u2019t have her tell you what was going on until it was all over. I had asked you to understand so much already. I refused to ask you to understand that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I would have. I would have understood.\u201d She uncrossed her arms before continuing. \u201cOr I would have at least tried to.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. She\u2019s so fucking right. But it\u2019s too late. I can\u2019t change the past. What\u2019s done is done.</p> <p>\u201cI know that, but it didn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d I reached across the table and stroked her cheek with my thumb. \u201cI was trying to be honorable. And I felt that coming to your door while I was still carrying Chrystle-sized baggage was not the honorable thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and all your right-thing-to-do ideas. You sorta suck at doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear that a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez Jack, this house is really nice,\u201d Melissa said, running her hand across the granite countertop in the kitchen of my rented house.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThe rent is really cheap here,\u201d I paused before adding, \u201cAnd I thought I was staying awhile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell thank God you\u2019re not! Can we go out tonight? Please? Somewhere fun?\u201d she begged, her bottom lip jutting out.</p><p>I smirked at her suggestion before glancing at Dean. \u201cSure.\u201d I shrugged, taking a swig from my lukewarm bottle of beer. There were only two bars in this small Alabama town, and after that hellish night when I met Chrystle, I\u2019d sworn I\u2019d never step foot in that particular bar again. So that only left the other one, and I had no idea what it was like.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Melissa practically shouted before disappearing upstairs to the guest bathroom. \u201cI get to shower first!\u201d</p><p>I eyed my brother. \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest with you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes to kiss me.\u201d Dean smiled like a lovesick idiot. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in junior high? What the fuck does that even mean?\u201d</p> <p>Dean\u2019s face dropped, and I genuinely ached for him. My brother was pretty much the polar opposite of me. He got attached to girls willingly. Whereas I cut every cord possible that tied me down to anyone\u2014until Cassie that is\u2014he fastened triple knots to the people he cared about. When Dean fell for a girl, he fell hard. I half wondered if he did it just to spite me. Just to prove how unlike me he really was.</p><p>\u201cIt just means that anytime that girl will let me kiss her, I\u2019m going to take it. I like her, alright. I just don\u2019t think she really likes me.\u201d</p><p>I punched him in the arm. \u201cKiss her better then, jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kiss her just fine, fuck you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not,\u201d I teased. Sensing his defenses on the rise, I backed off. I loved to torment my little brother, but I didn\u2019t enjoy actually hurting him.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to talk to her for you?\u201d I offered, wondering what Melissa\u2019s deal was.</p><p>Dean\u2019s back straightened as his shoulders tensed. \u201cDefinitely not. The last thing I want is for you to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tryin\u2019 to help, little brother.\u201d I took another sip before pouring the rest of the bottle down the sink. Warm beer tasted like piss. The shower turned off and Dean glanced up the stairs. \u201cGo up there, already. What you should have done was hopped in the shower with her,\u201d I suggested with a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dick,\u201d he shot back as he headed toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m right,\u201d I shouted as he flipped me off over his shoulder.</p><p>We sat around the small circular oak table, drinking and laughing. Melissa pounded her tiny fist against the tabletop before shouting over the music, \u201cJack, I forgot to tell you that I sent Cassie the jar of quarters the other day!\u201d</p><p>My mind drifted back to the night she left, standing alone in her old room while I stared at the jar she\u2019d left behind. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked for it. And she made me promise to wrap it in like a thousand layers of bubble wrap so it wouldn\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows and offered a cocky grin, happy to hear this revelation when my eye caught sight of the last possible person in the world I\u2019d ever want to see, with her maid of honor trailing behind her. My jaw tensed as I cracked my neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, look who it is, Vanessa. My husband.\u201d Chrystle\u2019s grating voice rang in my ears, and I suddenly wished I were deaf. \u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t his delicious brother too. Vanessa, you remember Dean, don\u2019t you? From the weddin\u2019?\u201d She looked toward Vanessa, who shifted uncomfortably but didn\u2019t respond. \u201cHi, Dean. How you doing, sweetie?\u201d Chrystle cooed in her syrupy accent as she continued to invade our space.</p><p>I glanced at Melissa, who was making fists with her hands, her eyes narrowed into tiny slits, and her mouth snarling. \u201cJesus, Jack, I guess it\u2019s true what they say about beer goggles,\u201d Melissa sniped, giving Chrystle the once-over with pure disgust in her eyes.</p><p>Chrystle\u2019s jaw dropped slightly and her eyes got huge. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re as ugly on the outside as you are on the inside,\u201d Melissa spat out. For a tiny thing, she sure was ballsy. I fucking loved it. Melissa said everything to Chrystle that I couldn\u2019t say without it potentially being used against me in court.</p><p>\u201cAnd just who the hell are you?\u201d Chrystle braced herself and tried to sound tough but failed, and I noticed Vanessa fighting to hide a grin.</p><p>\u201cNone of your fucking business,\u201d Melissa shot back before taking a drink from her glass.</p><p>\u201cBut it is my business. See, you\u2019re sitting with my husband and my brother-in-law.\u201d Chrystle ran her fingertips down Dean\u2019s arm, and he tensed before swatting her hand away.</p><p>\u201cOh, great.\u201d Melissa rolled her eyes. \u201cYou touched her, Dean. She\u2019s probably pregnant now.\u201d</p><p>With that comment, I couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. Thunderous laughter ripped from my lungs and spilled out into the air.</p><p>\u201cNow, why don\u2019t you take your ugly skank ass away from our table so we can enjoy the rest of our night?\u201d Melissa turned to eye me. \u201cSeriously, Jack. How drunk were you to fuck that?\u201d Her tone filled with contempt.</p><p>Struggling for a comeback, Chrystle scurried away from our table, almost tripping on an out-of-place chair as Vanessa quickly trailed behind her.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Funsize. That was awesome.\u201d I reached out to high five her from across the table.</p><p>\u201cThe easiest way to get under any girl\u2019s skin is to call her ugly. Especially when she\u2019s not,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Dean nodded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas, buster. You pull that shit with me, and I\u2019ll never speak to you again,\u201d Melissa said, with a sassy neck gyration that made me want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he responded, placing the bottle to his lips and chugging.</p><p>Pussy.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, that story is amazing!\u201d Cassie\u2019s eyes squinted as she howled with laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty hilarious.\u201d I laughed along with her, thankful for the upswing in her mood.</p><p>\u201cHow did Melissa keep that from me? That\u2019s the best story ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably dying to tell you,\u201d I admitted, feeling guilty that I\u2019d asked her best friend to keep so much from her.</p><p>\u201cDid the evil troll sign the papers after that?\u201d</p><p>The smile fell from my face as I remembered what came next. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The three of us walked toward the exit of the bar as Chrystle jumped in front of me, grabbing me by the arm. I freed myself from her wretched touch before shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me, you crazy bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to talk to you, Jack.\u201d She batted her eyelashes and tilted her head in some bullshit attempt to appear sweet.</p><p>\u201cHow about we talk after you sign the papers?\u201d</p><p>Instantly, her mouth pursed together in frustration. \u201cI\u2019m not signing those. You can\u2019t prove anything and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep telling yourself that,\u201d I lied, hoping she\u2019d buy it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cJust remember how many friends you have before I subpoena them all and make them testify against you. If you get them to lie on the stand, I\u2019ll make sure they go to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d she spat.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I leaned in close to her face, my words laced with anger and hate.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work anyway. I\u2019ve covered all my bases, so to speak.\u201d She grinned wickedly, and I wondered what the hell I did in a past life to deserve this.</p><p>\u201cJust sign the fucking papers, Chrystle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I refuse to make it easy for you to get rid of me.\u201d She smirked, and I wanted to smack the ever-loving shit out of her.</p><p>\u201cIs this a fucking game to you?\u201d I asked through clenched teeth, my temper rising to a boil.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay married, so I won\u2019t sign anything if I can avoid it.\u201d</p><p>Her smugness radiated from her with such force that I had to fight the urge to scream and shout like a lunatic in the middle of the bar.</p><p>Keep your cool, Carter. Do not let this crazy bitch push you over the edge.</p><p>\u201cAvoid it? You think you can avoid this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes I do.\u201d Her voice, thick with deceit and confidence, made me want to gag.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a bad person.\u201d I threw my hands up into the air in my frustration.</p><p>\u201cSo are you!\u201d she fired back.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m an asshole. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>This girl pushed every goddamned button I had. And not in a good way. I half wished Melissa would walk past me and deck her. Lord knows I couldn\u2019t. If it were socially acceptable to punch a girl, this might have been the time I\u2019d actually consider doing it. If she were a guy, I\u2019d knock her teeth down her fucking throat.</p><p>\u201cI will do whatever I have to do to be rid of you. You hear me? Whatever I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d she asked, her voice overtly raised.</p><p>\u201cIf I were threatening you, you\u2019d know it. Sign the damn papers.\u201d I turned away from her, punching the bar door open with my fist.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible to hate her more.\u201d Cassie exhaled as she shook her head in disbelief. \u201cWho does stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy bitches. I swear I\u2019m never talking to another girl who isn\u2019t you again.\u201d</p><p>That actually isn\u2019t a half-bad idea. If I never talk to another female fan, I\u2019ll never get in trouble with Cass and she\u2019ll trust me again.</p><p>\u201cGran might get sad.\u201d Cassie\u2019s sweet voice interrupted my new plan.</p><p>\u201cRight. You and Gran,\u201d I amended before continuing. \u201cSo, Chrystle filed a restraining order against all three of us the next day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShut the fuck up! Against you, Dean, and Melissa?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cShe said we threatened her life and she feared for her safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you joking? That bitch better hope I never run into her or she will fear for her safety.\u201d Her fingers tapped the top of her plate, making a loud ping with each touch.</p><p>I laughed out loud. \u201cI like it when you get all protective over me, Kitten. It\u2019s cute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should have had her locked up in an asylum or something when you had the chance.\u201d Her voice filled with anger, and I found myself amazed at the amount of craziness in my life over the past year.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe Meli didn\u2019t tell me any of this. I mean, after I saw you at your game that night, I called her right away. She told me to get over you. She said I needed closure, but she knew everything that you were doing the whole time.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the back of my neck in discomfort at the memory of seeing Cassie with some other guy at my baseball game and also how irritated Melissa had become. \u201cYeah. She was pretty pissed at me by that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I tugged my neck to the left, cracking it before exhaling loudly. \u201cShe told me that I had a deadline. Either I told you by a certain date, or she would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen was the deadline?\u201d</p><p>I looked away from her eyes, the truth still a painful reminder. \u201cBefore I left for spring training this season.\u201d</p><p>I watched as her mind worked, the pieces clicking together like a puzzle that only fit together in one particular way. She was making the connection between Melissa\u2019s demands of me months ago and their conversation after seeing me at the game a few weeks ago. \u201cBut she never told me. I mean, she never said anything. And obviously, neither did you.\u201d She stopped, her forehead wrinkling with her continued confusion as she realized that Melissa threatened to confess everything to her, but never followed through. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell me? She knew how hurt I was.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. She said that you were finally happy here. That you were giving people a chance and you loved everything you were experiencing. And she was afraid if she told you everything that you\u2019d go back to being sad and close yourself off. She figured telling you would only make you take steps back, instead of forward.\u201d</p><p>I watched as her forehead softened, releasing the tension. \u201cBecause of Joey?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She said that even though it wasn\u2019t the same, she could hear the subtle excitement in your voice whenever you talked about him.\u201d I forced a smile while my stomach churned and twisted with jealousy.</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why she pushed me so hard to go out with him.\u201d She stopped picking at her nail polish and looked at me. \u201cYou knew about him, right? I mean, before that night at the field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm\u201d was all I trusted myself to say in response. I had no right to be angry, but the thought of someone else with my girl made me want to punch holes in the wall. Or his face.</p><p>\u201cFrom Dean?\u201d she asked, her voice curious.</p><p>\u201cMostly. After Melissa got pissed at me, I think she enjoyed telling me you had someone else in your life. She blasted me one night after Chrystle had finally signed the papers, but I still hadn\u2019t called you. I told her I was trying to figure things out, but she fucking flipped out on me, yelling and screaming into the phone.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered at the memory of making Melissa angrier than I\u2019d ever heard her before. For a little thing, she sure was loud. \u201cShe demanded to know what the fuck it was that I still needed to figure out. Then she told me to leave you the hell alone and stay out of your life forever.\u201d</p><p>Cassie moved her hand to cover her open mouth, her eyes wide as she listened.</p><p>\u201cBy that point I was waiting to see if the trade would go through. No one knew I was trying to get traded. Not even Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Cassie paused, exhaling, \u201cdon\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel like someone out of a fucking Lifetime movie. Or some piece of shit from the Maury Povich show. Saying all of this out loud.\u201d I stopped to look at her green eyes.</p><p>God, she\u2019s so beautiful. How could I have ever hurt her?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all so insane to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Subject Change</p><p>Cassie</p><p>Reliving it all, when it wasn\u2019t that far in the past to begin with, was beyond overwhelming. I had no idea all the things Jack had gone through during our time apart. Parts of it broke my heart and other parts downright pissed me off. I was half tempted to tell him to stop. That I didn\u2019t want to hear any more. That I\u2019d heard enough. What could there possibly still be left to say?</p><p>But my mind\u2014my ever-loving, godforsaken, pain-in-the-ass mind\u2014wouldn\u2019t let it go. My mind would be the biggest monkey wrench in our getting back on track. I didn\u2019t want to be stupid. I\u2019d already accepted Jack\u2019s apology and welcomed him into my home with open arms, but going forward, I didn\u2019t want to be dumb ever again. There would be no next time if he fucked up. There would be no more chances. A girl can only take so much.</p><p>\u201cAnother break,\u201d I suggested, and knew immediately what crossed Jack\u2019s mind when I saw the knowing look on his face. \u201cNot that kind of break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He licked his lips and my jaw dropped open.</p><p>\u201cA change-of-subject break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd change-of-location break?\u201d He nodded his head toward the direction of the bedroom.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, barely able to see him through the tiny slits. \u201cFine. But only talking first.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cTalking first. Sex after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d I howled, my cheeks flushing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I can barely move anyway, I\u2019m so full. New York pizza is fucking good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d I said. New York pizza was unlike anything we had in California. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we had plenty of \u201cNew York style\u201d pizza places back home, but they were nothing like this. This had become, hands down, my most favorite style of pizza. Ever. \u201cThey say it\u2019s the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say what? What water?\u201d Jack asked as he put the dirty dishes into the sink.</p><p>\u201cThe pizza. They say it\u2019s so good here because of the water. It does something to the dough. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but I totally buy it.\u201d Every time I shared a tidbit of information I\u2019d learned about New York since living here, an excited chill coursed down my spine. I loved being the person teaching Jack all this stuff.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d He grabbed a towel and dried off his hands before turning to me. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I insist alright.\u201d</p><p>I walked into the bedroom and began stripping down, when Jack blurted out, \u201cI thought you said we weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting into my pajamas!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cI hate lying in bed in jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were full?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips. \u201cI am, but there\u2019s always room for K-I-T-E-N.\u201d He sang the word like the Jell-O jingle, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot a T,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t fit. You try to sing it with two t\u2019s.\u201d He patted the top of the bed before leaning his head against a pillow as the Jell-O jingle played in my head. \u201cGet over here.\u201d</p><p>I slipped into a pair of boy shorts and a tank top before literally jumping onto the bed. When I snuggled my head against the crook of his shoulder and wrapped my arm around him, he sighed with contentment and pulled a blanket over us.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s our subject change?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour new baseball team.\u201d I smiled against his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d His chest rose and fell against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. How does it work in the big leagues? What do you have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to report to the field on Monday morning. I need to be there by eight so I can fill out some paperwork. And I\u2019ll spend the day there until the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the game\u2019s at night, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be there all day long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I need to get checked in, get my locker, make sure my uniform fits, meet the manager, work out, take infield, have batting practice, eat lunch, attend meetings\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly before continuing, \u201cand miss my Kitten.\u201d</p><p>I laughed before sitting up to look at him. As much as I loved lying against his chiseled body, I enjoyed looking into those chocolate-brown eyes when we talked. Call me crazy.</p><p>\u201cShould I come to the field after I get off work? Are you pitching? Do you want me there if you\u2019re not pitching?\u201d Working in the office Monday through Friday all but assured that I\u2019d miss plenty of Jack\u2019s games. While a part of me hated knowing how many I\u2019d miss, other parts of me reveled in the dreams and goals I had for myself. I\u2019d moved to New York to advance my career, not follow Jack around the country. Still, the idea of him traveling and playing in stadiums without me filled me with sadness.</p><p>I feel like a walking contradiction.</p><p>His eyebrows pulled together. \u201cI have no idea if I\u2019m pitching or not. But I want you there no matter what.\u201d He reached for my hand, his thumb caressing my knuckles. \u201cI always want you there, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>My heart skipped with his touch, his words. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be there.\u201d I smiled softly as he raised my hand to his lips. The truth surged through me in that moment. There was a rush that happened whenever I watched Jack play. Nothing compared to sitting in a stadium, no matter how big or small, and seeing Jack on top of that mound of dirt. It was magic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a ticket for you at Will Call and you\u2019ll get an ID card so you can go underground after the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ID card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly for the away games. That way security knows you\u2019re a player\u2019s wife\u2014\u201d He stumbled before quickly recanting, \u201cor girlfriend. So they know you\u2019re with the team.\u201d</p><p>All other feelings escaped in a rush as jealousy settled into my stomach. I wondered if Chrystle possessed one of the ID cards in question. As if reading my mind, Jack added, \u201cShe never had one.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled and inhaled quickly. \u201cI know it\u2019s stupid to think about stuff like that, but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Jack quickly shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not stupid. Those thoughts are in your head because I put them there.\u201d He leaned his mouth next to my ear, his breath warm and enticing. \u201cI won\u2019t mess us up again. I promise.\u201d He nibbled on my earlobe before he pulled away.</p><p>I closed my eyes, drinking in his vow. Part of me cringed, acknowledging the vulnerability that coursed within me. I needed to be strong, but the reality was that Jack would be away a lot and I wouldn\u2019t be able to go with him. As much as I wanted to believe that his mistake with Chrystle was a one-time major screwup, I\u2019d be lying to myself if I said I wasn\u2019t fearful.</p><p>I was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever not be.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe me?\u201d he asked, his brow furrowed with worry.</p><p>I fought back the tears that formed in my eyes. \u201cI want to.\u201d What I wanted to do was bottle my anxiety up and put it on a shelf where it could only come out in small doses, but I didn\u2019t know how. Right now it lived on the outside of my skin, like an extra layer I couldn\u2019t shed no matter what. My emotions had taken full control over every other part of me. I\u2019d become victim to my own insecurities.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d His forehead pressed against mine as he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll never lose you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I want to be lost?\u201d I teased with a half-serious tone and watched as he pulled his head from mine.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me?\u201d I mocked, secretly loving the way he wanted me.</p><p>Jesus, Cassie, you\u2019re a fucking nutcase right now. Pick an emotion. Pretend like you\u2019re in charge here.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t let you. End of discussion.\u201d His mouth remained stoic.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really what one would consider a discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing to discuss. I\u2019m not leaving you ever again. And you\u2019re not leaving me. No matter how pissed off I make you, or how frustrated. I fucking love you, and I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I attempted to fight back the smile that formed. \u201cAnd I love you. But really, if you ever cheat on me again, I\u2019ll cut your nuts off and hang them from the Empire State Building.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re Bossy</p><p>Jack</p><p>And now I needed the subject change. I\u2019d relived my mistake with Chrystle every moment since I made it, and talking about cheating with Cassie fucking wrecked me inside. \u201cYou know, there isn\u2019t much more of the story to tell if you want to quit interrupting and let me finish.\u201d I cracked a smile.</p> <p>She crinkled her nose in response to my words, a slight smile spreading across her cheeks. I waited for what I was certain would be a smartass remark when she simply said, \u201cOK. Finish.\u201d</p><p>Wrong again, buddy.</p><p>I breathed out a long, steady sigh before picking up where I left off.</p><p>I leaned against the couch in my newly rented Arizona apartment. Spring training for pitchers and catchers was in full swing, and I was still a married man.</p><p>\u201cWe should really start on divorce proceedings, Jack.\u201d Marc\u2019s uneasy voice buzzed from the phone at my ear.</p><p>\u201cIs that your professional opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only dragging this out further. She\u2019s never going to sign something that makes her look as bad as the annulment does. As it is, there\u2019s a thirty-day waiting period after we\u2019ve filed the divorce paperwork.\u201d</p><p>My head pounded as my rage exploded. \u201cThirty days? Fuck!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. Let\u2019s just get this over with for you, OK? Let me withdraw the annulment and start the divorce paperwork. Although I have to warn you, she can refuse to sign the divorce papers too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Marc. Just give her whatever the hell she wants and get me out of this.\u201d I jammed my finger into the End button before pitching the phone full speed against the wall of my apartment. Pieces of plastic flew into the air, leaving a hole in the wall behind it.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The next day I opened my e-mail inbox to see a message from Chrystle\u2019s best friend, Vanessa.</p><p>Jack,</p><p>We need to talk. I can help you. Call me as soon as you get this.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Vanessa</p><p>I stared at the e-mail with her phone number for a good half hour before remembering I\u2019d shattered my phone. Before practice, I picked up a new one and almost knocked the salesman out when he suggested I change my number to a local one. I\u2019d never change my phone number to a number Cassie didn\u2019t have, and the mere suggestion almost cost that guy his pretty little face.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Vanessa said when she answered my call.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked abruptly. This girl was Chrystle\u2019s best friend. She knew everything Chrystle lied about and did nothing to stop it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let her keep doing this to you, Jack.\u201d Her voice broke, but I remained unconvinced and questioned anyone who could stay best friends with a person like Chrystle. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she faked her pregnancy,\u201d she whispered before continuing. \u201cI mean, at first I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know at the wedding?\u201d I asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo. She was still lying to everyone then.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t care. \u201cGet to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter seeing you at the bar and hearing the things she said to you, I tried to talk to some sense into her. But she won\u2019t listen. She got even crazier after that night. Like more determined or something...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>Annoyed, I huffed into the phone. \u201cVanessa, I don\u2019t have time for this. Either get to the point or I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to say that I\u2019ll testify on your behalf. I\u2019ll talk to your lawyer, or judge or whomever. I\u2019ll tell them that everything you wrote in those annulment papers is true. And I\u2019ll tell them everything they need to know that not even you know, Jack.\u201d</p><p>My chest heaved as disbelief and elation coursed through me. The air around me thickened as I struggled for a response. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t deserve what she\u2019s doing to you. It\u2019s wrong, and I don\u2019t want to be a part of it anymore.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to believe her. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious,\u201d I paused, still unsure of truth versus lies when it came to those girls, \u201cI\u2019d like to pass your phone number along to my lawyer and have him call you. Is that OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m really sorry, Jack. I hope this helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>Cassie swiveled her head back and forth in disbelief. \u201cThis story. Seriously. Crazier and crazier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but thank fucking God Vanessa e-mailed me when she did. Marc was just about to file the divorce papers when I called him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Just in the nick of time, like a well-played movie.\u201d She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cA well-played Lifetime movie,\u201d I added with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cSo, Vanessa followed through? She wasn\u2019t lying?\u201d</p><p>I knew Cassie\u2019s mind wandered to the same places mine had originally. Was this another trick, a lie, another baited hook I was sinking my teeth into? \u201cNot only Vanessa, but she got their friend Tressa to make a statement corroborating my claims on the annulment. Chrystle signed the papers that week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Wow.\u201d Her hand covered her now gaping mouth. \u201cJust like that? That\u2019s all it took to get her to sign?\u201d</p><p>I raised a hand in the air. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</p><p>With her head back on my chest, I wound my fingers in and out of her hair. \u201cYep. That was spring training, then the season started, and here we are.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head back up from my chest, a wicked grin covering her face. \u201cUh-uh. I want to hear about you seeing me at the field with Joey the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other night? That was weeks ago,\u201d I complained.</p><p>\u201cIt sometimes feels like the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel girl, Cassie Andrews. Anyone ever tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe once or twice.\u201d She leaned in, her soft lips pressed against mine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the perfect way to get me to stop telling you stories.\u201d I deepened the kiss, my tongue pushing its way into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTell me first; kiss me after.\u201d She leaned away from my face, and I thought briefly about teaching her a lesson. One that included the fact that I\u2019d kiss her whenever I damn well pleased. But I was close to finishing my story and I wanted to move on.</p><p>I kicked the mound of dirt at my feet, adrenaline coursing through my veins. I fought with my head to keep its focus, but it kept drifting to thoughts of Cassie. I was in New York, and she lived here.</p><p>She won\u2019t be here.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t come to your games anymore.</p><p>My stomach twisted as I faced my catcher, tossing warm-up pitches into his glove. I\u2019d thrown no less than ten pitches when a man\u2019s voice shouting stopped me mid-pitch. I almost threw my fucking arm out stopping like that.</p><p>\u201cCassie! Cassie, wait!\u201d</p><p>The air in my lungs escaped without warning, and I almost dropped onto the dirt mound at my feet. I glanced in the stands toward the sound of her name, catching sight of her long blonde hair flying as she ran. I\u2019d know her anywhere. A guy chased after her, and my chest blazed with jealousy. I clenched my jaw, every muscle in my body tensing at the sight of her with someone else. She turned around to face the guy, and her eyes met mine for a brief moment as my temper raged like an out-of-control inferno. The guy put his arm around her, and I forced back the urge to charge him like a bull in a bullring. I wanted to break his fucking arm. No one touched my girl but me.</p><p>\u201cCarter, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>I turned away from her, refocusing on the batter\u2019s box, and threw the ball with all my strength.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was taking me to the game.\u201d Her eyebrows creased as her expression turned remorseful.</p><p>\u201cThat...\u201d I paused, reliving the feeling of seeing him toss his arm around her shoulders again, \u201cmade me almost come unglued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m so sorry you saw me there with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the past now. Ready to hear how nervous I was when I got here last night?\u201d I played with her hair again.</p><p>She moved to straddle me, sweeping her legs on either side of my waist. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear about that in a minute.\u201d She leaned down, sucking my bottom lip into her mouth, her hips grinding into my waist.</p><p>She thinks she\u2019s in control.</p><p>In one quick movement, I flipped her onto her back. Pinning her beneath me, I pressed my hard-on against her shorts. \u201cIs this what you want instead of story time?\u201d My mouth plunged toward her neck, nipping gently before licking and kissing up to her ear. \u201cThis what you want, Kitten?\u201d I breathed against her.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d she moaned softly, her back arching.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d My hands wandered up her thighs before finding the sweet spot between her legs. \u201cYou\u2019re burning up down there,\u201d I said. Knowing how hot she was for me fueled my hard-on even more.</p><p>She moaned my name, and I covered her mouth with mine. \u201cSay it,\u201d I demanded, breathing into her.</p><p>Her eyes opened, her chest rising and falling. \u201cI want you instead of story time. Now, stop fucking around.\u201d Her hands wrapped around the nape of my neck, tugging and pulling my hair. I leaned away from her, enjoying the control.</p><p>I pulled her clothes off, tossing them over my shoulder before adding mine to the pile. Bringing my fingers and body back to hers, her back arched and writhed as she begged, \u201cJack, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to learn some patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck patience. Get in me!\u201d she practically screamed, her hand wrapping around me. I bucked against her gently before peeling her hand away. I tried to be strong, but who was I fooling? I wanted her just as badly as she wanted me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe more.</p><p>I placed my arms on each side of her gorgeous naked body before guiding myself inside her. \u201cSo wet, Kitten,\u201d I said, instinct and need taking over.</p><p>Her eyes closed as her fingertips pressed hard against my shoulders, working their way down my back and settling on my ass. I moved in and out of her, slowly at first. The feeling of her tightness surrounded me. Coupled with my feelings for her, I knew I wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><p>This girl is ruining my ability to last in the sack.</p> <p>\u201cJack. Faster.\u201d Her voice was breathy and filled with need.</p><p>Goddamn, she\u2019ll be the death of me.</p><p>I quickened my pace as she pushed and pulled against me, her breathing accelerating. I drove myself into her with more force, fighting the urge to explode right then. I leaned into her mouth, gliding my tongue along her bottom lip before pushing it inside her mouth. We breathed into each other, tongues desperate and needing, as her body started to quiver.</p><p>There is a God.</p><p>I refused to stop, pushing deeper as pleasure-filled screams tore from her lips and filled the air between us. Her body trembled as I grew harder, the blood draining from the rest of my body and pooling in one central location.</p> <p>Her eyes focused on me just as I closed mine. A growl escaped as I called her name. I released myself inside her, my hips slowing before finally stopping. I collapsed on top of her with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Get. Off,\u201d she demanded, gasping as she exaggerated her inability to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI thought I just did.\u201d</p><p>Cassie rolled her eyes, shoving me with all her strength. \u201cOK, OK. I\u2019ll move.\u201d I wrapped my hands around her shoulders and rolled us both over. I pulled her naked body against mine, refusing to let her go.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m hungry again.\u201d She kissed the top of my nose. \u201cAnd ready for the rest of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bossy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou like it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll Never Leave You Again</p><p>Jack</p><p>I waited for Cassie on the couch in the tiny living room. Looking around, I surveyed the small apartment and thought to myself that we\u2019d need a bigger place soon. And I needed a gym. But we could deal with that later. She walked out in her pajamas, grabbed one of the boxes of pizza, and tossed it on the coffee table near our legs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready now.\u201d</p><p>I walked into the lobby of Cassie\u2019s apartment building and was immediately greeted by an older gentleman in a dark gray suit and black bow tie. The doorman\u2019s kind face almost set my rattled nerves at ease. Almost.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, sir. May I help you?\u201d he asked, eyeing the packages in my arms curiously.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I forced a smile before asking, \u201cI was wondering if you could help me out?\u201d I moved toward him and placed the packages carefully on the tiled floor. His eyes raced between my now revealed Mets jersey and the boxes at my feet. I could sense he was nervous, or maybe it was caution I picked up on, but I immediately wanted to put him at ease.</p> <p>\u201cThese are for Cassie Andrews. She lives here.\u201d</p><p>A large grin covered his face, replacing the uncertainty. \u201cI know Miss Andrews. Lovely girl. Talented, too.\u201d</p><p>I knew that tone. It was pride, and even the doorman in Cassie\u2019s apartment building felt it for her. \u201cYes, she is.\u201d</p><p>I extended my hand toward him. \u201cI\u2019m Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred. How can I help you, Jack?\u201d he asked, gripping my hand with more strength than I expected.</p><p>I sat for a moment wondering just how much to tell this stranger and how. \u201cLong story short, Cassie was my girl. But I fucked everything up and lost her.\u201d I eyed him apologetically after swearing. If Gran heard me talk like that to an older person, she\u2019d smack me upside the head. \u201cSorry for the f-word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Go on.\u201d Fred leaned against the reception desk, his eyes sparkling with interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to get her back. Each one of these packages is a different gift. I need to get them to her, but I can\u2019t be the one to do it.\u201d My voice shook as I tried to explain. \u201cAm I making any sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled again. \u201cDo they all go at once?\u201d</p><p>I threw my hands in the air, thankful for his question. \u201cNo!\u201d I shouted a little too aggressively. \u201cSorry. They go separately. There\u2019s an order to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know which gift goes first?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my feet. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s really heavy, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK. Here, let\u2019s hide the rest behind the desk. Just in case she wants to come down and get the first one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, so what\u2019s the plan?\u201d I stared at the man I now found myself depending on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her and let her know that a package arrived. She can decide if she wants to come down to get it or if I should bring it up. We\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I said, before cracking my knuckles and pacing nervously.</p><p>Fred pressed a button and began speaking. \u201cMiss Andrews, there\u2019s a package down here for you. Do you want me to bring it up, or would you like to come get it?\u201d His eyes met mine as we both waited for her response.</p><p>The speaker crackled and her voice filled the otherwise empty lobby. \u201cCan you bring it up, Fred? I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>I literally had to brace myself against the wall at the sound of her voice. That voice filled my dreams at night. That voice belonged to the girl who belonged to me. That was my voice, and I wanted it back.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re busy, then I can come down. Whatever is more convenient for you, Fred. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s my kitten. So considerate of others all the time. I took a deep breath as my chest relaxed. \u201cOK, Miss Andrews. I\u2019ll be up soon,\u201d Fred responded politely.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Fred asked me with a smirk.</p><p>I nodded, bending down to lift the weightiest box first. \u201cIt\u2019s really heavy,\u201d I warned him before dropping it into his arms.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what\u2019s in this?\u201d Fred remarked, his voice strained.</p><p>\u201cQuarters. A hell of a lot of quarters,\u201d I said with a smile, and rushed over to press the elevator button for him.</p><p>When the elevator doors opened with a ding, I watched him walk inside, press a button and cock his head at me. \u201cWish me luck,\u201d he added with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHell, wish ME luck!\u201d I shouted back as the doors closed.</p><p>Fuck. What if she gets pissed off? What if she hates me? Why did I let so many months pass by without talking to her? I smacked the side of my head with my palm and reminded myself that I was a fucking idiot. No girl in her right mind would take someone like me back. I suddenly found myself praying that Cass was crazy. Or at least half crazy. That way I\u2019d have a shot.</p><p>A few moments later, the elevator doors dinged back to life and Fred stepped out, a smile on his face. \u201cOne down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say? Anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks someone is sending her weights.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>I laughed loudly just imagining her saying that, and it echoed through the small lobby. \u201cOK, here\u2019s the next one.\u201d I watched as his body braced and tensed at the anticipation of the second box. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not heavy,\u201d I said and watched as Fred exhaled in relief. \u201cBut it is fragile. There\u2019s a bunch of picture frames in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d Fred\u2019s smile was contagious, and I found myself smiling just as broadly as he was.</p><p>I paced the tile floor, waiting for his return. This had to work. This was my girl we were talking about. If wasn\u2019t going to be Cassie by my side, then it would be no one. I\u2019d never love anyone the way I love this girl. There\u2019s no way we went through all of this bullshit for nothing.</p><p>The elevator ding interrupted my thoughts. Fred stepped out, his face still scrunched up from the force of his smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say this time?\u201d I searched his eyes for answers.</p><p>\u201cNothing. She wondered if this package arrived with the first one. I told her no.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here you go,\u201d I said, dropping another light box into his waiting arms.</p><p>That delivery was filled with Cassie\u2019s rules and all the ways in which I\u2019d broken them. And all the ways in which I\u2019d never break them again. I made promises to her in that box and by the grace of God, or whatever higher power exists in this world, I hoped she\u2019d give me the chance to make good on those promises.</p><p>Another ding and Fred emerged. \u201cShe\u2019s confused,\u201d he admitted. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfused is good. It\u2019s better than mad. She\u2019s not mad, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem mad. She did want to know who was bringing the packages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d I asked as nerves shot through my body.</p><p>\u201cI told her some kid was dropping them off one at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe bought that?\u201d I huffed out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cShe bought it.\u201d He grinned mischievously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good, Fred. Thank you. Here\u2019s the next one.\u201d I handed him a manila envelope as he entered the waiting elevator.</p><p>This was the next-to-last gift I had, the gag about eye-rolling and all the ways in which it was bad for you. There was only one more small box to go before I stood outside of her apartment door and hoped she\u2019d open it. I looked down at my Mets jersey and ran my hands over it, making sure I looked presentable.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crying,\u201d Fred said, the moment he exited the elevator.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I exclaimed as my heart fell into the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cShe said they were good tears, though, so I think you\u2019re in the clear,\u201d he added, patting my shoulder.</p><p>I looked up at the ceiling and swallowed hard. \u201cWhew. OK. This is the last one, Fred, but I have to come up with you. Is there anywhere for me to wait without her seeing me while you deliver this last package?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can wait in the hallway, around the corner. She won\u2019t see you there,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cSounds good. You ready to see if I get my heart back?\u201d I asked, clutching a dozen red roses.</p><p>\u201cI have a good feeling,\u201d he said, glancing at the flowers.</p><p>We stepped out of the elevator together and into the illuminated hallway. Fred pointed at the door marked #323, and I nodded, hurrying around the opposite corner. The knock on the door was soft, but the sound carried. I heard Cassie tease Fred about how she should just leave her door open all night.</p><p>Fred informed her that this would be the last package. Was that disappointment I heard in her voice as she thanked him? Her door closed softly, and Fred cleared his throat. I peered around the corner, and he waved me over. \u201cGood luck, Jack.\u201d He reached out his hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for all your help. I couldn\u2019t have done this without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you could have,\u201d he said with a grin before stepping into the elevator and disappearing.</p><p>The last package simply contained a letter from me and a small note asking her to open her front door. I hurried to Cassie\u2019s apartment door and waited with the roses clutched in my sweaty hands, right in front of the Mets logo on my jersey. It was in this exact moment that I realized I\u2019d left my confidence somewhere between my old life in Arizona and my new one here. I was nervous as hell. What if... so many what-ifs plagued my mind as the door flew open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said, as her voice rang out into the hallway.</p><p>She looked beautiful. I wanted to grab her, throw her against the wall, tell her how sorry I was for everything, and make up for each moment that had been lost between us. I lowered my arms, allowing the lettering on my jersey to show.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying this,\u201d Cassie\u2019s face scrunched up with her broad grin.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying what exactly?\u201d I teased through my vulnerability. It was tough reliving the parts we\u2019d just lived through. I had no idea if Cassie would ever forgive me or take me back. There was a good chance she wouldn\u2019t. Last night was a huge risk for me, but I\u2019d do it all again for her.</p> <p>\u201cHearing all of this from your point of view. I want to see the rest of last night through your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled deeply, knowing that I\u2019d give her anything she asked for, and then I continued.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing a Mets jersey?\u201d she asked, her voice carrying a mixture of excitement and confusion.</p><p>\u201cI got traded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey traded you?\u201d She sounded surprised. No, she sounded offended.</p> <p>\u201cWell, technically,\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop the smile from taking over my face, \u201cI asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked what?\u201d Her green eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI asked to be traded to the Mets.\u201d I shrugged and looked down at the floor, wondering how long she was going to keep me outside.</p><p>Her eyes grew wide. \u201cSo, you live in New York now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust got here. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Yes.\u201d She stumbled as she moved aside for me to enter, and I stifled a laugh. Was she nervous too?</p> <p>\u201cThese are for you.\u201d I pushed the long-stem roses toward her.</p><p>\u201cThank you. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d She leaned in to smell them, and I watched her eyes close as she breathed in their fragrance.</p><p>She walked into her tiny kitchen, and I looked around her apartment, my eyes falling on the couch. \u201cI see you got my gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d she mumbled, and I wanted to silence her and make her moan all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d I said her name as I inched my body close to hers. I tried to resist touching her, but being that close... a man only has so much willpower. I don\u2019t know what it was exactly about her hair, but I was tempted to reach out and run my fingers through it. Instead, I found myself tucking strands behind her ear as she touched my face. I swear I turned into putty with her touch.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love me?\u201d I asked, as desperation and uncertainty coursed within me.</p><p>\u201cI never stopped.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all I needed to hear. \u201cMe either.\u201d I grabbed the back of her neck, unable to wait a single solitary second longer. My mouth was instantly on hers, the heat between us radiating. My tongue reached out to meet hers before I pulled away. I needed to apologize before I tossed her fucking clothes to the ground along with my pride.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for lying to you that morning. I\u2019m sorry for cheating on you that night. I\u2019m sorry for not being the person you knew I could be.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed and I was desperate to kiss them, so I leaned in, kissing her bottom lip lightly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you can ever forgive me, but I\u2019d never forgive myself if I didn\u2019t at least ask you to try.\u201d</p><p>Please fucking forgive me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to get here. She was fighting the annulment and it took months to get it processed and finalized. I refused to fight for you while I was still carrying all that baggage. But it took a lot longer than I had expected. I should have called you. And I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Please don\u2019t let it be too late.</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated me,\u201d she whispered, her eyes avoiding mine, and I swear my fucking heart split into pieces.</p><p>She thought I hated her.</p><p>I\u2019m such a dick.</p><p>Instinctively I reached for her chin, tilting her head up toward mine. \u201cI could never hate you. I thought I was going to have to come before the annulment was complete when I\u2019d heard about you and the guy from your work.\u201d I forced my clenched stomach muscles to loosen their grip on me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know who he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean. I kept tabs on you, Kitten. Not in a creepy way, I swear. Just in a making-sure-I-wasn\u2019t-going-to-lose-you-all-over-again way. See, you\u2019ve always been able to see past the front I put up. I never thought I\u2019d be able to find someone who would know the real me and still want to stick around. And then I saw you at that frat party and my life was never the same.\u201d I spilled my guts to her, hoping that something I told her would click and she wouldn\u2019t kick my ass to the curb.</p><p>A single tear ran down her cheek as I continued. \u201cI know I don\u2019t deserve you, but I need you.\u201d I reached for her face, wiping the tear from her gorgeous face, finding myself lost in the green of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need you too. I hate feeling vulnerable, and I want to pretend like I don\u2019t, but it would be a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t pretend. Tell me you\u2019ll try to forgive me so we can move on from our past.\u201d</p><p>Please forgive me.</p><p>\u201cI already have,\u201d she said, and I was torn between collapsing at her feet on the floor and jumping into the air like a pussy.</p><p>I leaned my head against hers, \u201cI\u2019ll earn your trust again. I promise.\u201d I emphasized the word trust, hoping she knew just how much I meant everything I was saying to her.</p><p>With her face buried into my shoulder, I breathed in the smell of her shampoo, her soap, her skin. Her arms wrapped around my waist and her breath was hot against my neck as she inched closer toward my face. I was already turned on and excited from her nearness. \u201cProve it,\u201d she whispered suggestively into my ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, I plan to,\u201d I answered confidently, before giving her a chance to change her mind, or even think at all.</p><p>I lifted her into my arms, my hands firmly cupping her ass. She wrapped her legs around my waist, and I pressed her back to the wall, rubbing my growing hardness against her. She moaned, and I grew even harder as my tongue traced the curves of her neck, her salty skin familiar and enticing. I licked and nipped my way toward her jawline, where her mouth waited, slightly parted.</p><p>Another breathy sound from her, and I thrust my tongue into her mouth. The feel of her tongue against mine caused my body to shudder uncontrollably. I pulled my mouth away, burying my head into her neck once more. I licked and sucked at her, her hips pressing against me as I continued grinding her into the wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d I whispered into her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d Her voice hitched, causing me to hesitate.</p><p>Against my better judgment, I pulled my head away from hers and looked into her eyes. \u201cDo you want to stop? Is it too soon?\u201d I considered momentarily that having sex might not be the best idea. No matter how badly my body craved it.</p><p>\u201cI could lie and tell you I think we should wait. But honestly, I\u2019ve waited long enough. I\u2019ve been without you for too long already. I want you, Jack,\u201d she insisted, her fingers digging into the muscles in my back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for everything, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. No more apologies. Tomorrow you can start again, but not right now.\u201d She touched the side of my face, and I half wondered if it was all a dream.</p><p>Cupping her ass, I walked us into her bedroom, her tongue running along my bottom lip before entering my mouth with ravenous intent. I wove my fingers into her hair, pulling lightly as she released a quick gasp.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop making those fucking sexy noises, I\u2019m going to lose it right here.\u201d</p><p>She smirked, clearly enjoying the power she had over me. She leaned into my ear, her tongue sucking and nibbling on it before breathing a heavy, long, drawn-out sigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s it. You\u2019re gonna get it,\u201d I teased, before throwing her on top of the bed. I pulled off my Mets jersey and threw it to the floor, quickly followed by my white undershirt.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019ve missed your body,\u201d she exclaimed while biting on her bottom lip, her eyes eating me up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not man candy, Kitten,\u201d I said with mock offense.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d she insisted with a mischievous grin.</p><p>A smirk took over my face before I leaned toward her, my hands grabbing at her pajama bottoms. She lifted her hips and I pulled them down past her feet and discarded them. Then I straddled her, pressing my hardness against her mound. I wrapped one arm around her back and lifted her up toward me. Her arms instinctively wrapped around my shoulders, her nails digging into my back. I pulled at her tank top and she lifted her arms into the air before pressing her exposed breasts against my chest.</p><p>I\u2019d been waiting so long to have her\u2014thinking for months about the moment she would be mine again, hoping I\u2019d get this chance\u2014and the mere feel of her skin against me nearly sent me over the edge.</p><p>When my knees hit the edge of the mattress, I lowered her to the bed and inched slightly lower. She rested her head on top of a pillow, and I kissed her breasts, my tongue swirling, and my mouth sucking. She moaned as she reached for my head, her hands keeping me firmly in place. I sucked some more, my mouth hungry for every inch of her. My hands slid down her stomach to the front of her thong, my fingers rubbing against the material. I slipped my hand underneath the elastic, exploring, before entering. I moved my fingers in and out of her as she squirmed and tossed her head back.</p><p>My tongue traced a path between her breasts, up her neck, and into her hot mouth. She briefly pressed her tongue against mine before pulling away. \u201cNo more teasing. I want you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>The sound of my name being spoken breathlessly from her mouth caused my breath to catch. My fingers slid out from inside her as I sat up again. I yanked my boxers to the floor before pulling her thong down and watching her kick it off with her feet. Her legs parted, making room for me, welcoming me home. \u201cI love you, Kitten,\u201d I said, as I slid inside her.</p><p>She fucking felt amazing as I rocked in and out of her. \u201cGoddamn...\u201d My voice trailed off as she moved her hips with mine, her breathing growing louder with each push. I thrust myself deeper until I could go no further, her moans growing in intensity and her breath quickening.</p><p>\u201cHarder, Jack,\u201d she demanded, and I pushed myself into her with more force. Each movement deep and hard, I knew I wouldn\u2019t last much longer.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she breathed out. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>And I prayed she\u2019d come before I did. Her body rocked against me as sounds of pleasure escaped her lips. My pace quickened, and her body trembled as she tightened on me, her movements jerking lightly. I continued thrusting until I could take no more. My dick throbbed, and I released myself inside of her, a deep groan escaping my lips.</p><p>My breathing uneven, I stared into her eyes before pressing my mouth to hers. \u201cI love you,\u201d I said, my thumb caressing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d She smiled, her hand weaving through my hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never leave you again,\u201d I promised, my heart finally feeling whole.</p><p>\u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll fucking kill you,\u201d she threatened through a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>I watched as she untangled her body from mine, slipping out from the bed and into the bathroom.</p><p>Welcome to the Big Leagues</p><p>Cassie</p> <p>And here we are.\u201d I wiped the tears falling down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Jack reached out his hand, brushing his thumb along my jaw.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that was all last night. How is it possible that it feels like so long ago?\u201d I asked, feeling like a freaking lunatic.</p><p>He sighed before responding. \u201cBecause today has been like six months all rolled into one single day. I\u2019m fucking exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I laughed.</p> <p>Scanning his muscular body with my eyes, I was momentarily distracted when he asked, \u201cDo you think I should call Sal\u2019s cousin tomorrow? I mean, do you think setting up a driver is a good idea?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head before answering. \u201cI do, actually. I think it\u2019s a great idea. You should see if you can hire him exclusively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he wouldn\u2019t drive anyone else around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not like that,\u201d I tried to explain, my brain literally pinging with fatigue. \u201cJust see if having the same driver all the time is an option. I think it would be beneficial if we only had one person taking us places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d He raised his eyebrows, taunting me.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll hire my own driver,\u201d I shot back.</p> <p>Jack lunged, pinning me beneath him as he planted a kiss on my nose. \u201cLike hell you will. He\u2019ll be our driver. If I like him, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine? You\u2019re not gonna give me some sort of smartass comment, like \u2018What if I like him and you don\u2019t?\u2019 Just, fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m too tired to pretend argue.\u201d I yawned, unable to hide my fatigue any longer.</p><p>\u201cBed?\u201d he asked, his eyebrows wiggling.</p><p>\u201cYes. But for sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, Kitten. For sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Monday afternoon, the phone at my desk rang incessantly, begging me to pick it up. The words Front Lobby displayed across the small screen and I reached to grab it before it stopped.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Cassie\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Cassie. Your driver is here.\u201d</p><p>My what?</p><p>Oh, right. Sal\u2019s cousin.</p><p>\u201cOK, thank you. Can you tell him I\u2019ll be right down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone without saying good-bye and shoved into my purse the camera Jack had bought me after my original one was stolen the night I was mugged at Fullton State. I rushed to file my last-minute photos into their corresponding online folders before speed walking to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cHave fun tonight, Cassie.\u201d Joey\u2019s broad Boston accent filled the air, and I turned quickly toward him.</p><p>An uncomfortable blush crept over my cheeks. \u201cThanks, Joey,\u201d I said with a tight smile. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d I pressed the elevator button, wishing it would hurry up and retrieve me. Working with Joey now that Jack was back in my life wasn\u2019t necessarily the most relaxed of situations. I should have added a rule number five to my list after that night: Never date someone you work with. Because when it ends badly, it\u2019s awkward for everyone. And there\u2019s no escape.</p><p>The elevator dinged, and I stepped inside the crowded space. Squeezing my way in, I sandwiched myself between two men who thankfully didn\u2019t smell terrible. Each time the elevator stopped and the doors opened, the people waiting on the other side realized it was too crowded for them to enter. They would step away as I offered a sympathetic smile, the doors closing. This happened repeatedly for twenty floors until we reached the lobby.</p><p>Finally free from playing sardine, I bolted into the lobby, looking for a driver who resembled Sal, complete with overstuffed belly and kind eyes. I scanned the room before stopping on a tall, striking man dressed in a black suit and tie. A pair of black sunglasses rested on top of his spiky dark hair, and even through his suit, I could make out the muscular body lurking underneath.</p><p>Good Lord, that is one good-looking man.</p><p>The security guard caught the man\u2019s attention and then pointed at me as a wide grin spread across his face. The tall drink of water looked in my direction and asked, \u201cMiss Andrews?\u201d I stepped closer to him, my insides trembling.</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Cassie.\u201d I smiled, trying my best not to look him up and down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Matteo. Mr. Carter sent me to bring you to the game. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I squeaked out when I noticed the hint of a tattoo peeking out from under his collar.</p><p>Jack sent a model to pick me up. A tattooed, freaking hot-as-fuck model.</p><p>Matteo opened the rear passenger door, and I settled inside. Suddenly feeling like an entitled snob, I fought the urge to climb over the seat and sit up front with my new driver. Unless I was in a taxicab, sitting alone in the backseat while someone else drove always struck me as odd. I reached for my phone, checking my personal e-mails as the car lurched forward. I glanced up briefly during the quiet drive to find Matteo\u2019s blue eyes watching me in the rearview mirror. I darted my gaze from his and returned to my phone, fiddling with it to look busy.</p><p>Putting my phone down, I looked outside the window as the city flew by. I constantly found myself in awe of this place, with its massive buildings and old architecture. It was the ideal setting for the photographer in me.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Sal\u2019s cousin, huh?\u201d I asked, breaking the uncomfortable silence between us.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You see the resemblance?\u201d He angled his head toward the backseat for a moment, and I caught sight of the smile spread across his tanned skin.</p><p>I smiled in return, my lips firmly pressed together as I imagined Sal\u2019s oversized belly and receding hairline. \u201cDefinitely. You could pass for twins.\u201d</p><p>He laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you like Jack?\u201d I asked, attempting to bring my boyfriend into the conversation.</p><p>Boyfriend.</p><p>Still weird.</p><p>\u201cMr. Carter is great. He\u2019s a really cool guy, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so,\u201d he offered politely, and I wondered what thoughts were racing in his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I mind you saying so?\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a quick breath. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not very professional of me to use the word \u2018cool.\u2019 And I probably shouldn\u2019t give my personal opinion on clients.\u201d</p><p>Now I huffed out the loud breath. \u201cJack is cool, so I get it. And I asked. You were simply answering my question.\u201d I wondered how Jack liked Matteo and if we\u2019d be hiring him as our regular driver. Until I had those answers, I refused to get too chummy with Matteo. Chrystle proved that strangers can\u2019t be trusted. At least, not in this business.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool that he plays baseball for a living. You must love it, huh?\u201d he asked sincerely.</p><p>My heart lodged in my throat. I struggled to formulate a response to his seemingly simple question as every emotion possible coursed through me in record time. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s pretty great,\u201d I lied.</p><p>We pulled up to Citi Field and Matteo parked the car in front of the Will Call window and hopped out. He opened my door and offered me a hand. I declined, pushing myself up from the plush leather seat.</p><p>\u201cYour ticket is at the booth. I\u2019ll be parked right here after the game ends, but Mr. Carter warned me that it may take awhile,\u201d he added with a smile.</p><p>I flashed back to the many times I\u2019d waited for Jack after his games ended. \u201cYeah, it takes a little bit to get back out here once the game\u2019s over. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. I\u2019ll see you around eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. It was nice to meet you.\u201d I smiled before walking away.</p><p>With my ticket clutched firmly in my hand, I struggled through the crowds toward the section of seats reserved for the wives and families of the players. The smell of popcorn and hot dogs wafted through the air. I looked at the number printed in black ink and walked slowly down the stairs, observing the row number with each step. Almost walking right past it, I stopped abruptly. I glanced at the group of heavily made-up women in my section, watching my every move. Their eyes scanned the length of my body from the top of my natural hairstyle down to my inexpensive shoes. I hurried to my assigned seat before sitting down and stuffing my black purse between the side of my leg and the armrest.</p><p>I turned toward the women, who still stared at me, their faces devoid of any emotion. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Cassie,\u201d I said loud enough for the occupants of all three rows of seats to hear. The women simply continued to eyeball me, offering literally nothing in return. Not a smirk, not a sound. I started to wonder if I had something on my face.</p><p>I turned to speak to the women in the row behind me before thinking better of it. I sized up each of them instead, taking mental notes of their expensive clothing, brand-name accessories, perfectly styled hair, and overly made-up faces. One woman with an obvious spray tan and dyed blonde hair glanced at me before raising her eyebrows in disgust and shaking her head with an audible huff.</p><p>\u201cDid you see her purse? What is that, Target brand?\u201d I heard a voice whisper before a chorus of laughter followed.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I fought back the urge to defend myself. From what exactly, I wasn\u2019t sure. But I suddenly wanted to shield my body from the exposed and raw feelings that took over. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to me that these women would be rude or unkind. It was one thing I hadn\u2019t overthought. Hell, I hadn\u2019t thought about it at all.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Jack warn me?</p><p>He must not know. How could he?</p><p>Shoving my vulnerability into my gut where it rested like a giant boulder, my eyes fell on the enormous rock sparkling from Miss Spray Tan\u2019s finger. It was the biggest, most ridiculous diamond I\u2019d ever seen, and I\u2019m from LA.</p><p>Wonder what her husband\u2019s overcompensating for?</p><p>My gaze quickly darted to the left hands of all the other women, realizing that each sported their own hefty-sized rocks. Feeling like I was surrounded by a new kind of sorority girl, I turned my scrutiny from them and stared down at the field. Clearly I wouldn\u2019t be making any friends tonight.</p><p>I thought I left this kind of bitch behind in college.</p><p>I craned my head in the direction of the bullpen at the end of the field, forgetting all about the rude women surrounding me when my eyes fell on Jack\u2019s powerfully built frame. Heat flooded through my body and seeped into my veins with one look at him as he jogged toward the pitcher\u2019s mound. The muscles in his legs flexed each time his foot crushed against the ground, and a smile crept across my cheeks.</p><p>God, I\u2019ve missed watching him play.</p><p>His Mets uniform reminded me so much of the one he wore in college that I couldn\u2019t stop the memories from replaying. I clearly envisioned the first time I saw him pitching. It had been a truly beautiful experience, although I never admitted it at the time. His transformation into a completely different person once he stepped on top of that mound of dirt at Fullton State was unlike anything I\u2019d ever witnessed before. Watching Jack play baseball was almost like a having a spiritual awakening. Through all my heartache and heartbreak, I\u2019d forgotten this part. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How my pride soared as I watched him play baseball, knowing how much of his heart it held. And how it literally warmed me from head to toe being the person he loved more than it. I relished the moment, reaching into my purse for my camera.</p><p>I looked through the viewfinder and grunted audibly. My seat was great for viewing the game, but not photographing it. I was simply too far away, and I didn\u2019t have my larger zoom lens with me. I snapped one picture anyway, just to remember the night by, before shoving the camera back into my non-designer purse.</p><p>In my dazed state, I barely noticed that the seat to my right was newly occupied. Convinced it was another horrible wife, I hesitated to acknowledge this person. I second-guessed myself, suddenly feeling no better than those other women, when a warm voice with a British accent interrupted my thoughts. \u201cHi. You\u2019re new.\u201d</p><p>I turned toward her and stopped my jaw from falling wide open. This woman was stunning. She had an exotic look that I assumed brought guys to their knees. Her long straight brown hair looked like satin. That combined with her naturally tan skin made the green flecks in her hazel eyes stand out even more. I didn\u2019t think she had a stitch of makeup on, and I was convinced she was the prettiest woman in this stadium.</p> <p>I offered a small smile. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m Cassie.\u201d</p><p>She reached out her hand. \u201cHi, Cassie. I\u2019m Trina.\u201d A wide smile appeared, and she grew even more gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d I told her, my voice genuine. After what I\u2019d just witnessed, the fact that she was willing to talk to me at all eased my nerves.</p><p>\u201cYou too. So, who do you belong to?\u201d She nudged my shoulder with hers.</p><p>\u201cJack Carter.\u201d I tilted my chin toward the field. \u201cHe\u2019s pitching tonight. And you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe second baseman, Kyle.\u201d She lifted her hand, pointing him out on the field, and I glanced at her ring finger. My shoulders relaxed when I noticed the absence of rings.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from? I love your accent,\u201d I said before suddenly feeling stupid.</p><p>\u201cLondon. I like yours too.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an accent!\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou do. It\u2019s like a totally Californian accent, dude,\u201d she said, trying to mimic the way I sounded to her.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s awesome,\u201d I attempted to say with an English accent, but failed miserably. \u201cSo, how long has your boyfriend been on the team?\u201d I asked, desperate for her friendliness to continue.</p> <p>\u201cThis is our second season. He got traded last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with them?\u201d I tipped my head subtly in the direction of the mean girls.</p><p>Trina\u2019s face instantly filled with irritation, her perfectly shaped brows pulling together with distaste. \u201cThey\u2019re bitches. They won\u2019t talk to you until Jack has,\u201d her manicured fingers shot into the air and did the symbol for air quotes, \u201cpaid his dues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Jack has what?\u201d I asked, with an expression that I\u2019m sure reflected the confusion my brain was experiencing.</p><p>\u201cHe has to earn the respect of his teammates. Once he does that, then you\u2019ll earn the respect of the Bratz dolls over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I reached for my head, massaging my temples as she continued filling me in.</p><p>\u201cThere is a class system among the wives. And well, you and I already have one strike against us because we\u2019re not wives. We\u2019re only girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, didn\u2019t they start off as girlfriends?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like you.\u201d Trina laughed. \u201cOf course they did, but that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re nothing to them. The only way they\u2019ll talk to you is if you do something wrong or get in their way. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>My head ached as I tried to wrap my thoughts around the insanity that came with the baseball wives. Thankfully, the crack of the bat grabbed our attention and we watched as Kyle fielded the hard-hit grounder effortlessly. Trina released a breath, and a broad smile stretched across her cheekbones. My smile followed, thankful for the out. I wanted Jack to have a great first game.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t keep from staring at Trina\u2019s perfect features. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re ridiculously gorgeous. You look like a model.\u201d The words escaped my lips before I could be embarrassed by them.</p><p>Trina let out a giggle. \u201cThank you, Cassie. I actually am.\u201d She paused. \u201cA model, that is. Not gorgeous. Oh, gosh.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cA nice model? Who woulda thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot most people, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>As I focused on Jack again, his fluid movements caused sensations in me I couldn\u2019t hide. My cheeks warmed as he leaned his body forward, focusing on the catcher\u2019s glove. Even from where I sat, I could sense the intensity in Jack\u2019s eyes. A battle waged between the hitter and the pitcher, and Jack hated to lose. A quick nod and one deep breath later, Jack\u2019s arm hurled the ball past the batter, who swung his bat mightily, but missed.</p><p>\u201cAnd definitely not them,\u201d she said, directing her displeasure back toward the mean girls.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just jealous because you don\u2019t have to bleach your hair some fake color or spray tan yourself orange to look good.\u201d</p><p>She continued to smile at me. \u201cDo you work, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI work for a magazine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrike two.\u201d She arched her eyebrows, and I crinkled mine. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know it was our duty to quit working as soon as we started dating them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently I didn\u2019t get that memo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hate girlfriends. And they hate anyone who works.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou would think that we\u2019d all support each other and be friends since we\u2019re forced to spend so much time together. But that\u2019s not how it works. You should have seen me last season, trying to talk to them at every game. Someone finally had to tell me that they would speak to me when I was worthy. That\u2019s the word she actually used. Worthy,\u201d she said, emphasizing it slowly, almost in a whisper, and I couldn\u2019t hide my disgust. \u201cBut she\u2019s not here anymore. Her husband got traded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I did not sign up for this,\u201d I said, the realization hitting me that these women would now be part of my life whether I wanted them to or not.</p><p>Trina brushed some loose hair from her eyes before continuing. \u201cThe worst one is Kymber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKymber? Even her name screams bitch,\u201d I said with a quick laugh.</p><p>Trina\u2019s eyes darted to Kymber before returning to mine. \u201cShe\u2019s the queen bee here. That\u2019s how she refers to herself. The Queen Bee. Who says that?\u201d</p><p>Cheers erupted into the air, causing both Trina and me to look at the field as our team jogged off, disappearing into the dugout. I\u2019d made it through half an inning. Only eight and a half more to go.</p><p>\u201cHer husband has been playing the longest and makes the most money. That\u2019s why she\u2019s the queen. And all the rest of the wives bow down to her.\u201d</p><p>A disgruntled sound ripped from my chest. \u201cI\u2019ve never been really good at bowing down to anyone. It\u2019s not really in my nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cassie. She won\u2019t make your life a living hell or anything. She\u2019ll just act like you\u2019re invisible. Like you don\u2019t exist. And if that kind of thing doesn\u2019t bug you, then you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I pondered her words, trying to figure out exactly how the situation made me feel. Was it better to be a verbal punching bag or to not exist at all?</p><p>When the game finally ended, I followed Trina down a long staircase. Her shoes clicked and clacked down the last set of public stairs before she headed through a private door, guarded by security. Once inside, I shivered as the air of the cold brick tunnels coursed through me. The tunnels ran the length of the stadium, and I quickly thanked Trina for taking me under her wing.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I had no idea where the clubhouse was after my first game, and no one showed me. By the time I got down here Kyle was waiting for me, wondering what took me so long.\u201d</p><p>A burly security guard stood between two metal guardrails. He smiled as Trina approached, giving her a quick hug before staring at me, the wrinkles around his eyes deepening.</p><p>\u201cCarl, this is Cassie. She\u2019s Jack Carter\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>He reached out his massive hand, and I gripped it. \u201cNice to meet you, Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Cassie. Hell of a game tonight for your boy. Make sure you tell him I said good job, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? I\u2019ll probably get lost.\u201d</p><p>Trina giggled. \u201cIsn\u2019t she funny, Carl? We\u2019re going to be good friends.\u201d</p><p>We followed the white bricks as they curved gently around a long corridor. Once around the corner, a Mets sign protruded from the wall, announcing the location of the player\u2019s locker room. I smiled when we reached the double mahogany doors with a sign that read New York Mets Clubhouse above them. I curbed my desire to whip out my camera and photograph the doors and sign.</p><p>\u201cAnd now we just wait?\u201d I asked Trina quietly.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I Insist</p><p>Jack</p><p>I walked out of the clubhouse, eager to see Kitten. It was my first outing as a New York Met, and I\u2019d been credited with the win. I pitched six innings and gave up three hits, no walks, and one run. I scanned the crowd of waiting women and children, searching for the one who owned my heart.</p><p>There\u2019s my girl.</p><p>I smiled as soon as our eyes met, the pure fucking joy it brought me to see her made me feel like the biggest pussy on earth. I noticed the hot chick standing next to her, but I didn\u2019t give a shit. My heart belonged to my Kitten, and I\u2019d never fuck that up again. I hustled over to her, scooping her up in my arms before I planted a long, dramatic kiss on her waiting mouth. My tongue begged for her lips to part and once she finally opened them, I had to remind myself where we were. I pulled back from her slowly, holding her face in my hand. \u201cI missed you,\u201d I whispered, mentally patting myself on the back as her cheeks turned pink.</p><p>\u201cUh, babe. This is Trina. She\u2019s Kyle\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d Cassie\u2019s voice stuttered, and I stopped myself from announcing it to the entire tunnel.</p><p>Jack Carter makes his girlfriend lose her composure with just one kiss! Oh yeah, he\u2019s THAT good.</p><p>I extended my hand to Trina, shaking hers firmly. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Way to go, Peters.</p><p>\u201cThanks for hanging out with Kitten.\u201d</p><p>Trina\u2019s forehead creased as she shot Cassie a confused look. \u201cKitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, don\u2019t listen to him.\u201d Cassie swatted my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that to other people like it\u2019s my name,\u201d she demanded, which made me want to pull her aside and show her who was boss.</p><p>She was.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, Trina. I\u2019ve gotta take this one home now.\u201d I winked as I interlocked my fingers with Cassie\u2019s, pulling her away from the crowd.</p><p>We exited the stadium where waiting fans lingered for autographs, pictures, and whatever else they could get from us players. Cameras flashed as Cassie and I walked past, and I pretended not to notice when two women screamed my name. Cassie jumped at the sound of their voices. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, Kitten.\u201d My fingertips brushed against her shoulder. Even with Cassie by my side, women still behaved like lunatics. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJack! Will you sign my son\u2019s ball?\u201d A man\u2019s voice echoed into the night air.</p><p>I glanced at Cass, and she smiled, slowing her pace to a stop. \u201cSure.\u201d The rest of the fans quickly gathered around, and I scanned the group, only signing balls and posing for pictures with kids or guys.</p><p>\u201cCan I get a picture, Jack?\u201d I looked up to see a pencil-thin, busty blonde batting her eyelashes at me. I wanted to fucking puke.</p><p>I looked at Cass sympathetically as she nodded, letting me know she didn\u2019t mind. With a terse \u201cNot tonight,\u201d I barely looked in the woman\u2019s direction before throwing my arm around Cass and walking toward the car. The woman mumbled \u201casshole\u201d under her breath, and Cassie\u2019s shoulders tensed.</p> <p>Anxious to get going, I scanned our surroundings, not wanting to be surprised by anything or anybody as we walked toward our waiting car. I spotted a large, muscular silhouette in the distance. \u201cHow do you like Matteo?\u201d</p><p>Cassie stopped abruptly, turning to face me. \u201cCan you believe he\u2019s Sal\u2019s cousin?\u201d</p><p>I laughed because I\u2019d thought the exact same thing when he picked me up earlier. \u201cNo! I almost died when I fucking saw this guy. He\u2019s good-looking, right?\u201d</p><p>The guy looked like someone you\u2019d see on a billboard or a shopping bag at the mall. I hired a fucking model to drive my smoking hot and incredibly kind girlfriend around town.</p><p>I\u2019m an idiot.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s pretty good-looking,\u201d she responded matter-of-factly.</p><p>I could always fire him.</p><p>Or hit him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to leave me for some driver.\u201d My body tensed as jealous insecurity raged through me.</p><p>Her face contorted; I could see that my words were settling for her. \u201cUh, you\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be insane, but I mean it. You can\u2019t ever leave me for someone else.\u201d The very fucking idea of Kitten leaving me for another guy made me want to rip someone\u2019s head off. I\u2019d die before I let that happen. This girl is my world.</p> <p>\u201cJack, where is all this coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I think since I fucked up so badly, the only way for us to be even is for you do the same thing.\u201d I shrugged and watched as her face changed from concern to anger.</p><p>She placed her hand firmly against her hip as she lit into me. \u201cFirst of all, you don\u2019t get to tell me what to do. You also don\u2019t get to be the one to dictate what makes us even when it comes to your colossal fuckup. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I knew she didn\u2019t really want an answer, so I remained quiet as she continued her tirade. \u201cThe biggest thing you don\u2019t get to do is turn this around on me. I\u2019m not the one who did anything wrong. I\u2019m not the one who cheated, got someone fake pregnant, and then got married. So you do not get to make this an issue where you\u2019re the one feeling bad and I\u2019m supposed to feel guilty over something I had no control over. That\u2019s bullshit, Jack, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Chills surged down my neck, causing the hairs to stand on end with her demands. She was hot as fuck when she was angry. I wanted to rip her clothes off and take her right here, while our model driver watched. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re totally right. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing still erratic, she reached for my hand, pulling me toward the giant waiting shadow. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that. It\u2019s not fair to me. I\u2019m the one who gets to be upset and have insecurities, and figure out how to trust you again. Not the other way around.\u201d Her voice turned to a whisper as we neared Matteo.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Carter, Miss Andrews,\u201d Matteo\u2019s voice rang out as he pulled open the rear door.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Matteo, call me Jack. Or Carter, even. Just drop the mister. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked one last time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking positive,\u201d I answered with a laugh, hoping that the f-word would break the ice even further.</p><p>\u201cOK, boss. If you insist.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right. I\u2019m your boss, model boy. And I do insist.</p><p>\u201cHow about you, Miss Andrews?\u201d</p><p>Cassie leaned her head to the side, her lips puckering. \u201cHow about me, what?\u201d</p><p>Is she flirting with him?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you prefer I call you?\u201d His eyes locked on to hers, and I wanted to introduce my fist to his jaw. Or piss all over Cassie in an effort to claim her as mine.</p><p>Get it together, Carter.</p><p>\u201cJust Cassie would be great. No Miss Andrews. It\u2019s sorta weird and creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weird and creepy.\u201d I leaned into her ear, whispering.</p><p>She whipped her head around to face me, and I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her mouth to mine. Her tongue parted my lips, and I deepened the kiss, my hands roaming down her back to her ass. I squeezed and she moaned into me. My lower body willing and able, I suddenly wished for privacy glass so I could take her in the back of this car.</p><p>Matteo cleared his throat as he eased the car forward. \u201cSorry. I just wanted to make sure we were heading home and not stopping anywhere first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to stop somewhere. I\u2019m starving,\u201d I said. \u201cBut no pizza. I need meat.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Cass\u2019s cell phone beeping distracted me from my starving stomach as I wondered who was texting her this late. As if sensing my question, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s Melissa. She wants to know if we\u2019re fighting already.\u201d She scratched the side of her head, her hair dangling around her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m asking her.\u201d She barely responded as her fingers raced across the cell phone screen.</p><p>\u201cI keep forgetting it\u2019s three hours earlier there, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right? Me too,\u201d she said, still typing.</p><p>I watched as the Manhattan skyline grew closer with each passing moment, marveling at the unmatched character of this city. I\u2019d never seen so many tall buildings in such a small space before. I knew that seemed stupid, but there was nothing like this in Southern California. I fucking loved it here already. Cassie\u2019s phone beeped again. And then again, as I turned to her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I focused as she covered her mouth with her hand. \u201cCass?\u201d</p><p>She waved a finger in the air. \u201cThere are pictures of us online already. From when we were just talking a few minutes ago. They look bad.\u201d</p><p>Cassie shoved her cell phone in front of my face, and I stared at the three attached photos, all showing Cassie looking upset and angry while I stood there like a jackass. The Internet caption on the photo read: \u201cJack Hits a Home Run on the Field, but Strikes Out at Home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d she asked, her voice shaking.</p><p>I tossed my arm around her shoulder, pulling her body against me. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do. We should probably be more aware from now on when we\u2019re out in public.\u201d Anger worked through me as I digested the simple fact that nowhere was safe from prying eyes. It was the one part of being a professional athlete that I loathed. I hated having no control over which pictures were posted of my personal life and when. I honestly couldn\u2019t give a shit what they posted about me, but posting things about Cassie crossed the line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jack. I didn\u2019t even think about who might be watching.\u201d Her breath warmed my chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d I planted a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to deal with this kind of stuff before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like such a bitch in those pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I tried to reassure her but ended up pissing her off instead.</p><p>She pushed away from my chest, squaring her shoulders to me as her breath quickened. \u201cWhat do you mean, it doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward, cupping her cheek in my hand. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that people are going to think whatever they want to think, no matter what we look like in some online photo.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed as her breathing evened out. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want people to think you have some crazy mean girlfriend who yells at you after your games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d I told her. I couldn\u2019t promise her that people wouldn\u2019t think badly of her, but I\u2019d do my fucking best to try. I\u2019d fight the press for her. I\u2019d do anything to keep her feeling safe, happy, and loved. She didn\u2019t deserve to be vilified online for any reason. Hell, if the public knew anything about our relationship, they\u2019d be hunting me down daily with pitchforks and chanting. \u201cBut you have to promise me something, Cass.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d she pouted, looking up at me with those big green eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let them get to you. The press will write and post whatever they think will sell ads or get them attention. They say things all the time that aren\u2019t true, and you just have to remember what is and what isn\u2019t. OK?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d experienced how rabid the press can get when it comes to players. I\u2019d escaped the scrutiny somehow in regard to everything that happened between Chrystle and me. I always wondered if Marc had something to do with that, but I\u2019d never asked him. I watched my teammates\u2019 relationships crumble under the pressure and never once blamed them or their girlfriends for not being able to handle it. But I knew I couldn\u2019t let that happen to Cassie and me. I\u2019d make sure of it.</p><p>\u201cCass? Just try not to read anything if you can help it. Tell Melissa to filter what she sends you,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cLike only send me something if it\u2019s good?\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Kitten.\u201d I pressed my lips against her forehead. \u201cTell her to only send the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>When Life Gives You Lemons</p><p>Cassie</p><p>Not wanting to wake up Jack, I grabbed my things for work as quietly as possible and headed out our front door. Once outside the apartment building, I rushed toward the subway station, noting the time. If I missed my train, I\u2019d have to grab a cab. And grabbing a cab would take forever at this time of the morning.</p><p>I passed by a local newsstand as a headline caught my eye: \u201cWELCOME TO THE BIG APPLE, JACK CARTER! GRAB A SEAT AND STAY AWHILE!\u201d Jack had a love-hate relationship with the press. He told me once that the press only likes you when you\u2019re winning. But the second you lose, you\u2019re the first one they blame. It didn\u2019t serve any purpose for him to read the things written about him by strangers, so he never did. He always said that he knew what he needed to improve upon, and he didn\u2019t need it shoved down his throat by some reporter who had no idea what it was like to stand on that mound.</p><p>Plus, the bad articles really pissed him off, and he almost punched out a reporter once. One long-winded talk in the manager\u2019s office with the media director present, and Jack vowed to never read any more press about the team again.</p><p>Even still, seeing this paper caused my heart to swell in size. His first win for the Mets was printed in black ink, and I wanted to cherish the memory, even if he didn\u2019t. I figured since the article was positive, maybe Jack wouldn\u2019t mind. So, I purchased one copy to read and another to keep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ran down the dank subway stairs, my papers clutched firmly in my hand as my train pulled in. The brakes squealed as it came to a complete stop before the doors opened. I hustled through the crowd and into the packed subway car. Not wanting to stand the whole way, I silently thanked God for the empty seat I spotted. Once sitting, I flipped open the paper to the sports section, immediately scanning the article on Jack. After skimming the highlights, I mistakenly decided to flip to the Entertainment &amp; Arts section.</p><p>My pride-filled heart suddenly exploded inside my chest, and I almost choked on the air around me when I caught glimpse of a familiar photo. I stared at the larger-than-life picture of me pointing my finger at Jack, my face clearly twisted in anger. I looked furious as Jack simply stood there, dejection written all over his face. My eyes fell to the photo caption where my first name was posted as clear as day. \u201cMets new golden boy gets reamed by girlfriend Cassie off the field.\u201d</p><p>Shit. How\u2019d they already figure out who I am?</p><p>I snapped the paper closed and looked at the people sitting around me. I prayed they hadn\u2019t seen the picture or noticed I was the one in it.</p> <p>Shit. Shit. Shit.</p><p>That stupid picture showed up online last night and now it was printed in the newspaper for everyone to see. I reminded myself that no one actually read printed papers anymore before I realized that the online version would probably include the same articles. Shaking the embarrassment off, I fidgeted in my seat until my stop.</p><p>Walking into the office, I tossed my things down on top of my cluttered desk before heading into the small corporate kitchen. The magazine\u2019s senior editor, Nora, flipped through the pages of a newspaper before glancing up at me.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Cassie. I see you had quite the night last night.\u201d Her gray eyes softened as she held the paper up for me to see.</p><p>I released a tense breath. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s not what it looks like.\u201d I attempted to defend myself, dunking a bag of chai tea into my cup of hot water.</p> <p>She smiled, her short brown hair perfectly curled. \u201cIt never is.\u201d Her voice soothed my fraying nerves.</p><p>\u201cIt looks bad though, right? Like I\u2019m crazy angry?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back down at the photo. \u201cYou look pretty pissed off.\u201d Her gaze returned to me as I winced. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s just one photo and no one will think anything of it.\u201d She waved a hand in the air, and I wanted to believe her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Nora.\u201d I smiled, appreciative for her kind words. I turned to walk out when she called my name.</p><p>\u201cSit with me for a minute.\u201d She pointed at the chair across from her.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p> <p>My legs started to tremble as anxiety consumed me. That picture could be bad for the magazine, and I doubted they wanted to be associated with any negative publicity. What if she fired me over this?</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like I stole your cab and sit down. You\u2019re not in trouble.\u201d I relaxed into the cold chair, still clutching the hot teacup in my hand. \u201cI just wanted to hear about your first Mets game as a player\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>A small breath escaped from my lips as I relaxed even further. Nora had been kind to me since the day I started in the office. She complimented my work, encouraged me to learn, and challenged me to grow on a daily basis. I respected her, and I wanted to earn her respect in return.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was it?\u201d She cocked her head to the side, her eyes locked on to mine.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d I hesitated, \u201cdifferent than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent how?\u201d she asked, before sipping her coffee.</p><p>I glanced up at the white ceiling tiles, attempting to formulate my words into cohesive thoughts before answering. \u201cIt was amazing watching Jack play again. Nothing in the world compares to how that feels.\u201d My heart squeezed inside my chest. \u201cBut the wives on the team are really mean. Like, none of them would even speak to me, mean.\u201d</p><p>She let out a loud guffaw, her head tilting back. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cI wish I were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they wouldn\u2019t talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They just stared at me at first and then they refused to acknowledge me at all. It\u2019s like I wasn\u2019t even there.\u201d I rolled my eyes, annoyed at the fact that I\u2019d be seeing these women again later.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful. And so unnecessary. Why do we women treat one another with such disrespect?\u201d she asked as my coworkers milled in and out of the small kitchen, casting curious glances in our direction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I suddenly remembered the one bright spot in the evening. \u201cOh, yeah! One woman did talk to me. She was really nice. Her name was Trina. She\u2019s a model. Freaking gorgeous.\u201d I bit at my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cTrina Delacoy? Beautiful brown hair, bright hazel eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. How do you know her?\u201d I asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s worked with us before, very nice girl. Who is she dating on the team?\u201d she asked, bringing the ceramic mug back to her lips.</p><p>\u201cThe second baseman, Kyle Peters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you tell her I said hello.\u201d The lines around her eyes deepened with her grin.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Cassie, now that your gorgeous super jock is back in your life, you\u2019re not going to quit the magazine, are you?\u201d She smirked at me knowingly as I pinched my eyebrows together.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why on earth would I quit?\u201d The last thing I wanted to do was leave this job. While the very idea of Jack being back in my life caused my soul to beam with love, I still had career goals I wanted to achieve. I moved across the country to work for this magazine, and Jack didn\u2019t affect my feelings about that.</p><p>\u201cI was just making sure. I\u2019d hate to lose you and all that beautiful potential you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019ll have me, I\u2019m yours,\u201d I said with a nervous grin.</p><p>\u201cGood. I assume you\u2019ll be traveling with the team some, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>My breathing hitched as the question echoed in my ears. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t even thought about it, to be honest. Work is my priority, so I guess I\u2019ll go to some of the away games on the weekends if I\u2019m not busy.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s schedule hadn\u2019t even entered my mind. I\u2019d been so overjoyed at simply having him back in my life, it never occurred to me. I had no idea how long he\u2019d be in town before he turned around and left again. I made a mental note to talk about his travel schedule that night, after the game.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can schedule some magazine work in with your boy\u2019s away games. Kill two birds with one stone?\u201d she offered with a wink.</p><p>I fought back against the burn of tears forming in my eyes. I would not cry, no matter how kind and amazing this woman was to me. \u201cIf that would work out and it makes sense for the magazine, it would be amazing. But you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t. And I\u2019m not making any promises. Just bring me a copy of Jack\u2019s schedule, and I\u2019ll have my assistant look into it.\u201d Her eyes wandered, glazing over as she tapped a finger against her lips. \u201cMaybe we can work in an online feature where we travel with you, highlighting some local human-interest stories from wherever you are. Or we can highlight the team and the charities they visit when they travel?\u201d She hummed lightly. \u201cSo many possibilities. Although I\u2019m not sure how they will work since the teams are usually in and out of towns rather quickly. But something to consider nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>I listened to the thoughts and ideas that spilled from my boss\u2019s mind, quietly waiting for her to dismiss me as my own excitement grew. The idea of being able to possibly work and travel with Jack at the same time thrilled me, but I refused to get my hopes up for something that might not be feasible.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d She waved me away. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later.\u201d</p><p>I scurried out of the kitchen before flipping on my computer and scanning last night\u2019s e-mails. I smiled when I saw Melissa\u2019s name in my inbox.</p><p>Cass,</p><p>Just remember one thing... when life gives you lemons, cut \u2019em open and squeeze the juice in life\u2019s face!!!!! That\u2019ll teach life to mess with you! HA!</p><p>Hang in there. The photo will blow over. You can always call Mom and talk to her if the shit hits the fan. In the meantime, I\u2019ll monitor all the websites you guys show up on and see if I can run interference. You know, post things anonymously to try to help. I\u2019ve already favorited the local NY gossip sites so I\u2019ve got you covered, GF!</p><p>Love you. Miss you.</p><p>Melissa\u2019s mom owned a successful boutique publicity firm in Los Angeles. She maintained an exclusive group of big-name clientele, but always made sure to keep that small business feel. Inadvertently I\u2019d learned a lot from her over the years just by overhearing her business meetings and phone calls. This sort of thing was right up her alley, and I knew she\u2019d be more than happy to help me if it got to that point.</p><p>Please, dear God, don\u2019t let it get to that point.</p><p>I hit the Reply button and quickly typed out a response before handling my daily duties.</p><p>Meli,</p><p>That picture was in the paper this morning. The actual PRINTED version! And they printed my name, but just my first name, thank God. I\u2019m so freaking embarrassed, but what can I do, right?! Ugh. I will definitely call Mom if things get out of control, but I\u2019m going to work on being more aware of my surroundings from now on. Hopefully they won\u2019t have anything to print of me going forward, unless it\u2019s my face wearing a big-ass, shit-eating grin. :) Call you soon.</p><p>xoxo</p><p>My cell phone vibrated as I searched online for upcoming events our readers might be interested in seeing. The magazine printed human-interest stories, with the inclusion of local politics, news, and happenings around the five boroughs. When I started, I mostly handled the research for future issues, but once a week I was assigned a general event to cover and photograph. My bosses never promised me that my photographs would be used, but since I started working here six months ago, they always have.</p><p>I glanced at my phone, noting one new text message from Jack on the screen. My body trembled at simply seeing his name. I pressed the button, displaying the message:</p><p>Matteo will pick you up at 6. You need to go to the sales office and pick up your ID card. See you after the game. Love you.</p><p>Without responding, I set my phone aside. As I completed my work assignments, my thoughts kept drifting to my conversation with Nora from earlier, hope filling my mind.</p><p>Matteo pulled up outside the Will Call booth again, and I averted my eyes from the hint of a tattoo that crept up from underneath his white dress shirt. I wondered what it was, but I was too embarrassed to ask. I caught sight of his blue eyes watching me in the rearview mirror and smiled. He turned to exit the car when I stopped him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to open the door for me. I got it. Thank you, though. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d I scooted out of the backseat, shutting the car door behind me. Matteo waved before driving off.</p><p>I approached the booth window. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Cassie Andrews, Jack Carter\u2019s girlfriend. He said I needed to pick up an ID card?\u201d</p><p>The young girl smiled. \u201cSee that building over there?\u201d She pointed to my right, and I nodded. \u201cJust go inside and they\u2019ll take your picture and print your card for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Confused and unsure, I asked, \u201cDo I still need a ticket to get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. The ID card is so you can get down to the locker rooms at away stadiums.\u201d She handed me an envelope with one ticket inside.</p><p>\u201cAh. That makes sense. Thanks so much.\u201d I turned to leave, walking toward the other building.</p><p>My freshly printed ID card in hand, I made my way to my assigned seat. It wasn\u2019t the same seat from last night\u2019s game, but it was still in the same section. Tension galloped through my body like a racehorse as I neared the seats filled with the mean girls.</p> <p>\u201cTry not to yell at your boyfriend tonight, Cassie!\u201d A manly voice mocked me from behind and I stopped midstep.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d another voice mumbled within earshot.</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.</p><p>Resisting the urge to look over my shoulder and confront the hecklers, I straightened my shoulders and continued toward my appointed row, my heart pounding out beats in double time against my flesh.</p><p>\u201cIf poor Jack gets cussed out when he wins, imagine what she does to him when he loses!\u201d another voice bellowed, barely louder than the pounding that echoed in my ears.</p> <p>Suddenly feeling vulnerable, I quickened my pace down the concrete steps. I shuffled into my seat, recognizing the meanest wife, Kymber, right away as she watched the situation unfolding. She laughed and whispered something into the ear of the wife sitting next to her. Both women glanced at me before directing their attention elsewhere.</p><p>So, it\u2019s really going to be like this. Awesome.</p><p>My phone vibrated, and I pulled it from my pocket. Thankful to see Melissa\u2019s name on the screen, I clicked the text message button.</p><p>Put that shit-eating grin on, babe!</p><p>That was all she wrote, followed by a picture of me walking in the stadium, an uncomfortable look plastered all over my face.</p><p>I shoved my phone into my purse, feeling nervous and extremely exposed. It was one thing to be in a stadium filled with people when no one knew who you were, but it was quite another when you were recognized. I\u2019d become completely identifiable to the thousands of people around me, all of whom knew\u2014thanks to the pictures popping up online and in the press\u2014I was Jack Carter\u2019s girlfriend.</p> <p>These fans had already formed their own opinions about the picture printed in the newspaper this morning. They assumed they knew me, or knew the kind of person I was. They made judgment calls about my character based on nothing but a simple photo taken completely out of context, which, as a photographer, really pissed me off. I strived to maintain my integrity when I was shooting, making sure that my photographs and edits always captured what was truly going on in the scene. I never attempted to create a false illusion with my pictures. Apparently it was too much to ask others to do the same.</p><p>If people wanted to take pictures of me without my knowledge, they absolutely could... and they would. If they wanted to approach me, there was nothing to stop them. I lacked any sort of self-protection, and it worried me. If the other wives weren\u2019t such raging bitches, I would have asked them how they got through it. It amazed me that none of them offered to help, or asked if I was OK. I looked around for Trina, but she was nowhere to be found. And since Jack pitched last night, he wouldn\u2019t be pitching at all tonight.</p><p>I toyed with the idea of calling Matteo and going back home, but the potential fallout cemented my ass right to my seat. I imagined pictures of me leaving the game early followed by distasteful and untrue headlines.</p><p>Nope. I wasn\u2019t moving. My pride refused to let me.</p><p>My phone vibrated again and I considered not grabbing it. One reminder pulse later, I reached into my purse, pulling it out. Another text from Melissa. Did I want to see this? Resigned to whatever fate was throwing at me tonight, I clicked the Read button.</p><p>Remember: LEMONS! In. Their. Faces.</p><p>A smile crept over my face as I stifled a laugh, hearing her voice in my head. Meli was right. I inhaled a sharp breath, suddenly filled with the determination to rise above this madness. I would not let them beat me. Not the mean-spirited fans. Not the horrible wives. Not the newspapers or online sites.</p><p>I watched this game for one reason and one reason only.</p> <p>Jack. Fucking. Carter.</p><p>No one in this stadium had any idea the kind of hell Jack and I had endured in the past, and I\u2019d be damned if anyone was going to ruin this for me after all we\u2019d been through. I crossed my legs and leaned my back against the cold, hard seat, silently wishing Trina would show up soon.</p><p>Yes, I wanted to prove everyone wrong. I wanted to show them that they wouldn\u2019t tear me down and wreck this experience. But it sure would be nice to have a friend by my side while I stayed strong in the face of such intentional ugliness.</p><p>You\u2019ll be fine, Cass. You can do this.</p><p>And I did.</p><p>For nine long innings, without Trina by my side, I endured. I left my seat before the game officially ended in order to separate myself from the rowdy crowd as it exited. As I walked up the staircase, the sound of someone snorting and coughing briefly caught my attention. I continued up the stairs, but the sound of wetness hitting the pavement forced my attention downward. My gaze stopped on the blob of spit mere centimeters from my front foot.</p><p>\u201cStupid bitch,\u201d a clearly drunken voice slurred.</p><p>Without thinking, my middle finger shot up from my right hand and flashed the crowd as I exited the aisle and into the tunnels.</p><p>Shit. I probably shouldn\u2019t have done that.</p><p>The next morning infamous photos of Cassie flipping the bird photos were all over the Internet. Captions read: \u201cJack\u2019s Sweetheart is Anything But!\u201d and \u201cSassy Cassie Has Quite the Temper!\u201d They were childish and annoying, but they affected me nonetheless. Embarrassment crept over me as I found myself thankful that Jack avoided the Internet. I quickly typed out a text to Melissa.</p><p>Make sure Dean doesn\u2019t show that shit to Jack. I don\u2019t need him worrying about me or yelling at me or being upset with me over this. Please make sure you talk to him.</p><p>If anyone could curb Dean\u2019s actions, it was Melissa. I worried about him sending Jack the same type of text messages with pictures that she had been sending me. I knew better than to let the jerks know they affected me, and now I\u2019d have to pay for my stupid actions with the online postings, comments, and whatever else came along. The last thing I wanted was for Jack to be worried about me, or think I couldn\u2019t handle myself in the face of some stupid drunk hecklers, so I was determined to keep my behavior a secret from him.</p><p>My phone chirped.</p><p>You got it. Dean won\u2019t tell Jack anything about his crazy middle-finger-flipping girlfriend. LOL But hey, you gotta keep it together or these fans will eat you alive. You\u2019re better than that.</p><p>I sighed inwardly and typed.</p><p>You\u2019re right. I know. I lost my cool. It won\u2019t happen again.</p><p>I worked the rest of the day uninterrupted and only started to get nervous about the game when Matteo dropped me off at the stadium. If he knew about the pictures, he wasn\u2019t saying anything.</p><p>\u201cHave a good night, Cassie. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d His smile reached all the way to his eyes, and I shoved my nervous energy aside before smiling back.</p><p>\u201cSee you later Matteo. Thanks for the ride.\u201d I slammed the door shut, hoping no one would notice me. If the comments started already, I\u2019d probably turn around and chase Matteo\u2019s car all the way back to Manhattan.</p><p>Attending Jack\u2019s games solo all the time might start to get old. I really needed to make some friends who liked watching baseball. I guess I wouldn\u2019t want new friends so badly if the wives had been kinder. And as much as I liked Trina, it was obvious that her modeling jobs kept her from coming to most games; that sucked for me because without her there, I felt completely alone.</p><p>A few nasty comments burrowed into my eardrums as I walked out of the tunnel and into the night air. One deep, steadying breath later and my nerves started to settle. I repeated a chant in my head as I walked toward my assigned seat: Don\u2019t give them anything to talk about. Don\u2019t give them anything to talk about.</p><p>I avoided looking directly into anyone\u2019s gaze for fear that they might see through my fa\u00e7ade. I played tough on the outside, but it wouldn\u2019t take much to break me down at this point.</p><p>The game ended and I started walking toward the exit, the sound of drunk men stumbling in line behind me. A quick shove forced me to slam into the guy in front of me, my hand grabbing his shoulder for balance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I quickly offered as he shook me off. Another rough shove and I started to wonder if they were accidental.</p><p>Reaching the end of the aisle, I turned to eye the person responsible for the shoving, when moisture splashed against the back of my shirt and bare neck. The smell of beer filled my nostrils as I winced, rolling my shoulders forward away from my damp and sticky shirt.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d an oversized man said with a sarcastic gruff before heading away, laughter ripping from his lungs. I watched as his friend patted him on the back in congratulations.</p><p>I stopped moving, the crowd filing out around me as my eyes met Kymber\u2019s. She looked at my soaking back and continued walking, her eyes saying it all. She didn\u2019t care what happened to me out here. She wasn\u2019t on my side and she damn sure wasn\u2019t going to do or say anything to help me. The other wives followed behind, all of them glancing in my direction, but none of them stopping to help.</p><p>I hurried toward a concession stand, my eyes scanning for a jersey with Jack\u2019s name and number on it. I breathed out in relief when I saw it displayed against the silver fencing.</p><p>\u201cCan I get a Carter jersey in medium please?\u201d I asked.</p><p>After paying for my purchase, I rushed into the nearest bathroom. Tearing off my beer drenched top, I reached for the faucet. I placed my black top into the basin and allowed the warm water to drench it. I wrung my shirt out before filling it with more fresh water, repeating the cycle numerous times until I was satisfied that the beer smell had dissipated. Soaking the shirt with water one last time, I scrubbed my body with it the best I could. I tried to get the stickiness and stench off of my back, but it was hard to reach.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to help you?\u201d a lady around my mom\u2019s age asked from behind me. Her brown eyes looked sorrowful as I viewed her in the mirror.</p><p>I turned on my heels to face her, thankful for the kindness. \u201cPlease?\u201d I refused to let myself cry from the frustration, embarrassment, and sadness. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said, turning back toward my reflection.</p><p>I watched as she scrubbed at my exposed skin, taking extra care to not get me too wet. Once finished, she grabbed some paper towels and patted my back dry.</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d I smiled before pulling my new shirt out and slipping it over my head. I shoved my wet shirt into the bag and pulled the drawstrings tight. Glancing into the mirror, I ran my fingers through my damp hair and knew Jack would smell the beer on me if I didn\u2019t wash it out.</p><p>I twisted my head down toward the sink, allowing the warm water to penetrate the beer soaked ends of my hair. Walking over to the hand dryer, I pressed the start button. It roared to life and I placed my wet hair under the heat. Once dry, I quickly sniffed at my hair, satisfied that no one would smell the beer unless you were searching for it. I pulled out a small bottle of scented vanilla lotion and rubbed it on my arms and my neck to help mask any lingering smells. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shoving the bag that contained my damp shirt into my purse, I headed out of the bathroom and in the direction of the locker room. I prayed Jack wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that anything happened and that I\u2019d be able to hold it all in. I knew keeping this from him was probably wrong, but I convinced myself that it was in Jack\u2019s best interest. He needed to keep his mind on the field and his head in the game at all times. He wouldn\u2019t be able to do that if he knew this kind of shit occurred. And I\u2019d never be able to forgive myself if anything happened to his career because of me.</p><p>A Lot of the Guys Cheat</p><p>Jack</p><p>After the game and the team meeting, I changed, took a quick shower, and headed out of the navy blue locker room doors. I burst through, looking around for her face. The minute I locked on her tired green eyes, I knew something was off.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, as my protective instincts flared.</p><p>Her lips formed a tight smile and I eyed the Mets shirt that hugged the curves of her body. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Like my new shirt?\u201d</p><p>She turned around, lifting her hair to proudly display my last name and jersey number written on the back of the shirt. Carter 23.</p><p>\u201cLike it? I fucking love it,\u201d I answered and her face softened, but the worry lines between her eyes remained.</p><p>My mind instantly flashed back to the night she was mugged at Fullton State. She was with a group of my teammates heading toward campus to meet up with me when a guy high on drugs and alcohol assaulted them and claimed to have a gun. I was scheduled to throw out the first pitch for the softball team that night, but I left the second I heard whispers about what happened, running into Dean and Brett along the way. I remember sprinting across the parking lot as quick as my legs would move me, toward the street searching for any signs of her. When I saw her silhouette, being helped up by my buddy Cole as they walked, I nearly crumpled with pain. It was my job to protect her and keep her safe, and I failed.</p> <p>Seeing her beautiful face bruised and beaten in my mind caused my blood to start boiling. I promised her that night that I\u2019d never let anyone hurt her again, and I meant it. The thought alone could make me come completely unglued. No one could fuck with my Kitten like that ever again.</p><p>\u201cYou going to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I pressed again and she avoided my eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally it\u2019s nothing. I just want to go home. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head toward her, my lips grazing over her ear as I whispered, \u201cI know you\u2019re lying. Tell me in the car.\u201d I kissed her ear before pulling my lips away and throwing my arm around her shoulder.</p><p>I relaxed the moment she pulled her body into mine and confessed, \u201cI love you. I\u2019m so fucking happy that you\u2019re here. That we\u2019re here together. You know that, right?\u201d She smiled as the words left her lips.</p><p>God I loved that smile. I loved everything about this woman.</p> <p>\u201cI am too. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I refused to stop for any fan autographs or pictures, instead walking straight to the car, my arm around my girl. Cassie\u2019s body tensed as small flashes of light exploded around us. I was used to this, but she wasn\u2019t. I squeezed her tighter, longing to reassure whatever bothered her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Matteo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Jack. Cassie.\u201d His smile quickly faded when he said her name. He sensed it too. Something was wrong.</p><p>Once in the privacy of our car, I reached for Cassie\u2019s hand, stroking the top with my thumb. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>The car sped forward and Matteo glanced at us in the rearview.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just really tired, Jack. It\u2019s a long day when I come straight here after work, you know?\u201d</p><p>She had a point. Cass was gone in the mornings before I woke up, and we didn\u2019t get home until well after eleven.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come to all the games.\u201d I offered her a way out. Did I want her there? Of course I did. I wanted that girl everywhere I was. But maybe I was being unreasonable by asking her to come to the games when I don\u2019t even play.</p><p>Her eyes softened, and I had to touch her. I cupped her chin in my palm, her eyes closing. \u201cI want to be at your games, Jack. I\u2019ll miss plenty of them because of work. I want to watch every one that I can.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>Actually fucking sighed.</p><p>Matteo was probably thinking about what a giant pussy I was. Hell, I was thinking about what a giant pussy I was.</p><p>I changed the subject. She was avoiding my question for a reason, and I refused to push her about it in the car. I\u2019d ask her again once we were home...and alone. I handed her a manila envelope filled with paperwork.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She scrunched up her nose, and it was so goddamned cute that I instantly hardened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my travel schedule for the next three weeks.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, \u201cOh! I meant to ask you about that the other night, but I completely forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell here it is.\u201d I slid my hand up her thigh. \u201cPart of it anyway,\u201d I added before she swatted my hand away.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she whispered, her cheeks turning pink.</p><p>I loved the way I affected her. It made me even harder, and I adjusted my jeans, attempting to relieve the pressure. She flipped through the papers, pausing to read some pages more thoroughly than others. I leaned into her neck, the smell of her skin overwhelming my senses. I kissed her softly, allowing my tongue to glide up her neck as she released a slight gasp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you in the back of this car while Matteo watches if you don\u2019t stop making those noises.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped open, her eyes falling to the bulge in my pants before widening with embarrassment. \u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScreaming my name isn\u2019t going to help you,\u201d I teased, my tongue sliding around her earlobe as I sucked it in my mouth gently.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cStop.\u201d She adjusted her body, moving my face away with her hands. \u201cWait \u2019til we get home,\u201d she begged, casting a glance in Matteo\u2019s direction.</p><p>I moved my hand up her thigh again, stopping before I reached her spot. Want filled her eyes, even through her constant pleading for me to stop. I pulled away swiftly, putting my hands behind my head and leaning back into them. \u201cOK. I can wait.\u201d</p><p>Her chest heaved, her breathing uneven.</p><p>Fuck. I couldn\u2019t wait, but teasing her was worth it.</p><p>She attempted to distract herself by flicking through the paperwork again, her hands shaking. \u201cSo this is all your travel information. Flight, hotel, bus, and game times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s all there.\u201d I tried to ignore the throbbing between my legs.</p><p>\u201cI have a question.\u201d</p><p>How the hell do females just turn off the ability to be turned on? It\u2019s like they\u2019re superheroes or something. Can go from worked up to shut down in two seconds flat! Guys don\u2019t work like that.</p><p>\u201cI have an answer,\u201d I said as evenly as possible.</p><p>\u201cWho does all this for you guys? Someone has to book all your flights and coordinate all this. I\u2019d freaking die if I had to do all that administrative bullshit,\u201d she admitted, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWe have a travel secretary. Her name\u2019s Alison, and I\u2019ll give you all her contact information in case you ever need to reach her.\u201d I tilted my head to each side, cracking my neck loudly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when I want to go to an away game? Do I call her for my travel too?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo. She only books the team\u2019s travel. All the wives, girlfriends, and kids are on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez. But if I wanted to get on the same flight with you, I can, right?\u201d she asked as two worry lines appeared above the bridge of her nose.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. We have a team plane that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a team plane? Like a Mets plane?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my eyes with the back of my hand. \u201cNo. If you\u2019d let me finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish,\u201d she interrupted with a smirk, and I wanted to finish her.</p><p>\u201cWe have a commercial airline that we charter, so no one else can go on it. It\u2019s just the team, the manager, the coaches, the trainers, and the equipment guys. And we don\u2019t sit in the airport or anything either. We use a separate area so we don\u2019t have to deal with fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea all that happened. That\u2019s pretty cool for you guys. Sorta shitty for me.\u201d Her lips formed a small faked snarl. \u201cBut whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the snarl?\u201d</p><p>She huffed, \u201cWell Nora mentioned that I might be able to do some assignment shooting in conjunction with your road trips. But that\u2019s not firm or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d get to travel with me and work? I love it.\u201d The idea of having her travel with me all the time was exactly what I wanted, and I refused to hide my enthusiasm over the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited. She only mentioned it once and she also said it might not work.\u201d She cocked her head to the side before asking, \u201cDo a lot of the wives go to the away games? I mean, what about the ones with kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them don\u2019t travel with the team. I think it\u2019s just easier to stay home.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOK. So if I want to go to an away game, I have to book my own flight, and what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to get a rental car. The team travels by bus. And you\u2019d have to let me know you\u2019re coming because Alison would need to change my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange your room, how?\u201d</p><p>I shifted in my seat, uncomfortable about the information I was about to divulge. \u201cIf a wife or girlfriend comes to an away game, we get put on a different floor of the hotel than the rest of the team. Or if there\u2019s another wing to the hotel, we get moved over there.\u201d</p><p>I braced myself, wondering what was going on in that pretty little head of hers. \u201cIf a wife or girlfriend comes, you\u2019re separated from the rest of the team? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus.</p><p>\u201cBasically it\u2019s for your own good. There are things you don\u2019t want to see on the road, Kitten. And if we\u2019re not on the same floor as them, then you won\u2019t necessarily see it.\u201d I coughed into my hand. \u201cUnless you go into the hotel bar. Don\u2019t ever go into the hotel bar. Don\u2019t even look in there. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She still looked lost. I needed to spell it out for her, and I really didn\u2019t fucking want to. Not with our history. Not with our painful past. I imagined the groupies and cleat-chasers that showed up in the hotel bars every night after our games. They always knew which hotel the team stayed at and didn\u2019t hesitate to make themselves available to any player who wanted them.</p><p>I\u2019d seen things happen in those bars I wished I could erase from my memory, and I didn\u2019t want them seared into hers. I hated hurting her. I glanced toward Matteo, who clearly knew what I was about to say. He quickly shook his head, as if advising me not to tell her.</p><p>\u201cA lot of the guys cheat on their wives, Kitten. That\u2019s why we\u2019re put on another floor if we\u2019re actually with our wives or girlfriends. And that\u2019s why you avoid the hotel bar at all costs. There are things you do not want to see in there. OK?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Matteo\u2019s eyes narrowed in the mirror as he shifted his view from the road to Cassie and back again. She looked shocked, her face losing color. \u201cOh. Right.\u201d</p><p>I reached for her chin, turning her to face me as her blonde hair spilled down around my hand. \u201cThose other guys, they can cheat all they want. But I won\u2019t. I\u2019ve learned my lesson. I don\u2019t even go into the hotel bars anymore. I refuse to put myself in that position ever again. And I\u2019ll ask to be on the wives\u2019 floor every road trip if that will make you happy.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my foot against the floor mat, nervous energy running through my veins as she turned away from me. I waited for her to respond. \u201cCass?\u201d Her eyes met mine. \u201cSay something. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always have something to say. Just say it. Please talk to me,\u201d I begged. This girl brought me to my knees, and I\u2019d fall to the floor willingly for her every single time.</p><p>She swallowed before inhaling deeply, \u201cI just think it sucks. Obviously management knows that cheating goes on and by putting the wives on separate floors, it\u2019s like they condone it. I just don\u2019t understand why the integrity they demand from you guys on the field isn\u2019t demanded once you\u2019re off it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, babe. The cheating is going to happen no matter what anyone says. The wives eventually started asking to be put on different floors. They didn\u2019t want to see girls coming out of their friends\u2019 husbands\u2019 rooms.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed to a roll before coming to a stop altogether. In the height of the conversation, I\u2019d almost forgotten where we were. Matteo exited the car before I could stop him, opening our door and extending a hand to Cass. He pulled her with care from the backseat, guiding her toward the building entrance by placing his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said politely.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d I reached out for Matteo\u2019s hand and gripped it tight. He gripped it just as firmly in response, and I fought the urge to squeeze it until his bones popped. If this was some sort of pissing contest we were having, I\u2019d be the one winning. \u201cSee you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Good night and good luck.\u201d He raised an eyebrow, and I patted his back.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>We walked through the lobby, saying hello to Fred before taking the elevator up to our apartment. Once through the front door I emptied the loose change from my pockets onto the table. I sorted through it, grabbing all the quarters and removing them from the pile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, peering around the refrigerator door at me.</p><p>\u201cTaking out the quarters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhyyyy?\u201d she asked, dragging out the y sound for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d I said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cHumor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t spend quarters anymore, Kitten. They all get saved and put in that box right over there.\u201d I pointed to the box filled with quarters Fred delivered that night, sitting on the shelf.</p><p>\u201cI owe you a lot of touches, Mr. Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me. Why do you think I keep adding to the box?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and I watched her face light up before I took her smile away. \u201cNow that we\u2019re alone, will you please tell me what\u2019s wrong? I know you\u2019re tired, but something else happened tonight. What was it?\u201d She hesitated, and I sensed she didn\u2019t want to tell me. \u201cCass. Please. I\u2019m starting to go a little fucking crazy here. Did someone hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, her eyes avoiding mine. \u201cNo one hurt me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know something happened. I can see it in your face. There might not be bruises this time, but I can see it just the same.\u201d</p><p>She winced at my bringing up the mugging. We barely talked about that night, partly because they caught the guy, but mostly because it made me uncontrollably pissed off. I could barely think about that night, the way she looked and the way she trembled in my arms, without wanting to break into jail and kill that asshole with my bare hands.</p><p>I searched my memory for anything I might have said or done recently to piss her off. \u201cWhy the fuck are you making me drag it out of you like this? Just talk to me!\u201d My irritation started to build as my tone escalated.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t she just fucking talk to me? \u201cDammit, Cassie, just spit it out! Are you pissed at me? Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>My phone beeped, signaling a text message. Irritated, I grabbed it and slammed my finger against the buttons.</p><p>Cass will kill me for sending you this Jack, but you need to see it. It\u2019s from tonight\u2019s game.</p><p>Attached to my little brother\u2019s text was a picture of Cassie getting a cup of beer thrown at her back.</p><p>I Don\u2019t Need a Babysitter</p><p>Cassie</p><p>I hated that Jack instantly thought it was something he did. I didn\u2019t want to tell him about the fans. Or the wives. Or any of it, really. The last thing he needed to do was to worry about me when he was on the field. Baseball was his job, not some hobby he played for fun on the weekend. I didn\u2019t want to be the kind of girl that distracted him, and suddenly, I would do anything to avoid him seeing me as a burden. The stadium was filled with thousands of people every night. It\u2019s not like he could stop them from saying whatever they wanted to me.</p><p>Jack was growing agitated, and I needed to tell him something. I remembered the last time I kept my feelings from him back in college. That first away game episode was a complete disaster. The two cell phone pictures that girl had shown me where Jack and some brunette were walking into a hotel room looked pretty damming. I convinced myself that Jack was cheating on me while his team played in Texas, and I refused to answer his phone calls or texts until he basically lost his shit on everyone around him. Turns out the brunette from the pictures was there to see Brett, Jack\u2019s roommate for the weekend, but I\u2019d never given him a chance to tell me any of that until he returned from the road trip completely pissed off at me. Had I learned nothing from that?</p><p>His phone beeped, and I watched his demeanor change from irritation to something else entirely. \u201cKitten,\u201d his voice practically whispered as his eyes burned with a mixture of rage and sadness.</p><p>As I leaned against the cold granite countertop, I didn\u2019t know what to say. I wasn\u2019t sure where to start.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened tonight?\u201d He was instantly at my side, his lips burying themselves against my neck. I sensed his restraint. He was trying desperately to keep his calm, but my hesitation in answering his question tested his resolve.</p><p>I swallowed the lump in my throat before turning to face him. \u201cUm, your fans are mean sometimes, and the wives on the team are really bitchy.\u201d I cringed with my admission.</p><p>Jack\u2019s body tensed, his hands balling into fists. \u201cGetting beer thrown all over you is more than mean, Cass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know about the beer?\u201d</p><p>He slid his cell phone toward me. \u201cDean.\u201d I nodded, knowing that not even Melissa could have stopped Dean from sending Jack that picture.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d He asked through gritted teeth and I played dumb.</p><p>\u201cWhat else, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else has been happening during the games? And stop trying to protect me, or whatever twisted thing you think you\u2019re doing \u2019cause I\u2019m about to fucking come undone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fans heckle me sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, they heckle you? Heckle you how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple guys just said some things about the pictures that have been printed is all.\u201d I looked away from his eyes as they narrowed. I tried to make my voice sound nonchalant, like it was all blown out of proportion, but Jack didn\u2019t buy it.</p><p>\u201cWhat pictures?\u201d His voice sounded bitter and confused.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to me that Jack hadn\u2019t been alerted to any of them. Of course he hadn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like he bothered reading the press, and if Dean didn\u2019t tell him, then who else would? The team\u2019s press and public relations departments stayed out of anything that didn\u2019t have to do with the team or a player directly. Anything that only regarded me wouldn\u2019t come up.</p><p>\u201cThat picture Meli texted me the other night was printed in the newspaper the next morning. And there have been a few others since then.\u201d I purposely avoided bringing up the one of my flipping off the crowd.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, staring straight past him, my gaze focused on the wall.</p><p>\u201cAnything else that you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>My eyes refocused on his dark irises, and then I blinked them closed before the next confession. I exhaled a slow breathe, \u201cSomeone tried to spit on me last night. But that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s it?\u201d He shook his head in disbelief before throwing his hands in the air. \u201cThis is not OK. This is not fucking OK.\u201d He reached for me, his body shaking with anger as he pulled me against his chest. He wrapped his arms tightly around my waist before resting his head against mine. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep this stuff from me. I can\u2019t stop it if I don\u2019t know it\u2019s happening. You have to let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to burden you.\u201d I admitted, feeling sort of stupid once I said the words out loud.</p><p>He squeezed my body hard against his. \u201cYou are never a burden. Do you hear me?\u201d he asked, tilting my face up to his. His eyes squeezed closed before reopening. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening to you. I\u2019m so sorry, Kitten.\u201d He started pacing, pulling at his jet-black hair as guilt washed through me.</p><p>This is exactly what I didn\u2019t want to happen. For Jack to be so worried about me that he couldn\u2019t think straight. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, Jack. It\u2019s not your fault. And I\u2019m not unsafe. There\u2019s security everywhere. Please, don\u2019t do this to yourself. Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I performed my best impression of an overly confident girlfriend, but inside I was choking. The truth was, I hadn\u2019t felt entirely safe, and I wasn\u2019t sure how fine I\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about you?\u201d He laughed and huffed at the same time. \u201cThat\u2019s like asking the Chrysler Building to not be tall!\u201d</p><p>I loved Jack\u2019s passion for me, but I longed to calm him. I wanted to be the one person on this earth who could bring him peace and serenity, not agitation with my presence.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Matteo should go to the games with you,\u201d he suggested slowly, before becoming more excited as the idea sunk in. \u201cYeah,\u201d he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Matteo will go with you to the games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t ask him to do that. He\u2019s our driver, not our babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so stubborn? I would rather know you\u2019re safe and with someone like Matteo, than alone and vulnerable in a giant stadium where everyone knows exactly where you sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is ridiculous.\u201d And I didn\u2019t know why I was fighting, honestly, because it was a brilliant idea, and I already felt more settled at the very thought of someone like Matteo by my side. He was strong and intimidating, and I knew he\u2019d fight to keep me safe. I honestly believed he\u2019d do anything Jack asked him to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a fucking discussion, Kitten.\u201d He leaned in close, his breath hot on my face. \u201cI can\u2019t be on the mound, trying to concentrate on my game, when I\u2019m worried about what people are doing or saying to you up in the stands. Matteo will go with you, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d He raised both hands into the air as if I had no choice, and my defenses flared.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the end of it? What am I, twelve? I don\u2019t even get a say in what happens in my own life? I\u2019m a prisoner to your press and your fans when I\u2019m at the stadium, and now I\u2019m a prisoner at home too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Cassie, just listen to me!\u201d His voice raged and I jumped, startled by its intensity. \u201cI\u2019d do anything to keep you safe. Anything! But I can\u2019t protect you when I\u2019m down on the goddamned field!\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a short breath. \u201cAnd I promised you after that night at Fullton that I\u2019d never let anyone hurt you again. Do you remember that? Because I do. I remember every single detail about that night. You didn\u2019t see what I saw. You don\u2019t know how you looked through my eyes. I felt like my entire reason for existing was crumbling around me as the girl I loved sat there spitting up blood.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes glistened at the memory. \u201cI failed you that night, Cassie. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for not making sure you were safe and protected. That should have never happened to you. And it won\u2019t ever happen again. I promised you I\u2019d never let anyone hurt you like that. Just let me keep my fucking promise to you,\u201d he finished, exasperated as the worry lines deepened on his face.</p><p>I choked back the emotions brought on by his words and released a small sigh. \u201cOK, babe. I\u2019ll sit with Matteo.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, and the tension lines faded from between them. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s my job to protect you. It\u2019s my job to keep you safe. Let me do it or I\u2019ll fucking go insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already said OK.\u201d Jack was right, and I didn\u2019t want to fight anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou already said OK?\u201d He mimicked my voice and I glared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you said OK.\u201d He took two steps toward me, and my insides quivered as he neared.</p> <p>Without warning my back was pinned against the wall, his mouth hot and wet all over my neck. \u201cI love you,\u201d he breathed against my flesh, my legs nearly giving out. \u201cDon\u2019t argue with me about your safety again,\u201d he demanded, and I moaned in response.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Cassie. What did I tell you about those sounds?\u201d His tongue made its way toward my mouth, where I parted my lips in anticipation of him.</p><p>We were ravenous. So hungry for each other, it was if we couldn\u2019t stop from eating this meal if we wanted to.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>He sucked at my bottom lip, bringing it into his mouth before nibbling and grabbing hold of it with his teeth. I couldn\u2019t control the sounds escaping from my lips as my tongue licked and explored the inside of his mouth before he pulled back slightly.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me.\u201d His voice was hot, commanding me to obey.</p> <p>And obey I did. \u201cOf course I love you.\u201d</p><p>He forced my arms up with one of his hands and with his other, he pulled my shirt off and dropped it on the floor. His dark chocolate eyes took me in before his head dropped and he buried his face between my breasts. His fingers unclasped my bra, and the material between his lips and my skin fell away, baring me to him.</p><p>I tangled my hands in his hair as his hardness pressed against me. He grabbed my ass and lifted up. Instinctively, I wrapped my legs around his waist, grinding into him with each step he took as he walked me toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Kitten. I\u2019m going to fuck you on this floor if you don\u2019t stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, his tongue entering my mouth with new determination. He placed me on the bed before positioning himself on top of me. My hands groped his back, fingers digging into his muscles as I lifted my hips to meet his.</p><p>I traced the lines of his muscles down his arms before working my hand between our hips. I fumbled with the button on his jeans until he gently lifted up, making sure not to put all of his weight on me. I unfastened the button, unzipped the zipper, and worked his jeans down over his hard ass.</p><p>He pushed himself from the bed, standing to remove the rest of his clothing. Then he looked at me, a deep grin appearing. I lurched forward, desperate to plant kisses on each dimple when he forced me back down. He removed my pants and underwear, and I lay on top of the bed, completely exposed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. I love everything about you.\u201d He planted a kiss on top of my foot. \u201cEven when you\u2019re stubborn...\u201d His tongue glided up my shin as excitement beelined throughout every fiber of my body. \u201cAnd bossy.\u201d His lips kissed my thigh, his tongue continuing its assault. \u201cAnd a pain in my ass.\u201d His breath warmed the skin near my hip.</p> <p>He slipped a finger inside me, and I moaned with pleasure. I rocked against him, his tongue licking my lower stomach before working its way up toward my breasts. He sucked and nibbled as my back arched with pleasure. \u201cYou like that?\u201d He moaned against my skin.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d I hummed, tangling my fingers in his hair again. \u201cGet in me,\u201d I said, and he moved his hardness toward me before pulling it away. \u201cGet in,\u201d I repeated, and he inserted the tip of himself inside of me.</p><p>I gasped and shuddered at the feeling of him entering me as I pulled on him to move deeper. He gave in, and my legs spread further apart, welcoming him. He rocked in and out of me as my hips ground against him, creating that familiar building of sensation. He pushed inside me with intensity, his tongue licking, his mouth sucking wildly from my breasts to my neck and back down again. I moaned and his mouth crushed against mine, silencing my pleasure. He rocked harder, faster as I moved against him, heading toward climax.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good. You always feel so fucking good,\u201d he breathed against me, his arms flexing above me.</p><p>My hands followed the lines of his back until they landed on his ass. I squeezed, pulling him forcefully into me. \u201cOh, Jack. Just like that.\u201d I worked against him, pulling, grinding, building. He quickened his pace, our bodies moving in unison as we barreled down the same ecstasy-ridden path.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Yes, Jack. Oh my God.\u201d I gasped as my body shook and trembled with excitement. The heat rushed all through me, my body throbbing as Jack worked himself into a frenzy.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Cassie. You\u2019re so fucking hot.\u201d His mouth sucked at my breasts, taking them into his mouth between his teeth. I grabbed his hair, pulling at it lightly as I moved my body with his. He hardened even more inside me, still working in and out as he pushed in deep one last time. Grunting loudly, he exploded inside of me, pulsating with each small thrust.</p><p>He pulled out slowly before collapsing next to me. \u201cGo pee. I know you have to.\u201d I swatted his shoulder before hustling from the bed into our bathroom.</p><p>A moment later, I joined him back in bed, pressing my head against his chest as he wrapped an arm around me. \u201cWhile we\u2019re on the subject of safety...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not on the subject of safety,\u201d I teased before continuing, \u201canymore.\u201d</p><p>His chest rose up and down sharply, my head moving with it. \u201cI think we should look into getting a new place. Not that this isn\u2019t great, but I think we can afford something a little bigger with a full-time doorman.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t fight the fact that I\u2019d been thinking the exact same thing. And I would feel much more secure having a full-time doorman instead of a part-time one only at night. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could look somewhere closer to Central Park if you wanted.\u201d My insides fluttered to life at his suggestion. I adored Central Park and wanted to live near it initially, but couldn\u2019t afford a place on my own. At least not where I looked. Before I answered, he added, \u201cI know it\u2019s farther from your office\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that much farther,\u201d I interrupted, lifting my head from his chest. \u201cI mean, it is, but I don\u2019t care. I love Central Park, especially the area near the Plaza Hotel. How\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned like a mischievous Cheshire cat. \u201cYour pictures online for the magazine.\u201d</p><p>I remembered the photos I\u2019d taken of the park and its surroundings when I first moved here. \u201cOh, right. Back when you were stalking me.\u201d</p><p>Without any real effort, he pounced, twisting and turning my body at his whim. I was on my back before I could even think. \u201cYeah. When I was stalking you, Brat,\u201d he said, sitting on me. \u201cYou took a picture of that fountain and that really pretty hotel. Or at least your pictures made it look pretty.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, trying to push him off me, but my moves were useless against him. \u201cThat\u2019s the Plaza Hotel. It doesn\u2019t need me to make it look pretty. It\u2019s amazing, and I\u2019m quite sure I\u2019m in love with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t seen any of that stuff, you know?\u201d He pinned my arms above my head before inching his face closer to mine. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad host.\u201d His lips brushed against my lips, softly at first before he deepened the kiss. Emotions and heat swirled inside me.</p><p>Thank God I was already lying down because my knees would have buckled completely the instant he started that kiss. I struggled to remember what we were talking about before he erased all my thoughts. \u201cHost? I\u2019m not a guy, and you\u2019re not my visitor. You live here now.\u201d</p><p>A gorgeous dimple flashed on each cheek. \u201cTrue. But I still think you should show me around. I have Thursday off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t. I have to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo call in sick,\u201d he suggested, and my temper started simmering. \u201cIt\u2019s my only day off this month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling in sick!\u201d I shoved at him, and he relented. Sliding his body from mine, I pushed up from the bed into a sitting position. \u201cWait. Is Thursday really your only day off this whole month? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>His head cocked to the side, sympathy glimmering in his eyes. \u201cWe only get two days off a month, Kitten. And they\u2019re usually travel days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d I said, my shock taking over. \u201cI mean, I knew you were gone half the month for games, but I guess I never realized that you didn\u2019t have any real days off.\u201d Jack\u2019s baseball schedule wasn\u2019t his fault. It\u2019s not like he controlled it. It was one more thing to adjust to in our new life together.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot. But listen.\u201d He reached for my hands. \u201cI have Thursday off. I would love to go look at new places if we have time, and I want you to show me some of your favorite spots in the city. OK? Maybe you can take a half day?\u201d His thumb caressed my hand. As if sensing my hesitation, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll make this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s fine.\u201d I attempted to mask my concern.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. What\u2019s wrong? What are you worried about? Is it the other girls?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. At least, not right this second.\u201d I faked a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s just that we\u2019ll barely see each other for the next few months?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou could always quit your job and come with me. Then we\u2019d never be apart.\u201d He smirked as my stomach dropped and my pulse quickened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You know I hate when you say shit like that,\u201d I warned as heat rushed to my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAh, Kitten. I\u2019m just messing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t,\u201d I snapped, my tone harsh and laced with bitterness. This wasn\u2019t the first time Jack had mentioned me not working. I flashed back to meeting Gran and Gramps for the first time when he\u2019d said the same thing. \u201cNot with my job, OK? It\u2019s important to me. I want to work. And if that means we don\u2019t get to be together that often during your season, then,\u201d I shrugged again, \u201cI guess we won\u2019t be together that often.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just want you to be happy,\u201d he admitted sweetly but it was too late. Jack picked the one topic that forced me to react in such a vicious way that I wanted to reach across the bed and rip his heart out. My defenses crawled into every crevice of my body, spreading its barbed wire protective coating all around.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t ask me to quit again. Not even in a joking way. It tears me up inside.\u201d My work was the one thing I had that was all for me. It wasn\u2019t about Jack. It wasn\u2019t about us. It wasn\u2019t about anyone or anything else. \u201cPhotography is my passion, Jack. It owns pieces of my soul, my guts, everything inside of me. My entire being comes alive whenever I stand behind that lens shooting, and I worked really hard to get to this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have. And I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he backpedaled. \u201cI just meant that I\u2019ll miss you. I want you with me all the time. I hate traveling, and I\u2019ll just wish you were there. But we\u2019ll never have that as long as you\u2019re working.\u201d</p><p>I whipped my head in his direction, my gaze glaring. \u201cI can\u2019t not work, Jack. Don\u2019t you get that? How can you, of all people, not get that?\u201d</p><p>I learned a long time ago that no one was going to do things for me. If I had a dream I wanted to reach, I had to claw my way toward it and grab it on my own. I wouldn\u2019t give up what I\u2019d worked so hard to achieve. I wouldn\u2019t let anyone take it from me. Jack, of all people, had to be able to relate. He worked just as hard as I did to get the things he wanted. Both of us had been let down by the few people in the world you\u2019re supposed to trust implicitly. All the unfulfilled promises from my dad ran through my mind, but the constant disappointment I\u2019d felt growing up paled in comparison to both of Jack\u2019s parents choosing to leave him.</p> <p>\u201cI do get that. What the hell are you talking about?\u201d He tugged at his hair.</p><p>\u201cIf I stopped taking pictures and stopped working, I\u2019d be lost. I wouldn\u2019t know who I was without it,\u201d I admitted, the very thought causing my insides to feel pitted and empty.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I\u2019m going to feel when my baseball career is over?\u201d He sat up straight and faced me.</p><p>\u201cBut you said once that you\u2019d give it up. For me! How could you say that?\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine giving up that part of myself for anyone. Not even Jack.</p><p>\u201cBecause, goddammit, it\u2019s the truth! I\u2019m going to be a fucking mess without this sport. I don\u2019t know who I am without baseball, and it\u2019s going to take me some time to figure it all out when that day comes. But I\u2019ll be able to do it as long as I have you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, disbelief running amuck through me. \u201cListen to me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cOne day baseball will end. It\u2019s a fact. And that day is going to be one of the worst days of my life. But if I have to go through the end of my career without you?\u201d He huffed. \u201cThen you might as well just put me out to pasture like one of those old fucking cows. Because there is no me without you. Jack Carter does not exist as a full person without Cassie Andrews.\u201d</p> <p>My chest heaved as I fought back the hot tears that threatened to pour from my eyes as he continued. \u201cWithout you, I\u2019d be a shell of a man. A hollowed-out, empty, lifeless carcass. And I know that because I\u2019ve been there. I lived through it. I lived through losing you due to my own stupidity, and I can never explain to you what that felt like.\u201d</p><p>I allowed my tears to fall, but I couldn\u2019t say anything yet.</p><p>\u201cCass, I don\u2019t want you to stop working. I don\u2019t want you to give up anything for me. But I need you to know that I\u2019ve learned from losing you. I know how bad it feels to not have you in my life, and I never want to experience that again.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my life without you, Jack,\u201d I wholeheartedly admitted. \u201cEven when we were apart, I always hoped that we\u2019d find our way back to each other. But I don\u2019t like feeling pressured to choose between you or my job. It\u2019s not fair, and it\u2019s a decision I don\u2019t want to have to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I won\u2019t win?\u201d he asked, his voice soft but firm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answered honestly. \u201cBut I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re fighting already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fighting. We\u2019re just figuring things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p> <p>I Won\u2019t Let Anything Happen to Her</p><p>Jack</p><p>I knew what Kitten meant last night, even if she didn\u2019t. She felt like choosing between her job or her heart was like being asked to literally choose me over herself. I wanted to blame her, but I couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t know what it was like. Not really. To live without the one person you knew you were meant for. I\u2019d experienced the pain of being forced to live without her while I had achieved my biggest dream.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Having baseball but no Cassie didn\u2019t make me happy. I was pretty sure it was the same for her with photography and no me; she simply hadn\u2019t realized it yet. She hadn\u2019t really been forced to. At least not from the perspective I had been. I fucked up. I lost her. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re the one who made the mistakes.</p><p>I tried not to wake Cassie as I dialed the office where Matteo worked. I purposely woke up before her alarm was set to go off to handle this.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Lombardi. It\u2019s Jack Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Carter. Is everything working out with Matteo?\u201d His accent echoed through the phone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m calling about actually.\u201d I attempted to explain before he interjected.</p><p>\u201cIf Matteo\u2019s not working out, we have plenty of other drivers.\u201d</p><p>I released an irritated breath. \u201cNo, Mr. Lombardi, Matteo\u2019s fine. I wanted to see about booking him longer on the days I have home games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, how much longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need him to stay at the field from the time he drops Cassie off until we leave.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell this guy my reasons for needing Matteo to stay. I wanted to keep that business as private as possible. \u201cSo, that\u2019s probably an extra four or five hours. Is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many days a week do you have home games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have about thirteen home games a month, with usually six or seven of them in a row.\u201d</p><p>I heard scribbling and the sound of papers being shuffled on the other end of the line. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because if it is, I\u2019ll need to look into other options.\u201d I needed a straight answer with no bullshit. If this guy wouldn\u2019t give me Matteo\u2019s time, I\u2019d take Matteo from him and hire him exclusively. Or find someone else to do the job.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just make sure you give Matteo a copy of your schedule so we can write him off in the books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Can you have Matteo call me when he checks in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I clicked the phone off before breathing out a sigh of relief. I\u2019d half expected more of a battle for Matteo\u2019s time. I appreciated it didn\u2019t come to that. Now I needed to talk to Matteo. I needed someone who wanted to watch out for her, and he needed to be able to put Cassie\u2019s safety above his own. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t like the idea of his pretty little model face being put at risk. I guess I\u2019d find out.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re up early.\u201d I turned around to see Cassie standing in the doorway, watching me. She looked so beautiful standing there that I couldn\u2019t resist her. I eagerly walked toward her, wrapping her up in my arms, and squeezed. I kissed her neck, breathing in the smell of her skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about last night.\u201d She tilted her head up to look at me. \u201cI think I just get really defensive when it comes to my job.\u201d</p><p>I looked into her green eyes, pushing the hair back from her face and tucking it behind her ear. \u201cI know. It\u2019s OK. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate fighting with you.\u201d Her lips jutted out in a pout, and I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI told you we weren\u2019t fighting. We\u2019re just figuring things out, OK?\u201d I leaned down, planting a kiss on her cheek. \u201cSo listen, I talked to Matteo\u2019s boss this morning, and he\u2019s fine with him staying for the games. I\u2019m going to meet with Matteo later today to make sure he can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She released a breath. \u201cHandle it how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to make sure he\u2019s up for it. I\u2019m not going to ask him to do this for us if he isn\u2019t comfortable doing it. He does have a choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how nice for him,\u201d she said, her voice laced with bitterness.</p><p>I dropped my hands. \u201cAm I doing something wrong, Cass? I\u2019m just trying to make sure you\u2019re safe and protected when I\u2019m not around. Is that not OK with you?\u201d</p><p>This girl is driving me fucking crazy.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She paused before looking at the floor. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry, Jack. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d Her eyes closed as she dropped her face into her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not used to anyone looking out for me the way you do. It\u2019s a bit of an adjustment for me is all. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Please don\u2019t fight me on this. I won\u2019t be able to concentrate on the field if I think people are harassing you or being mean or hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She nodded her head in agreement before swallowing. \u201cI\u2019ll try to be less crazy. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not crazy.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd I love you too.\u201d I kissed her lips before she pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI need to get ready for work.\u201d Her face softened.</p><p>\u201cGo then. Stop wasting time fake fighting with me.\u201d I smacked her ass, and she yelped.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>Half tempted to chase her ass right into the bathroom, the sound of my phone ringing distracted me. \u201cHey, Matteo,\u201d I said into the phone, after seeing his name and number appear on my screen.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Jack. Mr. Lombardi said you wanted to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is there any way we could meet a little bit later to go over some stuff? I\u2019ll pay you for your time, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on one sec.\u201d The phone sounded like it got tossed onto a desk. \u201cI have a couple clients this morning, but I\u2019m free around eleven. Is that too late?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s perfect.

See you then.\u201d</p><p>I pressed End, dropping my phone on the small counter before walking into the bathroom. I peered around the shower curtain at Cassie and became instantly aroused.</p> <p>Down, boy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having lunch with Matteo at Sal\u2019s. I\u2019ll text you afterward to let you know how it goes, OK?\u201d</p><p>She turned her body to face me, embarrassment spreading pink across her cheeks. \u201cGreat. Now get out of here before you make me late for work. I know what you\u2019re thinking, Carter.\u201d</p><p>I loved it when she called me by my last name. Her voice always sounded extra sassy, and it turned me on even more.</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me? Fuck, woman, look at you. Sexy as hell,\u201d I teased, knowing I was making her uncomfortable. But she looked beautiful all naked and wet, and now all I could think about were the things I wanted to do to her.</p> <p>She pressed her lips tightly against each other. \u201c\u2019Kay. Get out now. Bye. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I walked into Sal\u2019s, the smell of pizza making my stomach growl.</p><p>\u201cHey! Jack! Good to see you!\u201d Sal stood in the kitchen area, waving at me through a pass-through window. \u201cAnd hey, nice game the other night.\u201d His boisterous voice reverberated throughout the small building.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what can I get ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wait until Matteo shows up, and then we\u2019ll order something,\u201d I said, before sitting down at one of the tables.</p> <p>\u201cMatteo\u2019s coming? Ha! I haven\u2019t seen that little shit in weeks!\u201d He flung some pizza dough into the air before catching it on his fist and spinning it wildly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not really that little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cSo, how\u2019s he working out for you and Cassie? Everything good?\u201d He eyed me while pressing down on the dough, creating the perfect thin crust.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good so far. Thanks again for the recommendation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, no problem.\u201d He waved a hand at me as the bells on the door chimed. Matteo walked into the pizzeria, a huge smile spread across his face.</p><p>\u201cMatteo! Why don\u2019t you come visit me? You don\u2019t like my food?\u201d Sal teased before coming out from the kitchen to greet his cousin.</p><p>I watched the two men embrace and realized in that moment how much I missed my little brother, Dean. I wished he was done with school so I could move him out here, but he probably wouldn\u2019t leave Gran and Gramps. Dean was always the better grandkid.</p><p>\u201cAh, you know I love your food. I\u2019ve just been busy.\u201d Matteo nodded in my direction.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard. Busy\u2019s good.\u201d Sal slapped Matteo on the back. \u201cYou two let me know what you want to order, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just take a slice, Sal.\u201d I hesitated, patting my rumbling stomach. \u201cBetter make it two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Matteo said, following my lead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just make you guys a whole pie. It\u2019s not like the two of you won\u2019t finish it.\u201d Sal laughed before walking back into the kitchen.</p><p>I smiled, waving Matteo over to sit with me. Once he was close enough, I reached out my hand. A quick, firm handshake later and Matteo was seated across from me. \u201cSo, I need to talk to you about something,\u201d I started, leaning my elbows on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mr. Lombardi mentioned that you want me to keep the car there during the games, is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s a bit more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I pushed back into my chair, thinking about how to word it right. \u201cSome fans were heckling Cassie last night at the game. And I guess the other wives are really mean and don\u2019t do anything to help. The press is taking pictures of her and posting them online. I would really appreciate it if you would take her to the games and sit with her so she\u2019s not alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you want me to drive her to the field and then stay for the game with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But I also need you to watch out for her. And if anyone fucks with her, I need you to be OK with handling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it comes to that, yeah.\u201d Matteo shifted in his seat, and I added, \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to talk to you. If you\u2019re not comfortable doing this, I\u2019ll find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was uncomfortable,\u201d he responded in a sharp tone that caused my defenses to flare.</p><p>\u201cWell, I figured I\u2019d ask you because you\u2019re obviously strong, and I assume people find you intimidating.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI actually don\u2019t have a problem with it at all. I just need to know my boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I jerked my head toward him as my muscles tensed.</p><p>He better not be talking about his boundaries with Cass. I\u2019ll beat his ass right here in his cousin\u2019s restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI just mean, what exactly do you want from me? If someone heckles her, do you want to me to knock his teeth out, get him to shut up, or do nothing?\u201d</p><p>This was my idea and I hated it already. The thought of someone else defending my girlfriend was agonizing. I should have been the one protecting her, but I was willingly handing that job over to another guy. A guy who looked like a fucking magazine model.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should cause a scene unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Don\u2019t overreact, \u2019cause that will only lead to more bad press.\u201d He nodded as I continued. \u201cI basically don\u2019t want Cassie to be alone at the games anymore. I figured she\u2019d make friends with the other women on the team, but since that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen... I need to make other arrangements for her safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all this is fine with you? I need you to be sure,\u201d I asked, waiting to sense any hesitation on his end.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I smiled, happy we\u2019d come to an understanding. \u201cListen, that girl is my world, and I can\u2019t stand the thought of anyone hurting her. I\u2019d handle this myself if I could play the game and be by her side at the same time, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me to start tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cleared my schedule already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I appreciate you watching out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to her. I promise.\u201d His expression turned serious, his mouth narrowing into a thin, tight line, and I believed him.</p><p>He Can Drive Me Anytime</p><p>Cassie</p><p>Matteo arrived at my office promptly at six, just like Jack texted he would. He waited for me downstairs with the car while I finished up some last-minute photo editing. Tonight\u2019s game would be the first game he\u2019d attend with me, and I was nervous. Not to be alone with Matteo, but because now I\u2019d be photographed with some guy who wasn\u2019t Jack.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like Matteo wasn\u2019t a good-looking guy. He was downright gorgeous. I started wondering if this was a good idea after all. Were we unintentionally giving everyone more ammunition against me?</p><p>I sighed before heading down in the elevator, the stress of the situation starting to gnaw at me. I hated the things I had to think about now before I even walked out the door. All the added drama affected my ability to be happy. I was too concerned with everything around me to simply sit back and enjoy Jack\u2019s time on the field.</p><p>I hated this.</p><p>I spotted Matteo the moment I exited the elevator. He smiled, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile back in response.</p><p>\u201cI get to be your date tonight,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>Date?</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d I said, silently berating myself for agreeing with that word choice.</p><p>I walked toward the car, and when Matteo pulled open the back door, I declined, opening up the passenger door instead. \u201cI hate sitting back there while you drive me around. It\u2019s dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded before sliding in and closing the door behind me.</p><p>I fastened my seat belt as Matteo scooted into the driver\u2019s seat, starting the sleek Town Car with a flick of his wrist. \u201cThis should be fun, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. Honestly I think it might create more drama at first, but hopefully that will die down in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore drama how? Because I\u2019m going with you?\u201d</p><p>I wondered how exactly to phrase what I meant. Matteo was stupid hot, but I wasn\u2019t about to tell him that. \u201cMatteo, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re ugly. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to cause some sort of chaos.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and I noticed a hint of color creeping into his cheeks. \u201cYou think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I choked back. \u201cI said I think you\u2019re not ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI think you\u2019re not ugly either.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of how to respond, I flashed a quick, tight-lipped smile instead. The last thing I wanted was to make things uncomfortable between us, so I dropped the subject altogether and reached for my phone. I typed out a quick text message to Melissa before gazing out of the car window at the city whizzing by in a blur.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me what I\u2019m in for tonight,\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, well, we have the chatty fans and the mean wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh. Tell me about the wives.\u201d He glanced at me before returning his focus to the highway.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just really nasty. They won\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do to them?\u201d he asked with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I pursed my lips together before swatting his shoulder with my hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to them except join their stupid team with my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d he exclaimed, his voice animated and I laughed. \u201cSo do they just completely ignore you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cPretty much. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not even there.\u201d</p><p>His lips formed a slight snarl. \u201cYou women are rather mean to one another. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking the wrong girl. I\u2019m not one of those women. Unless you\u2019re mean to me first; then I\u2019m a bitch. But really, you asked for it, so you can\u2019t blame me,\u201d I smiled innocently.</p><p>\u201cWell, this oughta be fun.\u201d</p><p>We pulled into the parking lot at the stadium, and I nervously looked around. People swarmed all around our car, but no one paid attention to who was in it. I glanced at Matteo before opening my door and sliding out.</p><p>He exited and stood next to the door, not moving.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He glanced down at his work attire and then back at me. \u201cI need to change my clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t even think about that, but good idea.\u201d</p><p>I turned my back to the car as he scooted into the backseat to change. I thanked him in my head for being smart enough to bring a change of clothes. He would have looked ridiculous wearing slacks and a tie at the ball field. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked from behind me, and I jumped. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d I turned to look at him and wanted to scream. Nothing this guy wore covered up his good looks. \u201cYou look so different,\u201d I said, noting his jeans and long-sleeved white shirt that hugged the muscles in his shoulders and arms perfectly. The ink from his tattoo showed a little more now, although I still had no idea what it was.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He arched an eyebrow. \u201cI think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you in jeans. You look cute.\u201d</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cI just mean, you look nice in jeans. It\u2019s a different look from your dress slacks.\u201d I fumbled, trying to make my statement mean nothing, but clearly making it worse.</p><p>I picked up our tickets at the window, and we headed in. My nerves should have calmed with Matteo by my side, but they were heightened. Heads turned in our direction when we passed by. His good looks called attention to us, and that was the last thing I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for this?\u201d I asked before we headed out of the tunnel and down the aisle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cassie. I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed my apprehension and stepped into the light of the outdoors and the rush of the crowd. I walked down the steps, inching toward our row of seats as Matteo followed right behind. My heart raced as I braced for hateful words or taunting that never came. I released a breath before pointing to our seats.</p><p>I noticed all the mean wives staring at Matteo, their jaws agape at the sight of him. I sat down and faced them, suddenly filled with confidence. I pasted an obviously fake smile on my face and said, \u201cClose your mouths, ladies. You look ridiculous,\u201d before turning my back to them.</p><p>They gasped and whispered to each other, and I decided not to give a shit. At least not for tonight.</p><p>\u201cThat was awesome.\u201d Matteo leaned toward me, whispering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I just signed my death warrant with the baseball wives, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>I looked around the stadium and down toward the dugout for any signs of Jack. I hated when he didn\u2019t pitch. It wasn\u2019t as much fun watching the game when he wasn\u2019t playing. And the bullpen for the pitchers couldn\u2019t have been any further away from where our seats were. The way the bullpen was situated, I rarely even caught sight of him.</p> <p>Someone cleared her throat, forcing me to look up. \u201cTrina. Where were you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, girl, I had to work. Who is this?\u201d She extended a tanned hand toward Matteo as she eyed me curiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Matteo. I\u2019m Jack and Cassie\u2019s friend. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d He paused, clearly enamored with the beautiful woman. \u201cTrina, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s nice to meet you as well.\u201d Everything she said sounded prettier with her accent. \u201cMay I sit next to you, Cassie?\u201d she asked before tossing her purse in the seat to my left.</p><p>\u201cLike you have to ask. Please sit your bony ass down next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said all the wives were mean?\u201d Matteo\u2019s voice flirted as Trina leaned over me.</p><p>\u201cThey are. They\u2019re horribly mean. Everyone except for me,\u201d Trina said, her cleavage on full display beneath her sand-colored V-neck blouse.</p><p>My phone beeped and I reached for it, noting a text message from Melissa.</p> <p>Who is that hot piece of ass sitting with you?</p><p>She\u2019d attached a picture of Matteo leaning toward me. I typed back:</p><p>That\u2019s Matteo. He\u2019s our driver.</p><p>Holy hell. He can drive me anytime he wants!!!</p><p>Her response made me laugh out loud. Matteo peered over my shoulder at the text message. \u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, I hid my screen and shoved my phone into my purse. \u201cMy best friend, Melissa. She\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Trina asked softly. \u201cWhat I miss last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just some fans giving me shit. And the wives sitting here doing nothing while it all happened. I hated that you weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the paper.\u201d She frowned, an expression that looked unnatural on her face.</p><p>\u201cHas that ever happened to you?\u201d I hated the way hope coursed through me, but I desperately needed someone to relate to how my mind raced and my pride hurt.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She placed her hand over her heart. \u201cBut I\u2019m already in the public eye a lot for work, so it\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to it. I\u2019ve dealt with this kind of shoddy stuff for years. I feel bad for you because I know how uncomfortable it feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s the perfect word for it.\u201d I looked between Matteo and Trina. \u201cIt\u2019s so freaking uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand on top of mine. \u201cI know. And I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it, but you\u2019ll be OK. Don\u2019t let them get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying. It\u2019s a lot easier when you\u2019re here,\u201d I said meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cHey! What am I, chopped liver?\u201d Matteo interjected.</p><p>I answered \u201cyes\u201d as Trina answered \u201cno\u201d at the same time.</p><p>Cheers filled the stadium as the sound of a bat cracking echoed into the night air. I snapped my head toward the field in time to see the small white ball fly over the wall in center field and into the stands. The crowd screamed and hooted wildly, and the three of us clapped and high-fived each other like we\u2019d just hit the ball.</p><p>\u201cI miss a lot of the games for work. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Trina shouted above the noise.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of... apparently you know my boss, Nora? She loves you and said to tell you hello.\u201d</p><p>Trina\u2019s face lit up at the mention of Nora\u2019s name. \u201cNo way! I love Nora. She\u2019s your boss? You are one lucky girl. She\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She\u2019s really great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the magazine you work for! That\u2019s smashing, Cassie. Truly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, reaching out to pat her shoulder.</p><p>Trina\u2019s cell phone vibrated against the seat before she picked it up and looked at the screen. \u201cOh, excuse me. I need to take this.\u201d</p><p>I watched as she climbed over the row and into the aisle behind us before walking out of view.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Matteo said.</p><p>\u201cI know. And she\u2019s so nice. Her accent kills me. I want her to call me every night and read me a bedtime story,\u201d I said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI want in on that deal. Except I don\u2019t want it to be on the phone.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked defensively.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just typical, Matteo. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I hated typical, which is why I attempted to steer clear of Jack in the first place back in college. I\u2019d labeled him as the most predictable kind there was. I had been wrong.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, she\u2019s a beautiful girl. I\u2019d have to be blind to not be attracted to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you know if it doesn\u2019t work out with her and her boyfriend.\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d He nudged my shoulder teasingly, and I looked back toward the field.</p><p>Trina never came back, and Matteo and I spent the rest of the game making idle chitchat and wondering where Trina disappeared to. I realized that having him there made me less concerned with my surroundings, and who violated my space.</p><p>When the game ended, I stretched and almost lost my balance. Matteo\u2019s strong arm grabbed my back, holding me steadily in place. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said, before moving away from his grip.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t let you get hurt or Jack will kill me.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, unable to disagree when, amid the chaos of people shuffling around, I heard someone shout, \u201cReplace Jack already, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in disgust. I wanted to yell back, \u201cIf I\u2019d replaced him, then why the hell would I be at his game?\u201d But I didn\u2019t. I hated not defending myself. I convinced myself that I discouraged the heckling by staying silent.</p><p>Matteo tensed behind me, his body closing the space between us defensively. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d he whispered into my ear, and I jumped.</p><p>I swatted near my ear. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Just making sure you\u2019re OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re gonna insult me, they could at least be creative about it.\u201d I tried to smile, but disgust twisted my lips instead.</p><p>He followed close behind me until we reached the private entrance to the clubhouse. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait for Jack down here. We\u2019ll meet you at the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019ll see you at the car.\u201d He nodded before walking away.</p><p>I rounded the last corner when I spotted Trina sitting on a bench. \u201cHey,\u201d I shouted toward her, hearing my voice echo off the walls.</p><p>She stood up and walked toward me. \u201cSorry about that. I got stuck on a bunch of phone calls, and now I have to leave for Brazil in the morning for some big photo shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s insane, but I get it.\u201d I shrugged, understanding all too well the last-minute trips and how unplanned work can come up suddenly. I hadn\u2019t experienced it yet firsthand, but watched my coworkers handle it without complaint.</p><p>\u201cKyle won\u2019t be happy.\u201d She frowned, and I half smiled sympathetically. \u201cHe hates it when I\u2019m gone. I think he secretly wishes I\u2019d stop modeling and pop out some kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you do that?\u201d I asked, remembering the argument Jack and I had last night.</p><p>\u201cOne day, yeah. But not right now.\u201d She let out a deep sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s hard though, trying to balance working and being there for Kyle. He\u2019s on the road so often and he needs so many little things taken care of. I feel awful that I\u2019m not around to handle it, but not awful enough to give up my career for him.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, letting her know that I understood everything she said, but I didn\u2019t want to get into it any deeper at that moment. There was a time and place for that discussion, and it wasn\u2019t right then. At least not for me.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a horribly selfish person?\u201d She closed her eyes tightly, as if she didn\u2019t want to see just how selfish she might be.</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d I touched her shoulder and her eyes reopened. \u201cWhy do we have to give up our careers for theirs? I mean, why is it one or the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s really hard to work and have a relationship at the same time. Neither one of us is in a typical sort of job, really.\u201d She cast a glance toward the mean girls. \u201cNone of them work anymore. I heard that Kymber gave up some huge career to be a wife and mom,\u201d she lowered her voice, \u201cI think that\u2019s probably part of the reason why she\u2019s so ugly to us. She\u2019s full of resentment.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be like that.\u201d</p><p>Trina laughed. \u201cYou won\u2019t, Cassie. No matter what happens in your life, you\u2019d never treat people the way she does.\u201d</p><p>The door opened with a loud bang and Jack walked out, a cautious smile on his face. \u201cHey, Trina. Kitten.\u201d He planted a kiss on my cheek and pulled me away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Jack,\u201d Trina smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wait.\u201d I stopped abruptly. \u201cCan we exchange numbers?

He tossed his muscular arm around my waist and pulled me tight, our hips pressing against each other with each step.</p> <p>\u201cHow was everything tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter actually,\u201d I admitted, knowing that I\u2019d been far less stressed with Matteo around.</p><p>\u201cAnyone give you any shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me and kissed the top of my head. \u201cSo it was a good idea then, right?\u201d he asked as we headed toward the dark car where Matteo waited, once again wearing his work attire.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was?\u201d I smiled playfully, thankful for the times my mind allowed the past to fade into the distance.</p><p>\u201cHaving Matteo go with you to the games. Admit it was a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head on his shoulder. \u201cIt was a good idea. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Two Bedroom on the Twenty-Third Floor</p><p>Jack</p><p>Cassie couldn\u2019t take the day off, but she promised to meet me for lunch. Unsure of what to do with my rare few hours of freedom, I went online and searched for available rentals near the Plaza Hotel. I printed out a list of places on both the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side. I didn\u2019t know the difference between the two, but Cassie would.</p> <p>After calling a few of the numbers, I set up an appointment to view a place on the East Side after she got off work. I looked over my baseball schedule for the next three weeks, paying close attention to all the days I wouldn\u2019t be here. The team traveled for an eleven-day road trip soon, and I wondered if Cass would be able to make it to any of the away games.</p><p>I knew it was a shitty thing for me to think, but it sort of sucked that Cassie worked full time. It meant that we\u2019d never be together when I played on the road. And I was going to be gone an average of seventeen days each month. That\u2019s a long time to go without seeing your girl.</p><p>I\u2019d never admit that to her though, and I knew that wanting her around me all the time was selfish. Especially after everything I\u2019d put her through. She\u2019d moved to New York to follow her own dreams, and I wanted to be supportive.</p><p>Aside from my own pride-filled bullshit, I honestly hated the idea of her being here alone. The press and the fans stressed me out, and I needed to know she was protected when I wasn\u2019t around. We needed to move somewhere with a round-the-clock doorman sooner rather than later\u2014and before I lost my damn mind.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll buy her a dog? I\u2019ve always wanted a dog. Jesus, Carter, is anything not about you?</p><p>Pulling on my ball cap, I walked out of the apartment building and toward the subway station. The cool breeze whipped across my face, and the sunshine was so bright I almost turned back for my sunglasses. Cassie texted me directions to the restaurant where we were meeting for lunch since I had no fucking idea where I was headed or what I was doing. I was half tempted to call Matteo and have him drive me, but I knew Cass would ream my ass for not getting the \u201cNew York City experience,\u201d as she liked to call it. Plus, I needed to learn my way around.</p><p>I followed the stairs underground, stopping at the first vacant vending machine I could find. I pushed a ten dollar bill into the slot, and a blue-and-yellow Metro Card popped out. Glancing around, I watched as people slid their cards into the electronic readers before walking through the turnstiles. Memories of visiting Disneyland as a kid flashed through my mind as I slid my card through. The light turned green and the turnstile unlocked with a click.</p><p>I pushed through it, feeling like a fucking lost tourist and hoping no one would recognize me. Walking down another set of stairs, I reached the subway platform.</p> <p>What a trip.</p><p>The lighting was dimmer and the air damper down here. A guy at the far end of the platform banged on some drums and the sound traveled up and down the station. The idea of having my back unguarded didn\u2019t sit well with me, so I pressed against the wall and waited for my train to arrive.</p><p>The brakes squealed as the subway pulled in, the driver\u2019s voice fading in and out. When the doors opened, I waited for everyone to exit before I jumped inside. Virtually empty, I had my choice of seats. I grabbed the seat closest to the doors. Two stops later, I hopped out and headed up the set of stairs; the sunlight practically blinded me so I averted my eyes to the ground.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you that super-hot baseball player?\u201d Her voice stopped me in my tracks, and I looked up to see those familiar green eyes staring right through me.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the smoking hot girlfriend of said baseball player?\u201d I licked my lips and her mouth fell open. I loved fucking with her.</p><p>Cassie dropped her sunglasses over her eyes and pulled me away from the subway exit. \u201cCome on.\u201d She giggled, and I wanted to make out with her like some lovestruck teenager in the back of a movie theatre.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were meeting at the caf\u00e9?\u201d I reached down for her hand, interlocking her fingers with mine.</p><p>\u201cNora gave me the afternoon off. She wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, so I\u2019m all yours, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably knew I\u2019d get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She smiled. Her lips were so tempting I wanted to suck them into my mouth and never let them go. \u201cSo how was your first subway ride?\u201d</p><p>Shaking the visual from my mind and willing my dick to calm down, I refocused my thoughts. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut amazing, right? I mean all the different people from so many walks of life gathered in one place together. I freaking love the train stations.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head with a huff. \u201cYou would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d She swatted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt just means that you see the beauty in everything. Even the ugly, dark, disgusting subway stations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think they\u2019re cool. A little scary sometimes, but still cool.\u201d</p><p>Cassie pointed to the red-and-white checked awning up ahead. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta be honest, Kitten. I feel like we\u2019re betraying Sal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she whined. \u201cWe\u2019re not, I promise. This place isn\u2019t even Italian. It\u2019s French.\u201d</p><p>I stepped ahead of her to open the restaurant door when a woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cOh my God, are you Jack Carter?\u201d</p><p>I turned to face the woman as Cassie stopped midstep.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you ARE Jack Carter! I\u2019m a big fan. You\u2019re an amazing pitcher. Can I get a picture with you, please?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Cassie and saw her lips form a tight-lipped smile. So I pulled her close to me and put a polite but firm smile on my face as I told the woman, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m about to go eat with my girl. Some other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease! Just one picture? Or an autograph? Can you sign something for me then?\u201d I watched as she buried her hands into her oversized purse, searching for God knows what.</p><p>\u201cPlease understand, I\u2019m just trying to have some personal time right now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I turned my back to the overzealous fan and held the door open for Cassie.</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe,\u201d I said, stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. Why didn\u2019t you just give her what she wanted?\u201d</p><p>The hostess smiled but didn\u2019t interrupt us. Instead she grabbed two menus and waved us toward the back of the small caf\u00e9 as we followed her lead. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>I pulled Cassie\u2019s chair out for her before sitting down across the table and removing my cap.</p><p>\u201cYour waitress will be with you shortly,\u201d the petite brunette said before she bounced away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you didn\u2019t want to?\u201d Cassie leaned forward, her hair flopping in front of her eyes as I swept it away with my fingers.</p><p>I sucked in a breath. I hadn\u2019t told her any of this yet, this part of my master plan, but I guessed now was as good a time as ever. \u201cI\u2019m trying to limit my contact with them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to limit your contact with whom? Your fans?\u201d</p><p>I leaned across the table. \u201cJust the female ones.\u201d</p><p>There. I admit it.</p><p>I wanted to limit my contact with my female fans whether I was on or off the field. I never wanted to give them or the press anything to talk about, write about, or post about.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment before meeting my stare. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore your fans. It\u2019s mean and they\u2019ll end up hating you.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back against the hard chair and shrugged. \u201cIf I\u2019m mean to them, they\u2019ll leave me alone. And if they leave me alone, they won\u2019t have anything to say. And if they don\u2019t have anything to say, then you\u2019ll never have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying? You\u2019re OK with me talking to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m OK with you talking to them. I just don\u2019t want you to sleep with them.\u201d A slight laugh escaped her lips. \u201cOr make out with them or do anything with them.\u201d</p><p>I reached over, taking her hand in mine. \u201cI won\u2019t ever make that mistake again. I\u2019ll prove it to you every day for the rest of our lives. I wanted to ignore them for you, so you could see I\u2019m trustworthy and not be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go to those extremes for me. It\u2019s not right. And the trust part will just come in time. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I agreed, bringing her hand to my lips.</p><p>When we were done eating, I settled our bill with the waitress and waited for her to bring me back the change. She approached our table, a weird look on her face.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your change,\u201d she said, handing me the soft leather bill holder. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really sorry, but there\u2019s a crowd outside waiting for you to leave.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Cassie as the surprise flashed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t let them come in, obviously. But they know you\u2019re here. We\u2019re really sorry.\u201d The waitress stared at her feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I tried to reassure her before looking back at Cass. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded and looked at our waitress. \u201cHow\u2019d they know we were here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone posted it on that Spotted website.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this website where people can put where they spotted a celebrity or an athlete. Someone posted that you two were eating lunch here.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head back slowly. \u201cGotcha. Thanks.\u201d I pushed my chair back before stretching. Running my fingers through my hair, I grabbed my cap and placed it firmly on my head.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d I asked Cass, reaching my hand out for her to grab. She stood slowly, peering outside.</p><p>She exhaled. \u201cOK, there\u2019s not that many people outside. There\u2019s like ten.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to want me to sign stuff. Do you mind or do you want me to blow them off?\u201d I\u2019d do whatever the hell she wanted me to.</p><p>\u201cOf course you should sign stuff.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I gripped her hand, leading her toward the door. I pushed it open, holding it for her to walk through before following behind. The sound of my name filled the air around us as people crowded to get close, shoving their camera phones toward us. Instinctively, I wanted to protect Cassie from the rushing bodies, but I ended up only tightening my grip on her.</p><p>\u201cOw, Jack.\u201d She winced, pulling her hand from mine and shaking it.</p> <p>\u201cShit. Sorry, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cJack, how about a picture?\u201d A woman shouted above everyone else. I\u2019d have to have been blind to not notice her good looks.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, remembering Cassie\u2019s words.</p><p>Reluctantly I posed, keeping my hands to myself, but this chick draped herself all over me like a cheap fucking suit. Disgusted, I removed her hands from my body. \u201cNo more pictures, but I\u2019ll sign whatever you want,\u201d I announced to the group, frowning at the one who\u2019d just ruined pictures for the rest of them. Forcing a big smile on my face, I signed papers, taxi receipts, and a couple of baseballs.</p> <p>\u201cCassie, Cassie honey. Look this way.\u201d My attention turned to the long-haired, greasy-looking guy with a professional camera taking pictures of Kitten while she waited for me to finish. I watched as she reacted to the sound of her name, which clearly caught her off guard, and she searched the crowd for the one calling out to her.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone,\u201d I shouted in his direction, and he glared at me. He fucking glared at me, aimed the camera back toward Cass, and clicked the button. I imagined jumping over everyone and breaking that camera across the side of his fucking skull.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty when you smile, Cassie. Won\u2019t you smile for the camera? Who was with you at the game last night? Cassie? Did you and Jack make up? Why were you mad at him?\u201d The dirtbag was relentless.</p><p>\u201cI said leave her alone,\u201d I threatened, my patience fading.</p><p>Cassie suddenly appeared at my side, whispering in my ear, \u201cThat guy\u2019s creeping me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go,\u201d I whispered back. \u201cI have to go. Sorry.\u201d I made my way through the crowd, which had grown in number since I started. I pushed lightly through the people, signing a few scraps of paper on the way, never letting go of Cassie\u2019s hand.</p> <p>We walked down the sidewalk and I glanced back, noticing the guy still taking shots of us, following our every move. \u201cThat guy\u2019s following us. He must be paparazzi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he called out my name,\u201d she paused, \u201cthat freaked me out. And all those questions. It\u2019s weird when people know about your life like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Come on, let\u2019s get a cab.\u201d I stopped walking and the guy did too.</p><p>That\u2019s right, asshole. Keep your distance.</p><p>\u201cI got this.\u201d She winked at me before stepping out onto the edge of the busy street.</p><p>She looked sexy as hell hailing down a cab, her hip jutted out as she waved her arm. The cab pulled up like a speeding train before slamming on the brakes and we hopped in.</p><p>\u201cIs he following us?\u201d Cassie asked softly.</p><p>I glanced back. \u201cNope. I think he knows I\u2019ll deck him,\u201d I said with a laugh, and she kissed my cheek.</p> <p>When the cabbie stopped in front of a gold-trimmed apartment building with a uniformed guy standing outside the revolving door, I smiled, my comfort level growing already.</p><p>This is what I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>I helped Cass out of the cab, and we walked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the doorman asked.</p><p>Good. He asks what you\u2019re doing here before you go in. I like that.</p><p>\u201cWe have an appointment with Ruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good day,\u201d he nodded, allowing us to enter.</p><p>A middle-aged woman greeted us the moment we walked in. Her voice was so raspy it sounded as if she smoked twenty packs a day. \u201cI\u2019m Ruth. You must be Jack and Cassie. It\u2019s nice to meet you. We happen to have a vacant two-bedroom apartment on the twenty-third floor that I want to show you. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>I turned to Cassie. \u201cTwenty-third floor? It\u2019s my number, babe. That\u2019s a sign.\u201d</p><p>Baseball players are nothing if not superstitious.</p><p>Cassie smiled, following Ruth into the elevator that flew us to the twenty-third floor in no time. Ruth led us down the hall, unlocked the door, and waved us in. \u201cI\u2019ll just be over here, so you kids take your time looking around.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>This place was gorgeous. I knew Kitten was already sold by the look on her face. \u201cCan we afford this?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe can. Easily. It\u2019s not as much as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>I could see why. Cassie started on about granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances, and squealed when she walked into the master bathroom. I didn\u2019t know half the shit she was talking about, but the smile on her face was priceless. I\u2019d take out a fucking loan to live here if I had to.</p><p>\u201cI think we can fit ten apartments the size of yours in here,\u201d I teased, before walking onto the balcony. The city rushed by down below, and the buildings provided the perfect landscape. I bet Kitten would love to photograph things from up here.</p><p>\u201cA balcony? Heaven. I\u2019m in heaven.\u201d Her face crinkled with delight.</p><p>\u201cI wanna do bad things to you on this balcony, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShocking,\u201d she said as she rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo you like it?\u201d I asked, grabbing her by the waist and pulling her to me. Before she could answer, I pressed my lips against hers, feeling her body go limp in my arms. I pulled away from her slowly, letting the kiss linger before finishing it with a peck against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s seriously gorgeous, Jack. I think I could live here forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s a little further from Central Park than you wanted?\u201d I asked just to be sure, already knowing what her answer would be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect. And the park isn\u2019t that far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sold then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even see the master bedroom. Or the guest room. Did you even look around?\u201d She ran her fingers through my hair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to. If you like it, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d I stepped inside and shouted toward the open front door. \u201cRuth.\u201d She peered around the door frame and smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it. What do we have to do?\u201d</p><p>Getting Caught</p><p>Cassie</p><p>Jack talked Ruth into letting us move in as soon as possible, saying he wanted to know I\u2019d be safe while he was on the road for eleven days. The move kept my brain occupied, so instead of focusing on the fact that Jack would be gone for so long, I thought about packing instead. It stopped me from my small freak-outs about Jack and cheating. I didn\u2019t want to worry about him doing that, but sometimes you can\u2019t help the way you feel.</p><p>We spent the following week packing up our small apartment, and I stayed away from the field when Jack wasn\u2019t pitching to have more time to get everything in order. I realized that I didn\u2019t like staying home when Jack\u2019s team played a home game. I thought I\u2019d feel differently because Jack wasn\u2019t pitching, but I didn\u2019t. I wanted to be where he was, whether he was playing or not.</p><p>But being away from the field also meant that there were no pictures of me online and that small reprieve brought a sense of normalcy back into my life I\u2019d almost forgotten. It\u2019s amazing how quickly we adapt to things in our lives when we believe we don\u2019t have a choice in the matter.</p><p>I closed the top of a box, taping it shut as Jack walked through the front door. I smiled, jumping to my feet to greet him. I wrapped my arms around his neck and nuzzled against his warm skin. \u201cHi, babe. How was the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it when you\u2019re not there,\u201d he admitted, and a part of me melted with his words.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d I closed my eyes, breathing in the smell of him.</p><p>\u201cAnd we lost.\u201d His tone turned grumpy and annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down, giving me a quick peck on the mouth before walking into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m hungry, Kitten, and everything\u2019s packed.\u201d He opened and closed our cupboards.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s pasta in the fridge that I made for dinner. Just needs to be heated up.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward the refrigerator and opened the door. \u201cOh, here,\u201d he said, reaching into his back pocket. He pulled out a folded-up piece of paper and tossed it at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the detailed travel itinerary for the next few games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I unfolded it. \u201cIs this my copy or do I need to write this all down somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all yours. I have mine in my locker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I scanned the paper looking for his flight time. I breathed out with relief when it read six p.m. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that your flight isn\u2019t until six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s only about two and half hours to Miami from here so we lucked out.\u201d He flashed a quick dimpled grin before the microwave beeped, signaling his food was ready.</p><p>I nodded and scanned the bare living room. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it could look any smaller in here, but it actually does. Which really makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur new place is going to feel like a palace to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may never leave our bathroom,\u201d I teased and he raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m talking about because you didn\u2019t even look at it. Just wait until you see it!\u201d</p><p>I started getting really excited. Our new apartment looked amazing, and I couldn\u2019t wait to begin living there. \u201cMatteo knows we\u2019re moving, right? You told him?\u201d</p><p>He nodded before swallowing a mouthful of food. \u201cI told him. He knows exactly where it is.\u201d</p><p>I started going through the checklist in my head. Utilities changed over and turned on, old apartment cleaned, movers booked, house packed, and address updated online and with the post office. \u201cKitten?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice broke through my overly organized brain.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear a word I said?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cSorry. What\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked if you thought about coming to any of the away games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask you if I could come to the Chicago series.\u201d I plopped down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cAsk me? Kitten, you can come to every fucking game if you want. You don\u2019t have to ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never been to Chicago.\u201d I smiled, picturing Cloud Gate, the famous stainless-steel bean-shaped sculpture that people always talked about. I wanted to photograph that bean.</p><p>The couch dipped as Jack sat next to me. \u201cAlright, but listen. Chicago is a really big city that sometimes isn\u2019t safe. Since you\u2019ll be alone, I don\u2019t think you should take the El around town. Just take cabs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe L?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chicago\u2019s train system, which I\u2019m sure is fine but I\u2019ll lose my shit thinking about you riding around on it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take the trains in New York alone all the time. It can\u2019t be that different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not. But I\u2019d feel better if you just took cabs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK. I\u2019ll take cabs.\u201d I agreed before feeling small nerves tingle up and down my spine. I needed to get used to traveling to strange places alone. Not only was it a part of dating Jack, but it was a part of my future career as well. My job assignments were almost always guaranteed to be in unfamiliar territory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Kitten. And as much as I want you there, now I\u2019m freaking out at the idea of you being there alone.\u201d His eyebrows pulled together.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be alone. I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot really. I\u2019ll be at the field most of the time. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a day I\u2019m even around for lunch. We\u2019re gone before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d I understood now why the wives didn\u2019t go to the away games.</p> <p>Jack\u2019s shoulders squared as he faced me. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot of alone time. You don\u2019t have to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to. I should at least see what it\u2019s like, right? Maybe I\u2019ll like having time to explore,\u201d I offered, unsure of whom I was trying to convince, me or him.</p><p>The tension on his face remained. \u201cMaybe we should fly Matteo out so you aren\u2019t alone?\u201d</p><p>I jerked my head back in surprise. \u201cNo! We\u2019re not bringing Matteo! Are you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop thinking like that. I don\u2019t want Matteo to go everywhere I go.\u201d I imagined the field day the local press would have with that.</p> <p>Jack reached over, grabbing my hand in his. \u201cI worry about you is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but at some point you need to let me be a big girl and take care of myself. I was perfectly fine here before you came, you know.\u201d His expression fell, and I knew I\u2019d hurt him. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I meant it. I just meant that I didn\u2019t need a babysitter before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t being hounded by the press or fans before either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d I admitted, my stomach fluttering with the thought.</p><p>\u201cI know you think I\u2019m crazy, Kitten, but I can\u2019t function if I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d He lowered his head, and a horrible feeling crept over me. I hated being the source of his pain.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy, but I hate that I cause you so much stress.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes turned to my face. \u201cYou don\u2019t cause me stress. I cause me stress because I can\u2019t relax when it comes to you. Because I love you so damn much.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to respond. Jack made me fully aware that I was his number one priority in life, and I\u2019d never experienced that feeling before. I stared at him, allowing my own feelings for him to circulate throughout every ounce of my body. Feeling heavy with my own emotions, I longed to lighten the mood.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it matter what time I land on Friday?\u201d</p><p>He brought my hand to his lips and kissed across my knuckles. \u201cEven if you book a flight that gets in when I do, I\u2019m not allowed to ride with you to the hotel. So don\u2019t worry about trying to coordinate your flight with mine or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll just fly out after work then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you might miss the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t. We have summer Fridays in the office now so we get to leave early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are summer Fridays?\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThis whole freaking city goes to the Hamptons on the summer weekends. So everyone gets off early on Friday so they can drive up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you imagine if we did that shit in LA? What would we have, Malibu Fridays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeach house Fridays!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>Jack smiled and tilted his head. \u201cYou\u2019re so adorable. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>His words pierced like an arrow into my lungs, causing me to catch my breath. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time do the movers get here tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d I looked around one last time. \u201cI got everything, right?\u201d</p><p>Jack turned his head in all directions, scanning our tiny living space. \u201cLooks like it to me. You did good, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d My cheeks warmed with his compliment as his hand cupped my face.</p><p>\u201cWe should leave this place with a bang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d I sucked at my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI think you know.\u201d He pushed off from the couch before slipping his hands under me and lifting me up. \u201cI think I have two quarters in my pocket.\u201d His tongue swept across my lips as he carried me into our tiny bedroom one last time.</p><p>We moved into our new apartment the following morning, and Jack was on a flight that evening. But not before building our new bed frame, two sets of bookshelves, and a new dresser. He promised he\u2019d put together everything so I wouldn\u2019t have to.</p><p>I adored the man he was becoming for me.</p><p>For us.</p><p>Chicago Friday finally rolled around, and I landed at Midway airport around four. Jack\u2019s game at Wrigley didn\u2019t start until seven thirty, but he was already at the field. I hopped a cab to the hotel like Jack insisted and watched the city come into view. Even through the backseat window, I sensed the difference between this city and New York. I assumed they\u2019d be similar, but they weren\u2019t.</p><p>Both cities had numerous tall buildings, but that was pretty much where their similarities ended. While New York appeared dirty and lived in, Chicago was spotless and trash free, newer maybe. And where New York buzzed with constant energy, Chicago exuded more of a gentle hum.</p><p>I checked in at the hotel on the bank of the Chicago River and ordered room service while I killed time before the game. I looked out the window at the water down below and the city that surrounded me. Chicago had a style all its own, and I smiled as I thought about capturing it with my camera. I\u2019d have plenty of time for that tomorrow.</p><p>When I arrived at the stadium, I almost spent the entire evening staring at the WRIGLEY FIELD, HOME OF THE CHICAGO CUBS sign. It was such a classic piece of baseball memorabilia that I found myself awed by it. I took a few shots of the aged red-and-white sign, loving everything about it, before picking up my lone ticket waiting for me at guest relations. I passed through the dark entrance, lost in the excitement of a new-to-me stadium.</p><p>Once inside, I wandered alone, going the wrong direction at first before turning around. I wondered if any of the mean girls would be here. Aside from Trina, there wasn\u2019t anyone I wanted to see. Three text messages later, and I found out Trina was still out of the country on her job. I scanned the row of green seats searching for mine. I dropped into my chair before looking around. I found myself surrounded by a few pretty, college-aged girls, but no one that looked familiar. My shoulders relaxed at the absence of any mean girls. I didn\u2019t realize how stressed out they made me feel until they weren\u2019t around.</p><p>Without the distraction of the usual fans or the mean wives, I concentrated completely on watching Jack play. The way he focused always impressed me. He seemed like another person entirely when he stood on that mound of dirt. He blocked out every sound, every shout, every yell, and zoned in one hundred percent on the batter standing sixty feet away.</p><p>And when he gave up a hit, he gathered his composure and refocused his energy, unlike some of the other pitchers who became completely rattled when someone got a hit off them. In a game in which your state of mind could make or break you, Jack had the ability to keep it together. His temper off the field never translated on it. Jack always moved forward, putting the last play behind him and focused on the next one.</p><p>His passion and sheer respect for the game he loved only made me love him more. I admired the way Jack played ball. It showed a lot of internal character to pitch the way he did. He was focused, determined, and played with a full heart. How can you not love that?</p><p>When the game ended, I asked three different security guards for directions to the visiting team\u2019s locker room. With my ID card in hand, I wandered underground and waited for Jack to emerge. It was odd being the only person waiting. Players started to walk out of the locker room, each one flashing me a quick smile before walking away. I wondered if they even knew who I was. I hadn\u2019t really met any of the players since Jack, and I didn\u2019t spend time with them socially.</p><p>Trina\u2019s boyfriend Kyle walked out, and I smiled. \u201cHey, Cass. Jack\u2019s on his way out,\u201d he said, before giving me a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Tell Trina I miss her.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI sure will. See you later.\u201d He waved as he walked down the corridor out of view.</p><p>Jack walked out moments later, his hair still wet from the shower. I wrapped my arms around him and squeezed. \u201cGreat game, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he whispered before kissing my lips.</p><p>He led me outside where the team bus rumbled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to take a cab back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine. I should be able to ride with you instead of sending you off alone at eleven o\u2019clock on a Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d I tried to reassure him, but I sensed that he was uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait with you until you get a cab.\u201d He grabbed my hand and walked me toward the busy street.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Jack. I don\u2019t want you to get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf the team isn\u2019t even out of the locker room yet. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Hailing a cab took longer than I anticipated. It was a Friday night and the majority of the taxis driving past me were already filled with passengers. I started to worry that Jack would have to leave me alone when an empty cab came our way and Jack hailed it.</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby.\u201d I craned my neck up to give him a kiss before hopping inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the hotel,\u201d he said before shutting my door for me.</p><p>I arrived before the team bus, so I stepped inside the grand lobby and waited. I almost headed into the bar when Jack\u2019s warning coursed through my mind.</p><p>Don\u2019t look in there, Cass. Jack told you not to look.</p><p>But the team\u2019s not even here yet. What could I possibly see?</p><p>I argued with myself mentally before caving and turning my head to peer inside the bar area. I spotted the three college girls who were sitting near me during the game. One of the girls waved her hand in my direction as if recognizing me from earlier, and I quickly averted my eyes.</p><p>Holy shit. Those girls were sitting in the player ticket section?</p><p>The team barreled into the hotel lobby, making a loud scene as they entered. I scanned the burly men, searching for Jack. Kymber\u2019s husband passed by me without a glance, and I watched as he turned into the bar.</p><p>No fucking way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I observed the scene unfolding like a car crash before my eyes. I couldn\u2019t look away if I tried. He sauntered into the bar as one of the blonde girls hopped up from her stool and into his arms. She giggled as he gripped her ass, giving it a couple of smacks, much to her delight. She wrapped her legs around his waist, planting kisses all over his lying, cheating, rat-bastard face. Two more players, both married, entered the bar and a similar scene unfolded. I wanted to puke.</p><p>My jaw dropped wide open as all the feelings of Jack cheating on me poured into my bloodstream. My stomach churned, threatening to empty its contents all over the shiny tile floor. Jack suddenly appeared in front of me, his expression grim. \u201cI told you not to look in the bar, Kitten. I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d I shook my head, still shocked at the blatant display of infidelity and my own hellish flashbacks.</p><p>Jack grabbed my arm and led me toward the elevator. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said no bar. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re on a different floor than they are. So you don\u2019t have to see that shit. Come on.\u201d</p> <p>I stumbled as I tried to keep pace with Jack, who was clearly desperate to remove me from the area. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they act that way in public. Aren\u2019t they worried about getting caught?\u201d</p><p>Jack eyed me. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this here. Wait until we\u2019re in our room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I sighed.</p> <p>Stepping out of the elevator, we walked down the long corridor toward our room. I ran my fingers across the wallpaper as Jack pressed the card key into the slot. With two clicks, he pushed on the door, holding it for me to enter before he followed. He lay down on top of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t worried about getting caught because everyone already knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell me that Kymber the bitch knows her husband is a cheating piece of shit?\u201d I asked, my tone clearly reflecting my disbelief.</p><p>He huffed. \u201cNot in so many words, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she knows he\u2019s cheating on her, and what? She just doesn\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t fathom how anyone in their right mind wouldn\u2019t care about being betrayed in that way. What kind of relationship was that anyway?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if she really knows, but I know she suspects it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t care enough to find out for sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably doesn\u2019t really want to know the answer. The reality is that a lot of these guys cheat on their wives, Kitten. It\u2019s a really shitty fact, but it\u2019s the truth. And yeah, the wives usually know, but they just pretend it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike they\u2019re in denial?\u201d I shook my head, still trying to comprehend it all. I thought about Kymber and her crew of mean girls, and felt sorry for them.</p><p>\u201cEither that or they just pretend it\u2019s not happening because they like their lives.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, refusing to believe such craziness. \u201cNo way. All the material things they get are more important to them than being respected, or treated well, or truly loved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really easy to get accustomed to a certain lifestyle. And they\u2019d rather not give it up.\u201d He tousled his dark hair before pressing his head against the wall.</p><p>That entire concept seemed foreign to me. I wondered what caused a person to convince themselves that the trade-off was worth it. Who needed self-esteem and self-worth when you had big diamonds and expensive clothes? \u201cWell, don\u2019t you get any ideas, Mr. Carter, because that kind of crap will never fly with me.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes started to mist, my heart aching with the realization that he already did do that to me. The whole cheating, my knowing about it, basically accepting it, and welcoming him back with open arms. It all happened.</p><p>\u201cKitten, I would never do to you what they\u2019re doing to their wives. I think they\u2019re assholes. Especially the guys with kids.\u201d He patted the bed. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I moved to lie down next to him, and he wrapped his arm around my shoulder. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t like those other women. And I wouldn\u2019t like you if you were.\u201d His lips pressed against the side of my head. \u201cI made a mistake before, but it won\u2019t happen again. I know you\u2019d leave me forever if I did and I can\u2019t...\u201d he paused, \u201cI won\u2019t lose you again.\u201d</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t She Be Hotter?</p><p>Cassie</p><p>Jack and I fell into a comfortable routine over the next six weeks. Matteo accompanied me to every home game, and the heckling basically stopped. Until Jack garnered his first lost for the team, that is. That night I was forced to hear a few choice things about how much \u201cJack sucked\u201d and how I needed to \u201cget his head on straight.\u201d The hard-core fans were rabid. When you won, they loved you so fiercely you could do no wrong. But the moment you lost, they stepped all over you on their way out the door.</p><p>We talked on the phone constantly when he traveled. He wanted me to come to as many away games as I could, but it wasn\u2019t as fun as I thought it would be. I spent most of my time wandering alone in a strange city or eating by myself in restaurants. From the outside, it seems so glamorous to be the girlfriend of a major leaguer, but it\u2019s mostly sort of lonely. Not to mention the fact that seeing the other players constantly cheat on their wives made me sick to my stomach.</p><p>I had small bouts of insecurity every now and then, but I did my best to keep my fears in check. Jack tried his best as well, staying on the phone with me until all hours of the night, opting for room service instead of going out with the guys, no matter how many times I told him not to.</p><p>Baseball kept Jack gone for literally half of each month. The most consecutive number of days he\u2019d been home at one time was seven.</p><p>Seven.</p><p>Trust was a tricky thing. At times, it seemed like a living, breathing entity that I shaped, built, and conformed to fit my needs in that moment. And other times, it moved like an uncontrollable emotion that ebbed and flowed like the tides in the ocean. One day I\u2019d be perfectly fine and the next I\u2019d be a wreck, convinced that Jack was no better than his teammates.</p><p>I wished our relationship were easier, but we were a work in progress. The hardest part was being OK with that. I had a choice when Jack first came back. I didn\u2019t have to let him through my front door, but I wanted to. I needed to move forward and believe that he wouldn\u2019t hurt me again. My heart longed to accept his actions and take a leap of faith, but my head refused to give in.</p><p>Stupid head.</p><p>Jack being on the road didn\u2019t mean that the online posts about us stopped. They didn\u2019t. And no matter how hard I tried to convince myself not to read them, I usually couldn\u2019t resist. My own curiosity killed me. I\u2019d read the things written about me or Jack and I\u2019d swear I\u2019d never read them again because they caused me so much anguish. It became a vicious self-deprecating cycle, and I needed to work on my willpower.</p><p>And Melissa, bless her heart, didn\u2019t always help matters. She kept tabs on every site that posted about me or Jack, and even though she claimed to not share them all with me, it seemed like she alerted me to a new post every day. I was exhausted simply hearing about it all.</p><p>Determined to stay focused on work and not the press, I scanned the Internet at my desk, searching through old photographs and news clippings for another photographer\u2019s research. An e-mail alert from Matteo popped up on my screen.</p><p>Want to grab lunch today? I have no clients and Jack\u2019s still out of town.</p><p>I almost typed back \u201cYes,\u201d but stopped myself. I enjoyed Matteo\u2019s company, and we\u2019d become really good friends, but I knew what would happen. Someone would see us together and take our picture. That picture would be plastered all over the Internet within minutes and most likely printed in the paper the next day with some false headline and trumped-up story from an \u201canonymous source.\u201d</p><p>I hated feeling like I couldn\u2019t go anywhere with anyone when Jack was out of town, but all it took was one headline that screamed \u201cWhile Jack\u2019s Away, Cassie Will Play\u201d to stop me. The headline was printed above a picture of me and Matteo laughing over dinner and resulted in a number of Internet accusations, not to mention my needing to reassure Jack that absolutely nothing fishy was going on between Matteo and me.</p><p>That was a nightmare I had no intention of repeating. I quickly typed a response back to Matteo\u2019s e-mail:</p><p>Working on a project. Sorry. See you when Jack gets home.</p><p>Hopefully my last line made it clear that I wouldn\u2019t make plans with him until Jack was back in town.</p><p>I worked straight through lunch and by the time I left the office, I was famished. After sweating through the humidity on the non-air-conditioned train ride home, I decided to stop at a caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Cassie. You want to order something to go?\u201d the short round man asked. I\u2019d only been here a handful of times, but Roman always remembered me and greeted me by name.</p><p>\u201cActually, Roman, I think I\u2019ll eat here tonight.\u201d I smiled as he pressed his hands together with delight.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead and sit anywhere you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I looked around at the empty tables before choosing one in the far corner near the window. Roman appeared at my table, an iced tea in hand.</p><p>\u201cYou need to see the menu?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just get your famous East Side sandwich and fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, pretty lady!\u201d He grinned and it stretched across his whole face, forcing me to smile back in return.</p><p>I rested my back against the wooden chair and watched the people dash by. New York was such a busy city all the time. Day or night, snow or sun, people always rushed around.</p><p>My phone vibrated against my hip pocket. Pulling it out, I read the text message from Melissa.</p><p>Cute top.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I looked around anxiously with the sudden wish that she were here for a visit and simply hiding from me. I typed out a response:</p><p>What are you talking about?</p><p>You\u2019re on that Spotted website again. Spotted: Jack Carter\u2019s girlfriend dining alone near her apartment in Sutton Place.</p><p>Immediately, I was lightheaded.</p><p>You\u2019re joking.</p><p>Before I typed anything else, my phone beeped again. Melissa sent a screenshot of the website to my phone, complete with a picture of me staring out of the window I was actually looking out of.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>I grabbed my purse, dropping more than enough cash on the table to cover the bill, and looked around for Roman. \u201cRoman, can I get it to go? I need to get home. Something came up. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Cassie. No problem. Tell Jack I said hello.\u201d He transferred my food from the plate he carried into a box before handing it to me.</p><p>\u201cI will. I left the money on the table. Thank you.\u201d I smiled before rushing out the door.</p><p>I looked over my shoulder the entire walk back to my apartment. I couldn\u2019t get there fast enough. Every step reminded me how exposed my life had become. From behind my sunglasses, I glanced at the passersby, wondering if the cell phones they held were actually being used to help splash my life across computer screens all over the country. Every tourist with a camera now seemed a potential accomplice in my media hazing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once inside the safety and security of our apartment building, I allowed myself to crumple.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK, Miss Andrews?\u201d the doorman asked, his big bushy moustache bouncing as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Antonio. I\u2019m just a little freaked out by all the online posts and stuff. They can\u2019t come in here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. They can\u2019t come in here.\u201d He straightened his back. \u201cI won\u2019t let them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I muttered, averting my gaze outside, thankful that no one stood gawking or staring.</p><p>Insisting that my every step was tracked, I\u2019d become paranoid. The press, the fans, the pictures; it never seemed to stop. There was little reprieve. Little sanctuary. I tried to pretend it didn\u2019t matter, but the constant pressure was getting to me. Pieces of me were being chipped away at daily. Why was I up for public consumption? I wasn\u2019t even the celebrity in the relationship.</p><p>I called Melissa from the elevator as soon as the doors closed. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d she answered instead of saying hello.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m freaking out. How the hell does this whole town know who I am? And more importantly, why do they care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re Jack\u2019s girlfriend. And he\u2019s the number one pitcher for the team right now. You know how people get with stuff like this. They\u2019re obsessed with celebrities\u2019 personal lives.\u201d</p> <p>I exhaled, unlocking my apartment door and walking inside. \u201cBut I can\u2019t even get dinner without someone posting it online. Even you know I\u2019m not that interesting.\u201d I tried to laugh.</p><p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t know that. All they see is the girl who has the hot and awesome Jack Carter\u2019s heart. They don\u2019t know what you guys have been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they act like they do.\u201d I sprawled across the couch. \u201cThey post all sorts of shit claiming to know everything about us.\u201d</p><p>Melissa laughed. \u201cYeah, and we both know how accurate those postings are. They\u2019re almost as good as the ones on that hot wives website.\u201d</p><p>My heart beat in double time. \u201cWhat hot wives website?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cass. It\u2019s just a stupid website.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on it?\u201d I asked, before sitting up to grab my laptop from the coffee table.</p><p>She hesitated and I knew she was keeping something from me. \u201cPictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else? Tell me,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo really. It\u2019s just pictures mostly, but they rate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRate me how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBased on hotness.\u201d</p><p>I typed a description into the search engine as hundreds of disgustingly named websites turned up. I added \u201cathlete\u201d into my search and bingo. I clicked on the first link listed and my name appeared, along with four recent pictures of me. There was a description that stated Jack and I met back in college but broke up for a brief time before getting back together after he was traded. A paragraph described what I did for work, but didn\u2019t mention where.</p><p>Thank God.</p> <p>A rating scale of one to ten stars waited at the end of the post to be voted on. Underneath the star rating, mine currently sat at six, by the way, was a comment section.</p><p>\u201cI found the website,\u201d I breathed into the phone.</p><p>\u201cOh God. No. Cass. Don\u2019t,\u201d she pleaded through the phone.</p><p>I clicked on the Comment link as my stomach turned.</p><p>\u201cI heard she cheats on Jack every time he\u2019s out of town with that Matteo guy. Maybe someone needs to help Jack get back at her. I volunteer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her making out with that guy who\u2019s always with her at the games. I would have taken a picture, but I didn\u2019t have my phone with me. Next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend went to school with her in California and said she was a bitch to everyone there and no one liked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought baseball players were supposed to have hot girlfriends. Where\u2019d he find this one\u2014she\u2019s disgusting. And she should probably go on a diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello? Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d I sniffed.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to go through these one by one? Obviously you don\u2019t cheat on Jack when he\u2019s away. You were not making out with your super-hot driver, but if you\u2019d let me I totally would. You were not a bitch to anyone who didn\u2019t deserve it in college, and you\u2019re not fat or ugly. These are all jealous girls who all think they want what you have.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with tears as I asked my best friend, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop reading it. Right now,\u201d she insisted, and I clicked the small red X at the top of the screen, closing the page. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll stop telling you anything anyone is saying. None of it matters anyway, and it\u2019s tearing you apart.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, knowing she couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cYou have to help.\u201d</p><p>Melissa was right. These posts and judgments wrecked me. I tried to not care and be stronger, but it was hard when it was constantly shoved in your face. And it was even harder when the things posted were blatant lies.</p><p>\u201cI will. No more texts or picture messages, OK? I promise. You\u2019ll feel a million times better once you stop reading the things they\u2019re posting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d I said, obviously trying to convince us both.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to stay away, but trust me, you\u2019ll be better off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Meli.\u201d My phone beeped and I pulled it from my face, staring at the screen. \u201cHey, I have to go. Jack\u2019s calling on the other line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Talk to you later. Love you!\u201d she shouted before I clicked over.</p><p>\u201cHi, babe,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cKitten.\u201d His voice purred into my ear. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>I released a breath. \u201cI miss you too. How was the game today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, we lost. They outhit us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll be home soon, and I have a surprise for you,\u201d he teased through the phone.</p><p>I smiled, tucking my feet underneath one of the pillows on the couch. \u201cWhat kind of surprise?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI got in touch with my buddy Jake. I saw that he had a concert coming up at Madison Square Garden. So I reached out to him for some tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake who?\u201d I asked, never hearing about this friend in a band before.</p><p>\u201cJake Wethers,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cFrom The Mighty Storm?\u201d I choked out before bolting upright.</p><p>Jack laughed again. \u201cYeah, you\u2019ve heard of the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jack. Everyone\u2019s heard of the band. How the hell do you know Jake Wethers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have some mutual friends back in LA, and we met a few times over the years. We just hit it off and stayed in touch. You\u2019ll love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, I already love him,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to a Mighty Storm concert! And I can\u2019t believe you freaking know Jake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did good?\u201d he asked, his voice a mixture of sweet and cocky.</p><p>\u201cBetter than good. I can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just remember that you love me and not Jake Wethers, got it? I love Jake but I\u2019ll kick his ass if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough dating you. The last thing I need is to date a freaking rock star,\u201d I moaned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Jake\u2019s no picnic like I am,\u201d he said, and the irony wasn\u2019t lost on me.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure. Because dating you has been a real walk in the park,\u201d I joked, my insides still giddy with the knowledge that Jack and Jake were friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go grab some food, Kitten. I love you. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d I said, before hanging up my phone and collapsing back onto the couch.</p><p>Jack walked through the front door with a wide grin on his face, and I practically knocked him over in my excitement. \u201cGod I missed you,\u201d he breathed into my hair, tangling his fingers in it.</p><p>I kissed each of his dimples before pressing my mouth to his. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d I said, before sweeping my tongue across his bottom lip. He tasted like warm cinnamon, and I sucked his bottom lip into my mouth, nibbling gently.</p><p>Jack dropped his bag onto the floor with a loud thud and lifted me from the ground with one arm. He walked us into our bedroom and tossed me onto our new bed. \u201cGet naked,\u201d he demanded with an arched brow.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d I toyed, staring at him.</p><p>With a cocky grin, he shrugged and then pulled off his black T-shirt. I wanted to lick every inch of his tanned chest and abs. He unfastened his shorts and removed the rest of his clothes in one swift motion. I took in every delicious ounce of him, my eyes roaming from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d he said, not moving from where he stood at the end of the bed.</p><p>I lifted off my white tank top before scooting out of my shorts and underwear. Then I unfastened my bra and dropped it to the side of the bed. Jack was on me, licking, nibbling, and kissing my body like a man starved for it.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he breathed against my skin before licking my neck.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want the foreplay; he\u2019d been gone for so long that I craved his touch. I pulled at his body, aching for him to enter. I didn\u2019t want to wait a second longer without having him inside me. \u201cJack,\u201d I breathed out, as he kissed my breasts and moaned against them. \u201cJack, get in. I want you. Now.\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved up to mine, his tongue moving in and out of my mouth passionately. He was feverish, and I was desperate. \u201cSay it again. Tell me you want me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my mouth harder as his body moved around mine. I tried to force him inside, but he resisted. My fingertips dug into his lower back as I attempted to guide him. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, Jack. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d His hands grabbed at me all over. \u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside me. I want you inside me now,\u201d I breathed and moaned in unison.</p><p>With one deep thrust, he pushed himself inside of me. I moaned, the pleasure mixing with pain. \u201cOh God. You\u2019re so deep.\u201d</p><p>He moved in and out, pushing deeper with each thrust until he could go no further. I wrapped my legs around his waist, taking him as deep as he could go. \u201cI\u2019m not going to last, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>I tightened my grip, pushing my hips against him harder and faster as he grew inside of me. I maneuvered my body and Jack flipped us over so I was now on top. Taking him even deeper from this position, I cried out with pleasure. I looked down at Jack, his eyes locked on mine. \u201cYou feel so fucking good,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>I leaned forward, thrusting my tongue into his mouth while working my hips up and down in a rushed pace. The feeling of him inside of me was unlike anything else, and I moaned as he pressed against the right spot. Bursts of feeling shot through my body as I screamed out with the pleasure he gave me. I worked my hips against his as he moaned, his hands gripping mine forcefully. He throbbed against my insides as he groaned in raspy breaths. Our movements slowed and he pulled me against his heaving chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have you home,\u201d I whispered against his chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He huffed. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jack.\u201d I loved Jack more than I\u2019d ever loved anyone in my life, but dating him was hard. I wanted to tell him about all the Internet sites and the things they posted, but he had enough to concentrate on during the season. So I stuffed my unhappiness deep inside, hoping to God it would stay there.</p><p>He ran his fingers through my hair as he leaned up to plant a kiss on the top of my head. \u201cI love you, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>Not Cut Out For This</p> <p>Cassie</p><p>I could rarely attend Jack\u2019s afternoon home games because of work, so I was following a game online when my cell phone sang its Melissa ringtone. I reached for it, silencing it immediately. I answered it quietly, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we said no more, but I have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened as I held my breath. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrystle sold her story to a tabloid.\u201d</p> <p>My stomach dropped. \u201cWhat story exactly?\u201d I managed to ask through my shock.</p><p>\u201cOh, the one where you\u2019re a home-wrecking whore who stole her husband after she lost their baby to a miscarriage.\u201d</p><p>My head started to pound as the walls of the office spun around me. I clutched the phone tight against my cheek, willing the bile rising in my throat to subside.</p><p>\u201cCass, are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore?\u201d I choked out, wondering what more there could possibly be.</p><p>\u201cThere are pictures online of their wedding. And pictures of you. And the article is filled with lies. People are eating it up, Cass. Believing every word of that lying bitch\u2019s story. The message boards online are blowing up calling you a home wrecker and the devil. It\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p><p>My body started to tremble with fury. I hated Chrystle so much for everything she\u2019d done to come between me and Jack. And here I\u2019d thought she was out of lives for good. \u201cWhy won\u2019t she just go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause she\u2019s a money-hungry publicity whore. I\u2019m going to fucking kill her. Straight up murder the bitch.\u201d</p><p>I managed a chuckle through my rage-filled tears. \u201cMe first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, can I see you please?\u201d Nora shouted across the bustling office floor.</p><p>\u201cMeli, I have to go. My boss is calling me.\u201d I tossed my phone into a drawer before my nervous legs walked me into Nora\u2019s office. Her walls were covered with various magazine covers from over the years and pictures of Nora with celebrities and local politicians.</p><p>\u201cClose the door and come sit,\u201d she said, not looking up as I entered. I did as she requested, shaking as I collapsed into the overstuffed white leather chair. \u201cTalk to me about this article that just came out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d I asked, my eyes instantly welling.</p><p>She leaned forward onto her elbows and looked directly at me. \u201cHow much of it is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just found out about it, so I\u2019m not quite sure what it says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Jack married to this person?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she got pregnant.\u201d I could tell she assumed those parts of the story were accurate.</p><p>\u201cNo. She lied to him. She told him she was pregnant, but she never was. The minute Jack found out, he left her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he didn\u2019t leave her for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was with me first.\u201d I suddenly wanted to defend what Jack and I had in the past, before Chrystle came along and fucked it all up. \u201cWe were together when he met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he cheated on you?\u201d she asked matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she know about you?\u201d Nora eyed me, and I sensed that an idea was coursing through that brain of hers.</p><p>\u201cShe knew about me. She didn\u2019t care. She said that she always wanted a baseball-playing husband, so that\u2019s what she got.\u201d Anger and embarrassment collided within me as I struggled to keep my emotions balanced.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to address this article publicly? We could make a statement on your behalf, disputing all of this woman\u2019s claims and accusations.\u201d Nora folded her hands together and rested her chin on top. \u201cOr we could run a counter article on you and Jack.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even thought about defending myself. In the past months, I\u2019d learned to keep quiet when it came to all the things people wrote about me. I was told standing up for myself would end up making me look worse, which I never understood, but I had to agree with because I didn\u2019t know what else to do.</p><p>\u201cIf you fight back they\u2019ll attack even harder,\u201d Melissa\u2019s mom had advised me at one point. \u201cDon\u2019t give them any more ammunition. People like that love getting a reaction out of you. So when they don\u2019t get what they want, they eventually move on.\u201d But they hadn\u2019t moved on.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think I should do?\u201d I asked Nora. \u201cMake a statement? Won\u2019t it make it worse?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cPossibly. Let me think on it for a couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry about you. I don\u2019t know how you put up with all of this crap. Being with this guy sure has its downfalls, doesn\u2019t it? I hope he\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>My lungs constricted as if all the air had been sucked out of the room. I wanted to choke, but couldn\u2019t. I struggled to keep my composure as the tears spilled out. And just like that, I broke down. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The bad press, the constant harassment, the online sites judging me every day. It had become too much weight to carry.</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d Nora pushed back from her desk and walked over to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just meant that it\u2019s a lot to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s not what you said; it\u2019s how I feel,\u201d I tried to explain through my sobs.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a few days off? Go clear your head. Hell, take a vacation or something. Get out of the city for a while.\u201d</p><p>I wiped at my eyes and sniffled. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll fly home. Are you sure that\u2019s OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. We\u2019ll come up with a game plan when you get back.\u201d She squeezed my shoulder before returning to her chair.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Nora.\u201d I forced a smile before walking out of her office. I gathered my things, typed a quick out-of-office notification for my e-mail, and turned my computer off. I stopped at the lobby store, grabbing a copy of the tabloid as my legs wobbled. The wedding picture of Jack with Chrystle caused me sharp stabs of pain as I stared at it.</p><p>Mortified, I tucked the tabloid under my arm and walked outside. I couldn\u2019t take the subway home, I\u2019d never last surrounded by all those people, so I called the only person I could think of while I walked back into the lobby.</p><p>\u201cMatteo, can you come get you from work and bring me home?\u201d My voice was shaking as I practically begged.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Are you OK, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I just need a ride home please.\u201d He knew I was lying, but he didn\u2019t press the issue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Matteo arrived right on time, and I headed out of the lobby doors toward the car. He rushed out of the driver\u2019s seat, concern written all over his face. He took me by the hand, opening the door for me and closing it softly. Once inside, I buckled myself in and waited for the inquisition that never came. If he had a million questions, he wasn\u2019t asking any.</p><p>Matteo pulled the car up in front of my building as hordes of cameramen surrounded it. \u201cOh my God,\u201d I said, the shock clearly written all over my face.</p><p>\u201cCassie, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Matteo asked.</p><p>The press realized it was me in the car, and it took less than two seconds for them to swarm the side I sat on, cameras flashing nonstop, practically blinding me, even in the daylight. \u201cI got this,\u201d Matteo said before exiting the car. I heard him demand they move as he opened my door and helped me out. I lowered my head upon exiting, refusing to make eye contact with anyone.</p><p>Reporters shouted questions while Matteo wrapped a protective arm around me and pushed through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cDid you know she was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Jack leave her for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you having an affair with Jack while he was still married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think stress made her lose the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d he shouted, trying to get me into my building.</p><p>Once inside the building, the doorman blocked the reporters while Matteo shielded me from view and pressed the button on the elevator. He stayed by my side until it opened. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said through watery eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be OK? Are you sure you want to be alone right now?\u201d He held the elevator door open with his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go get Jack soon, right? I\u2019ll be fine until he gets home. But I might need you to drive me somewhere later. I\u2019ll call you if I do,\u201d I said, knowing I was being cryptic.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need, I\u2019ll be there for you,\u201d he reassured me.</p><p>\u201cThanks again.\u201d I swallowed before allowing the doors to close and block everything but my own reflection from view.</p><p>In the security of our apartment, I collapsed onto our bed, tucking my knees into my chest. I allowed my tears to spill out onto my pillow. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening again. I\u2019d never experienced someone so vindictive and cruel, and I hadn\u2019t even read the damn article yet.</p><p>I flashed back to being at Fullton, when reports started coming in about Jack getting married and how I was portrayed as the woman left behind. I thought I\u2019d never experience pain and humiliation like that again, but this was far worse. Now that Jack played in the major leagues, everything was amplified. Our lives weren\u2019t simply a local story anymore; they were national news. And this Chrystle story garnered everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>My stomach twisted and turned as I tried to block it all out, but failed. My cell phone rang, causing me to jump as I looked at the number flashing on the screen. I didn\u2019t recognize it, but answered it anyway. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this Cassie Andrews?\u201d a male voice asked on the other end of the line.</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to ask you a few questions about the article today for our website, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not OK. How\u2019d you get this number? Don\u2019t call again.\u201d</p><p>Horrified, I ended the call as quickly as I could. I guess I should have been surprised it took them this long to track me down, but I was completely losing it. I didn\u2019t want the press to have my phone number. I hated it enough that they knew where we lived.</p><p>I closed my eyes after putting my phone on silent, falling into the comfort of sleep. The sound of the door slamming woke me.</p><p>\u201cCass? Cassie? Where are you?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice was frantic as the sound of his footsteps beat against the wood flooring. I stayed silent, knowing that he\u2019d eventually find me in here.</p><p>\u201cKitten. Are you OK?\u201d He curled next to me in the bed, holding my shaking body in his arms. All I wanted to do was run. Literally. \u201cTalk to me, Cass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they still downstairs? The press?\u201d I avoided looking at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re fucking vultures.\u201d</p><p>I pushed off the bed and walked into the kitchen. I opened the cupboard and pulled out a glass. Filling it with water, I gulped the entire thing down. \u201cHow did you hear about the article?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe team\u2019s publicist saw it and alerted me. He\u2019s putting out an official statement on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your statement?\u201d I asked, placing the glass down on the cold granite countertop.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know?\u201d I started getting pissed, the heat rising in my belly.</p><p>\u201cThe team makes a statement, and I\u2019m required to go along with it,\u201d he told me, trying to make me feel better but failing miserably.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t agree with it? What if it\u2019s a horrible, stupid statement? You\u2019re just supposed to smile and nod your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happens, Kitten. They put out a statement that\u2019s best for the team, and I\u2019m supposed to agree with it. I have no say.\u201d</p> <p>I turned my back to him, storming into our bedroom. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking ridiculous! This is your life we\u2019re talking about! And my life. These are horrible lies about you and about me. We can\u2019t just sit here and agree with some statement you didn\u2019t even make.\u201d</p><p>He followed right behind me. \u201cWhat do you want to do? Make our own statement?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my running shoes from the closet. \u201cI have to get the fuck out of here.\u201d The heat spread quickly throughout my entire body as my temper flared beyond control.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with a temper, Jack. Just because I don\u2019t go around putting my fist in people\u2019s faces doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t lose my shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning away isn\u2019t really showing you have a temper. It just shows you have...\u201d he paused, \u201clegs.\u201d</p> <p>I laced up my gym shoes. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Legs for running away instead of staying here and talking it out!\u201d he yelled, his voice frustrated.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think clearly when I\u2019m around you. I need to be away from you.\u201d His eyes. His face. They all distracted me from my internal thoughts.</p><p>I slammed the door and walked down the stairs to our gym, thankful it was empty. I turned on a treadmill before plugging into my iPod. The music of Imagine Dragons blasted in my ears as I started running faster and faster, all the frustration from the last few months pouring out in beads of sweat across my forehead. Wishing I could stomp out all the blog posts, newspaper articles, gossip columns, message board threads, and Chrystle from my memory with each step, I slammed my feet against the moving surface.</p><p>After an hour of running on pure adrenaline, nothing changed. I didn\u2019t feel better, relieved, or calmed. The same pressures and hurt remained. I realized this was something I could no longer ignore.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t happy.</p><p>The past four months had helped dissolve my strength into a puddle of self-doubt and misery. Being with Jack meant accepting all the other things that came with it, and I hated it. My head pounded as I walked back into our apartment. Ignoring Jack, I moved past him and into the shower. He tried to follow me, but I closed and locked the door. I took my time, hoping the hot water would wash away my doubts, but nothing helped. Afterward, I towel dried my hair before emerging with another towel wrapped around my body.</p><p>Jack sat on our bed, watching my every move as I quickly changed into a pair of jeans and a tank top.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for this, Jack.\u201d I snapped my eyes shut, willing the online pictures and tabloid article to disappear from my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sign up for what exactly?\u201d he asked cautiously, his head tilting to one side.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for this life. This constant invasion of privacy... this scrutiny. This judgment. People get to say and write whatever they want about me, and I just have to sit here and take it. I can\u2019t deal with it anymore.\u201d</p><p>The tears started to fall, and I didn\u2019t bother to stop them. \u201cDid you know that my pictures are plastered all over websites where people get to vote on whether or not they think I\u2019m hot enough for you?\u201d I screamed through my frustration.</p><p>Logically I knew it wasn\u2019t Jack\u2019s fault, but my embarrassment overruled all logic at the moment. \u201cDo you know how horrible that feels? To be judged on my looks by a bunch of fucking strangers? Heaven forbid I\u2019m actually a good person who loves her boyfriend and works hard and treats people well. But that doesn\u2019t count. None of that matters!\u201d</p><p>I threw my hands out, shaking my head. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what I wear and how my hair looks and how much weight I need to lose. Why do people think it\u2019s OK to tear apart the way I look? Did you know there\u2019s an entire thread on the baseball website dedicated to hating me? Not liking me, but hating me. What the hell did I even do to anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll have administration get that shit taken down right now! I will not have any threads about you on a baseball website. Unless it\u2019s good stuff.\u201d He forced a small smile, his dimples barely showing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been called every name in the book. Whore, slut, gold digger, ugly, fat, bitch, cunt, tramp, cleat chaser... and I can\u2019t fucking take it, Jack. I don\u2019t know how anyone does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Kitten?\u201d He took two steps toward me, and I instinctively stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying.\u201d My heart battered against my chest as I denied the truth. I knew exactly what I was saying... I just apparently couldn\u2019t form the actual words.</p><p>He started nervously pacing. In all honesty, my nerves even overwhelmed me in that moment. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, Cass. You know we\u2019re no good without each other.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head as more tears escaped. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re any good with each other either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. You\u2019re just upset.\u201d Jack\u2019s voice shook as he shoved his hands into his front pockets. When I didn\u2019t respond, he begged, \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t you dare give up on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m losing myself.\u201d I turned away, unable to bear the look in his eyes. \u201cBeing in this relationship with you is completely fucking with me,\u201d I admitted, the tears falling down my cheeks without mercy. Guilt rushed through me as my words spilled out. I never intended to admit all of this to him during the baseball season. I wanted to be strong enough to get through it on my own, to talk to him when the season ended, but I couldn\u2019t take any more. My insides had wound up so tight I thought they might shatter. Chrystle\u2019s accusatory article was the last straw.</p><p>Jack stepped closer, his arms resting on my shoulders as he turned me toward him. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to quit,\u201d he said, reaching for my chin with shaky hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to walk away from this.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to throw up. My feelings contorted inside of me, the conflict raging once again. Part of me wanted to bolt as quickly as I could from everything Jack Carter, while the rest of me wanted to tangle myself up in his arms and never let go.</p><p>\u201cI need to figure out how to be with you and still keep my sanity. I feel like a crazed lunatic. Like I have absolutely no control over my life. I can\u2019t keep living like this.\u201d I sobbed until my vision blurred.</p><p>He led me toward our couch, pulling me down with him as I cried into his chest. How had I become so twisted up and confused? I knew I loved Jack, but I wasn\u2019t sure I could be with him like this any longer. I pulled away from his grip, wiping my eyes with the back of my hand as he returned to the view, as gorgeous as ever.</p><p>He cupped my cheek, moisture filling his dark eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here without you. We can fix this. But we can\u2019t fix it if you walk away. I can\u2019t make us work by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to find some sort of balance. Between your work and my work and all the pressure that comes along with it\u2014\u201d I stopped as I tried to gather my thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s just too much. I need to get myself together. I\u2019m falling apart here.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his head into his hands, his fingers tugging at his dark hair. I watched his chest rise and fall, his head shaking before he turned to look at me. \u201cFine,\u201d he started with a ragged breath. \u201cGet yourself together, then. But don\u2019t you fucking quit on me. After everything we\u2019ve been through, please don\u2019t let this break us.\u201d</p><p>Tears ran down my cheeks with his words. I loved Jack, but this was about me. Loving Jack put my own self-worth at risk. A girl could only take so much bashing and criticism from so many fronts until her self-esteem started to take a nosedive. And that wasn\u2019t healthy for either of us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a few days off from work and go stay with Melissa.\u201d The words flew from my lips effortlessly. I hadn\u2019t even talked to Melissa, but I knew she would welcome me.</p><p>He lowered his head, the look of defeat replacing any hope he once had. \u201cOK, Kitten. You go.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, reaching for my cell phone and dialing Matteo\u2019s number. \u201cHi, Matteo, it\u2019s Cassie. Can you get me to JFK as soon as possible, or are you busy?\u201d</p><p>Matteo asked me to hold for a moment while he rearranged his schedule with another driver. I waited, avoiding all eye contact with Jack. Matteo came back on the line, informing me that he\u2019d pick me up in twenty minutes and he\u2019d call me when he was downstairs. I thanked him before I ended the call and turned the ringer back on.</p><p>Whether I wanted to or not, it was time to pack.</p><p>I sensed Jack watching me from the doorway of the bedroom we shared as I tossed pieces of clothing into my open suitcase. Deliberately, I forced myself not to look at him. He could take the broken parts of me and shatter them even further. If I looked at him, I\u2019d question everything. He could make me stay, and I desperately needed to go. After adding two more pairs of shoes, I zipped up the suitcase and lifted it from the bed.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d he offered from behind me, his breath gliding across my back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have it,\u201d I said tightly, refusing to face him.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d he asked, his tone desolate.</p><p>I shrugged, unsure of my actual plans. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A few days. A week, maybe. I\u2019ll text you,\u201d I offered with a glance in his direction.</p><p>Jack\u2019s face turned sullen as the color drained instantly from his cheeks. He reached for me, his fingers tightening around my wrist, stopping all forward movement. \u201cYou are coming back. Right, Kitten?\u201d A look of powerlessness covered his face.</p><p>My stomach dropped to my feet with his question. I took a few short breaths before responding, \u201cYes, Jack. I\u2019m coming back.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a lie, but the truth was almost as painful. Of course I would come back, but I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d be coming back to. \u201cI have a job here.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows pinched together, tears filling his eyes as he let go of my arm. My phone rang, breaking the sorrow-filled heaviness in the room. \u201cHi, Matteo. OK, I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to go.\u201d I leaned toward Jack and planted a soft kiss on his cheek before turning to walk away.</p><p>He gripped my wrist from behind and yanked me around to face him. \u201cGet over here,\u201d he said roughly as he pulled my body effortlessly into his. Before I could situate my arms, his were wrapped around me, pulling me tight against his heaving chest.</p><p>Oh my God, he\u2019s crying.</p><p>\u201cI love you more than anything. You need to know that before you walk out that door.\u201d The warmth of his breath fluttered against my skin. My eyes met his, and the tears that rolled down his cheeks caused my heart to shatter.</p> <p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d My current dysfunction had nothing to do with my feelings for Jack. I loved him more than I ever thought possible. But sometimes love wasn\u2019t enough, and in order to be with him forever, I needed to make sure I could handle whatever came my way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything to make you happy. Anything, Kitten. You just tell me what I need to do and I\u2019ll do it. Tell me what you want and I\u2019ll give it to you. You want to file a lawsuit against Chrystle, I\u2019ll start the paperwork tomorrow. You want me to quit baseball? I\u2019ll stop playing.\u201d</p><p>It pained me to hear his voice sounding this desperate, this needy. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want,\u201d I choked out, my jagged heart beating out painfully piercing beats. \u201cRight now I just need some space.\u201d</p><p>He peeled his arms from my body, and I instantly craved their attention again, but refused to give in. \u201cOK. Space,\u201d he breathed out in response, his cheeks tearstained. \u201cBut not forever. I won\u2019t let you quit on us. I know this is all my fault. One fucking mistake that never goes away. I\u2019m so sorry about all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI am too.\u201d</p> <p>I pulled my suitcase out the front door, leaving Jack behind.</p><p>I walked out of the elevator, noticing the gaggle of press still gathered outside our building. Seeing me, the cameras started flashing against the glass of the window as they fought over one another for the best shot. Matteo lunged through them on his way to reach me. Blocking me from view once again, he grabbed my suitcase while keeping a tight hold on my body.</p><p>Stepping outside, I was bombarded by the press shouting their questions.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you and Jack split up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going back to Chrystle?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs for them to shut the hell up and mind their own business. They didn\u2019t know anything about our relationship and their stupid assumptions drove me nuts. Matteo opened up the passenger door, and I shook my head, opting for the rear seat, which had privacy glass on the windows. I watched as some of the paparazzi scattered, and I assumed they were heading for their cars so they could follow me.</p><p>He opened the door for me and ushered me inside. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>I wiped the tears from my cheeks. \u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you and Jack alright?\u201d he asked as he pulled the car onto Second Avenue.</p><p>Unsure of how much I wanted to confide in Matteo at the moment, I opted for the easy way out. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Matteo checked the rearview mirror a few times before I asked, \u201cAre they following us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I can usually tell if they\u2019re around us because they drive like assholes, but I don\u2019t see anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d His voice questioned and I simply looked in his direction. \u201cYou know I\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>I forced a polite smile. \u201cI know. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>We drove the rest of the way in silence. My brain turned inside my skull, causing more confusion, questions, and pain. I closed my eyes as the sound of my cell phone beeping filtered into my ears.</p><p>I read the text message from Jack.</p><p>I love you. I wish there were different words that I could say, but no one\u2019s been clever enough to invent any yet. So it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. But it\u2019s everything. I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Please come home soon.</p><p>Half tempted to ask Matteo to turn the car around, I turned my phone off instead. Another text message like that, and I would go back. I\u2019d never leave.</p><p>And I\u2019d probably become a shell of a person who secretly resented everything her life had become. Because the problems and issues would still remain. I needed to fix this. I needed to fix me. Before I knew it, the car screeched to a stop in front of the airline terminal. I pushed out of the backseat with the help of Matteo\u2019s outstretched, muscular hand.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, pulling me against his chiseled body.</p><p>God, he smells good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be OK.\u201d He patted the length of my hair, his hands sliding down my back slowly. Matteo had never touched me like that before. I sensed deliberation in his movements, but did nothing to stop him.</p><p>Why aren\u2019t I stopping him?</p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you cry,\u201d he whispered in my ear, before wiping my cheek with his thumb.</p><p>Pull away, Cass.</p><p>I didn\u2019t move. Nerves surged through my body like waves in the ocean. Forceful and without remorse, they ebbed and flowed from my head to my toes. My knees started to shake as my heart rate quickened.</p><p>Pull aw\u2014</p><p>Before I could process another thought, Matteo\u2019s soft lips pressed against mine. I tensed quickly at first, shock and disbelief sprinting through my head. I squeezed my eyes shut, allowing the difference in his kiss and his touch to overwhelm my senses. His mouth opened and his tongue pushed up against my lips, begging for entry.</p><p>Instantly, my eyes shot open as I pushed away from his Adonis body. I wiped his taste from my lips with the back of my hand before covering my mouth from view. My mind raced to piece together what the hell had just happened and why I\u2019d allowed it.</p><p>Fuck, what if someone saw that?</p><p>I quickly scanned the area, noting the absence of prying eyes and cameras. I couldn\u2019t be certain there wasn\u2019t someone hiding, but it looked all clear.</p><p>Thank the stars.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Cassie. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d His eyes widened as a look of horror crossed his face. \u201cIt broke my fucking heart to see you crying. You\u2019re too beautiful to cry like that. I just wanted to take your tears away and make you happy.\u201d</p><p>I processed his words.</p><p>I think.</p><p>What is he saying exactly?</p><p>I refused to move for what seemed like an eternity, but I\u2019m sure it was only a few seconds. \u201cUm,\u201d I stuttered, \u201cI... I have to go.\u201d</p><p>I reached into the open trunk of the car, pulling at my suitcase. \u201cCassie. Look at me,\u201d Matteo said forcefully. I released my grip on my suitcase, turning to face him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Jack. I\u2019m so sorry. I never should have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d I yelled as embarrassment and anger all competed for the gold medal in my emotional Olympics.</p><p>His long, tanned fingers gripped the edge of his jacket. \u201cOh, come on. Don\u2019t make me say it out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what out loud? What the hell are you taking about?\u201d I didn\u2019t have time for this. Not tonight. I was already coming apart at the seams; I couldn\u2019t take any more shit from anyone.</p><p>Here, Matteo, pull this frayed piece of fabric and watch me fall into particles of skin, clothing, and hair in a big heap on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI like you. I didn\u2019t mean to and I know we can never be together, but fuck!\u201d He started pacing.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you like me?\u201d I shouted at his back. \u201cYou don\u2019t fucking like me. We\u2019re friends. That\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever been. That\u2019s all we\u2019ll ever be,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>His jaw worked under his fingertips as he continued to pace. \u201cI know. Like I said, I fucked up. I didn\u2019t mean to go and fall in love with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I interrupted, refusing to hear another word. \u201cYou are not in love with me! Do you hear me?\u201d I inched closer to his body, my anger rising. \u201cSay it!\u201d</p><p>He stopped pacing and shook his head. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019re not in love with me! You just think you are because we spend so much time together, and you\u2019re supposed to protect me. But you\u2019re not in love with me. Not really. So I want you to fucking say it.\u201d I jabbed my finger into his rock-hard chest repeatedly.</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders, no words leaving his lips. I jabbed at him again. \u201cSay it!\u201d And then I lost it. I started crying out of pure frustration. \u201cSay it, damn it!\u201d I insisted, stomping my foot on the concrete.</p><p>He took a step toward me, and I firmly placed my hand against his stomach, stopping him cold. \u201cDo you feel something for me? Anything at all?\u201d his voice pleaded.</p><p>I wanted to kick him in the nuts right then and there and tell him that pure hatred raced through my veins for him. And well, that was something. But it would have been a lie. \u201cMatteo, I do not feel anything for you other than friendship. I love Jack. I\u2019ve always loved Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not attracted to me? This is purely a one-way street?\u201d His lips formed a snarl, and I fought down the urge to sock him in the jaw. He\u2019d pushed all the wrong buttons tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to be dead to not be attracted to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d he shouted, pleased at my apparent revelation.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not the kind of attraction that means anything!\u201d I yelled back, my frustration boiling over so hot and thick I thought my skin might blister.</p><p>He shoved a hand through his hair in frustration before leaning toward me. \u201cWhat the fuck does that even mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just means that yes, I think you\u2019re hot. But so does anyone with eyes! You\u2019re a good-looking guy. Of course I\u2019m attracted to you,\u201d I explained, intentionally lowering my voice before continuing. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be with you. I don\u2019t want to leave Jack for you. It\u2019s not the kind of attraction that makes me question anything in my life, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to the ground, looking like all the wind had just been sucked from his sails. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Guilt seeped into my bones, making itself at home. Scenes of our time spent together ran through my mind like a sports highlights reel. Had I given him the wrong impression? Did I lead him on? Did I make Matteo think there was something between us?</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve ever given you some impression that I wanted more from you. I don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t say that to hurt you, but I\u2019m in love with Jack. I want that to be very clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d He paused, exhaling a breath so large his chest caved inward. \u201cYou didn\u2019t lead me on. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t really spend any time with anyone other than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you. You don\u2019t love me, Matteo. I promise you that you don\u2019t. You just think you do because we\u2019re always together. Maybe we should look into hiring another driver when I get back into town?\u201d</p><p>The idea of a new driver filled me with a sliver of relief. The lines of our relationship had blurred so often that I suddenly appeared blinded by it. Matteo worked for us, but the friendship we formed often took precedence. Lines needed to be clear again\u2014business first, friendship second. But how would I ever explain that to Jack without him suspecting something? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His face twisted as he pushed off the curb, standing above me. \u201cPlease don\u2019t fire me. I love working for you guys. This is literally the best job I\u2019ve ever had. Give me another chance. Please, Cassie. I\u2019m so sorry. It will never happen again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t give him any answers, so I didn\u2019t. Right now, I needed to get the hell out of New York and away from everyone. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Jack?\u201d His handsome face looked nervous; it seemed strange to see him looking so undone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. I considered keeping the kiss from Jack, and that fact alone nearly wrecked me. Omitting the truth was still being dishonest. I\u2019d be doing the number one thing I\u2019d insisted Jack never to do me: lie.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill me.\u201d Matteo rubbed his temples.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I couldn\u2019t disagree. \u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>I Don\u2019t Care How Much It Costs</p><p>Jack</p><p>Watching Cassie run out our door last night practically tore me in two. I knew I had to let her go, but it fucking killed me to stand there and watch it happen. I hoped Melissa would be able to talk some sense into her. Despite all of the torment and pain I\u2019d caused in the past, I knew Melissa still believed that Cassie and I were meant to be together. I thought I could count on that much.</p> <p>I convinced myself that Cassie just needed some time away. She\u2019d see everything clearly in a few days, and she\u2019d come back home to me. I knew that being in the public eye could be unbearable at times, but hopefully it was worth putting up with in order to be together.</p><p>Right?</p><p>I knew what I wanted. And what I wanted was to spend the rest of my life with Cassie. I\u2019ve always known it, but having her leave like this only solidified the fact that I refused to live my life without her in it. I wanted her to know how serious I was about us. Nothing and no one would ever come between us again. I didn\u2019t know shit about jewelry, but every guy knew about Tiffany\u2019s. The ring Chrystle sported on her tiny finger had been her late grandmother\u2019s, so all of this ring-shopping business was new to me. And I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>I hustled down the busy New York streets toward the shop six or so blocks away. I pulled my hat down low and donned sunglasses, hoping no one would recognize me and try to stop me for pictures. Two steps from the Tiffany\u2019s store a voice shouted, \u201cJack Carter?\u201d and my feet stopped moving. \u201cOh my God, are you Jack Carter?\u201d</p><p>I looked up to see a teenage girl practically dancing off the sidewalk. \u201cHi.\u201d I smiled, not wanting her to draw attention to me, or the store I was about to walk into.</p><p>\u201cCan I get a picture with you? Please?\u201d Her voice shook.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d I leaned toward her as she tried to take a self-portrait of us. I grabbed the phone from her shaking hands. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d I reached out my arm as far as it would go before clicking the button on her phone.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Oh my God. I can\u2019t wait to show my dad. And all my friends. They think you\u2019re so hot,\u201d she gushed.</p><p>\u201cJust your friends think I\u2019m hot?\u201d I teased, hoping to ease the teen\u2019s nerves.</p><p>She laughed, her face turning a bright shade of red before squeaking out, \u201cThanks again. Bye.\u201d</p><p>I turned around, scanning the area for photographers and passed the Tiffany\u2019s entrance just to be safe. When no one else approached me, I turned back around and hastily walked through the revolving door. Once inside, I wanted to puke. Talk about overwhelming. Glass cases lined the entire length of the store. Where the hell was I supposed to start?</p><p>\u201cHello, sir. May I help you find something?\u201d A brunette stepped in front of me with a fake smile.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I froze. \u201cEngagement rings.\u201d</p><p>Her fake smile deepened. \u201cRight this way.\u201d</p> <p>She led me past a crowd of people hovering over something and directed me toward a display of cases. \u201cAll of our engagement rings are here. Let me find a specialist to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d was all I muttered in response.</p><p>I glanced down. No wonder girls loved this shit. Diamonds of all sizes and colors sparkled like the lights at the baseball stadium. Everything seemed so fancy and showy\u2014neither of which was Kitten\u2019s style. I continued to scan the flashy rings when a voice broke my concentration.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon. My name is Elizabeth. Sasha told me you were looking for engagement rings. Do you have a specific style in mind?\u201d</p><p>Yeah. The kind that fits on her hand and makes her say yes when I propose.</p><p>\u201cUm, no. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we start with a price range. Do you have a certain amount you are looking to spend?\u201d She smiled, her overly white teeth blinding me.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Her face lit up. Like seriously... Lit. The. Fuck. Up. Like I\u2019d just told her she\u2019d hit the jackpot.</p><p>\u201cOK. So then, is there a certain shape she likes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly.\u201d I paused. \u201cElizabeth, was it?\u201d She nodded. \u201cI have no idea what kind of shape she likes. I\u2019d just like to get her a ring that fits her personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright then. Is there a shape you like? There\u2019s round, cushion cut, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what any of that means other than round. Why don\u2019t I just look at these, and I\u2019ll tell you which ones I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell, salespeople are annoying.</p><p>I wandered around the cases searching for the one ring that looked right. I passed by all the so-called \u201cfancy\u201d diamonds, assuming that Cassie would probably hate a big pink or yellow diamond on her finger.</p><p>I stopped at a case filled with more subtle pieces. They looked more classic, timeless even, and I liked the look. And then I noticed it. A round diamond surrounded on all sides by smaller diamonds. The band held diamonds as well.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth, can I see this ring please?\u201d I looked up, searching for her.</p><p>She smiled again, rushing over. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe round one right there with all the diamonds around it,\u201d I said, pointing.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful choice. Now this band comes with either a two-and-a-half-, three-, or four-carat diamond in the center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost me,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cThe size of the diamond. The center one for this band can accommodate any of the sizes I mentioned.\u201d</p><p>I contemplated her words, but still had no idea what they meant. \u201cCan I see the difference in sizes? I have no idea how big or small that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, let\u2019s go in the back.\u201d</p><p>She led me toward a private office in the back, the ring I picked out coming with us in a small white paper bag. \u201cPlease sit.\u201d she motioned to the black leather chair, and I sat down.</p><p>Elizabeth unfolded a black velvet ring holder and gently placed the diamond ring inside before unfolding another small envelope and pouring out three diamonds. She arranged them flawlessly on the velvet with her tweezers.</p><p>I sat back and admired them. \u201cOK, I think she\u2019d hate the four-carat one. That thing is enormous and would take up her entire hand.\u201d</p><p>I released a long breath, wanting to choose the right ring at the right size. I pulled at my shirt to relieve the pressure that raced through me. \u201cWhat size do you like best with that band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly I think the three carats is divine. And the band itself is gorgeous. They complement each other beautifully.\u201d</p><p>I nodded in agreement. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s go with the three carats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d She smiled. \u201cOne more question. Do you want this particular diamond, or would you like me to look for a better one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d She placed a black contraption against her eye as she examined the diamond. \u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful diamond. I don\u2019t see any inclusions, scratches, or marks in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not a piece of crap, right?\u201d</p><p>She laughed uncomfortably, clearly stunned by my language. \u201cNo, sir. Definitely not. We don\u2019t carry any crap in our store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Then I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>Strength</p><p>Cassie</p><p>I told Melissa I didn\u2019t want to talk on the drive back from LAX. I leaned my head against her car\u2019s passenger window and closed my eyes part of the time, and watched the palm trees fly by the rest. When I walked through the door of our old apartment, relief filtered through every weight-induced crack in my bones. The pressure I endured living in New York had become such a constant companion that I\u2019d stopped being aware of the heaviness that bore down on me.</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at Melissa and took a long, deep breath, filling my lungs before virtually crumpling on the couch.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk now?\u201d she asked, tossing me a bottle of water from the fridge.</p><p>I stared at her, wanting to confess everything, but not really knowing where to start. \u201cIt\u2019s just a relief to be away from everything and everyone. I had no idea how stressed out I was until I wasn\u2019t there. You know?\u201d I buried my head in my hands.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d Melissa smiled before disappearing into her room.</p><p>My eyes crinkled as I wondered what she could possibly have for me. She didn\u2019t even know I was flying out before last night. She reappeared with a small, red mesh bag in her hand and sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cI was going to mail it to you, but now I don\u2019t have to. Open it,\u201d her bright blue eyes danced as she watched me.</p><p>I pulled at the satin strings and poured the contents of the tiny bag into my hand. A brass ball chain holding an old silver key appeared. Confused, but still liking the concept, I eyed my best friend, \u201cIt\u2019s cool. Did you get one for you too?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes before grabbing the key out of my opened hand and turning it over. \u201cRead it.\u201d</p><p>I inspected the tiny letters stamped onto the top, holding it close to my eyes. It read, STRENGTH. I smiled, pulling my head through the open space of the necklace without unlatching it. I watched the key fall between my breasts and loved that I would be able to hide it under my clothing if I wanted to. \u201cThis is really awesome. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a story that goes along with it,\u201d she started and I turned my attention toward her. \u201cSo I bought you this particular word because I think with everything going on in your life right now, you could use the extra STRENGTH. But there will come a day when you\u2019ll see someone who will need your key and your word more than you do. And when that day comes, you have to pay it forward and give your necklace to them.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched. \u201cSo I have to give it away?\u201d I asked, rubbing my thumb along the gift I wasn\u2019t ready to part with just yet.</p><p>\u201cYep. That\u2019s the whole concept behind these necklaces. That we give them away at some point. When someone needs your word more than you,\u201d she reached for the key, touching it briefly before letting it go. \u201cBut not right now. You need it right now.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled sharply before exhaling. \u201cThis is really cool. I mean, all of it. The necklace. The word. Giving it away. The whole concept and idea. I love it. Thank you so much.\u201d I leaned into her and squeezed as much as I could without getting up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew you would. And you\u2019re welcome. So, are you going to tell me what\u2019s going on? You didn\u2019t fly out here at the last minute for no reason.\u201d</p><p>My smile dropped as my bottom lip jutted out in a pout. \u201cStop trying to psychoanalyze me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m good at. Plus, I like pointing out all your broken parts,\u201d she added with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo you can be thankful it\u2019s not you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBitch! No. So I can help fix you.\u201d She nudged against me. \u201cWhat did Jack say about the article?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much, really. I think he\u2019s just worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all worried.\u201d She placed her head on my shoulder, and I leaned against it.</p><p>There were two quick knocks on the door before it opened and Dean burst through. \u201cYou told him I was here?\u201d I whispered to Melissa.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered in response.</p> <p>\u201cSis. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Dean practically sprinted to me. I loved it when he called me that, even though it wasn\u2019t official.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was here,\u201d I asked, before he snatched me up from the couch into a bear hug. I missed Dean and seeing him forced me to realize just how much.</p><p>\u201cJack called me, out of his mind. Told me to go check on you and make sure you were OK. He said he thinks you broke up with him. Is that true?\u201d Dean\u2019s voice was filled with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You did what?\u201d Melissa asked through her surprise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I did. I just left and told him I didn\u2019t know if I could do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cassie! Are you trying to fucking kill the guy?\u201d Melissa shook her head. \u201cAfter everything the two of you have been through?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is it always about Jack and how my decisions affect him? Why isn\u2019t it ever about me and what all of this bullshit does to me?\u201d I broke down, the tears spilling out as I leaned back onto the couch.</p><p>Dean dropped onto the other side of me, wrapping his arms around me, \u201cI don\u2019t want you guys to break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fucking wreck on the inside. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d I looked at him before looking away. I hated disappointing Dean. \u201cChrystle\u2019s stupid article pushed me over the edge. I can\u2019t take another picture of me with \u2018home wrecker\u2019 or \u2018man-stealing slut\u2019 written across it.\u201d I buried my head in my hands, pressing my palms against my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat does any of that have to do with Jack, though? I mean, really?\u201d Melissa\u2019s forehead creased.</p><p>\u201cIt has everything to do with Jack!\u201d I shouted, throwing my hands up in the air. \u201cI\u2019m only dealing with all of this because I\u2019m dating him. This keeps happening to me because I\u2019m his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you two weren\u2019t together, then no one would post stuff about you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I breathed out a loud, annoyed breath. \u201cObviously! They wouldn\u2019t care about me if I wasn\u2019t with him.\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s hand rested on my thigh. \u201cWell, then. You should definitely let these strangers dictate your love life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk.\u201d I narrowed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I honestly can\u2019t believe I\u2019m sitting here listening to this. You would walk away from Jack just to stop some stupid gossip?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how it feels. I know it probably seems like I shouldn\u2019t care, or I should let it roll off my back, but people read those things and they believe them without question. They shout mean things to me all the time at Jack\u2019s games. New York might be a big city, but it feels really small sometimes. Everything that gets posted, I have to deal with. Not anyone else. Me.\u201d I pointed at my chest. \u201cAnd it sucks.\u201d</p><p>Dean reached for my shoulder. \u201cCassie, leaving Jack isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cAll the harassment would stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think you\u2019d be OK not being with him?\u201d Dean pleaded, his voice becoming more agitated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not OK right now and I\u2019m with him.\u201d</p><p>Melissa cleared her throat. \u201cYou know you\u2019re not a real person to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real person to whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people that post on those websites, they don\u2019t know you. They don\u2019t know anything about you. It\u2019s really easy for people to talk shit about someone they don\u2019t know. Especially when it\u2019s someone they think they\u2019ll never see in real life.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never been one of those types to write nasty things online about people I didn\u2019t know. Did I read gossip sites and watch shows about celebrities? Of course I did. But I always remembered there were two sides to every story, and I never trusted what was reported. Melissa\u2019s mom instilled that in both of us from a young age. Occupational hazard, she called it.</p><p>I sniffed, wiping away a tear as Meli continued. \u201cYou know this. You\u2019ve just never been at the receiving end of it like this before. Last year was bad, but it was nothing like this. It\u2019s horrible and hurtful, but people do it because they can. They hide behind a computer screen where no one else can see them. They aren\u2019t held accountable for their words. They can type them, press enter, and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I read those words and they stay with me. When someone takes a picture of me at lunch eating a burger with a caption that says, \u2018Maybe she should lay off the burgers\u2019...\u201d I looked down at my thighs before staring ahead at the wall.</p><p>\u201cI know. We grew up out here, surrounded by celebrity rumors and paparazzi and all the craziness. You know that people enjoy tearing other people down. They get off on seeing you fall apart,\u201d Melissa added with a snarl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never understood that. Why do people love seeing other people in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Because people are petty, shallow, and jealous? Because they think they want what you have and when it\u2019s not so glamorous, they\u2019re happy it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be?\u201d</p><p>Dean sighed and I directed my glossy gaze at him. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly girls, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly girls what?\u201d Melissa shot back, her tone defensive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly girls who read those magazines, watch those shows, and post on those websites. You girls love taking each other down a notch.\u201d</p><p>I nodded in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s so true. You\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s never gonna change.\u201d Melissa rolled her eyes and exhaled loudly. \u201cGirls are competitive bitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? Why are we like that? I mean, if all those people who talked shit actually got to know me, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d like me.\u201d I looked between Melissa and Dean, longing for reassurance.</p><p>Melissa grabbed me by both of my shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you! They don\u2019t know you. And they never will. You\u2019re someone they see on TV, or in a magazine, online, or at a game even. You\u2019re not someone who has dinner at their house on Sunday night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I should start planning dinners with strangers?\u201d I choked back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBitch. I\u2019m saying that these people suck. They suck. Not you. And you\u2019re punishing Jack for what these people are doing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Sis,\u201d Dean added with a smile. \u201cPeople always posted things about Jack on Facebook and online and stuff. They were mostly lies, but Jack never read any of it. So it never affected him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to stop reading it all. Then this stupid Chrystle thing came out.\u201d I turned to Melissa. \u201cHow can she say all these things, anyway? They\u2019re outright lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a reputable magazine. It\u2019s a trashy tabloid. They\u2019re sort of known for printing half truths.\u201d Melissa tilted her head.</p><p>\u201cCan I sue her for defamation of character or slander? Something...\u201d I pondered out loud, before propping my feet up on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth your time and effort. In those kinds of cases, you have to prove that you were affected by her story. You would have to prove that your character was defamed, by say, a loss of job or income due to the things she said.\u201d She stopped to take a drink of water. \u201cSame thing with slander. You have to prove that her statements were made maliciously to cause you harm. And you have to prove the harm it actually caused.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my head back against the couch pillows. \u201cI swear she knows all this before she does it. It\u2019s the same shit she did to Jack with the annulment, knowing he would have to prove her claims were false.\u201d</p><p>Dean made a quick sound of disgust. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that little bitch knows exactly what she\u2019s doing before she does it.\u201d</p><p>I yawned, covering my mouth with my hand before wiping at my tired eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so tired. Dean, can I come over and see Gran and Gramps tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better. They know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>We all stood up at the same time, and I hugged Dean tight, thankful he stopped by, before walking into my old room. I looked around at the empty walls; the memories still existed within the confines of this space, even if the mementos didn\u2019t. The front door closed and Melissa knocked softly before opening my door.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss living here?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh.\u201d Her face crinkled with pleasure.</p><p>I moved to sit on the bed and patted the empty spot next to me. \u201cSo, tell me what the freaking deal is with you two.\u201d I nodded my head in the direction of the door Dean just exited. Melissa shrugged her shoulders and I leaned into her. \u201cI know you like him. Why are you torturing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you like him. What I can\u2019t figure out is why you won\u2019t tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted before changing the subject. \u201cBut I do know that you\u2019re taking your frustrations out on the one person who would literally do anything for you. Breaking up with Jack won\u2019t fix you or make you better. It will only break you more. And you know it. So stop pretending like you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice subject change.\u201d</p><p>She hopped off the bed, leaving me with her words before blowing a kiss into the air and closing the door behind her. Brat. I hated how well she knew me.</p><p>I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed. I couldn\u2019t remember ever sleeping so soundly. I rolled over and reached for my cell phone when I realized it wasn\u2019t near me. I\u2019d turned it off before I left New York and hadn\u2019t turned it back on. No wonder I slept so well.</p><p>Normally I\u2019d search frantically for my phone, but I decided it was nice to be disconnected and left it turned off in my purse. After brushing my teeth, I walked into the living room. Melissa was sitting on the couch, watching TV. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>She clicked it off before turning to face me. \u201cMorning. Hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarved,\u201d I admitted. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I ate anything, and I hadn\u2019t been hungry at all last night. But now my empty stomach growled and twisted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She chuckled before standing up and making her way into the kitchen. \u201cWell, I only have cereal and toast. That\u2019s gonna have to do.\u201d She popped her head out from behind the cabinets. \u201cUnless you want to go out to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. Cereal and toast is perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo sit down. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d Melissa shooed me away with her hand, and I made my way to the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think the worst part about all of this is?\u201d I watched as my tiny best friend balanced bowls, milk, and cereal boxes in her arms.</p> <p>\u201cThat you\u2019re an emotional mess who thinks her life would be better off without Jack Fucking Carter in it?\u201d She cocked an eyebrow in my direction, and I frowned.</p><p>\u201cNo. Smartass.\u201d I took a deep breath before finishing my thought. \u201cIt\u2019s that I\u2019m supposed to stay quiet. While people post all these things and say whatever they want about me and Jack, I\u2019m not supposed to defend myself. And I hate the way that feels because I feel like I\u2019m being bullied in a way, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are kind of being bullied,\u201d she agreed, setting everything on the table before plopping two pieces of bread into the toaster.</p><p>\u201cSo I feel like by keeping my mouth shut, I\u2019m telling all these people that it\u2019s OK to do the things they\u2019re doing. Like my silence condones their behavior. It doesn\u2019t feel right to keep quiet. It should be OK for me to stand up for myself.\u201d I poured cereal into my bowl until it overflowed onto the table. I picked up the scattered pieces and popped them into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why people in your situation normally have a PR person, or a publicist, or a lawyer on their side. Those people speak out on your behalf. Which brings me to something I want to talk to you about anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your personal publicist, it\u2019s my job to\u2014\u201d</p><p>I laughed, mocking her tone. \u201cAs my personal publicist?\u201d</p><p>Her lips narrowed, her eyes squinting. \u201cGive me a break, Cass. If you ever hired someone else to handle your PR, I\u2019d disown you. And so would my mom. I can handle this for you.\u201d</p><p>Melissa worked at her mom\u2019s publicity firm in the summers and would join the staff full time as soon as she had her degree in hand. I asked Melissa when we were still in high school why she bothered applying to colleges when she could learn everything she needed to by working with her mom directly. But Meli\u2019s mom insisted she have the college experience and wouldn\u2019t let her start working at seventeen. I remembered her saying, \u201cYou have the rest of your life to work, Melissa. Don\u2019t be in such a hurry to get it started. Go live. Have fun. Enjoy college and everything that comes with it.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my elbows on the table. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I was thinking,\u201d she started.</p><p>\u201cAlways dangerous,\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>\u201cStop interrupting me! This is serious, Cass! I\u2019m trying to help you!\u201d she shouted, her annoyance clearly growing.</p><p>I puckered my lips, stifling a chuckle, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Go on. I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d I marked an X across my chest with my finger.</p><p>She breathed out. \u201cOK. So I was thought about this all night and I think it\u2019s brilliant! You and Jack should do some sort of interview together. Like a human-interest story on what it\u2019s like being a professional athlete and for you, what it\u2019s like dating one. And you can address all the Chrystle accusations and lies, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeli, people who lose their house in a flood, or an entire community wiped out by some freak super storm... that\u2019s a human-interest story. Not the girl whining about how hard it is to date an athlete and how mean people are. They\u2019ll only hate me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if it\u2019s done right.\u201d Her bright blue eyes looked into mine, her eyebrows raised.</p><p>I shook my head wildly. \u201cWe\u2019re not a human-interest story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you are. Those tabloids wouldn\u2019t sell if people weren\u2019t interested. And trust me, they\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened. \u201cYou think people would care about our side of the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, they\u2019d care! But the story will have two purposes. The first will be to put that little lying bitch in her place. And the second will be your public image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy public image?\u201d I tried to follow, but I was confused.</p><p>\u201cIf people see you as a real person, with problems just like they have, then maybe they\u2019ll stop being so mean. If they hear about all the things you and Jack have gone through as a couple, they\u2019ll sympathize with you instead of hate you. You won\u2019t be someone who\u2019s unattainable and only seen from a distance. You\u2019ll be relatable. It\u2019s hard to hate the girl you\u2019d be friends with if you knew her.\u201d She smiled, quoting my feelings from last night.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re even allowed to do something like that. I\u2019d have to get permission from the team\u2019s publicity department first. And who the hell would even want to run a story like that?\u201d</p><p>Melissa rolled her eyes, my question apparently stupid. \u201cRight now? I bet I could get almost anyone to run that story. But you work for a freaking magazine, Cassie! A human-interest magazine,\u201d she reminded me pointedly.</p><p>\u201cBut those aren\u2019t the types of stories we print.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to tell me your magazine doesn\u2019t ever profile anyone local? Don\u2019t you ever do puff type pieces on New York\u2019s elite?\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips together before responding. \u201cActually they do. But it\u2019s online only and never in the actual printed version.\u201d</p><p>A wide grin appeared on Melissa\u2019s face as her hands clapped together. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Online can be just as effective. Think your boss will go for it?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYeah, I do, actually. She mentioned something about it before I left. But I need to talk to Jack first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an easy sell. He\u2019ll do anything if it means keeping you happy.\u201d</p><p>Love Makes A Life Worth Living</p><p>Cassie</p><p>After almost an hour of arguing, I convinced Melissa to drive me over to Gran and Gramps\u2019s house. I still didn\u2019t know why, but she still wanted to keep her distance from Dean, and meeting Gran and Gramps was not part of her master plan.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop by the store real quick so I can pick up some wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ll get some too. I\u2019ll need it,\u201d she suggested, pulling into the supermarket parking lot.</p><p>I looked around at how spread out and spacious everything seemed. New York was so compact. I\u2019d forgotten how different Southern California was. And I really missed the palm trees. My heart squeezed as I took in the sight of them.</p><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d I asked Meli before shutting the car door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201d She typed out a text before throwing her phone into her glove compartment.</p><p>After grabbing two bottles of wine and a small flower arrangement, we headed toward the checkout stand. Pictures of Chrystle and Jack\u2019s wedding suddenly appeared in my vision as the tabloid sat in the wire rack, mocking me. My heart pounded, and I couldn\u2019t step forward; my legs trembled forcefully.</p><p>And then another sight caught my eye. More pictures of Jack and Chrystle, feeding cake to each other and posing with their bridal party. \u201cMelissa,\u201d I tried to squeak out, but all sounds failed me.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. Cass. Cassie?\u201d</p><p>I turned to face her, my body numb and eyes already tearing up. She scooted our items up on the conveyer belt. \u201cWe\u2019ll take these, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see some ID?\u201d the clerk asked, and Melissa thankfully pulled her license from her wallet.</p><p>I stared at the newer, more mainstream magazine in horror. Chrystle had sold her story to not only one magazine, but two. What else had she done? \u201cDo you want to grab that?\u201d Melissa asked through my shock.</p><p>I managed to shake my head when the clerk said, \u201cDo you know him? Jack Carter? He used to live here, but he plays for the Mets now. Can you believe all the stuff him and his new girlfriend did to that poor girl? It\u2019s crazy. I guess fame makes you do horrible stuff.\u201d</p><p>I turned to face her, multiple emotions running through me like a fucking tornado. She gasped as she noticed my face, her mouth twisting into a slight snarl. \u201cOh my gosh. You\u2019re her! Jack\u2019s girlfriend, Cassie. Right?\u201d Her eyes narrowed with accusation.</p><p>I opened my mouth to say God knows what when Melissa rescued me. \u201cWhat? Cassie lives in New York with Jack. Why the hell would she be here?\u201d She grabbed the receipt, stuffing it in the bag before tugging me by the wrist toward the door.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>I snapped out of my wedding-photo daze. \u201cSorry.\u201d I apologized, although I wasn\u2019t quite sure what for.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Meli shook her head. \u201cThat was brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to my life.\u201d I extended my hands with a shrug.</p><p>My mind raced with thoughts about Chrystle and thoughts about Jack, and how even all the way across the country I couldn\u2019t get away from the media nightmare I now lived in. I wanted to focus on being happy right now, excited to see Gran and Gramps. I let those thoughts take over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love Gran and Gramps, Meli. They\u2019re awesome.\u201d I looked at her, a large fake smile plastered on my face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to love them,\u201d she responded without even a glance.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? After we fix me, we really need to do some work on your dysfunctional ass.\u201d</p><p>That garnered a glance. A nasty, wicked one. She pulled her car up to the curb and I hopped out, excited to see the family waiting inside for me. Dean popped his head out from behind the screen door, his eyes meeting mine. I widened mine, and he figured out what I was trying to convey and bolted through the door and to the side of our car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came, Melissa.\u201d He smiled at her, grabbing the bag from the store.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only been trying to get me here for months.\u201d She turned a pointed glare at me.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d Gran\u2019s voice spilled out from an open window.</p><p>\u201cIs the kitten here already?\u201d Gramps voice quickly followed.</p><p>I arched my eyebrows at Dean. \u201cThe kitten?\u201d I asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask. He started calling you that after you moved. We think it\u2019s funny, so we never correct him.\u201d</p><p>Dean opened the door for us, and as I stepped inside my heart immediately filled with love. Nothing had changed since my last visit, except for the three new black-and-white photographs on the wall.</p><p>Melissa pointed at them. \u201cCass, you took these, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered with a small smile before tossing a quick glance at Dean. I turned my head, noticing one additional new portrait. It was taken the day Jack signed to play for the Diamondbacks. Five people were in the photo, and I was one of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re practically family already,\u201d Melissa said as she glanced at the picture.</p><p>If a heart could grow in size, mine enlarged on the spot. I\u2019d been more at home here with this family than with the one I was supposed to call my own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grabbing the bag from Dean, I started walking toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you around the house.\u201d Dean grabbed Melissa by the hand, leaving me alone.</p><p>Gran and Gramps sat at the table, drinking out of coffee mugs. Gran scooted out of her chair and shuffled toward me, her arms outstretched. \u201cOh, Cassie. It\u2019s so good to see you. We miss you.\u201d She kissed the side of my cheek and hugged me as tightly as her frail arms could.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too. Here, I brought these.\u201d I pulled out the flowers and the wine.</p> <p>\u201cThe kitten is here!\u201d Gramps practically shouted before wrapping his burly arms around me, the smell of tobacco lingering on his clothes.</p><p>I breathed him in, the scent reminding me of being here with Jack. \u201cGramps! I miss you the most. Don\u2019t tell Gran,\u201d I whisper-shouted near his ear.</p><p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d Gran yelled out from the sink where she worked on arranging the flowers in a vase.</p><p>\u201cCome sit,\u201d Gramps said as he plopped back into his chair.</p><p>\u201cShould we open the wine?\u201d Gran asked, still arranging the flowers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m OK. We brought those bottles for you guys to enjoy with dinner. Save them.\u201d I winked at Gramps, and he grinned.</p><p>Gran placed her hand on my shoulder as she passed me to sit down. She sipped from her mug before eyeing me. \u201cSo, dear, how is everything?\u201d</p><p>My smile faded quicker than I intended. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Everything\u2019s good,\u201d I lied, as the realization that being around Jack\u2019s family without Jack was harder than I anticipated. I missed him. And I knew I couldn\u2019t get anything past Gran.</p><p>Gran reached out a hand, touching my fingers gently. \u201cWe saw that dreadful magazine. Why won\u2019t she just go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve wondered the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack said you\u2019re having a hard time dealing with it all. Tell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d Gran had a way of making you talk about the things you wanted to avoid.</p> <p>I looked into Gramps\u2019s tired eyes, the worry lines around them increasing. \u201cHe\u2019s right. I\u2019m just having a hard time dealing with all the press and the Internet sites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What do they say?\u201d Gramps asked through his confusion.</p><p>\u201cJust a bunch of mean stuff about how I\u2019m not hot enough for Jack. I\u2019m too fat. They take my picture and basically say whatever they want about it. They just make things up. And now with the whole Chrystle thing, I feel like I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, you know how much we love you, right?\u201d Gran asked, and I nodded. \u201cIt broke our hearts what Jack did to you. We were so disappointed and sad. But to know that you\u2019ve taken him back after everything, we can\u2019t tell you how happy that makes us.\u201d She reached out to squeeze Gramps\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThe press sounds dreadful. Truly awful. And I can\u2019t begin to imagine what it must be like to deal with that on a daily basis. But, dear, one day, all of that will fade away. The press, the Internet, the websites, Chrystle,\u201d she paused, \u201cthey will all be things of the past.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward, cupping my face in her hand. \u201cI know you can live your life without all of those things, but can you really live your life without Jack?\u201d</p><p>They already knew the answer as I blinked back the tears. \u201cI think I\u2019d be miserable without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love him,\u201d Gramps called out, joy animating his voice.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t give up. One day you\u2019ll look around and realize that all the things you thought mattered so much, really didn\u2019t matter much at all.\u201d Gran eyed Gramps, the love between them apparent. \u201cWhat matters the most is who you love. Because when everything else is a distant memory, the people you love are all that\u2019s left. And love is the single most important thing we can do in our lives. Give it. Receive it. Teach others how to do it.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with tears again. \u201cLove is the most important thing? Above everything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Gramps said with a crooked smile. \u201cIt\u2019s funny the things you think will last forever when you\u2019re young. I figured I\u2019d work until I died. But even work stops at some point. And you find yourself looking around, taking stock of your life, and you realize that you don\u2019t give a shit about where you worked, or what you did to bring in money, but you care about the lives you touched. The love you shared. The family you created. You care about who is standing beside you when the shit hits the fan.\u201d</p><p>Gran swatted at Gramps twice, presumably for each time he cursed, but missed. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cThe older you get, the more you realize that it isn\u2019t about the material things, or pride or ego. It\u2019s about our hearts and who they beat for. I know your heart beats for Jack in the same way that his heart beats for you. I don\u2019t think one can survive without the other. Do you?\u201d</p><p>I wiped at the tears rolling down my cheeks, their words striking a chord inside my soul. How could I ever think I\u2019d be OK without Jack in my life? I might be able to distract myself for a little while, but eventually I would realize that my heart lay vacant and cold. \u201cNo. I\u2019d be miserable without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to figure out a way to let all the other stuff go. You have to let Jack carry some of the load for you. If you keep things from him, he can\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Gramps raised his hand before quickly adding, \u201cI know you ladies like to think that we can read your minds, but we can\u2019t. We don\u2019t know anything that\u2019s going on in those heads of yours unless you tell us.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know you\u2019re right. It\u2019s just easier said than done right now.\u201d</p><p>Gran didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cIf you quit on Jack, you\u2019re giving everyone what they want. Chrystle wins. And I would hate to see her win at anything.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cBut you and Jack would be the real losers because you\u2019d lose each other. People spend their whole lives searching for the kind of love that the two of you share. That\u2019s what life is all about.\u201d</p><p>Gramps chimed in, \u201cLove is life. If you miss out on love, you miss out on life.\u201d</p><p>Melissa and Dean shuffled into the kitchen, goofy smiles on both their faces. \u201cGran, Gramps, this is Cassie\u2019s best friend, Melissa.\u201d Dean beamed with pride as he introduced her to his family.</p><p>Gramps grinned. \u201cHi, Melissa. You\u2019re just as pretty as the kitten,\u201d he said with a wink, and Melissa couldn\u2019t help but smile even wider.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d Gran extended her hand before glancing in my direction and whispering, \u201cThis one\u2019s going to need a little work on the Dean front, isn\u2019t she?\u201d I nodded, wondering how the hell Gran seemed to instinctively know everything.</p><p>After a couple hours of polite conversation and Gran force-feeding us sandwiches, Melissa and I said good-bye. Dean stood on the porch with a pout on his face as he watched us leave. She begged him for some time alone with me, but he claimed he wanted to spend time with me too. They compromised on girl time tonight and Dean time tomorrow. I laughed at their conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou like them, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked Melissa as she lowered the car radio.</p><p>\u201cThey are pretty great. How was your alone time with them? Dean insisted we let you guys talk by yourselves.\u201d She sounded slightly annoyed by Dean\u2019s suggestion.</p><p>\u201cI appreciated it,\u201d I admitted, hoping to relieve her irritation. \u201cThey\u2019re so awesome. They always seem to know just what to say and how to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say this time?\u201d she asked, her eyes focused directly in front of her.</p><p>\u201cThey talked about the importance of love. And how in the end, it\u2019s all that really matters, and it\u2019s all you have left when everything else is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound almost as smart as I am,\u201d she said, and I smacked her shoulder with the back of my hand. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>I watched as we passed the restaurant where Jack and I had our first date, the quick jolts of pain to my heart reminding me how much I missed him.</p><p>\u201cSo, did they fix you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still need to figure out how to find some balance, but all of you are right. Breaking up with Jack won\u2019t solve anything in the long run. I\u2019d regret it eventually, and I\u2019d probably never get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Cass, Jack isn\u2019t the only one who changed. I mean, you changed him. But he changed you too. Whether you realize it or not, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>Hearing Melissa say those words solidified what I\u2019d known for some time. She\u2019d told me the same thing back in college, but it seemed to carry more weight now. I felt like I\u2019d grown up twenty years in the span of the last two.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I honestly can\u2019t imagine my life without him. And I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you need to stop running away from him when things get rough. You do that a lot, and eventually he\u2019s going to get pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t run away,\u201d I sniped defensively.</p><p>\u201cReally? You left the state! You\u2019re either running away or shutting him out completely. And both of those things suck.\u201d</p><p>I watched the palm trees blur into green streaks across the sky blue backdrop. Melissa was right. \u201cI\u2019ll work on it.\u201d I\u2019d bottled so many of my emotions inside because I didn\u2019t want to burden Jack with them. And I needed to learn how to clear my head with Jack in the picture instead of pushing him out of it.</p><p>Melissa\u2019s phone started to ring. \u201cCan you see who it is?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed for the phone and noticed Jack\u2019s name flashing across the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil. Answer it.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped to the floor. \u201cHi,\u201d I answered nervously.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your phone?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice was tight and agitated.</p><p>\u201cI left it in the apartment. Why? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck it as soon as you get back and then you fucking tell me,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>\u201cJack? Hello?\u201d I pulled the phone from my ear to look at the screen. \u201cHoly shit, he hung up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Melissa sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. He told me to check my phone.\u201d My head started to spin as I wondered what the hell could have happened.</p><p>Don\u2019t</p><p>Jack</p><p>My cell phone beeped, signaling I had a new text message. Instead of a return phone number, the sender was an anonymous e-mail. I considered not opening the message, knowing that nothing good could come from an anonymous source. After a short battle with myself, I clicked the message and a picture popped up.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Matteo kissing Cassie displayed on my screen and violent urges instantly ripped through my guts. My temper flared as a fire blazed through my every pore. I wanted to tear Matteo\u2019s fucking head off. How dare he put his lips on my girl? How dare he fucking even think about touching her?</p><p>But she let him. She wasn\u2019t pushing him away in the picture, she was kissing him back. Fuck, even her goddamn eyes were closed! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I dialed Cassie\u2019s number, but it went straight to voice mail. Again. Where the hell was she? I forwarded the picture message to her cell.</p><p>She\u2019d bailed on me in the middle of all the Chrystle drama and now this. How would she explain this? I looked at it, clear as day with my own two eyes. Matteo\u2019s filthy fucking lips stuck to my beautiful Kitten\u2019s. Have I been fooled this whole time?</p><p>I walked into our bedroom and pulled out the velvet ring box I\u2019d buried in my sock drawer. It creaked as I opened it to peer at the shiny diamond inside. How could she do this to me? To us? Shaking my head, I squeezed my eyes closed before opening them again. The image of Matteo kissing Cassie plagued my every thought.</p><p>I snapped the box shut and pitched it forcefully through the opened closet door. It crashed against something with a loud thud, and I walked out of our room not caring what happened to the contents.</p> <p>Maybe it was all an elaborate ploy, her inability to handle the press? How long had she and Matteo been sneaking around behind my back? Had I forced them together by asking him to keep her safe during my games? Was this all my fault? I wondered how long I had until the media got ahold of that picture. With my luck, it was already posted everywhere.</p><p>I dialed Melissa\u2019s cell phone, determined to reach Cassie. I listened as it rang three times. Cassie answered, and she sounded nervous when she said hi. I asked where her phone was, unable to hide my anger. Her voice rose, and she actually sounded confused and worried when she told me she left it at Melissa\u2019s apartment and asked what was wrong.</p><p>\u201cCheck it as soon as you get back and then you fucking tell me,\u201d I said and ended the call. I didn\u2019t want to hear another word out of her mouth until she looked at the same picture I had. I waited. And grew more agitated with each passing minute. The press was already having a field day with all of Chrystle\u2019s accusations, now they\u2019d have even more to talk shit about.</p><p>On top of it all, now I needed to find a new driver. Matteo\u2019s work here was finished. No matter what the story, I didn\u2019t want to see his face anywhere near mine again.</p><p>I paced our apartment, my anger growing as my patience wore thin. Half tempted to call Melissa again, my phone suddenly rang. I answered the call, but said nothing.</p> <p>\u201cJack? Are you there? It\u2019s not what it looks like, I swear.\u201d She pleaded through the phone, and I found myself surprised at my lack of sympathy.</p><p>\u201cSo, he didn\u2019t kiss you? \u2019Cause it looks like he\u2019s kissing you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cYes, he kissed me, but...\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long, what?\u201d she asked, her breathing shaky.</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p> <p>She inhaled sharply. \u201cWhat? Nothing is going on, Jack, I swear. There\u2019s nothing between me and Matteo. He kissed me, and I pushed him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re pushing him away in this picture. Did you like it? His lips on yours. Looks like you might like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pushed him off of me, Jack! I told him no! I told him I loved you.\u201d She started to cry.</p><p>It tugged at my chest, the sound of her crying, but I pretended not to care. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about the kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we haven\u2019t even talked. Because it meant nothing. He apologized. He was scared to death of losing his job with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be. \u2019Cause I\u2019m either going to fire him or fucking kill him.\u201d Or both. \u201cYou know what, Cass, I don\u2019t blame another guy for falling for you. I don\u2019t. But you... I never expected this from you, of all people. I feel like I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Jack. Of course you know me. I love you. I\u2019ll come home tomorrow. We\u2019ll fix this. I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I stopped her rant.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t what? Don\u2019t come home?\u201d She sounded like she couldn\u2019t believe what I said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you,\u201d I admitted, my guts feeling like they had just been shredded.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t do this. Jack, please,\u201d she begged.</p><p>I leaned against the granite countertop, thoughts racing, emotions clashing. I was pissed off. I\u2019d worked so hard to break down this girl\u2019s walls, but no matter what I did, it was never good enough. She always ended up blocking me out, and I didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit, Cassie! I haven\u2019t done anything since I came back into your life except try to be a better man for you. I try every single day to do right by you. It\u2019s all I want, to be good enough. To make up for the mistake I made. I\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>My frustrations mounted as I vented. \u201cBut you walk around here constantly keeping shit from me. And when things finally get to be too much for you, what do you do? You run away. I know you\u2019re used to being let down and disappointed, but we\u2019re supposed to be a team. We hold each other up when the other one\u2019s about to fall. We don\u2019t run away and leave our other half to fend for him or herself.\u201d</p><p>She stayed quiet, clearly having no defense for her actions, so I continued. \u201cYou left me here to deal with Chrystle and her shit all alone. I know you\u2019re hurt and angry, but I am too. Did you even once stop to think about how I felt? How her article affected me and made me look? No. Because you left me here and took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said with a sob.</p><p>\u201cYeah? For which part?\u201d I asked, and could hear her sobbing in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for all of it, Jack. You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t deal with things well and I promise I\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled through my nose as I stared out the balcony window. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. You keep things inside and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to bother you with stuff I think is stupid. I don\u2019t want you to worry about things when you\u2019re on the field. You have enough to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide what\u2019s stupid and what isn\u2019t. If it\u2019s bothering you, then you need to tell me. You need to communicate with me. I fucking tell you everything. I share everything with you because I don\u2019t ever want there to be another secret between us again. I don\u2019t like keeping things from you, and I don\u2019t appreciate you keeping things from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say other than I\u2019m sorry. I know I\u2019m not good at being an open book, but I\u2019ll try to be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know I let you down before and you don\u2019t trust me completely. But this goes beyond that, and I think we both know it.\u201d She sniffed, and her breath hitched repeatedly as I continued. \u201cAfter tonight\u2019s game, we\u2019ll be on the road for few days. I think we should take this time to figure out what we both want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I want,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I lied. Of course I wanted Cassie, but I was hurt. I lost her trust in one terrible decision-making moment, but she lost pieces of mine every time she shut me out, kept me at distance, or didn\u2019t care enough about our relationship to stay put and fight. I wanted to know we were solid, but her actions only confused me.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d she said with hurt in her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything to fix this, Jack. Tell me what you need me to do.\u201d</p><p>I took a long, deep breath. It was finally my turn.</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d I said before ending the call. Now she would know how it felt to be on the other end of that fucking request.</p><p>I immediately dialed the car service where Matteo worked and asked for the owner. \u201cHi, Mr. Lombardi, Jack Carter here. I need to cancel all services with Matteo and request a new driver starting today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Carter. Did Matteo do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>The media would inform him soon enough, if he didn\u2019t know already. \u201cI just want a new driver. Do not send Matteo here today or I\u2019ll lose my shit. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI, uh... understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still require the driver to stay for the duration of the games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not.\u201d</p><p>I pressed End on my cell and typed out a text message to Matteo for good measure.</p><p>You\u2019re fired. Don\u2019t show your face here again and stay the fuck away from Cassie.</p><p>I tossed my phone down, not expecting a response when it beeped right back.</p><p>Jack, I\u2019m really sorry. Can I come there and talk to you?</p><p>I cracked my neck from side to side, the idea of seeing Matteo igniting the flames of my temper.</p><p>Not a good idea, man. Not right now.</p><p>It will take 2 seconds. Please. I know you want to kill me. Let me explain.</p><p>Explain? Explain how his lips touched my girlfriend\u2019s? What the hell was there to explain? Maybe he wanted me to kick his ass? I glanced at the clock on the wall. I had time.</p><p>Fine. But don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.</p><p>My body tensed all over as the image of him kissing Cassie burned into my mind. Within minutes, he knocked on my door. I hesitated, knowing that if I started hitting him, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to stop.</p><p>I opened the door, the dejected look on his face almost made me feel sorry for him. Almost. I clenched my hands, balling them into fists as my mind raced. I stepped back from the door, not wanting to be near him. I didn\u2019t invite him in.</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m really sorry. There\u2019s no excuse for my behavior. It\u2019s just that she looked so sad and so distraught that it killed me to see her like that. I just wanted her to be happy. My emotions took over, and I got all jumbled up inside.\u201d</p><p>He had feelings for her.</p><p>I glared at him, willing myself to stay calm as he continued. \u201cI feel horrible and I know you can never forgive me, but you need to know that Cassie stopped me. She shoved me away and put me in my place.\u201d</p><p>Good girl.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to disrespect you or your relationship. Somewhere along the way of looking out for her at the games, my feelings got involved. But she doesn\u2019t have any feelings for me. She made that completely clear. I know you\u2019ll never forgive me, but I hope you\u2019ll forgive her.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but that kindhearted comment set me off. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do with her. She\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I just wanted to apologize to you and tell you what happened. I really am sorry Jack.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed my pride. And then I almost choked on it. I couldn\u2019t blame him for caring about her when that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d asked him to do. No wonder the lines got blurred. He protected her so often that he didn\u2019t know how to turn that part off. \u201cI understand how your feelings for her grew.\u201d The tension between his brows lessened slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t forgive you right now for kissing her. But maybe in time I will.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThank you. That means a lot.\u201d He turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cMatteo,\u201d I called out. \u201cThanks for coming by.\u201d</p><p>A real man owned up to his mistakes and confronted them. Even when I warned him not to come here, he still insisted. It was hard not to respect that kind of integrity. Not to mention the fact that I liked Matteo. Maybe I could grow to like him again. Maybe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Game Changer</p><p>Cassie</p><p>I sat on the floor staring at my cell phone as Melissa practically danced around me. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d I pulled up the photograph of Matteo kissing me on my phone and held it up to her face. \u201cOh shit. When the hell did he kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night he drove me to the airport.\u201d I shook my head, wondering how I was going to fix this.</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot?\u201d she asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI was so caught up in everything else that I completely blocked it out. It wasn\u2019t important. I shoved him off me and told him I loved Jack. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnd of story?\u201d She shook her head, her fingers tapping along the base of her hip. \u201cShit, Cassie. This is bad.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced up at her. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow pissed is Jack?</p><p>\u201cPretty pissed. But he\u2019s mad about other stuff too. He basically said that we\u2019re supposed to be a team, but I\u2019m not being a team player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to fix this,\u201d Melissa demanded, as if telling me something I didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware. Get this.\u201d I paused to look her straight in the eyes. \u201cHe told me to prove it.\u201d</p><p>A sharp laugh ripped out of Melissa\u2019s mouth before she tossed her hand in front of it. \u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled from behind her hand. \u201cBut that\u2019s some ironic shit, right there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>Melissa sat down next to me on the floor, our legs pressing together. \u201cFirst things first, you have to fire Matteo. I mean, you should do it so Jack knows you\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Jack fired him the minute he hung up on me. But if he didn\u2019t, I will.\u201d I leaned my head against the wall. \u201cDo you think I should call Matteo and make him go over there? He needs to tell Jack that I didn\u2019t do anything. He created this mess!\u201d</p><p>Melissa shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Jack might turn it all around on you and get pissed that you reached out to the guy. Plus, I wouldn\u2019t really send Matteo over to talk to Jack right now. Unless you want to go his funeral later.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, my fingers shaking as I reached for my phone to type out a text message.</p><p>You have to tell Jack I didn\u2019t do anything. You have to fix this.</p><p>\u201cWho are you texting? Matteo?\u201d She cocked her head to the side, her lips pursed together in a disapproving gesture. \u201cDo you not listen to a word I say?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged as my phone beeped.</p> <p>Already got it covered. I\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she tapped her finger against her hand impatiently, \u201cwhat\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>I moved the screen of my cell in her direction and waited for her to read his brief response. There was nothing more I wanted to say to Matteo, so I placed my phone on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI hope you enjoyed knowing the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sucks. And all of it could have been avoided if I\u2019d just stayed put and actually talked to Jack instead of running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up, Cass. You needed to get out of that scene. It took you all of two seconds of being away from Jack to realize you couldn\u2019t live without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think this picture\u2019s in the tabloids already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have Chrystle\u2019s crazy allegations,\u201d she held up one finger, \u201cand a picture of you and Matteo kissing,\u201d a second finger joined the first, \u201cand photos of you leaving the apartment with a suitcase when Jack has games at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks bad, right?\u201d</p><p>She twisted her mouth. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good. But you need to worry about Jack first and everyone else after. I\u2019ll reach out to your boss and talk to her about my ideas for the human-interest story on you and Jack. I\u2019ll fill her in on all the details she needs to know about Chrystle, and I\u2019ll work Matteo in there too. You said she\u2019s cool, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s phenomenal. And she wants to help, so I think she\u2019ll welcome any ideas you have. You might want to word it that you heard she wanted to run this story so she thinks the whole thing was her idea,\u201d I suggested with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if Jack says no to the interview? I mean, what if he doesn\u2019t forgive me?\u201d</p><p>She slammed her palms against the tile floor. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t forgive you, I\u2019ll fly out there and personally kick him in the nuts! After everything you\u2019ve forgiven him for, he can absolutely get the fuck over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d Nervous butterflies flapped their wings in my stomach. I hated being on this side of things. It was so much easier being the one who was mad. It sucked being the one someone was mad at.</p><p>\u201cHe may be a stubborn asshole, Cass. But he loves you. He will forgive you and get past this. He might murder Matteo, but I think we all expect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven Matteo expects that.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo, when are you leaving?\u201d</p><p>I stared straight ahead at the photographs covering the walls, wondering how the hell she knew me so well. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Jack be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019ll be on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that gives you a little time to get yourself together and prove it.\u201d She nudged my shoulder with hers. \u201cAlthough I do think taking back the little cheating liar proved plenty, but what the hell do I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know a lot, and I love you. What would I do without you?\u201d</p><p>She faced me, her bright blue eyes shining. \u201cYou\u2019d be lost forever, searching for me.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice being here and not being online, right?\u201d</p><p>I breathed deeply, not realizing the truth before she asked. \u201cBetween that and having my phone off, it\u2019s been way less stressful.\u201d I cocked my head to the side. \u201cI mean, it was before the whole Matteo kissing thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember when you get back, no gossip sites. We\u2019re still not reading them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot reading them, check,\u201d I wholeheartedly agreed.</p><p>She held her pinky out in the space between us and I wrapped my pinky around it.</p><p>I stepped into the terminal at JFK and turned on my phone. I scrolled to Matteo\u2019s number, and, since I could never use him for a ride again, especially now, I deleted it. Hopefully this would help prove to Jack that the dreaded kiss truly meant nothing to me. I wouldn\u2019t talk to Matteo again for the rest of my life, and that was fine with me.</p><p>After getting my suitcase, I waited in line for a cab, and once inside, I started to feel sick. Being back in New York after spending time in LA was like being in a different universe. My life appeared so different depending on which state I was in. I couldn\u2019t hide in New York. And even though there were a hundred times more photographers in Southern California, it seemed easier to get lost there. Or maybe I simply knew the hiding places better?</p><p>We pulled up to my apartment building where three paparazzi waited outside. They had to know Jack and I were both out of town, so why were they here? I tried to be nonchalant, but they recognized me right away as I pulled my suitcase from the trunk.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been cheating on Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Matteo driving you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really make Jack leave Chrystle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go away with Matteo?\u201d</p><p>Back in the middle of hell, I lowered my head and walked through the revolving door, resisting the urge to scream in their faces. I kept my back to the cameras while I waited for the elevator doors to open and swallow me whole.</p><p>Walking through our front door, I noticed the mess Jack left. Dirty dishes sat in the sink. Maybe he didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come home so soon? Or did he think I wouldn\u2019t come home at all? I cringed inwardly at my thoughts and cleaned up the mess. I wanted to text Jack that I made it back, but remembered that he\u2019d asked me to leave him alone. I hated being in our home without him.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t win. I hated being in LA without him. I hated being here without him. It was time for me to stop holding Jack accountable for things he didn\u2019t do. And if I truly didn\u2019t want to live my life without him in it, I needed to act accordingly. Be strong and trust that he was tough enough to deal with my emotional baggage. My choosing to keep things from him only placed a heavier burden on my shoulders. And Jack never asked me to do that. That was a choice I made to make things easier on Jack, but in the end, it only made me resentful.</p><p>I spent the next couple of days on the phone with both Melissa and Nora, working out the potential details for the magazine article. Nora was thrilled to help but made it clear there was a need for the story, especially now. She pressed me to firm up a date as soon as possible, insisting that the longer we waited to speak out, the more potential things had to escalate. I promised her that I\u2019d ask Jack as soon as he came home, and then hoped he\u2019d still speak to me. Melissa and Nora were also up to something, I sensed it, but neither would admit a thing.</p><p>I was restless the entire day Jack was due to come home. Pacing while I waited, I practically held my breath for him to walk through the door. A bottle of wine called out to me while I paced, so I stopped and poured myself a glass. I desperately needed to ease the tension running through me.</p><p>I stepped outside on the balcony and leaned on the railing, the summer heat beating down on my bare shoulders. Lights switched on and buildings lit up from the inside out as I sipped my wine, watching the city come alive. This city held its own kind of magic. You just had to know where to look.</p><p>The front door slammed shut, and I whipped around to see Jack standing in the entryway staring at me. I wanted to leap into his muscular arms, but resisted and just walked slowly back inside. He looked so damn good in his travel attire of black slacks and a white collared shirt with a black tie. I was tempted to rip his clothes from his body and throw them in a pile on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He nodded curtly in my direction, his voice devoid of any emotion.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I answered softly, terrified that this could be the end.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d you get back?\u201d He glanced around at the kitchen and the living room.</p><p>\u201cA couple days ago.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his bag at his feet and opened the fridge. Pulling out a beer, he twisted the top off before taking a long swig.</p><p>\u201cJack, listen,\u201d I started, unable to wait any longer before working things out between us.</p><p>His eyes widened as he moved to our kitchen table. Pulling out a seat, he plopped down. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry for everything. I should have told you about the kiss the second it happened, but I just wanted to forget it. And I\u2019m sorry for running out on you without even giving you a chance to talk. I\u2019ve realized that I really suck at talking things out, and I promise you that I\u2019m going to work on it. If you\u2019ll let me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened as I looked at him, trying to gauge his reaction before I continued. \u201cLeaving you here all alone to deal with the fallout of Chrystle\u2019s article was wrong of me. You were right when you said I didn\u2019t take your feelings into consideration.\u201d I averted my eyes briefly before looking back at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about how you felt. I only thought about myself. And I\u2019m so embarrassed to even admit that to you, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took two short, steadying breaths. \u201cJack, I know I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019m really hoping you\u2019re not ready to give up on me yet. I don\u2019t have gifts or love letters or anything like you had. But what I can give you is my word, my promise, my vow to you. Which I will back up with actions, by the way.\u201d I forced a slight smile and thought I saw his expression soften.</p><p>\u201cI promise to stand by you and not run away when things get tough,\u201d I told him solemnly. \u201cI promise to always talk to you about the things that are bothering me, no matter how stupid and insignificant I think they are. I promise to be a better team player. Because there isn\u2019t a game on earth I want to play if you\u2019re not by my side.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with tears as my emotions overwhelmed me. \u201cI love you. I don\u2019t want to be anywhere without you. You told me once that I was your game changer, but the thing is, you\u2019re mine too. It took me a little time to realize that, but I finally did. You\u2019re my game changer. Because nothing else matters if you\u2019re not with me.\u201d</p><p>Jack pushed back from his chair and walked over to me. \u201cI love you, Kitten.\u201d</p> <p>I stood up and pulled me to him, crushing my chest against his. We squeezed each other like we\u2019d never touched before, all space disappearing between us. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jack. I know I\u2019m a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, but you\u2019re my pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d I pressed my wet face against his shirt.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I forgive you.\u201d He tilted my head up and pressed his lips against mine.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d I pulled back from the kiss.</p> <p>\u201cMore what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I hesitated, nervous that he might hate the idea. Jack had always been a private person, and I wasn\u2019t convinced he\u2019d be willing to invite the public into our personal space. \u201cI want to fix everything. I want people to stop hating us and believing the things they read and think they see. The magazine said they would be willing to interview us. They\u2019d call it a local human-interest story, but it really would be our way of setting the record straight. Nora and Melissa both think this will help our public image. Especially in light of Chrystle\u2019s accusations and the Matteo picture, but they want to do it as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we get to throw Chrystle under the bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery step of the way. We can address whatever we want. Nora said we would have a lot of creative control, but she\u2019d make sure we came out on top. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I thought he would argue more, or be more concerned.</p> <p>\u201cReally. I think this is the best way for people to hear the truth. And since it\u2019s the magazine you work for, I trust it will be done right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you set it up, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour next day off is Monday. Can we do it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited for people to learn about the real us. Maybe they\u2019ll stop being so judgmental,\u201d I said hopefully.</p><p>\u201cWho cares? Is it time for make-up sex yet?\u201d He bit his bottom lip suggestively, and I instantly craved every inch of his skin on mine.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I leaped into his waiting arms, desperately pressing my lips against his.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your quarters,\u201d he teased.</p><p>I Can\u2019t Believe I Did That</p><p>Cassie</p><p>I hopped out of bed Monday morning filled with anticipation. The interview was supposed to take place here in our apartment, but Nora asked to see us in the office first. The request was a bit unusual, but since she was doing us this huge favor, I agreed. Not to mention the fact that I still was getting paid time off.</p><p>Tossing my long hair into a ponytail, I stared at the bags under my eyes before dabbing some concealer on them. I hurried through the rest of my makeup routine as Jack hopped into the shower.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a new driver, or should I just call us a cab?\u201d I cringed at bringing up the whole Matteo and driver situation.</p><p>\u201cI never hired a new person. I\u2019ve just been using random drivers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to call the car company or grab a taxi?\u201d I pressed my lips together to spread my lipstick.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want. I don\u2019t really care.\u201d</p><p>I frowned to my reflection at Jack\u2019s apparent indifference. \u201cWe\u2019ll just take a cab.\u201d I finished getting ready as Jack got dressed and disappeared into the living area. I hated how it took him absolutely no time to look gorgeous.</p><p>By the time I got ready, I caught Jack reading online, a sour look spread across his face. I crept up behind him and tossed my arms around his shoulders before looking on the computer screen. A nasty article titled a \u201cHome-Wrecking Floozy\u201d was on the screen. Obviously, it was about me.</p><p>He shook his head, his hand reaching up to grab mine. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kitten. I had no idea these were the kinds of things people were saying about you.\u201d</p><p>I leaned down and kissed his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. This whole thing is my fault. No wonder you flipped out. This shit is horrible.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNone of that matters. It\u2019s all lies anyway, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care about how you feel about me. Not a bunch of people I don\u2019t know. At least I\u2019m trying not to care what they think,\u201d I admitted honestly.</p><p>I pulled Jack by the hand into the magazine offices. He had never been up there before. \u201cWhere\u2019s your desk?\u201d he whispered as my coworkers turned to eye us before saying hi and excitedly introducing themselves to Jack. I spotted Joey in the kitchen, hanging back and looking clearly uncomfortable, and I offered him a slight smile. He smiled back but stayed put.</p><p>I pointed toward the far wall. \u201cOver there. I\u2019ll show you after.\u201d</p><p>I rapped on Nora\u2019s oversized door. \u201cCome in,\u201d she called out.</p><p>We closed the door behind us. Nora stood up and came around her desk to introduce herself to Jack. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too. I\u2019ve heard a lot of great things,\u201d Jack said respectfully, and I was impressed.</p><p>\u201cSo, I know we were supposed to shoot the puff piece today,\u201d she began, and my heart raced.</p><p>Supposed?</p><p>\u201cBut this just came up, and I wanted you to be the first to read it.\u201d She handed us each a copy of our magazine with a cover photograph of a girl I didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Vanessa,\u201d Jack said as he opened the magazine and flipped to the article.</p><p>\u201cChrystle\u2019s best friend, Vanessa?\u201d I asked and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cRead the interview. I think you\u2019ll find it quite illuminating,\u201d Nora insisted.</p><p>I skimmed through it before my jaw dropped and I was forced to stop. \u201cHoly shit, Jack. Do you see the part where Vanessa says that Chrystle planned this whole thing from day one?\u201d</p><p>I read directly from the magazine copy:</p><p>\u201cChrystle knew every player who got drafted and had the potential to eventually play on our team. She researched Jack and learned everything about him before he even played here. She was obsessed. She knew he was raised by his grandparents, that he had a younger brother, a girlfriend, what kind of car he drove. She found out his parents weren\u2019t in his life, and she said no one could live through that unscathed. Chrystle believed that everyone had a weakness and she was convinced she\u2019d just stumbled upon Jack\u2019s. When I mentioned that he had a girlfriend, she didn\u2019t care. Unless Jack moved to Alabama with his girlfriend, Chrystle considered him fair game.\u201d</p><p>My stomach turned. \u201cJesus, Jack.\u201d I looked at him, his eyes still scanning the magazine in his hands.</p><p>\u201cAnd the minute Jack arrived, sans girlfriend, she put her plan in motion. She practically stalked him, waiting for the opportunity to seduce him. She knew where he lived and who he lived with. Some nights she would wait outside their apartment in case they all went out somewhere. She wanted to follow them and make it look like a coincidence when they all showed up at the same place. She was relentless. I feel like Jack didn\u2019t stand a chance against her. He had no idea what he was up against because most normal people aren\u2019t that manipulative and determined. She wasn\u2019t going to stop until she had what she wanted. And what she wanted was Jack.\u201d</p><p>The interviewer of the magazine asked, \u201cWhy? Why Jack?\u201d And Vanessa responded:</p><p>\u201cBecause he was going to make it all the way to the major leagues and she knew it. Anyone who watched him play and knew anything about baseball knew it. Most of the guys on the team would never get that far, and she once said that she refused to be saddled with any of them. That they were all just loser head cases waiting to happen. She wanted the money, the celebrity, and the lifestyle that went along with being the wife of a major league ballplayer. It really is as simple as that.\u201d</p><p>Reading all of Vanessa\u2019s words horrified me. Anger, sadness, and pain all raced through my body. I wanted to go back in time and protect Jack from this nightmare ever unfolding. No one deserved to be treated this way.</p><p>I reached out my hand, placing it on Jack\u2019s thigh as he turned to me, shaking his head. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</p><p>Nora clapped her hands together and leaned her chin against them. \u201cThe rest of the interview basically talks about how she faked the pregnancy, the miscarriage, and then how she dragged out the annulment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I want to read the part about the faked pregnancy,\u201d I said a little too enthusiastically. I scanned the questions and answers, searching for it.</p><p>\u201cShe got a local doctor to go along with her plans by basically framing him. She told him that she knew he had an affair in the past and she threatened to tell his wife if he didn\u2019t help her. She claimed to have proof and numerous witnesses. The poor guy was terrified of losing his family so he did whatever she asked. He falsified paperwork and prescriptions for her. She came home from that first doctor\u2019s visit with a confirmation of pregnancy, a due date, a calendar, prenatal and extra iron pills, and a chart that showed the baby\u2019s growth in terms of weeks. Anything from the doctor\u2019s office looked completely legit. There\u2019s no way Jack would have known she was lying. None of us did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is really a piece of work, that girl,\u201d I breathed out.</p><p>Nora leaned over and tapped the magazine meaningfully. \u201cAll in all, the article paints an extremely unflattering picture of this Chrystle person and makes you and Jack out to be the victims, without looking stupid.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo, with Vanessa\u2019s interview, ours would sort of be redundant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so. My suggestion is that we wait and see how this plays out. I can\u2019t imagine there will be any more questions after people read this interview, but it might not hurt for the two of you to make a joint statement.\u201d She tapped two of her fingers along the side of her jaw. \u201cMaybe we do a more upbeat article and photo spread on your new apartment, your lives, how happy you two are here in New York. More like a public image, life, and style piece. But there\u2019s no rush.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smiled. \u201cI like that. I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Jack barely smiled, possibly still in shock over everything Vanessa\u2019s article revealed. \u201cI do have one question, if you don\u2019t mind, Nora?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in touch with Vanessa?\u201d</p> <p>My eyes grew wide as I realized I hadn\u2019t even thought about that. Nora smiled and looked at me. \u201cThis one\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my gaze. \u201cMelissa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a little firecracker that one,\u201d she breathed out. \u201cI think she got Vanessa\u2019s phone number from Jack.\u201d</p><p>Jack tilted his head back in recollection. \u201cShe did ask me for her number. But that was months ago. After the annulment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did? That\u2019s weird,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI swear she told me she wanted to thank her. Knowing her, she probably did.\u201d</p><p>Nora spoke up. \u201cWell, she passed along Vanessa\u2019s contact information to me and I was prepared to reach out to her when Melissa let me know I didn\u2019t need to. She said that she had spoken to Vanessa, and she was only too obliged to give us an interview for the magazine. Apparently the poor girl has been sick over Chrystle\u2019s publicity stunts and Melissa convinced her to talk to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only reason Chrystle signed the annulment papers. Otherwise, I\u2019d probably still be technically married to her.\u201d Jack winced, giving my hand a quick squeeze.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s come through for us twice now,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo as I mentioned, there\u2019s no need for us to do the interview we had intended. We\u2019ll schedule the upbeat piece for later, and this article will run in both the online and print versions starting Wednesday.\u201d Nora smiled. \u201cYou can keep those copies. I\u2019ll see you in the office tomorrow, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here. Thank you so much.\u201d I stood and walked over to her desk to give her a hug.</p> <p>Nora straightened her jacket and skirt when I released her. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just good business.\u201d She tried not to smile.</p><p>Jack reached across her desk to shake her hand. \u201cWe really appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for us.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now, go win some games.\u201d</p><p>I hated to admit that I was relieved about the tell-all interview being canceled. I would have gladly done it, but part of me was thankful we didn\u2019t have to. All the same information was going to come out, but it didn\u2019t come from me or Jack. I assumed there would be fewer accusations that way.</p><p>Once we were in the back of the taxi, Jack threw his arm around me and asked, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved we don\u2019t have to do that kind of interview. I\u2019m angry at hearing all those things, and I\u2019m sad that it all happened. But I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s all going to be over soon.\u201d I leaned my head against his shoulder as he pulled me close against him. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed off at reading all that shit. I\u2019m mad at her for being crazy. I\u2019m mad at me for being stupid. I just want it all behind us once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d I promised.</p> <p>While Jack paid the fare, I exited the cab and headed into the lobby of our apartment building. My legs almost folded on me when I saw a familiar petite brunette at the front desk talking to our concierge. I bolted through the revolving door, ignoring our doorman as my insides raged. She turned toward me, and I screamed, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing in here? Antonio, she\u2019s not allowed in here. She\u2019s not welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh look,\u201d Chrystle said in her honeyed accent. \u201cIt\u2019s Cassie, the home wrecker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to Whore Island already? What are you doing here?\u201d I screeched at the last person on earth I wanted to see.</p><p>She placed her hand on her hip and leaned toward me. \u201cDid you know that people will pay thousands of dollars for a juicy gossip story? They don\u2019t even really check their facts anymore.\u201d</p><p>My hands balled in and out of fists as she smiled at me triumphantly. \u201cThe truth will come out soon enough, and then everyone will know what a lying, psychotic bitch you are,\u201d I spat out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. People love little ol\u2019 me. I\u2019m just a victim in all of this and they feel so sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you overestimate your ability to deceive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotten me this far, hasn\u2019t it? And it got your boyfriend to marry me. Remember that?\u201d Her mouth twisted into a wicked grin as she pointed in Jack\u2019s direction.</p><p>I swallowed the lump in my throat and pulled my arm back. With as much forward motion as I could muster, I slapped her wretched, conniving, evil face. The sound echoed through the lobby as she gasped, a red handprint outlined across her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d She glanced outside, where I hadn\u2019t noticed a lone photographer standing before. Flashes of light bounced off the windowpanes.</p><p>She set this up.</p><p>I refused to be her victim any longer. \u201cNext time it won\u2019t be a slap. Don\u2019t come near me again and stay the fuck away from Jack.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline made my heartbeat thump in my ears as Jack suddenly appeared at my side. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d he shouted at the unwanted trash.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack!\u201d she whined. \u201cYour girlfriend just hit me. Do something!\u201d</p><p>He puffed out his chest, looking down at her. \u201cI\u2019ll hold your ass in place if she wants to do it again. Now get the fuck out of my apartment building, you stupid bitch.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, her face scrunched in horror. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret that. Both of you. You just wait,\u201d she threatened as she shuffled in her high heels toward the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice turned caring and concerned.</p><p>I released a quick breath, still shaking from my actions. My hand vibrated and pulsed from the impact. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I missed it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. Someone was taking pictures, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see it soon enough.\u201d I gestured toward the photographer trying to keep up with Chrystle, and Jack bolted out the door.</p><p>I watched him shout until the photographer slowed down. Jack pulled him aside and talked to him, while Chrystle looked on from a short distance away. Jack smiled and then jogged back in to our building.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled. \u201cI told him that it would be in his best interest to not publish those photos. Chrystle was a stalker, I was filing a restraining order against her today, and everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie. And I mentioned that if he published anything that further damaged your reputation, I\u2019d hunt him down and shove that camera so far up his ass he\u2019d need a doctor to remove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, babe.\u201d I shook my head, knowing full well that threats don\u2019t work on paparazzi types.</p><p>\u201cThen I bought the pictures from him and demanded exclusivity. If they show up anywhere, I\u2019ll sue him. Looks like I will get to see you hitting her after all.\u201d He kissed the top of my head and turned toward Antonio, who looked confused and unsure what to do. \u201cThat woman is a stalker. I\u2019ll be filing a restraining order against her this afternoon. Please see to it that she does not come in here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Antonio responded.</p><p>Jack joined me at the waiting elevator, and I whispered, \u201cAre you really getting a restraining order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stalking me, she threatened us, and I think she\u2019s unstable,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s definitely something, alright.\u201d I leaned up to plant a kiss on his cheek before pulling out my phone.</p><p>I typed out a quick text to Melissa:</p><p>Thank you for getting Vanessa to do the story. It\u2019s unbelievable. You\u2019re unbelievable! :) PS. Chrystle was just here. In our building. And I slapped her! LOL</p><p>Melissa responded immediately.</p><p>You did? THAT FUCKING ROCKS! HAHA I heard she was in NY trying to shop around a potential book idea. As soon as the article hits, she\u2019ll be dead in the water. No one will touch her. And you\u2019re welcome. Vanessa was scared at first, but she really pulled through.</p><p>I quickly typed back:</p><p>Yeah, she did. If you talk to her again, which I\u2019m sure you will because you\u2019re like that... please tell her I said thank you.</p><p>\u201cAre you texting Melissa?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Jack. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I said thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>A Proposal</p><p>SEVERAL WEEKS LATER</p><p>Cassie</p><p>Things changed once the article came out with all of Vanessa\u2019s revelations. The public\u2019s desire to know everything didn\u2019t ease up, but at least Jack and I were no longer viewed as the bad guys. Melissa told me that the online message boards were filled with comments about how much I must have loved Jack to forgive him for everything, and how strong we must be as a couple to have endured it all and still be together. True to my word, I hadn\u2019t been online to read any of it since the night I broke down. And Melissa had been right, I did feel better. I guess sometimes ignorance is bliss.</p><p>I also attended Jack\u2019s games without the fear of being ridiculed or mocked... unless he lost, then the fans were still unforgiving. Even a few of the mean wives commented about the article and what a horrible thing happened to me and Jack. They still didn\u2019t go out of their way to talk to me, but at least they acknowledged my existence. Which I\u2019ll admit was hard at times, considering I knew what some of their husbands were doing behind their backs.</p><p>Work got busier for me, and I was assigned to my first on-location shoot after a tornado practically destroyed an entire town in the Midwest. It was harder than I imagined, shooting the devastation and witnessing people\u2019s pain up close and in person. My heart literally ached with each shot I captured.</p><p>Sometimes I questioned if what I was doing held true value. And I wondered how I was any better than the paparazzi, invading people\u2019s personal space for the sake of a photograph.</p><p>But when one of my photos was chosen to solicit donations and another was used to focus on rebuilding the town, my fears were eased. I convinced myself that my pictures did good and helped bring to light the true devastation, so others could see it and be called to help.</p><p>I walked the short distance from the subway station to our apartment, excited to see Jack. His team had an afternoon playoff game that day and I didn\u2019t attend partly because I knew Jack wouldn\u2019t be pitching and I was also under a deadline at work. It was embarrassing how excited I got at the idea of coming home to Jack. He wasn\u2019t normally home before I was, and I liked walking through the door and into his waiting arms. I looked up at our apartment building, the shadow casting halfway across the street, and grinned. I allowed myself to get lost in the sounds of the traffic rushing past me, finding comfort in their constant accompaniment.</p><p>When I opened the front door, a familiar smell hit me, and I struggled to place it. \u201cWhat are you cooking?\u201d I shouted into the apartment with a smile.</p><p>Jack peered around the kitchen wall at me. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what I got Gran to do,\u201d he said with a laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I know that smell from! That\u2019s Gran\u2019s sauce!\u201d I raced into the kitchen, reaching for a spoon before dipping it into the saucepan on the stove. I blew on it lightly before tasting it. \u201cOh my God. So good. Did you make it?\u201d</p><p>Jack wrapped his arms around my waist. \u201cI had her freeze some sauce and then overnight it to us. She\u2019s been freaking out the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is awesome.\u201d I dipped my spoon in again and Jack swatted my hand.</p><p>\u201cGet outta there. Wait for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>I turned to eye him. \u201cWhat are you up to, mister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He let out a breath. \u201cCan\u2019t a guy just cook dinner for his girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I nodded. \u201cCan I do anything?\u201d I glanced around, noticing a vase of red roses on the table.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He smiled and kissed me on the cheek.</p><p>Jack</p> <p>I wanted to do this right. That\u2019s why I reached out to her father and asked for his blessing days ago.</p><p>I knew I didn\u2019t have to do that. Cassie would have insisted it wasn\u2019t necessary, but Gran would probably have me killed if she found out I hadn\u2019t. I figured it was the right thing to do, which should have pointed me in the opposite direction given my past, but I followed my gut anyway.</p><p>The phone rang as my heart thumped in my ears. \u201cHello,\u201d a soft voice answered.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Andrews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s Jack Carter. I was wondering if your husband was home, and if I could speak to him,\u201d I asked as politely as I could.</p> <p>\u201cOh hi, Jack. Is everything OK? Is Cassie alright?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cCassie\u2019s fine. Everything is OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, OK. That\u2019s good to hear. Hold on a second and I\u2019ll grab her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I exhaled, wanting to get this over with as soon as possible.</p><p>The phone clanked on the other end and a male throat cleared. \u201cHello? Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Andrews. How are you, sir?\u201d I hated being respectful when he\u2019d let Cassie down so many times over the years.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t complain. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sir,\u201d I stalled, clearing my throat before continuing. \u201cFirst of all, I want you to know how much I love your daughter. She\u2019s the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met in my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he said.</p><p>I knew I was supposed to ask for permission to marry his daughter, but I didn\u2019t want it. And I knew damn well I wouldn\u2019t need it. He couldn\u2019t stop me from marrying her if he tried. So I worded it a different way. \u201cI just wanted you to know that I plan on asking her to marry me, and I wanted to ask for your blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll say yes?\u201d</p><p>What the hell kind of question was that? I gripped my hair with my free hand. \u201cYes sir, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, alright then!\u201d he said happily into the receiver. \u201cYou have my blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smiled, and hearing shouting in the background I asked, \u201cMay I speak to your wife again quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sure, sure. Congrats! And let us know what we can do. We\u2019ll pay for anything you need and handle anything you kids want.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated before realizing that he\u2019d never follow through on those offers. Cassie was right about how easy it was to get sucked in by his charisma and enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cJack? Tell me you asked him what I think you asked him!\u201d</p><p>I laughed into the phone. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>She squealed with delight. \u201cWhen are you asking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, so please don\u2019t say anything to her if you two talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say a word. We\u2019ll wait for her to call us with the big news!\u201d</p><p>I exhaled with relief. \u201cGreat, thanks. I\u2019ll talk to you later, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, Jack. And hey.\u201d She paused before continuing in a hushed tone. \u201cThank you for calling. I know you didn\u2019t have to, but it was nice that you did.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself, finally convinced that I\u2019d actually done the right thing for once.</p><p>Nerves rarely raced through my body, but they were having a field day as I waited to pop the question. I loved this girl more than anything in the world and we\u2019d been through a lot.</p><p>I longed to make this girl my wife, and I hated sitting here at dinner, waiting to ask. Why couldn\u2019t I just ask her now, while her mouth was filled with pasta? Should I get down on one knee? I wondered if she sensed what was coming. I\u2019d never cooked dinner for her before and here I just went all Gourmet Chef on her ass.</p><p>What if she says no?</p><p>She won\u2019t say no.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She\u2019d better not say no.</p><p>Cassie</p><p>After dinner, Jack carried all the dishes into the kitchen and loaded them into the washer. He refused to let me help at all. I stared out the window at the skyline. I really did love living in New York.</p><p>Suddenly, Jack was kneeling next to my chair. As he placed my hand in his and started speaking, my heart began to race. \u201cI don\u2019t know any other couple who has been to hell and back more than the two of us. I feel like everything we\u2019ve been through has only made us stronger. We\u2019ve had to learn to work together. To be a team. To support each other and stand by each other.\u201d</p><p>I started to shake. Nervous energy consumed me, and I could barely hear half the words he said. My brain started to spin, and I couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything other than the fact that Jack was kneeling next to me.</p><p>Jack</p><p>Her eyes glazed over, and knowing Cass the way I do, I wasn\u2019t sure she could even hear me anymore, but I kept talking. \u201cI promise to stand by you, to hold you up when you\u2019re about to fall, and to always keep you safe. I never believed there was a girl out there for me. Until I met you. You changed everything. And I never want to live without you. I love you more than I ever thought possible.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes before taking a deep breath. All my confidence wavered in this moment as I realized Cassie held my future in the palm of her hands.</p><p>\u201cKitten. Be my wife. Marry me.\u201d I opened the black velvet Tiffany\u2019s ring box.</p><p>Cassie</p><p>Seeing the diamond inside caused me to gasp. It sparkled and danced in the light. The center diamond was huge and was surrounded by smaller diamonds. It looked too pretty to touch.</p><p>\u201cKitten?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice cut through my sparkle coma as I realized I hadn\u2019t answered him yet.</p><p>My gaze moved to meet his. \u201cYes. Of course I\u2019ll marry you. Who the hell else would I marry?\u201d I smiled, still not reaching for the gorgeous ring.</p><p>He grinned and his dimples appeared as he reached inside the box and pulled out the ring. I held out my left hand, and he pushed that gorgeous piece of jewelry into place. My eyes were transfixed on the diamonds lighting up my finger. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d I said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it? We can take it back.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my hand away from his, clutching it against my chest. \u201cNo way. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already am.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>SIXTEEN MONTHS LATER, JANUARY 12</p><p>Jack</p><p>I stood at the end of a makeshift aisle in Gran and Gramps\u2019s lush backyard. It had been transformed into a light-filled wonderland. Every tree, bush, and branch was covered with tiny bright white lights. I waited underneath the large tree where lanterns flickering with candlelight hung from the branches. Oversized Mason jars were lined up in two rows, forming the aisle, and each jar was filled with a few inches of quarters to hold up the white candle burning inside. I glanced at the few round tables decorated all in white and smiled. My eyes grazed past my old teammates from Fullton State, Melissa\u2019s parents, Cassie\u2019s parents, Gran, Nora, and, finally, Matteo and Trina, who started dating pretty soon after Trina and Kyle broke up. I found myself smiling at our group of friends and family filling the small space, excited to share our intimate moment with us.</p><p>I loved the fact that Kitten and I shared the same views when it came to today. Thankfully, neither one of us needed a large formal wedding to mark the special occasion. Although in all honesty, I would have given her anything she wanted, we both craved the privacy and security that only our close friends and family could provide. So we opted for a more casual setting and dress code. I looked down at my charcoal gray suit and adjusted my black tie.</p><p>Where the hell is Dean?</p><p>I smiled at Gran, who was already holding a tissue to her eyes, as I stepped away from the altar. She dropped her hand and asked, \u201cJack? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find Dean.\u201d</p><p>I stormed into the house, trying not to accidentally see Cassie while I looked for my brother, who just happened to disappear minutes before I was supposed to get married. I peered into the empty kitchen. Glancing in the front yard and the living room and finding them empty, I made my way back toward our bedrooms.</p><p>Both of our bedroom doors were closed. I knew Cassie was in my room, so I knocked on Dean\u2019s before turning the handle. I didn\u2019t wait for a response before I opened the door and barged inside.</p><p>\u201cShit. Really?\u201d I eyed my brother, lying on top of a partially clothed Melissa, his tongue down her throat and his hands who knows where.</p><p>\u201cGet out, Jack. Jesus,\u201d Dean shouted, covering Melissa\u2019s body protectively.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you two could figure your shit out after the vows? I\u2019d like to get married sometime today,\u201d I shouted, my patience wavering.</p><p>I slammed the door and knocked on the door to my old bedroom. \u201cKitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come in here, Jack!\u201d she yelled, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I just wanted to say I can\u2019t wait to see you. Make sure those two actually leave the bedroom, please. Tell them they can fuck after the vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she called out through the door. \u201cIs that where Melissa is? I\u2019ve been waiting for her to come back for like half an hour!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re going to be waiting forever if you don\u2019t go drag her out of there. I\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d I said, leaning my cheek against the door.</p><p>With another hasty knock on Dean\u2019s door, I yelled, \u201cToday little brother! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Since he obviously couldn\u2019t be trusted alone with Melissa, I waited for him to come out of his room before I walked back outside. I nudged him as we headed down the aisle toward the tree. \u201cReally couldn\u2019t wait until later?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou kidding me? With her, later might mean never. I gotta take what I can get.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI do not envy you, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He gave me a look. \u201cWell, I sure as shit envy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d I told him and I meant it.</p><p>If I weren\u2019t me, I\u2019d envy me. I shifted my weight between my legs as I waited for the best day of my life to begin. People always talk about being nervous on their wedding day, but I wasn\u2019t. If any emotion surged through my body, it was excitement. I couldn\u2019t wait to make this girl my wife and spend the rest of my life making her smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The processional music started and everyone rose to their feet. I stared at the back door as if my life depended on it. Melissa walked out first, a huge smile on her face. I noticed that she locked eyes with Dean and never stopped looking at him her entire walk down the aisle. She wasn\u2019t fooling anyone.</p><p>All my thoughts disappeared, my mind going blank, the moment I saw Cass in the shadows. When she stepped out of the darkness and into the backyard, my heart jumped from my chest and flew into her hands. She looked so fucking beautiful walking toward me in that strapless white dress. I grinned like an idiot. I know because my cheeks burned, and I couldn\u2019t stop the feeling if I tried. Not that I wanted to try.</p><p>Her hair was pulled back, revealing her delicate neckline, and my mind raced with dirty thoughts. All the blood rushed from my body and into one place the second I started thinking about all the things I wanted to do to her. Shit, I couldn\u2019t get married with a fucking hard-on. Think about something else; think about anything else. Think about baseball.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>When she finally arrived at my side, I reached for her hand, caressing it with my thumb as she gave me a subtle squeeze. \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d I whispered as I leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou look hot,\u201d she whispered and gave me a little wink.</p><p>Gramps cleared his throat, and I glanced up at him. He stood before us with a businesslike expression on his face. After he\u2019d gotten ordained online with Dean\u2019s help, Gran told me he took his role in the wedding very seriously. \u201cI have the most important job of all. I have to get it right!\u201d She told me, he said.</p><p>Gramps swallowed once before asking, \u201cShall we begin?\u201d He started reading the first few lines of the ceremony, and I struggled to keep my impatience in check.</p><p>I was standing before my family and friends, marrying the only person in the world I\u2019ve ever wanted to marry. There would be no annulling this marriage. No end to this beginning. No trade for this team.</p> <p>People spend their lives searching for their one true love, their other half. I found mine in college, dancing in a fraternity house driveway. Lucky for me, she found me right back.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait until she\u2019s knocked up. </p> </body></html>"]
