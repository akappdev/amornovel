Even at a rout like this one, a well-bred lady\u2019s abrupt shout of joy was likely to draw notice, and Amelia did not care to explain herself to the crush of young ladies surrounding her. Especially when the reason for her delight was not a triumph at the card table or a proposal of marriage, but rather the completion of a dinner menu.</p> <p>She could imagine it now. \u201cOh, Lady Amelia,\u201d one of these young misses would say, \u201conly you could think of food at a time like this.\u201d</p><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t as though Amelia had planned to stand in a ballroom, dreaming of menus for their family summer holiday. But she\u2019d been puzzling for weeks over a new sauce for braised pheasant, to replace the same old applejack reduction. Something sweet, yet tart; surprising, yet familiar; inventive, yet frugal. At last, the answer had come to her. Blackberry glaze. Strained, of course. Ooh, perhaps mulled with cloves.</p><p>Resolving to enter it in her menu book later, she swept the imaginary dish aside and compressed her grin to a half-smile. Summer at Briarbank would now officially be perfect.</p><p>Mrs. Bunscombe brushed past in a flounce of scarlet silk. \u201cIt\u2019s half-eleven,\u201d the hostess sang. \u201cNearly midnight.\u201d</p><p>Nearly midnight. Now there was a thought to quell her exuberance.</p> <p>A cherub-faced debutante swaddled in tulle grasped Amelia by the wrist. \u201cAny moment now. How can you remain so calm? If he chooses me tonight, I just know I\u2019ll swoon.\u201d</p><p>Amelia sighed. And so it began. As it did at every ball, when half-eleven ticked past.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about making conversation,\u201d a young lady dressed in green satin said. \u201cHe scarcely utters so much as a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we even certain he speaks English? Wasn\u2019t he raised in Abyssinia or ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Lower Canada. Of course he speaks English. My brother plays cards with him.\u201d The second girl lowered her voice. \u201cBut there is something rather primitive about him, don\u2019t you think? I think it\u2019s the way he moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the gossip you\u2019re heeding,\u201d Amelia said sensibly.</p> <p>\u201cHe waltzes like a dream,\u201d a third girl put in. \u201cWhen I danced with him, my feet scarcely skimmed the floor. And he\u2019s ever so handsome up close.\u201d</p><p>Amelia gave her a patient smile. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>At the opening of the season, the reclusive and obscenely wealthy Duke of Morland had finally entered society. A few weeks later, he had all London dancing to his tune. The duke arrived at every ball at the stroke of midnight. He selected a single partner from among the available ladies. At the conclusion of one set, he would escort the lady in to supper, and then ... disappear.</p><p>Before two weeks were out, the papers had dubbed him \u201cthe Duke of Midnight,\u201d and every hostess in London was jostling to invite His Grace to a ball. Unmarried ladies would not dream of promising the supper set to any other partner, for fear of missing their chance at a duke. To amplify the dramatic effect, hostesses positioned timepieces in full view and instructed orchestras to begin the set at the very hour of twelve. And it went without saying, the set concluded with a slow, romantic waltz.</p><p>The nightly spectacle held the entire ton in delicious, knuckle-gnawing thrall. At every ball, the atmosphere thickened with perfume and speculation as the hour of twelve approached. It was like watching medieval knights attempting to wrest Excalibur from the stone. Surely one of these evenings, the gossips declared, some blushing ing\u00e9nue would get a proper grip on the recalcitrant bachelor ... and a legend would be born.</p><p>Legend indeed. There was no end of stories about him. Where a man of his rank and fortune was involved, there were always stories.</p><p>\u201cI hear he was raised barefoot and heathen in the Canadian wilderness,\u201d said the first girl.</p><p>\u201cI hear he was barely civilized when his uncle took him in,\u201d said the second. \u201cAnd his wild behavior gave the old duke an apoplexy.\u201d</p> <p>The lady in green murmured, \u201cMy brother told me there was an incident, at Eton. Some sort of scrape or brawl ... I don\u2019t know precisely. But a boy nearly died, and Morland was expelled for it. If they sent down a duke\u2019s heir, you know it must have been dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not believe what I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Amelia said, widening her eyes. The ladies perked, leaning in close. \u201cI hear,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthat by the light of the full moon, His Grace transforms into a ravening hedgehog.\u201d</p><p>When her companions finished laughing, she said aloud, \u201cReally, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s so interesting as to merit this much attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say that if you\u2019d danced with him.\u201d</p><p>Amelia shook her head. She had watched this scene unfold time and again over the past few weeks, admittedly with amusement. But she never expected\u2014or desired\u2014to be at the center of it. It wasn\u2019t sour grapes, truly it wasn\u2019t. What other ladies saw as intriguing and romantic, she took for self-indulgent melodrama. Really, an unmarried, wealthy, handsome duke who felt the need to command more female attention? He must be the most vain, insufferable sort of man.</p><p>And the ladies of his choosing\u2014all flouncy, insipid girls in their first or second seasons. All petite, all pretty. None of them anything like Amelia.</p><p>Oh, perhaps there was a hint of bitterness to it, after all.</p><p>Really, when a lady dangled on the outer cusp of marital eligibility, as she did, society ought to allow her a quiet, unannounced slide into spinsterhood. It rather galled her, to feel several years\u2019 worth of rejection revisited upon her night after night, as the infamous duke entered at the stroke of midnight, and at twelve-oh-one his eyes slid straight past her to some primping chit with more beauty than brains.</p><p>Not that he had reason to notice her. Her dowry barely scraped the floorboards of the \u201crespectable\u201d range, and even in her first season, she\u2019d never been a great beauty. Her eyes were a trifle too pale, and she blushed much too easily. And at the age of six-and-twenty, she\u2019d come to accept that she would always be a little too plump.</p><p>The girls suddenly scattered, like the flighty things they were.</p><p>A deep whisper came from behind her shoulder. \u201cYou look ravishing, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she wheeled to face the speaker. \u201cJack. What is it you\u2019re after?\u201d</p><p>Pressing a hand to his lapel, he pulled an offended expression. \u201cMust I be after something? Can\u2019t a fellow pay his dearest sister a compliment without falling under suspicion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when the fellow in question is you. And it\u2019s no compliment to be called your dearest sister. I\u2019m your only sister. If you\u2019re after my purse, you must come up with something better than that.\u201d She spoke in a light, teasing tone, hoping against all previous evidence that he would protest: No, Amelia. This time, I\u2019m not after your purse. I\u2019ve ceased gambling and drinking, and I\u2019ve thrown over those ne\u2019er-do-well \u201cfriends\u201d of mine. I\u2019m returning to University. I\u2019ll take orders in the Church, just as I promised our dying mother. And you truly do look lovely tonight.</p><p>Eyes flicking toward the crowd, he lowered his voice. \u201cA few bob. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>Her chest deflated. Not even midnight, and already his eyes held that wild, liquor-flared spark that indicated he was on the verge of doing something spectacularly ill-conceived.</p><p>Steering him by the elbow, she left the young ladies to titter amongst themselves and guided her brother through the nearest set of doors. They stepped into the crescent of yellow light shining through the transom window. The night air closed around them, cloying and humid.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cA few shillings for the hack, Amelia.\u201d He grabbed for the reticule dangling from her wrist. \u201cWe\u2019re off to the theater, a gang of us.\u201d</p><p>Off to the theater, her eye. Off to the gaming hells, more likely. She clutched the beaded drawstring pouch to her bosom. \u201cAnd how will I get home, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Morland will take you.\u201d He winked. \u201cRight after your dance. I\u2019ve two pounds sterling on you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. Another two pounds she\u2019d have to siphon from her pin money. \u201cAt tremendously long odds, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak like that.\u201d A touch grazed her arm. Jack\u2019s expression was suddenly, unexpectedly sincere. \u201cHe\u2019d be damned lucky to have you, Amelia. There\u2019s no lady your equal in that room.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. Since their brother Hugh\u2019s death at Waterloo, Jack had changed, and not for the better. But in rare flashes, that dear, sensitive brother she loved would surface. She wanted so desperately to gather him close and hold tight to him for weeks, months ... however long it took, to coax the old Jack out from this brittle shell.</p><p>\u201cCome now. Be a sweet sister, and lend me a crown or two. I\u2019ll send a runner to Laurent\u2019s, and he\u2019ll send that garish new landau for you. You\u2019ll be driven home in the finest style his copper heiress can afford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Winifred. She\u2019s the Countess of Beauvale now, and you ought to speak of her with respect. It\u2019s her fortune that purchased Michael\u2019s commission and supports young William at school. It\u2019s thanks to her and Laurent that I even have a home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the worthless ingrate who brings the family nothing but disgrace. I know, I know.\u201d His flinty gaze clashed with a forced smile. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a few coins to be rid of me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you understand? I don\u2019t want to be rid of you at all. I love you, you fool.\u201d She smoothed that incorrigible wisp of hair that always curled at his left temple. \u201cWon\u2019t you let me help you, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. If you\u2019ll start with a shilling or two.\u201d</p><p>With clumsy fingers, she loosened the strings of her reticule. \u201cI will give you everything I have, on one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must promise me you\u2019ll join us this summer, at Briarbank.\u201d</p><p>The d\u2019Orsays always summered at Briarbank\u2014a rambling stone cottage overlooking the River Wye, down the slope from the ruins of Beauvale Castle. Amelia had been planning this summer\u2019s holiday for months, down to the last damask tablecloth and saucer of currant jelly. Briarbank was the answer to everything, she knew it. It had to be.</p><p>Hugh\u2019s death had devastated the entire family, but Jack most of all. Of all her brothers, the two of them had been the fastest friends. Hugh had been just one year older, but several years wiser, and his serious bent had always balanced Jack\u2019s wilder personality. Without that check on his impulsive nature, Amelia feared Jack\u2019s grief and recklessness were conspiring to disaster.</p><p>What he needed was love, and time to heal. Time spent far from Town, and close to home and family\u2014what remained of both. Here in London, Jack was surrounded by temptation, constantly pressured to keep pace with his spendthrift peers. At Briarbank, he would surely return to his good-humored self. Young William would come on his break from school. Michael would still be at sea, of course, but Laurent and Winifred would join them, at least for a week or two.</p><p>And Amelia would be the perfect hostess. Just as Mama had always been. She would fill every room with great vases of snapdragons, arrange theatricals and parlor games, serve braised pheasant with blackberry glaze.</p><p>She would make everyone happy, by sheer force of will. Or bribery, if she must.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a crown and three shillings here,\u201d she said, extracting the coins from the pouch, \u201cand six pounds more saved at home.\u201d Saved, scrimped, scraped together, one penny at a time. \u201cIt\u2019s yours, all of it\u2014but you must promise me August at Briarbank.\u201d</p><p>Jack tsked. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cWho? Who didn\u2019t tell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurent. We\u2019re not opening the cottage this summer. It was just settled this week. We\u2019re letting it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLetting it out?\u201d Amelia felt as though all the blood had been let from her veins. Suddenly dizzy, she clutched her brother\u2019s arm. \u201cBriarbank, let out? To strangers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not to strangers. We\u2019ve put the word around at the clubs and expect inquiries from several good families. It\u2019s a plum holiday cottage, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she bit out. \u201cYes, I do know. It\u2019s so ideal, the d\u2019Orsay family has summered there for centuries. Centuries, Jack. Why would we dream of leasing it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we outgrown the pall-mall and tea biscuits routine? It\u2019s dull as tombs out there. Halfway to Ireland, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDull? What on earth can you mean? You used to live for summers there, angling on the river and\u2014\u201d Comprehension struck, numbing her to the toes. \u201cOh, no.\u201d She dug her fingers into his arm. \u201cHow much did you lose? How much do you owe?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes told her he\u2019d resigned all pretense. \u201cFour hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour hundred! To whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Morland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Midni\u2014\u201d Amelia bit off the absurd nickname. She refused to puff the man\u2019s notoriety further. \u201cBut he\u2019s not even arrived yet. How did you manage to lose four hundred pounds to him, when he\u2019s not even here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. Days ago now. That\u2019s why I must leave. He\u2019ll be here any moment, and I can\u2019t face him until I\u2019ve made good on the debt.\u201d</p><p>Amelia could only stare at him.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, I can\u2019t bear it. I was holding my own until Faraday put his token in play. That\u2019s what brought Morland to the table, drove the betting sky-high. He\u2019s out to gather all ten, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll ten of what? All ten tokens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. The tokens are everything.\u201d Jack made an expansive gesture. \u201cCome now, you can\u2019t be so out of circulation as that. It\u2019s only the most elite gentlemen\u2019s club in London.\u201d</p><p>When she only blinked at him, he prompted, \u201cHarcliffe. Osiris. One stud horse, ten brass tokens. You\u2019ve heard of the club, I know you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re talking about. You seem to be telling me you\u2019ve wagered our ancestral home against a brass token. And lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in for hundreds already; I couldn\u2019t back down. And my cards ... Amelia, I swear to you, they were unbeatable cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that they weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He gave a fatalistic shrug. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. If I had some other means of raising the funds, I would. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed, but there\u2019s always next year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d But next year was a whole year away. God only knew what trouble would find Jack in the meantime. \u201cThere must be another way. Ask Laurent for the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he can\u2019t give it.\u201d</p><p>Of course he was right. Their eldest brother had married prudently, almost sacrificially. The family had been desperate for funds at the time, and Winifred had come with bags of money from her mining-magnate father. The trouble was, the bags of money came cinched tightly with strings, and only Laurent\u2019s father-in-law could loosen them. The old man would never authorize the use of four hundred pounds to pay off a gaming debt.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave before Morland arrives,\u201d he said. \u201cYou understand.\u201d</p><p>Jack unlooped the reticule from her limp wrist, and she did not fight him as he shook the coins into his palm. Yes, she understood. Even if nothing remained of their fortune, the d\u2019Orsays would cling to their pride.</p><p>\u201cHave you at least learned your lesson now?\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He vaulted the low terrace rail. Rattling the coins in his palm, he backed away into the garden. \u201cYou know me, Amelia. I never was any good with lessons. I just copied my slate from Hugh\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>As she watched her brother disappear into the shadows, Amelia hugged her arms across her chest.</p><p>What cruel turn of events was this? Briarbank, rented for the summer! All the happiness stored up in those cobbled floors and rustic hearths and bundles of lavender hanging from the rafters\u2014wasted on strangers. All her elaborate menus and planned excursions, for naught. Without that cottage, the d\u2019Orsay family had no true center. Her brother had nowhere to recover from his grief.</p><p>And somehow more lowering than all this: She had no place of her own.</p><p>Accepting spinsterhood had not been easy for Amelia. But she could resign herself to the loneliness and disappointment, she told herself, so long as she had summers at that drafty stone cottage. Those few months made the rest of the year tolerable. Whilst her friends collected lace and linens for their trousseaux, Amelia contented herself by embroidering seat covers for Briarbank. As they entertained callers, she entertained thoughts of begonias in the window box. When she\u2014an intelligent, thoughtful, well-bred lady\u2014was thrown over nightly for her younger, prettier, lack-witted counterparts, she could fool herself into happiness by thinking of blackberry glaze.</p><p>Lord, the irony. She wasn\u2019t much different from Jack. She\u2019d impulsively wagered all her dreams on a pile of mortar and shale. And now she\u2019d lost.</p><p>Alone on the terrace, she started to tremble. Destiny clanged against her hopes, beating them down one hollow ring at a time.</p><p>Somewhere inside, a clock was tolling midnight.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace, the Duke of Morland.\u201d</p><p>The majordomo\u2019s announcement coincided with the final, booming stroke of twelve.</p><p>From the head of the staircase, Spencer watched the throng of guests divide on cue, falling to either side like two halves of an overripe peach. And there, in the center, clustered the unmarried young ladies in attendance\u2014stone-still and shriveling under his gaze.</p><p>As a general point, Spencer disliked crowds. He particularly disliked overdressed, self-important crowds. And this scene grew more absurd by the night: the cream of London society, staring up at him with unguarded fascination.</p><p>We don\u2019t know what to make of you, those stares said.</p><p>Fair enough. It was a useful\u2014often lucrative\u2014thing, to be unreadable. He\u2019d spent years cultivating the skill.</p><p>We don\u2019t trust you. This he gleaned from the whispers, and the manner in which gentlemen guarded the walls and ladies\u2019 hands instinctively went to the jewels at their throats. No matter. It was also a useful thing, at times, to be feared.</p><p>No, it was the last bit that had him quietly laughing. The silent plea that only rang louder every time he entered a ballroom.</p><p>Here, take one of our daughters.</p><p>God\u2019s knees. Must he?</p><p>As he descended the travertine staircase, Spencer girded himself for yet another unpleasant half hour. Given his preference, he would retreat back to the country and never attend another ball in his life. But while he was temporarily residing in Town, he could not refuse all invitations. If he wished to see his ward Claudia well married in a few years, he must pave the way for her eventual debut. And occasionally there were high-stakes card games to be found in the back rooms of these affairs, well away from the white-powdered matrons playing whist.</p><p>So he made his appearance, but strictly on his own terms. One set, no more. As little conversation as possible. And if the ton were determined to throw their sacrificial virgins at his feet ... he would do the choosing.</p><p>He wanted a quiet one tonight.</p><p>Usually he favored them young and vapid, more interested in preening for the crowd than capturing his notice. Then at the Pryce-Foster ball, he\u2019d had the extreme misfortune to engage the hand of one Miss Francine Waterford. Quite pretty, with a vivacious arch to her brow and plump, rosy lips. The thing was, those lips lost all their allure when she kept them in constant motion. She\u2019d prattled on through the entire set. Worse, she\u2019d expected responses. While most women eagerly supplied both sides of any conversation, Miss Waterford would not be satisfied with his repertoire of brusque nods and inarticulate clearings of the throat. He\u2019d been forced to speak at least a dozen words to her, all told.</p><p>That was his reward for indulging aesthetic sensibilities. Enough with the pretty ones. For his partner tonight, he would select a meek, silent, wallflower of a girl. She needn\u2019t be pretty, nor even passable. She need only be quiet.</p><p>As he approached the knot of young ladies, his eye settled on a slender reed of a girl standing on the fringe of the group, looking positively jaundiced in melon-colored satin. When he advanced toward her, she cowered into the shadow of her neighbor. She refused to even meet his gaze. Perfect.</p><p>Just as he extended his hand in invitation, he was arrested by a series of unexpected sounds. The rattle of glass panes. The slam of a door. Heels clicking against travertine in a brisk, staccato rhythm.</p><p>Spencer swiveled instinctively. A youngish woman in blue careened across the floor like a billiard ball, reeling to a halt before him. His hand remained outstretched from his aborted invitation to Miss Melony Satin, and this newly arrived lady took hold of it firmly.</p><p>Dipping in a shallow curtsy, she said, \u201cThank you, Your Grace. I would be honored.\u201d</p><p>And after a stunned, painful pause, the music began.</p><p>The clump of disappointed ladies dispersed in search of new partners, grumbling as they went. And for the first time all season, Spencer found himself partnered with a lady not of his choosing. She had selected him.</p><p>How very surprising.</p><p>How very unpleasant.</p><p>Nevertheless, there was nothing to be done. The impertinent woman queued up across from him for the country dance. Did he even know this lady?</p><p>As the other dancers fell into place around them, he took the opportunity to study her. He found little to admire. Any measure of genteel poise she might claim had fallen casualty to that inelegant sprint across the ballroom. Stray wisps of hair floated about her face; her breath was labored with exertion. This state of agitation did her complexion no favors, but it did enhance the swell of her ample bosom. She was amply endowed everywhere, actually. Generous curves pulled against the blue silk of her gown.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said, as they circled one another. \u201cHave we been introduced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears ago, once. I would not expect you to remember. I am Lady Amelia d\u2019Orsay.\u201d</p><p>The pattern of the dance parted them, and Spencer had some moments to absorb this name: Lady Amelia d\u2019Orsay. Her late father had been the seventh Earl of Beauvale. Her elder brother, Laurent, was currently the eighth Earl of Beauvale.</p><p>And her younger brother Jack was a scapegrace wastrel who owed Spencer four hundred pounds.</p><p>She must have sensed the moment of this epiphany, for when they next clasped hands she said, \u201cWe needn\u2019t speak of it now. It can wait for the waltz.\u201d</p><p>He quietly groaned. This was going to be a very long set. If only he\u2019d moved more quickly in securing the jaundiced one\u2019s hand. Now that Lady Amelia\u2019s brash maneuver had been successful, God only knew what stunt the ladies\u2014or more likely, their mothers\u2014would attempt next. Maybe he should start engaging his partners\u2019 hands in advance of the event. But that would necessitate social calls, and Spencer did not make social calls.

I cannot imagine that you are unaware of it, but the d\u2019Orsay name is synonymous with noble poverty. For us, four hundred pounds is a vast sum of money. We simply cannot spare it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you propose? Do you mean to offer me favors in lieu of payment?\u201d He repaid her shocked expression with a cool remark: \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p> <p>It was a small lie. He was a man. And she was a buxom woman, poured into a form-fitting dress. Parts of him were finding parts of her vaguely interesting. His eyes, for example, kept straying to her d\u00e9colletage, so snugly framed by blue silk and ivory lace. From his advantage of height, he could spy the dark freckle dotting the inner curve of her left breast, and time and again, he found his gaze straying to the small imperfection.</p><p>\u201cWhat a revolting suggestion,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you routinely solicit such offers from the distraught female relations of your debtors?\u201d</p><p>He gave a noncommittal shrug. He didn\u2019t, but she was free to believe he did. Spencer was not in the habit of ingratiating himself, with anyone.</p><p>\u201cAs if I would barter my favors for four hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you called it a vast sum of money.\u201d Well above the going rate for such services, he refrained from adding.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some things upon which one cannot put a price.\u201d</p><p>He considered making an academic argument to the contrary but decided against it. Clearly the woman lacked the sense to follow logic. As was further evidenced by her next comment.</p><p>\u201cI ask you to forgive Jack\u2019s debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot refuse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour hundred pounds is nothing to you. Come now, you weren\u2019t even after Jack\u2019s money. He was only caught in the middle as you drove the betting high. You wanted Mr. Faraday\u2019s token, and you have it. Let my brother\u2019s wager be set aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She huffed an impatient breath, and her whole body seemed to exhale exasperation. Frustration exuded from her every pore, and with it wafted her own unique feminine scent. She smelled nice, actually. No cloying perfume\u2014he supposed she couldn\u2019t afford rich scent. Just the common aromas of plain soap and clean skin, and the merest suggestion that she tucked sprigs of lavender between her stored undergarments.</p><p>Blue eyes locked with his. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Spencer tempered his own exasperated sigh. He could explain to her that forgiving the debt would do both her brother and her family a great disservice. They would owe a debt of gratitude more lasting and burdensome than any debt of gold, impossible to repay. Worst, Jack would have no incentive to avoid repeating the mistake. In a matter of weeks, the youth would land in even deeper debt, perhaps to the tune of thousands. Spencer had no doubt that four hundred pounds was a large sum to the d\u2019Orsay family, but it would not be a crippling one. And if it purchased Lady Amelia\u2019s brother a greater portion of sense, it would be four hundred pounds well spent.</p><p>All this he might have explained. But he was the Duke of Morland. As much as he\u2019d forfeited for the sake of that title, it ought to come with a few advantages. He shouldn\u2019t have to explain himself at all.</p><p>\u201cBecause I won\u2019t,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She set her teeth. \u201cI see. And there is nothing I can say to persuade you otherwise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Lady Amelia shuddered. He felt the tremor beneath his palm, where his hand pressed against the small of her back. Fearing she might burst out weeping\u2014and wouldn\u2019t that be the final polish on this sterling example of awkwardness\u2014Spencer pulled her tightly to him and whisked her into a series of turns.</p><p>Despite his efforts, she only trembled more violently. Small sounds, something between a hiccough and a squeak, emanated from her throat. Against his better judgment, he pulled back to study her face.</p><p>The woman was laughing.</p><p>His heart began to beat a little faster. Steady, man.</p><p>\u201cIt is true, what the ladies say. You do waltz like a dream.\u201d Her eyes swept his face, catching on his brow, his jaw, and finally fixing on his mouth with unabashed interest. \u201cAnd you are undeniably handsome, up close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hope to move me by means of flattery? It won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d She smiled, and her right cheek dimpled. The left did not. \u201cI see now that you are a positively immutable gentleman, a veritable rock of determination, and my every attempt to move you would be in vain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the laughter, then?\u201d</p><p>Why the question? he berated himself, annoyed. Why not gratefully allow the conversation to die? And why did he find himself wondering whether Lady Amelia\u2019s left cheek ever dimpled? Whether she smiled more genuinely, more freely in situations that did not involve debasing herself over large debts, or whether the lone dimple was merely another of her intrinsic imperfections, like the unmatched freckle on her breast?</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she answered, \u201canxiety and gloom are tiresome. You\u2019ve made it clear you will not forgive the debt. I can pass the remainder of the set moping about it, or I can enjoy myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe notion shocks you, I see. I know there are some\u201d\u2014here she raked him with a sharp glance\u2014\u201cwho judge it a mark of their superiority to always appear dissatisfied with the available company. Before they even enter a gathering, they have made up their minds to be displeased with it. Is it so very unthinkable that I might choose the reverse? Opt for happiness, even in the face of grave personal disappointment and complete financial ruin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smacks of insincerity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsincerity?\u201d She laughed again. \u201cForgive me, but are you not the Duke of Morland? The playwright of this little midnight melodrama that has played to packed houses for weeks? The entire scene is predicated on the assumption that we eligible ladies are positively desperate to catch your attention. That a dance in the Duke of Midnight\u2019s arms is every girl\u2019s fondest fantasy. And now you call me insincere, when I claim to be enjoying my turn?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin and looked out over the ballroom. \u201cI have no illusions about myself. I\u2019m an impoverished gentlewoman, two seasons on the shelf, no great beauty even in my bloom of youth. I\u2019m not often at the center of attention, Your Grace. When this waltz concludes, I don\u2019t know when\u2014if ever\u2014I shall know the feeling again. So I\u2019m determined to enjoy it while it lasts.\u201d She smiled fiercely, defiantly. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>Spencer concluded this must now be the longest set in the history of dancing. Turning his head, he dutifully swept her the length of the floor, striving to ignore how every pair of eyes in the ballroom tracked their progress. Quite a crowd tonight.</p><p>When he risked a glance down at her, Lady Amelia\u2019s face remained tilted to his.</p><p>\u201cCan I persuade you to stop staring at me?\u201d</p><p>Her smile never faltered. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>Oh no, indeed.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d she whispered in a husky tone, that from any other woman he would have interpreted as sensual overture, \u201cit\u2019s not often a spinster like me has the opportunity to enjoy such a prime specimen of virility and vigor, and at such close proximity. Those piercing hazel eyes, and all that dark, curling hair ... What a struggle it is, not to touch it.\u201d</p><p>He shushed her. \u201cYou\u2019re creating a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you created the scene,\u201d she murmured coyly. \u201cI\u2019m merely stealing it.\u201d</p><p>Would this waltz never end?</p><p>\u201cDid you wish to change the subject?\u201d she asked. \u201cPerhaps we should speak of the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go to the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooks, then. How about books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome other time,\u201d he ground out. And instantly wondered what had possessed him to say that. The odd thing of it was, despite her many, many unpleasant attributes, Lady Amelia was clearly possessed of some intelligence and wit. He could not help but think that at another time, in another place, he might have enjoyed discussing books with her. But he couldn\u2019t possibly do so here, in a crowded ballroom, with his concentration unraveling on each successive twirl.</p><p>His control of the scene was slipping.</p><p>And that made him frown.</p><p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s a dangerous glare,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your face is turning a most impressive shade of red. It\u2019s enough to make me believe all those dreadful rumors about you. Why, you\u2019re actually raising the hairs on my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am all honesty,\u201d she protested. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d She stretched up and tilted her head to the side, elongating the smooth, pale column of her neck. No freckles there. Only an enticing curve of creamy, soft-looking, sweet-smelling female skin.</p><p>Now Spencer\u2019s heart slammed against his ribs. He didn\u2019t know which he yearned to do more. Wring that neck, or lick it. Biting it might be a fair compromise. An action that mingled pleasure with punishment.</p><p>Because she deserved to be punished, the impertinent minx. Accepting the futility of her first argument, she\u2019d chosen to wage a different battle. A rebellion of joy. She might not wrest a penny from him, but she would wring every possible drop of enjoyment at his expense.</p><p>This was the very attitude responsible for her brother\u2019s debt. Jack would not quit the card table, even when he had no hope of recouping his losses. He stayed in, risked hundreds he did not have, because he wanted to win one last hand. It was precisely the temperament one might expect from a family such as the d\u2019Orsays\u2014a lineage rich with centuries of pride and valor, perpetually strapped for gold.</p><p>Lady Amelia wanted to best him at something. She wanted to see him brought low. And through no particular skill or perception of her own, she was perilously close to succeeding.</p><p>Spencer came to an abrupt halt. Implausibly, the room kept spinning around him. Damn it, this couldn\u2019t be happening. Not here, not now.</p><p>But the signs were unmistakable. His pulse pounded in his ears. A wave of heat swamped his body. The air was suddenly thick as treacle and tasted just as vile.</p><p>Devil, damn, blast. He needed to leave this place, immediately.</p><p>\u201cWhy have we stopped?\u201d she said. \u201cThe waltz isn\u2019t over.\u201d Her voice sounded as though it came from a great distance, filtered through cotton wool.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over for me.\u201d Spencer swung his gaze around the room. An open set of doors to his left beckoned promisingly. He attempted to release her, but she clutched at his shoulders and held him fast. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d he said, \u201clet me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet you what?\u201d Her eyes darting to the side, she whispered, \u201cLet you go? Let you abandon me here on the dance floor, to my complete and total humiliation? Of all the unchivalrous, ungentlemanly, unforgivable ...\u201d When she ran out of descriptors, she threw him an accusatory glare that implied a thousand more. \u201cI won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands to her waist, grasped tight with both hands, and bodily lifted Lady Amelia d\u2019Orsay\u2014two, four ... six inches off the floor. Until they looked one another eye-to-eye, and her slippers dangled in midair.</p><p>He spared a brief moment to savor the way indignant shock widened those pale blue eyes.</p><p>And then he carried her out into the night.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Before Amelia could even catch her breath, the duke had swept her straight through the doors. They emerged onto the exact same circlet of terrace where she\u2019d argued with Jack, not a half hour ago. The Bunscombe gardens were getting good use this evening.</p><p>Dropping her to the ground with dispatch, Morland warded off her complaint with an open palm. \u201cYou asked for it.\u201d Then he sagged against a marble pillar, tugging at his cravat. \u201cBloody hell, it\u2019s hot in there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Amelia quietly reeled on her feet, simultaneously infuriated and exhilarated by the way he\u2019d so easily lifted her and carried her from the room. She wasn\u2019t precisely a wisp of a girl. But as sturdily framed as she was, he was definitely more so. As he\u2019d lifted her, she\u2019d felt his dense shoulder muscles rippling beneath her palms.</p><p>Oh, yes. He was powerfully built indeed.</p> <p>Well, and what now? She\u2019d known she was treading untested ground with her bold teasing. But then, she\u2019d been in the mood to take risks. She\u2019d already lost Briarbank, lost Jack, probably lost any remaining marital prospects after her wild charge across the ballroom to claim His Grace\u2019s hand. She had no reputation or fortune left to protect; why not have a little fun? He was an attractive, enigmatic, powerful man. It had been intoxicating, pushing the boundaries of propriety as she\u2019d never dared before, not knowing what manner of response she might provoke.</p><p>Whatever response she\u2019d expected, it hadn\u2019t been this. Bodily abducted from the ballroom? Ha. Let those debutantes giggle at her now.</p><p>\u201cAnd to think,\u201d she said wonderingly, \u201cI defended you against all those rumors of barbarism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d He made a gruff noise in his throat. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve learned your lesson. Don\u2019t test me again. In the end, I always come out ahead\u2014at cards, at negotiation, at everything.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOh, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cBecause I possess the singular bit of sense no one in your family seems to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that, pray tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know when to walk away.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Light spilled out from the ballroom, illuminating his sculpted, aristocratic profile. With his curling forelock and the marble behind him, he could have been part of a Greco-Roman frieze. Immortally handsome.</p><p>And deathly pale.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cFour hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cFour hundred pounds, if you leave me this instant. You\u2019ll have the bank draft in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she blinked down at the paving stones. Four hundred pounds. Four hundred pounds, and all she need do was turn around and leave? Jack\u2019s debt, paid. Her summer at Briarbank, restored.</p><p>\u201cTurn those hapless d\u2019Orsay fortunes around, Lady Amelia. Learn when to walk away.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. He was serious. She spared herself a brief moment of self-deprecating irony, that while he wouldn\u2019t think of paying four hundred pounds for her favors, he was eager to hand over the sum if she would simply go away. Vile man.</p><p>Oh, but his face had turned a very peculiar shade. In the ballroom, his cheeks had blazed red with anger, but now his complexion was the color of ash. She could hear the air dragging in and out of his lungs. And was it a trick of the moonlight, or was his hand trembling, just a little, where it rested atop the balustrade?</p><p>If he were unwell, to simply desert him ... it would be to abandon every good principle her dear parents had taught her. She would be selling her conscience and good breeding for four hundred pounds.</p> <p>And there were some things on which one could not put a price.</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cTruly, you look very ill. Why don\u2019t you allow me to get you some\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m perfectly well.\u201d He pushed off the marble pillar and paced the terrace perimeter, taking deep draughts of night air. \u201cMy sole affliction is a plaguing female in blue silk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be rude. I\u2019m trying to be helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d He swiped impatiently at his damp temple with his cuff. \u201cI\u2019m not ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so pale?\u201d Amelia shook her head. \u201cWhy is it a man would rather swallow nails than accept a lady\u2019s assistance? And for pity\u2019s sake, can\u2019t a duke afford handkerchiefs?\u201d</p><p>She unlaced the reticule cinched around her wrist. Now emptied of coin, it was so light she\u2019d nearly forgotten the thing altogether. She loosened the string and withdrew the sole item remaining within: a meticulously embroidered linen square.</p><p>She took a moment to admire the stitching she\u2019d finished just a few days ago. Her initials, in dark purple script. Twining around and through the open spaces of the letters, she\u2019d embroidered vines and, in a lighter green, a few curled ferns. A stroke of pure whimsy had spurred her to add a tiny black-and-gold honeybee, buzzing around the apex of the A.</p><p>It was, perhaps, her best work yet. And now this treasured, labored-over bit of linen would go to wipe His Grace\u2019s noble brow? Just how much would she be forced to surrender on this terrace? Her brother, her home, her last small accomplishment. What was left? She half expected Napoleon to pop out from the hedges and demand her allegiance.</p><p>\u201cMorland.\u201d The curt baritone sounded from the shadows.</p><p>Amelia jumped.</p><p>The voice spoke again: low, rough. To her relief, most definitely English. \u201cMorland, is that you?\u201d</p><p>The duke straightened. \u201cWho goes there?\u201d</p><p>A rustling of greenery indicated the stranger\u2019s approach. Impetuously, Amelia went to the duke\u2019s side and pressed her handkerchief into his hand. He looked from her to the square of linen, and then back to her again.</p><p>She shrugged. Perhaps it was silly, but ... it was simply that he was one of England\u2019s great men, and she did come from one of England\u2019s historically great families, and she just couldn\u2019t allow him to face an unknown challenge looking as if he\u2019d succumbed to malaria. Not when she clutched a perfectly clean handkerchief in her hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, hastily wiping his brow and jamming the linen square into his coat pocket as not one, but two men emerged from behind the hedge and vaulted the low rail at the edge of the terrace. The duke edged between her and the strange men. It was a chivalrous, reassuring gesture. She did not regret the handkerchief now.</p><p>The strangers stood outside the half-circle of available light, so that Amelia could not make out their features. She saw only two silhouettes: one fashionable, one fearsome.</p><p>\u201cMorland. It\u2019s Bellamy.\u201d This came from the fashionable one. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019ve met Ashworth,\u201d he said, indicating the giant at his side.</p><p>The duke stiffened. \u201cCertainly. We\u2019re old school chums, aren\u2019t we, Rhys?\u201d</p><p>No answer from the hulking shadow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you to make your escape,\u201d Bellamy said, \u201cbut we can\u2019t delay any longer. You must come with us at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with you? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell you in the carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now, and I shall decide if I join you in any carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClub business,\u201d Bellamy said.</p><p>He eased into the light, and Amelia peered at him. Ah, now she understood why his name was familiar. His face was familiar to her, too. And there was no mistaking the shock of artfully disheveled hair. He was that infamous hell-raiser, the ringleader of that fast group of young bucks Jack would give his eyeteeth to join. The group he\u2019d lost four hundred pounds trying to keep pace with. Was Bellamy involved in that token nonsense, too?</p><p>\u201cClub business?\u201d Morland said. \u201cDo you mean the Stud Club?\u201d</p><p>Amelia barely checked an unladylike snort of laughter. Stud Club, indeed. Men and their ridiculous societies.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re calling an urgent meeting,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cAnd since you\u2019re now seven-tenths of the membership, you\u2019re required to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Osiris?\u201d the duke asked, his voice suddenly grave. \u201cIf something\u2019s happened to that horse, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The tower called Ashworth broke his silence. \u201cIt\u2019s not the horse. Harcliffe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>The bottom dropped out of Amelia\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Ashworth,\u201d said Bellamy. \u201cThere\u2019s a lady present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarcliffe?\u201d she echoed. \u201cDead? As in Leopold Chatwick, the Marquess of Harcliffe?\u201d As in, the boy who\u2019d been raised a half-day\u2019s ride from Beauvale Castle and gone to school with her older brothers? The golden-haired, fine-featured, good-humored, and universally admired young man who\u2019d been so kind as to dance with her at her come-out ball? Not just once, as the obligation of friendship warranted, but two full sets? \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean Leo?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy stepped forward, tapping his gold-knobbed walking stick on the paving stones as he went. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s hand went to her mouth. \u201cOh, poor Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know his sister?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>The duke seemed to recall his social duty, as the only person present acquainted with all parties. \u201cLady Amelia d\u2019Orsay, this is Mr. Julian Bellamy.\u201d His voice darkened a shade as he introduced the larger man. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Rhys St. Maur, Lord Ashworth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder any other circumstance, I\u2019m sure I would be delighted.\u201d Amelia inclined her head. \u201cMay I ask, how is Lily coping with her grief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has not yet been informed of Leo\u2019s death,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve come for you, Morland. As the remaining members of the Stud Club, we have an obligation to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of obligation? Imposed by whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the code. The Stud Club Code of Good Breeding. As your interest obviously lies purely in the horse and not in the club\u2019s spirit of fraternity, I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve taken the care to acquaint yourself with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of such a thing,\u201d said Morland. He looked to Ashworth. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>The larger man remained cloaked in shadow, but Amelia could tell that he shook his head in the negative.</p><p>\u201cThere is a code,\u201d Bellamy said impatiently. \u201cAnd you are both subject to it. Else you must forfeit your interest in the Club entirely. Now come along, both of you. We must inform Lily of her brother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the three men said in unison. They looked around at one another, as if surprised to find themselves in agreement.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she argued back. \u201cYes, I will. Lily\u2019s parents are no longer living. Leo was her only family, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you gentlemen may have your clubs and tokens and codes of honor, but we ladies have our sisterhood. And I will not allow the three of you to go trampling Lily\u2019s feelings like so many elephants. Tonight, she will learn that her only brother has died and she is alone in the world. She will need understanding, comfort, a shoulder to cry upon. And I refuse to let her suffer through it alone, while you three dolts stand around, arguing the finer points of your asinine club and its asinine code.\u201d</p><p>There was a prolonged silence, during which Amelia began to regret a few of her words. Such as \u201cdolt,\u201d applied to two peers of the realm. And the uninspired repetition of \u201casinine.\u201d But she would not apologize for the sentiment, and she would not be left behind. She knew what it was to lose a brother. She knew what it was to walk down that particular alley of Hell all alone. What she would not have given for Mama\u2019s presence on the day they came about Hugh.</p><p>At last, the duke spoke. \u201cWe will take my carriage. It\u2019s readied, and I have the finest team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bays are warm,\u201d said Bellamy.</p><p>Morland firmed his jaw. \u201cI have the finest team. Anywhere.\u201d</p><p>A deferential silence followed. It hadn\u2019t even been a command, but with those few words the duke had asserted absolute control of the situation. If he had been feeling ill, he now appeared fully recovered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Fitter than ever, to Amelia\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cCan we cut across the gardens? Until we\u2019ve spoken with Lily, I\u2019m loath to draw public notice.\u201d</p> <p>Again, all three men looked to Amelia.</p><p>She paused. Obviously, it would not escape the guests\u2019 attention that she and the Duke of Morland had disappeared into the night. But all would be explained, once Leo\u2019s death became public knowledge tomorrow. And it wasn\u2019t as though they were alone.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy and Ashworth cleared the railing easily. Their boots landed in the flowerbed with a soft squish before they rounded the hedge and disappeared the same way they\u2019d come. Morland went next, stepping over the rail one long leg at a time.</p><p>He directed Amelia to sit on the balustrade, then to swing her legs across. She did so, in rather ungainly fashion. A fold of her gown became tangled in the closure of her slipper, and that made for some seconds\u2019 delay. At last freed, she prepared to slide down from the rail. It was only a few feet to the ground.</p> <p>The duke stopped her.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d he said, placing his hands about her waist. \u201cIt\u2019s muddy here.\u201d</p><p>At her nod of assent, Amelia found herself in those powerful arms for the second time that evening. Lifted effortlessly from the balustrade, swung over the flowerbed, and deposited on the raked gravel path. Gently, this time. Surely she was reading far too much into it, but she couldn\u2019t help but imagine he was making amends. Offering an unspoken apology for his brutish behavior in the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, swaying a bit as he released her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he replied, laying a hand to the coat pocket where he\u2019d placed her handkerchief. \u201cFor earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe needn\u2019t speak of it. Are you well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Together they followed the path the other men had taken, walking alongside one another. He did not offer his arm. He did, however, point out a toad in the path an instant before she would have stepped on it.</p><p>As they rounded the front corner of the house and approached the paved driveway where the carriages and drivers sat waiting, he spoke once again. \u201cWhat does it stand for, the C?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour initial.\u201d He patted his pocket again.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Understanding dawned. \u201cClaire. It stands for Claire. Amelia Claire.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked on.</p><p>Amelia purposely fell behind.</p> <p>Ninny, ninny. They passed a piece of bronze statuary, and Amelia longed to bash her head against it. What an absolute muffin she was. He\u2019d asked her a question once. She had to answer it three times? \u201cClaire,\u201d she mimicked quietly, adopting the voice of a parrot. \u201cIt stands for Claire. Amelia Claire.\u201d</p><p>She recognized, and rued, the giddy flutter in her belly: infatuation. It could not have happened at a worse time. Nothing good could come of it. And of all the gentlemen in London, this one? She hadn\u2019t been exaggerating in the ballroom, when she\u2019d told him he danced divinely and was undeniably handsome. Nor when she\u2019d confessed an unchaste longing to touch his dark, curling hair. And he really did lift the hairs on her neck. True, all of it true.</p><p>He\u2019s horrid, she silently told herself. Loutish, arrogant, insufferable! He refused to release Jack from debt. He insulted you. He bodily hauled you from a ballroom and then offered you money to just please go away! And for heaven\u2019s sake, you are on your way to tell Lily Chatwick her twin brother is dead. You are a depraved, deranged woman, Amelia Claire-Claire-Claire d\u2019Orsay!</p><p>It was just ... something about those few unrehearsed moments, when a strange rustling in the hedge made them forget debts and insults and act on instinct alone. And she\u2019d rushed to his side with her treasured handkerchief, and he\u2019d put his body between her and the unknown. She could not escape the feeling that they\u2019d formed an unspoken alliance and were now acting as a team.</p><p>He touched a hand to his coat pocket again. He kept doing that. And every time he did, her knees went weak.</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>They reached the carriage. It was an impressive conveyance. Jet-black, glossy, emblazoned with the Morland ducal crest, and drawn by a team of four perfectly matched black horses.</p><p>The duke helped her in, closing one of his hands about her fingers and placing the other against the small of her back. Bellamy and Ashworth had already situated themselves on the rear-facing seat, leaving Amelia and Morland to share the front-facing one.</p><p>Nothing about this situation should thrill her. It was terrible, the way his authoritative command to the driver shot sparks to her toes. It was unpardonable, how she sat toward the middle of the seat and allowed her body to fall against his as the carriage lurched into motion.</p><p>\u201cHow did Harcliffe die?\u201d the duke asked.</p><p>Thank you, Amelia said silently, scooting away from him until she hugged the outer edge of the seat. Thank you for reminding me of the gravity of our situation and the utter inappropriateness of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cFootpads,\u201d said Bellamy. \u201cHe was beaten to death in the street, in Whitechapel. It appears to have been a random attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God.\u201d</p><p>It was too dark for Amelia to make out the expressions of anyone in the coach. She reckoned, therefore, it was too dark for them to see hers. And so she permitted herself a rush of hot, silent tears.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t right. Waterloo was over; the war had ended. Young, handsome men at the peak of vitality were supposed to stop dying. Only a few weeks ago, she\u2019d spied Leo at the theater. He\u2019d taken a box with some of his friends. The lot of them were loud and disruptive in the way only Leo\u2019s friends could be, because Leo was always forgiven everything. Everyone loved him so.</p><p>Amelia shuddered. Beaten to death, by footpads. If such a thing could happen to Leo ... it could so easily have been Jack.</p><p>\u201cIt could have been me,\u201d said Bellamy. \u201cGod, it should have been me. I was supposed to go with him tonight, but I begged off.\u201d His rough voice cracked. \u201cWhat a damned bloody waste. If I\u2019d been there, I might have prevented it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you might have been killed, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter me than him. He had a title, responsibilities, a sister to protect.\u201d He swore violently. \u201cWhat will become of Lily now? This is all my fault. The boxing match was my idea in the first place. And I begged off. I begged off, to spend the evening with that harlot Carnelia.\u201d He leaned forward, burying his face in his hands.</p><p>Amelia supposed he must refer to the very scandalous, very married Lady Carnelia Hightower. Though her mind reeled, she remained silent. The last thing she wanted was to remind all three men there was a lady in the carriage and cause them to temper their remarks. For Lily\u2019s sake, she wanted to gather all the information she could. For once, the quality of being invisible to men worked in her favor.</p><p>The duke cleared his throat. \u201cYou called it a random attack. If that is the case ... well then, random is random. It might have been anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been me.\u201d This came from Ashworth, the taciturn giant across from her. \u201cI cannot die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say such a thing?\u201d Amelia asked, abandoning her intention to remain silent. It was such a shocking statement to make, and something in the low rasp of his voice told her he did not speak from arrogance.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve tried, several times. And as you see, I\u2019ve failed on each occasion.\u201d</p><p>She had no response to that.</p><p>\u201cAsk your friend Morland,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m bloody hard to knock down.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, the duke tensed. Clearly the two men had some history of enmity.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Mr. Bellamy raised his head, scrubbing at his eyes with his palm. \u201cWe\u2019ve no time for this. Leo is gone. It\u2019s Lily we need to discuss. As Leo died without issue, the Harcliffe title, estate, properties\u2014including the town house\u2014will all pass to some distant cousin. She probably has a legacy due her, but given her condition, she cannot live independently in Town.\u201d</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t, Amelia silently agreed. Poor Lily. She must find some way to help her. \u201cWhat do you propose, Mr. Bellamy?\u201d</p><p>The man looked from Ashworth to Morland. \u201cMy lord, Your Grace\u2014one of you must marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry her?\u201d Spencer blinked. \u201cDid you just say one of us must marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Sighing deeply, he raised a hand to his temple. No offense intended to the deceased, nor to Lily Chatwick and her mysterious \u201ccondition.\u201d It was just that this situation would clearly require a great deal of discussion, and he\u2019d far exceeded his allotment of civil speech for the evening.</p><p>What he wanted to do was to go home, toss back two fingers of brandy, and prostrate himself on the library floor\u2014well, on the carpet; the floor was unforgiving oak, and he wasn\u2019t an ascetic monk, after all\u2014until this damned whirling clamor in his head cleared. Come morning, he\u2019d take Juno out for a rambling canter, probably halfway to Dover and back. She was uneasy in Town, unused to the crowds and noise. A long ride over open country would put them both to rights. Afterward, he\u2019d give the mare a proper grooming himself. She was touchy with these London stablehands, and they were never able to do a thorough job. After all that ... perhaps dinner before he went out in search of cards.</p><p>That was what he wanted to do. But, as so often happened, what he wanted and what was required of him were disparate things.</p><p>\u201cThe Stud Club code states,\u201d said Bellamy, \u201cthat in the event of a member\u2019s untimely demise, the brotherhood is honor bound to care for his dependents. With her brother gone, Lily will need a protector. She must marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you do it?\u201d Ashworth asked. \u201cYou are obviously well acquainted with her. Weren\u2019t you and Harcliffe friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe closest of friends, yes. Which is precisely why I cannot do it. Lady Lily Chatwick is the sister of a marquess. Her ancestry includes several royals. I believe Leo once told me she\u2019s thirteenth in line for the Crown. I am ...\u201d Bellamy pressed a fist against the seat cushion. \u201cI am no one of consequence.\u201d</p><p>Well, on that point he and Spencer were in complete agreement. He despised the vain upstart. From what he heard at the tables, Bellamy had arrived out of nowhere some three years ago. Despite the man\u2019s vague origins, even the veriest snobs invited him to every rout and card party, for his amusement value alone. He was an uncanny mimic.</p><p>Spencer had once watched from a doorway as Bellamy regaled an audience of dozens with his bawdy imitations of Byron and Lady Caroline Lamb. He thought the man a pathetic clown, but the young bucks of the ton worshipped him. They mimicked the mimic: imitated his style of dress, his manner of walking, his cutting witticisms. Some went so far as to have their valets apply some noxious mixture of soot and egg whites to their scalp, to imitate his riffled black hair.</p><p>Spencer had no interest in the man\u2019s hair or fashion, and nothing but contempt for his cheap brand of humor. But he did have a keen interest in one thing of Bellamy\u2019s: the brass token that made him a member of the Stud Club.</p><p>\u201cIt will have to be Morland,\u201d said Ashworth. \u201cI\u2019m not marrying her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be damned lucky to marry her,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cShe\u2019s a lovely, intelligent lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain she is. But the last thing I\u2019d do to a woman I admired is marry her.\u201d</p><p>Spencer couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cOh, you\u2019ve a shred of decency now? Where did that come from, I wonder? Perhaps you found it lying around a battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I did,\u201d the man said evenly. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t meet with you there.\u201d</p><p>Spencer glowered. Just like the bastard, to deal him a low blow. As a youth, there\u2019d been nothing he wanted more than to follow his father\u2019s example and purchase a commission in the Army. But when his father died, Spencer became the late duke\u2019s heir. Suddenly he had a title, duties, responsibilities. He would have been risking hundreds of lives in battle, not merely his own. Farewell, visions of glory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you marry her, Ashworth?\u201d Bellamy asked. \u201cYou\u2019re a lord, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lately inherited a barony. It consists of a worthless expanse of moorland in Devonshire and a house that burnt to the ground fourteen years ago. I had to sell out my commission just to pay the creditors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d Lady Amelia said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>Forgive her? Spencer would have thanked her, profusely. A change in conversation was all too welcome.</p><p>\u201cBut I knew your name was familiar,\u201d she went on, speaking to Ashworth, \u201cand then you mentioned the commission ... Are you by chance Lieutenant Colonel St. Maur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. And yes, I knew your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so. He mentioned you in his letters, always spoke of your bravery. Were you ...\u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cWere you with him, at Waterloo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not at the end. He served in a different battalion. But I can tell you he was a fine man, and an excellent officer. Admired by those who served under him, well regarded by his superiors. A credit to his family and country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Lady Amelia seemed satisfied, but to Spencer\u2019s ears, this speech was flat, unconvincing. Rehearsed. As though Ashworth had spoken those exact words many, many times. He probably had. Perhaps to him, tonight\u2019s errand\u2014notifying a young lady of her brother\u2019s untimely death\u2014was nothing but routine. It would explain this new gravity in his demeanor. Spencer didn\u2019t remember him being so solemn, before.</p><p>Not that they\u2019d spent much time conversing at Eton. Difficult to chat while throwing punches.</p><p>\u201cWhere is his body?\u201d Lady Amelia suddenly asked. \u201cLeo\u2019s, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt my home,\u201d Bellamy answered. \u201cMy men are keeping watch until he can be brought to the undertaker\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLily will want to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady. She won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will, I assure you. No matter what his injuries. I ...\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cI would have given much, for the opportunity to see Hugh. His death would have been easier to accept, I think.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, Spencer became extremely\u2014there was no better word for it\u2014aware of Lady Amelia d\u2019Orsay. His team of blacks hied left, pulling the carriage around a sharp corner, and she fell against him. Soft, warm. Her lavender scent was richer than it had been earlier. As she righted herself, a drop of moisture landed on the strip of exposed skin between his glove and his sleeve.</p><p>She was weeping.</p><p>Weeping, in absolute silence, presumably too proud to ask for a handkerchief after she\u2019d pressed hers on Spencer in the garden. His hand strayed to his side pocket, where her precise, cheerful stitches secretly decorated the black satin lining. It was her own fault she was without it\u2014he hadn\u2019t wanted the thing in the first place.</p><p>But now, perversely, he didn\u2019t want to give it back.</p><p>\u201cThat settles it then,\u201d said Bellamy. \u201cMorland will marry her.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer said, \u201cI refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy leaned forward. \u201cIt\u2019s in the Stud Club code. Neither Ashworth nor I are suitable prospects, as you\u2019ve heard. If you hadn\u2019t so methodically reduced the number of our members over recent weeks, there might be other candidates. But you did. And as you are now seven-tenths of the club, the burden of responsibility falls on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Lady Amelia said. \u201cHow can one man be seven-tenths of a club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the tokens, my lady,\u201d said Bellamy. \u201cYou see, Leo purchased an exceptional stallion some years ago. Osiris was once the finest racehorse in England. He\u2019s too old to race anymore, but still valuable as a stud horse. Many gentlemen were asking the favor of breeding rights, and Leo devised the Stud Club scheme as a lark. If you knew Leo, you know how he loved a good joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he and my brother were boys, they once stole the clapper from the church bell just so they could sleep in on Sunday morning.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy smiled. \u201cYes, that sounds like Leo. Which brother of yours was this? Lord Beauvale? Or Jack?\u201d When she did not immediately answer, the man added, \u201cOr\u2014God, I\u2019m sorry. Not the one who died in Belgium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not Hugh. None of those, actually. This was my brother Michael. He\u2019s an officer in the Navy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord. Just how many of you are there?\u201d Spencer regretted the question instantly. What had possessed him to ask it? Why the devil should he care?</p><p>The longer Lady Amelia went without answering, the further the accusatory hush spread through the carriage: Badly done, Morland. Badly done. Truly, he was capable of civil conversation. Just not at any time before, during, or for several hours following a ball.</p><p>At last, she answered. \u201cThere were six of us, once. Now only five. I am the only daughter.\u201d She paused, perhaps waiting to hear what rude-mannered question would be hurled at her next. When none came, she prompted, \u201cPlease continue, Mr. Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Leo had ten tokens fashioned from brass and distributed them to close friends. Possession of a token entitled a man to send mares to Osiris to be mated. But as a matter of club code, the tokens could never be bartered, purchased, or given away. They could only be won in a game of chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt cards,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCards, dice, wagers of any sort. That handful of misshapen brass tokens became the most coveted currency in London. Everyone wanted a share of Osiris, of course. But more than that, they wanted to be a part of the club. The fraternity, the camaraderie ... there\u2019s a certain cachet now, among gentlemen of our set, to calling oneself a member of the Stud Club. Not many clubs can be so exclusive as to permit only ten members, and winning a token meant that luck or wits, or both, were with you.\u201d Bellamy shot Spencer a cutting look. \u201cThen Morland here came along and ruined the fun. He\u2019s collected seven of the ten tokens now. The remaining three belong to me, Ashworth here, and Leo, of course.\u201d</p><p>The seat cushion resettled as Lady Amelia pivoted in Spencer\u2019s direction. \u201cBut why would he do that?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy said, \u201cCare to answer the lady, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>Spencer stared hard out the carriage window. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I want the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mr. Bellamy has said, one token is sufficient for securing breeding privileges. Why insist on obtaining them all? Why such greed?\u201d</p><p>Spencer heard the accusation in her voice. She blamed his \u201cgreed\u201d for her brother\u2019s debt. \u201cWhere Osiris is concerned, I am not interested in breeding privileges. I am interested in possession. I don\u2019t like to share.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy shook his head. \u201cThere you have it, Lady Amelia. His Grace is uninterested in brotherhood, friendship, the preservation of a fixture in London society. He only cares for the horseflesh involved. I tell you, Morland\u2014you may not like to share, but you\u2019ll have to. You\u2019re not getting my token unless you pry it from my cold, dead hands. The Stud Club was Leo\u2019s creation, and I\u2019ll not allow you to destroy his legacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do want me to marry his sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Er, yes.\u201d Bellamy growled with frustration. \u201cI mean, I do not want it. I wish to God there were someone\u2014anyone\u2014else. But there isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lady Amelia made a strange, inarticulate noise. Did it convey dismay? Frustration? Amusement? At least she wasn\u2019t weeping any longer.</p><p>Clearly, Bellamy could not translate her outburst any better than Spencer could. Cocking his head, he eyed the two of them carefully. \u201cThat is, unless you are already engaged. Did we interrupt something on the terrace back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said quickly, laughing as she did. \u201cWhatever you interrupted, it was not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, Your Grace, honor compels you to make an offer to Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Lady Amelia, \u201cbut precisely what is honorable about deciding a woman\u2019s future without so much as soliciting her opinion? If Lily wanted to marry, she might have done so years ago. We are not living in the Dark Ages, sirs. A lady\u2019s consent is generally considered a prerequisite before any wedding plans are made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but even in these modern times, sometimes circumstances\u2014such as a death or impending poverty\u2014make a lady\u2019s decision for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot speak for Lily, Mr. Bellamy. But I can tell you, I have faced such circumstances. And they have never made the decisions for me.\u201d</p><p>So, Spencer thought to himself, Lady Amelia had received offers of marriage. And refused them. He had been wondering whether her spinsterhood was a condition arrived at by choice, or merely from a lack of alternatives.</p><p>Damn it, why was he wondering about her? Why did he feel this need to know everything about an impertinent, managing, none-too-pretty female? But he did. Oh, he did not want to engage in anything so gauche or peril-fraught as inquiry. He merely wanted a reference\u2014the comprehensive codex of all things Amelia Claire d\u2019Orsay. A chart of her ancestry back to the Norman invaders. The catalogue listing every book she\u2019d ever read. A topographical map indicating the precise location of every freckle on her skin.</p><p>Ashworth spoke. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</p><p>The carriage rolled to a quiet halt before Harcliffe Manor. As they waited for the footman to open the door, Bellamy leaned forward and spoke directly to Spencer.</p><p>\u201cLily may be deaf, but she is not stupid. She reads lips, and she speaks with diction every bit as aristocratic as yours. Look at her when you speak; that\u2019s all that is required. Do not raise your voice or speak in simplistic terms, as if she were your senile great-aunt. Do not talk about her as if she isn\u2019t in the room. Do not treat her as anything less than your social and intellectual equal.\u201d</p><p>Spencer bristled. \u201cWhy are you directing all this admonishment at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause before this night\u2019s through, you will have a private audience with her. You will make Lily an offer, Morland. You will. Or by God, I\u2019ll call you out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cA duel?\u201d Amelia cried. \u201cWhatever for? So we will have two deaths tonight, instead of one?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, the duke said icily, \u201cJust try it, Bellamy. I will take pleasure in prying that token from your cold, dead hands.\u201d</p><p>Really, these men were impossible.</p><p>When the carriage door swung open, Amelia rose from her seat and bustled between Bellamy and Morland, who sat trading murderous glares. As she exited the coach, the men followed her.</p><p>Rushing up to claim the front stoop, she stood blocking the door and addressed them firmly, in the tone her mother had used to address her quarreling brothers. If these grown men were going to behave like boys squabbling over marbles, someone with sense had to take charge. For Lily\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cHold a moment, if you please. Before we go in, I will have my say.\u201d</p><p>The three men stared up at her, and Amelia\u2019s resolve began to waver. They may have been behaving like children, but they were, all three of them, quite large, powerful, and intimidating men. A duke, a warrior, a scoundrel. She was unused to commanding the attention of such men. La, she was unused to commanding the attention of any men, aside from her own brothers. Her navel was still turning cartwheels whenever she so much as thought of glancing in the duke\u2019s direction. And thanks to the smoky, amber glow of the carriage lamp, she was getting her first clear look at Lord Ashworth and Mr. Bellamy.</p><p>What she saw did not put her at ease.</p><p>Ashworth was enormous, in every respect\u2014tall, broad, imposing. A dramatic scar sliced from his temple to his cheekbone. The blow that caused it must have narrowly missed his eye. But for all Ashworth had the look of a marauding pirate, she felt safer with him than with Bellamy. Despite his rakishly mussed hair, Mr. Bellamy\u2019s clothing and manner were polished\u2014so polished, they gave the impression of slickness. There was such a thing as a man too handsome to be trusted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>She drew a deep, steadying breath. \u201cHere is what will occur. We will alert the house staff to awaken Lily and ask her to dress. By the time she comes down, I promise you, she will be prepared for the worst.\u201d</p><p>Any woman, when awakened in the dead of night, prepared herself for the worst. How many times had Amelia stumbled downstairs, tripping over feet numb with dread, certain that disaster had befallen another of her loved ones? Only to discover it was Jack, staggering in from an evening spent carousing with his \u201cfriends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen she comes down,\u201d she continued, \u201cI will speak with her alone. You gentlemen wait in Lord Harcliffe\u2019s study, and I will inform Lily of her brother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Amelia\u2014\u201d</p><p>She silenced Bellamy by raising an open palm. \u201cIt is not a task I relish, sir. But I will not leave it to the three of you. Forgive me for speaking frankly, but after the past quarter-hour\u2019s conversation, I am unconvinced that any of you possess the sense or sensitivity to impart the news in any respectful fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, I must insist\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you must listen!\u201d Her voice squeaked, and she pressed a hand to her belly. \u201cYou must understand, I have lived through the very experience that Lily is about to endure. And the three of you together, you\u2019re a fearsome group. I\u2019m not even certain how I\u2019m able to stand before you without melting into the mist ... except that this has been a most unconventional evening, and I\u2019m no longer certain of much at all.\u201d</p> <p>Dear Lord, now she was babbling, and they were looking at her with that strange combination of pity and panic with which men regard a woman on the verge of hysterics.</p><p>Pull yourself together, Amelia.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, allow me to break the news delicately. If Lily gets one look at you, she\u2019s going to instantly know\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a gentle creak, the door swung open behind her.</p><p>Amelia pivoted, meeting face-to-face not with a servant, as she\u2019d anticipated, but with Lily Chatwick herself. For the first time in ... oh, it must have been two years. Since Hugh\u2019s funeral, perhaps. They\u2019d been friends as girls\u2014not the closest of friends, as Lily was a few years older. But after the fever that left Lily without hearing, they\u2019d seen one another less and less. She did not come out in society often.</p><p>\u201cAmelia?\u201d Lily swept a lock of dark hair from her face. With her other hand, she clutched the neck of her dressing gown closed. \u201cWhy, Amelia d\u2019Orsay, whatever are you doing here at this\u2014\u201d Her sleepy, dark-fringed eyes went to the men.</p> <p>Amelia squeezed her hands into fists. Lily couldn\u2019t have heard her remarks, she reminded herself. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t too late to break the news gently.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear God.\u201d Lily\u2019s hand went to her throat. \u201cLeo\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Lily said some time later, staring blankly at her folded hands. They sat in the parlor. A cup of brandy-laced tea rested on the table, untouched and long gone cold. \u201cSomehow I just knew it, even before you arrived. I\u2019d retired early. I was so very tired last night. But then I woke with a start not an hour later and haven\u2019t been able to sleep since. I just knew he was gone.\u201d</p><p>Amelia moved her chair closer to her friend\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Such worthless, feeble words. But really, in such a situation, there was nothing helpful to be said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to believe it, had I not felt it in my own heart. As it is, I\u2019ve been growing accustomed to the idea for several hours now. We\u2019ve always known when the other was in danger. Because we are twins, I suspect. Our bond has always been close. During my illness, he took the mail coach all the way home from Oxford, even though no one had written him. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d Lily bent her head to her folded hands. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard to imagine existing without him, when I never have.\u201d</p><p>Her slight shoulders shook as she cried, and Amelia smoothed the black plait of hair running down the grieving woman\u2019s back. The casual observer would never have guessed that she and Leo were twins. Their appearances could not have been more different. Leo had golden-brown hair, bronzed skin\u2014an aura of health and energy radiated from him. By contrast, Lily was fair and dark-haired, of serene and contemplative disposition. The moon to her brother\u2019s sun. Amelia had heard it suggested, in gossipy settings, that the twin birth was a fortunate thing for their mother\u2019s reputation\u2014for no one would believe Leo and Lily to be children of the same father, had they not emerged from the womb within minutes of one another.</p><p>Amelia squeezed her friend\u2019s shoulder lightly until Lily lifted her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Leo gone, even for me. More than anyone in my acquaintance, he always seemed so ... so alive. He will be greatly missed.\u201d She gentled her touch, stroking reassuringly. \u201cBut you needn\u2019t be anxious. For as many people as there were who loved Leo, there will be equally many eager to assist you, in any way.\u201d She threw a sideways glance toward the doors that connected this parlor with the library. \u201cJust in the other room, you have three of England\u2019s most powerful men, each of them prepared to swim the Channel, if you asked it.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Lily\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cMr. Bellamy is responsible for the presence of the other two, I am sure. Sometimes I think that man will smother me under his good intentions.\u201d</p> <p>She must have caught Amelia\u2019s fleeting look of skepticism.</p><p>\u201cOh, do not mistake him,\u201d Lily said. \u201cJulian is a gifted performer. His favorite, and most successful, role is that of the incorrigible rou\u00e9. But he has been a steadfast friend to Leo and no doubt views it his duty to assume brotherly guardianship of me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain his interest is entirely brotherly?\u201d Amelia recalled Mr. Bellamy\u2019s behavior in the coach, and his impassioned defense to any remark that might be construed as even mildly disparaging to Lily.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Lily said. \u201cOn that point, I am quite certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel I should tell you, on our way here the three of them were arguing over ... over who among them should be the fortunate one to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me? I never thought to marry at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them that you would need time to absorb this news, time to grieve. I tried to persuade them against presenting you with such decisions tonight, but I do not know if I was successful.\u201d</p><p>More accurately, she did not know if Mr. Bellamy\u2019s threats had been successful in removing Morland\u2019s reluctance. She hoped not. And not because she would be jealous. No, envy had nothing to do with this. Whatever her own physical attraction to the duke, Amelia was wise enough not to confuse it with esteem for his character. This evening alone, she\u2019d witnessed more than enough evidence of that gentleman\u2019s callous attitudes toward debt, death, society, friendship, and marriage to know she would not wish such a husband on any woman she called friend.</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Lily said weakly. Her head sank to the table again. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. This has to do with that absurd club Leo started, with the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a ridiculous name he gave it. The Stud Club. I told him, he should have asked me for ideas. I could think of a dozen better things to call it. What\u2019s wrong with the Stallion Society?\u201d</p><p>Amelia bit back a laugh, then dipped her head to catch Lily\u2019s attention. \u201cIf you like, I\u2019ll send them away. I\u2019ve stood up to them all once already tonight, and I\u2019m not afraid to do it again.\u201d</p><p>Pride strengthened her voice as she said this. And why should it not? At some point this evening, between surrendering her last few coins to Jack and claiming the Duke of Morland\u2019s hand, Amelia had stepped outside herself, somehow. Or stepped outside that quiet, unassuming, plain, and proper shell she\u2019d been inhabiting all her life. Scolding a trio of intimidating men was only part of it. She\u2019d confronted a duke, even flirted with him during a sensual waltz. With no success, but still\u2014it went beyond anything she\u2019d dared before. Add to all this, she\u2019d departed the ball under mysterious circumstances, and right now the gossips were probably debating precisely when that well-bred d\u2019Orsay girl had become such a brazen adventuress.</p><p>Why, at the stroke of midnight, of course. That was the moment Amelia had ceased to be a pumpkin. And no matter what tomorrow brought, she was proud of herself for that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go chase them off now,\u201d she said, pushing back from the table.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI\u2019ll speak with them. I know they are grieving, too, and they mean well. Men do have that incurable need to try their hand at fixing things. Even things that can never be mended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them you\u2019d want to see Leo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Yes, I would.\u201d Her voice was polite and remote. Amelia knew she had entered that numb void of unreality that followed a great shock. For all Lily insisted she\u2019d sensed the truth hours ago and had grown accustomed to the idea in the interim, Amelia knew Leo\u2019s death would not become real to her for some time yet. And when it did, the pain would be near unbearable.</p><p>She would not press Lily to confront that grief now. Let her float in that dark nothingness as long as she could.</p><p>\u201cShall I come upstairs with you and help you dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ll do. My maid is awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll wait with the gentlemen until you\u2019re ready. May I direct your cook to have a cold supper sent in? The beasts may prove more docile after a feeding. And if you can manage it, you should take some food, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Direct the servants however you think best.\u201d Bracing both hands flat on the table, Lily pushed back her chair and slowly stood. \u201cI\u2019m grateful you\u2019re here, Amelia. You are so very good.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, the array of cold meats and cheeses laid out on a serving cart remained largely untouched. The duke sat in a winged armchair in the farthest reaches of the library, impatiently leafing through the pages of a book. If he had looked up once in the past hour, Amelia had not noticed it. And, to her frustration, she found herself watching him a great deal.</p><p>The only one of the gentlemen to eat anything had been Lord Ashworth, and he now lay reclined on the divan, eyes closed and massive boots propped on the studded leather ottoman. His attitude of repose did not strike her as disrespectful, however. She might have described it as prudent. A military trait, she assumed. Ashworth was clearly a man who did not allow death to interfere with the unceasing work of survival. He would not waste an opportunity to eat, drink, or rest when it presented itself.</p><p>By contrast, Mr. Bellamy had not ceased moving since Amelia entered the room. He\u2019d prowled the floor so many times, she feared he would wear a groove in the parquet. When the doorbell rang, he dashed to answer it himself. The caller was an investigator, Amelia gathered through scraps of overheard conversation, charged with tracking down the footpads who\u2019d murdered Leo.</p><p>\u201cSome news?\u201d the duke asked, when Bellamy reentered.</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing we didn\u2019t know already. He was beset in an alley, somewhere in Whitechapel. The motive appears to have been robbery. Some urchins nearby heard scuffling and shouts, but they were too frightened to investigate. It was a prostitute who found his body and called for a hack, but she\u2019s since disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they know to bring him to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she came upon him, he was still alive, barely. He apparently gave her my address. A fortunate thing, too, or who knows what might have happened to his body. Sold to medical students, most likely. I\u2019m surprised the whore didn\u2019t think of that. She was probably hoping for a reward, saving a nobleman\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe she simply had a conscience and a good heart,\u201d Amelia said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Bellamy made a sound of skepticism. \u201cWell, no matter how pure her intentions, they weren\u2019t enough to save him. He died en route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you there at home, when they brought him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He swore under his breath. \u201cNo, they had to send for me. Damn it, if only I\u2019d been with him. This wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>With a sudden, savage burst of strength, he crashed his fist down on a bookshelf. Amelia jumped in her seat. Lord Ashworth\u2019s eyes popped open.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cThis is my fault. I can\u2019t make it right, but I will do what I can\u2014bring Leo\u2019s murderers to justice and see Lily well settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are unlikely to accomplish either goal tonight,\u201d the duke said.</p><p>Bellamy started in the duke\u2019s direction. \u201cYou will offer for her, Morland. If I have to hold a knife to your bal\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Amelia shot to her feet. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, blocking Bellamy\u2019s path. \u201cPlease, if you care for Lily\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he cut in impatiently. \u201cAs I would my own sister, if I had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I beg you, allow her some time to grieve. Her brother has died. Whether he went violently or peacefully, expected or not\u2014what matters is, he is gone from her life, and this is a tragedy. If you care for her, offer her comfort and understanding, not promises of vengeance or proposals of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Bellamy released his breath. \u201cI will speak no further of murder and retribution. But he\u201d\u2014he pointed toward the duke\u2014\u201chad better do his duty by Lily. If he wants to hold on to his share in Osiris, he has no choice.\u201d</p><p>Morland put aside his book. \u201cNo choice? I am a duke. I always have a choice. And I do not respond favorably to threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not threatening you,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cI\u2019m merely reminding you of the Stud Club code. Any member who fails to adhere to the Code of Good Breeding must surrender his interest in the horse.\u201d</p> <p>A thought occurred to Amelia. \u201cBut Leo\u2019s dead. Doesn\u2019t this horse pass to his heir, as the rest of his possessions do?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy gave the duke a cold smile before turning to Amelia. \u201cNo, my lady. Leo designed the club very cleverly. Had his solicitor draw it all up. Osiris is held in trust, and any breeding rights are contingent on two conditions: possession of a token and adherence to the code. If His Grace fails to fulfill his obligations, he forfeits any rights to the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d Morland said.</p><p>Amelia thought the entire enterprise was absurd. She was heartily sick of hearing about this Stud Club and the vagaries of its code.</p><p>The duke continued, \u201cThis code of yours ... in the coach, you said members must provide for the dependents of the deceased. I don\u2019t recall any mention of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how else you could provide for her. She will lose this house, and everything in it. Even with whatever income she may have, she cannot live independently. As much would be true for any well-bred gentlewoman, but when one takes into consideration her condition ...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere are no alternatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course there are!\u201d Amelia cried, increasingly desperate to save Lily from this ill-conceived plan, which was proving to be nothing but a product of Mr. Bellamy\u2019s guilty conscience and the Duke of Morland\u2019s greed for horseflesh. \u201cIt will take time for the will to be executed. Lily is not in danger of being forced out onto the street tomorrow. And gentlewomen of means do live independently. I don\u2019t see why Lily\u2019s deafness should preclude it, if such is her desire. She could always engage the services of a companion. Some widow or unmarried lady of good breeding but little fortune, to provide her with companionship and assist her in managing the household. Such arrangements are made all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA paid companion,\u201d the duke said thoughtfully. His hazel eyes trained on Amelia. \u201cThat would solve matters nicely. If a suitable candidate presented herself.\u201d</p> <p>Cocking his head a fraction, he raised one eyebrow and continued to regard her with that intense, scrutinizing gaze. A meaningful gaze.</p><p>She went hot and prickly all over.</p><p>Oh, no. No, you don\u2019t.</p><p>How dare he suggest, even tacitly, that Amelia would make a suitable paid companion? Such employment was for destitute widows and hopeless spinsters. Women with no prospects whatsoever, and no family or fortune of their own. That wasn\u2019t her!</p><p>At least, not yet.</p><p>There he sat, so smugly handsome. She could practically hear the arrogant words echoing in his skull: I am a duke. I always have a choice. And you may as well abandon all dreams for your future and become a paid companion, because a man like me would never choose a woman like you.</p><p>Yes, well. She\u2019d absorbed that point already, hadn\u2019t she? Dozens of midnight snubs had taught her that lesson. But earlier that evening, when she\u2019d taken his hand, forced him to listen, given him her opinions\u2014not to mention her handkerchief\u2014Amelia had felt she\u2019d clawed her way to equal footing with the man.</p><p>Evidently not. Swiftly, surely, with a ruthless economy of words and those devastating eyes, he had put Amelia back in her place. What was it about this man that made her react so strongly? Despite his fine looks and obvious intelligence\u2014or perhaps because of them\u2014he, more than any man of her acquaintance, had the power to make her feel so vulnerable, lacking, and most decidedly unwanted.</p><p>Breaking eye contact with the Duke of Morland was not something Amelia wished to do. It was something she needed to do, as an act of sheer self-preservation.</p><p>For the love of God, why couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>From the doorway, Lily cleared her throat. \u201cThank you all for waiting. I am ready now.\u201d</p><p>Gratefully, Amelia turned away from the duke to face her friend. Lily\u2019s long black hair had been replaited, and she\u2019d changed into a dark blue day dress that was elegant in its simplicity. Or perhaps it was elegant simply because Lily wore it. Nearing thirty now, she still had the willowy figure of her youth, and the same dark, doelike eyes Amelia had always envied. Even in grief, she was stunning. And had she not been so opposed to the idea of her friend marrying any of the gentlemen in this room, Amelia would have taken umbrage on behalf of Lily, and indeed the entire female sex, that any man would have so much as a moment\u2019s hesitation when offered the chance to apply for her hand.</p><p>With her entrance, both Lord Ashworth and the duke rose to their feet, as etiquette dictated. But then, to Amelia\u2019s surprise\u2014to everyone\u2019s surprise\u2014the Duke of Morland did more than stand.</p><p>He came forward.</p><p>\u201cLady Lily,\u201d he began. \u201cMay I express my deepest sympathies for your loss.\u201d</p><p>His \u201cdeepest sympathies?\u201d Amelia suspected this man\u2019s deepest sympathies would not fill a thimble.</p><p>\u201cLet me assure you,\u201d Morland continued, \u201cthat as a friend of Harcliffe\u2019s, a fellow peer, and an associate in his club, my honor as a gentleman compels me to offer you any assistance you may require.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Your Grace,\u201d Lily replied. She flicked a distressed glance in Amelia\u2019s direction, as it became clear the duke was not yet finished speaking.</p><p>\u201cIn addition, it is my intention to make you an offer,\u201d he said.</p><p>The room held its breath.</p><p>\u201cI should like to make you a substantial offer for your brother\u2019s share in the stallion Osiris.\u201d</p><p>His words skated on the thin, tense surface of quiet. Until they crashed under a resounding chorus from every corner of the room: \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to purchase his token,\u201d the duke said.</p><p>Ashworth\u2019s boots thunked to the floor. \u201cYou can\u2019t purchase his token. They can only be won in a game of chance.\u201d</p><p>Morland said coolly, \u201cWas his not a random killing? Bad luck, in its purest form.\u201d</p><p>That did it. Amelia\u2019s impression of the Duke of Morland was now cemented. Not only cemented\u2014cast in bronze. He was the most arrogant, self-absorbed, unfeeling man she\u2019d ever had the misfortune to waltz with, bar none.</p><p>\u201cYou are supposed to offer her marriage,\u201d Bellamy growled.</p><p>\u201cI am duty-bound to offer her assistance. And so I have done.\u201d He addressed Lily once again. \u201cMadam, tomorrow I will direct my secretary to call. He will be at your disposal in any regard, whether it be making burial arrangements or securing new housing. He will also bring a bank draft constituting my offer for Leo\u2019s share in the Stud Club, which you may review and accept or decline as you wish.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy said, \u201cYou bastard. This is a matter of honor, and all you can think of is the damned horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll any of you can think of is the damned horse!\u201d Amelia went to Lily\u2019s side. \u201cLily\u2019s future is her own to decide. Stop puffing up your chests and playing at this childish imitation of chivalry. All this going on about honor and duty ... you own shares in an animal, for God\u2019s sake. You are not the Knights of the Round Table. By your own admission, Leo devised this club as a joke. Don\u2019t you have real duties to tend to, actual human relationships worth your efforts and attention? Or is this all you have in your lives, a bit of play-acting nonsense centered on a horse?\u201d</p><p>All three fell quiet, diverting their gaze to various features of the room\u2019s d\u00e9cor\u2014tassels, fringes, lacquered trays that had probably never suffered such intense male scrutiny. Perhaps these men truly didn\u2019t have anything in their lives worth caring about, aside from this horse and this club. It would certainly explain their pathetic silence.</p><p>It was really ... quite sad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Amelia,\u201d said Lily. She drew a deep breath and addressed the men. \u201cYour Grace, my lord\u201d\u2014she turned to Bellamy\u2014\u201cJulian. I know you are all acting from honorable motives, and I do appreciate your concern. Leo would be heartened to see such evidence of your friendship.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of Leo\u2019s name from her lips, and the slight waver in her tone, the men softened in both posture and expression.</p><p>\u201cHis death leaves me bereft and grieving, but not penniless. I have means, and I have friends of my own.\u201d She squeezed Amelia\u2019s hand. \u201cEven if I did wish to marry, I must complete a year of mourning first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose rules don\u2019t apply,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cNot in an extreme situation such as\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lily shook her head. \u201cThere is nothing extreme about my situation, aside from the tremendous shock. Leo is ... was so very young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo young. All the wrong men die young.\u201d Swearing, Ashworth kicked the ottoman. \u201cWorthless devils like me? Now, we\u2019re damn near indestructible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lily said. \u201cNo one is immortal\u2014that is the lesson to be learnt from this. If you wish to honor Leo\u2019s memory, let his death be your ward against complacency. Amelia is right. Surely each of you has responsibilities more pressing than your membership in Leo\u2019s club. Lord Ashworth, don\u2019t you have some family, an estate?\u201d</p><p>The man swore, rubbing a palm over his close-shorn hair. \u201cA burnt-out stripe of heath in Devonshire. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on the place in fourteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time you did,\u201d Lily said pointedly. When Bellamy looked as though he would protest, she added, \u201cAnd I\u2019m certain His Grace has duties enough of his own to occupy him, without taking charge of me.\u201d</p><p>The duke turned toward Lily. \u201cI have a ward. My cousin, though I suppose she was raised as more of a sister to me.\u201d</p><p>Amelia didn\u2019t know why this abrupt admission should move her. And it didn\u2019t, not really. It simply caught her by surprise. Surely, other ladies would have known Morland had guardianship of his cousin. She must be the only woman in London society who hadn\u2019t spent recent months mooning over the \u201cM\u201d section of Debrett\u2019s Peerage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>But there was something almost ... human in his face, as he mentioned her. A slight pleating at the corner of his eyes. A hint of uncertainty in the furrow of his brow.</p><p>Amelia tore her gaze away. She\u2019d spent entirely too much time looking at the duke this evening, and she couldn\u2019t bear to see him humanized any further. Far safer to hold to her demonized version: arrogant, cold, horse-mad. Easy to detest.</p> <p>Bellamy covered the floor in three quick strides to confront Lily at a distance of inches. His voice was husky and intense. \u201cYou know I have no sister. No brother. No estate in Devonshire or anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lily took his hand in hers. \u201cBut we have thought of you as family, Leo and I.\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes, Bellamy swallowed hard. \u201cThen you must not deny me the right to look after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never try.\u201d</p><p>Standing at Lily\u2019s side, Amelia began to feel as though she were intruding on a very private conversation. Yet it did not seem possible to move away without drawing further attention to herself. She settled for averting her eyes and remaining absolutely still. Beneath her hand, Lily\u2019s shoulder began to tremble.</p> <p>\u201cI promise you this,\u201d Bellamy said in a low voice, resonant with emotion. \u201cI will find the men who killed Leo. I will hunt them down. No matter how far they run, no matter where they hide. And I will see them hanged.\u201d</p><p>Lily began to weep.</p><p>\u201cDear Lily.\u201d Bellamy clutched her fingers and brought them to his lips. \u201cTell me what to do. Give me some way to make it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take me to him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd let me say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>As morning dawned, Spencer had still not found the solace of his library carpet, but he had downed a fair amount of brandy, and the whirling din in his head had cleared. He had passed much of the night in silence, which helped. Though he and Ashworth had retreated to Bellamy\u2019s garden while Lily wept over her brother\u2019s battered corpse, by tacit agreement there\u2019d been no conversation. He\u2019d spent the carriage rides to and fro in quiet contemplation, as had they all.</p> <p>He peered out the coach window into the gray-amber dawn. The London streets swarmed with fruit and fish vendors, live-out servants and laborers on their way to their posts. The early-morning bustle slowed the coach\u2019s progress considerably.</p><p>But then, he was in no great rush. The two other men and Leo\u2019s grieving sister had already been deposited at Harcliffe Manor. He and Lady Amelia were the sole passengers remaining, and the coachman was welcome to take his time. For once, Spencer was not eager to be alone.</p><p>\u201cThis has been a most extraordinary night,\u201d he said softly, almost to himself.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Fatigue, coupled with the incredible nature of the night\u2019s events, had left him in a strange state. He had taken Lily\u2019s exhortations to heart. Harcliffe\u2019s death was indeed an effective memento mori, as the medieval saying went. \u201cRemember that you will die.\u201d Were something to happen to him, Spencer would not want Claudia caught in Lily\u2019s predicament. Fortunately, there were concrete actions he could take to avoid such an outcome, and he intended to see to them directly.</p><p>This very morning, as a matter of fact.</p><p>\u201cIt was a very grave shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Lily seems to have taken it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it seems so, to you. But I know better. Leo\u2019s death is only now becoming real to her. When the shock wears off, she will be stricken with grief. I will call again this afternoon. Perhaps offer to stay with her for a few days.\u201d She shot him a look, her blue eyes catching a sharp gleam from the window glass. \u201cOnly until other arrangements can be made.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to understand the anger in her tone, and failed. It was becoming a maddening habit, this trying to understand her.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, if I may speak freely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t yet managed to prevent you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour \u2018offer\u2019 to Lily last night was unconscionable. I have never encountered a person so vain, arrogant, presumptuous, self-absorbed, and utterly heartless.\u201d</p><p>Her charges surprised Spencer, but they did not wound him overmuch. When spoken in such a distraught, irrational tone, words were easy to dodge\u2014like so many china shepherdesses hurled in a fit of pique.</p><p>She continued, \u201cFrom all evidence, you care more for horses than for people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have concluded wrongly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have I concluded wrongly?\u201d she said, mocking his deep tone. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true that I find the average horse more pleasant to be around than the average person. Most true horsemen would agree. But it does not follow that I value all horses above all people. And I am not pursuing ownership of Osiris simply because he is a horse, but because he is the horse I am determined to have, at any cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d she muttered. \u201cAt any cost, including that of friendship, dignity, honor.\u201d</p><p>Spencer shook his head. It would be futile to explain his reasons for wanting that horse. She couldn\u2019t comprehend them, even if he tried.</p><p>The carriage rattled on, and their elbows rattled against each other. They sat sharing the front-facing seat. Spencer supposed he might have crossed to the opposite seat, once the others had alighted. That would have been the proper thing to do. But he hadn\u2019t felt like moving. Lady Amelia was leaning against him, just slightly\u2014no doubt fatigued and chilled. And once again, he found himself enjoying the soft weight of her body against his.</p><p>As that pleasure gathered and spread, so did his unbiddable curiosity. He could not rid his mind of it, this desire to keep speaking with her, to listen to whatever she might say. To discover, to know, to understand.</p><p>He said, \u201cYou disdain the importance I place on horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. With all due respect to the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it then, that\u2019s most important to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family,\u201d she replied instantly. \u201cAnd my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA house in Bryanston Square?\u201d Spencer could not mask his surprise. From the direction she\u2019d given, he knew it must be one of those newer, boxy town houses. Not the sort of history-rich, time-faded abode in which he would picture Lady Amelia d\u2019Orsay.</p><p>\u201cNo, not that house. That is Laurent\u2019s house, built to his wife\u2019s tastes. I refer to our ancestral home in Gloucestershire. Beauvale Castle is in ruins, but we have a cottage where we summer. It\u2019s called Briarbank, for its position directly overlooking the River Wye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasing prospect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen a house more happily situated. Mama and I, we used to walk out every morning to gather lavender and fresh\u2014\u201d She sniffed. \u201cAll my fondest memories are of Briarbank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be leaving Town soon, to summer there?\u201d</p><p>She tensed. \u201cNot this year. This year, my brothers intend to let the cottage out. You see, Your Grace, my brother Jack has a debt to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, after a pause. \u201cSo this is the true root of your anger, my refusal to forgive your brother\u2019s debt. Not my offer to Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the root of my anger has since forked into several branches of irritation, and your treatment of Lily is one of them. But yes.\u201d Jutting out her chin, she turned her face to the window.</p><p>Spencer couldn\u2019t bring himself to fault her persistence. Throughout his life, if there was a common trait amongst the few people he\u2019d unreservedly admired, it was loyalty. But in this case, the sentiment was severely misapplied. That brother of hers was on a swift course to ruin her entire family. \u201cI fail to see how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d She cut him off with an impatient gesture. \u201cBy my counting, we\u2019ve spent close to seven hours in one another\u2019s company. And you\u2019ve spoken more words to me in the last few minutes than in previous six-and-some hours combined. Are you always this chatty in the mornings?\u201d</p><p>Chatty? Spencer had been called many unflattering things in his life, but no one had ever accused him of being chatty. Remarkable.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m not. Are you always this inhospitable?\u201d</p><p>She gave a breathy sigh. \u201cNo. But as you say, it has been an extraordinary night. Even before you arrived at the Bunscombes\u2019 ball.\u201d</p><p>Her remark put him back on that darkened terrace and had him mentally searching his pockets for her handkerchief. He shouldn\u2019t like to lose it. She\u2019d obviously invested great care in its design and creation. But unlike the young ladies who netted purses and lacquered tea trays as a means of displaying their dubious \u201caccomplishments,\u201d Lady Amelia had embroidered that square of linen for no one\u2019s appreciation but her own.</p><p>This intrigued him.</p><p>As did the fact that, for all her harsh words declared him an enemy, her body seemed to have formed a fast friendship with his. She was still leaning against him.</p><p>\u201cYou are not intimidated by me,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said musingly. \u201cHonestly, I am not. Oh, I would have been at this time yesterday. But as Lily said, this night has taught me that no one is immortal. It\u2019s a dire realization in many respects, but oddly enough I find it somewhat freeing. Brash impertinence holds a sudden charm. I shall have to look out, or I may be in danger of becoming a real termagant.\u201d She laughed softly to herself. \u201cYesterday at this time, I would have seen you as the unapproachable, imposing Duke of Morland. And you would not have seen me at all.\u201d</p><p>No doubt it would have been the politic thing to object. To say, Oh, certainly I would have noticed you. I would pick you out from a crowd of ladies. But that would have been a lie. In all likelihood, she was right. If they\u2019d crossed paths in the street this time yestermorn, he would not have spared her a second glance. And that would have been an unfortunate thing, for she was a woman who greatly improved on second glance. At this moment, he was discovering that the warm, even light of dawn did her features better service than the harsh shadows cast by candlelight and coal. She looked almost lovely, in the morning.</p><p>She touched a finger to the window glass. \u201cToday, I know we are merely humans. Two flawed, imperfect, mortal beings, whose bones will one day crumble to dust. Just a woman and a man.\u201d</p><p>At her words, space inside the carriage seemed to collapse around him. Not in a suffocating, oppressive manner, but in a way that evoked the pleasanter aspects of human closeness: physical pleasure and emotional intimacy. It had been some time\u2014an imprudently long time, on reflection\u2014since he\u2019d enjoyed the former. He\u2019d spent most of his adult life avoiding the latter. Surely the extraordinary nature of the night\u2019s events was to blame, but Spencer found himself suddenly, intensely hungry for both.</p><p>No sooner had he thought it, than she nestled closer still. Was she seeking comfort? Or offering it?</p><p>Just a woman and a man.</p><p>Slowly, deliberately, he lifted one gloved hand from his lap and placed it on her leg, a few inches above her knee.</p><p>Her thigh went rigid beneath his palm. He did not move, did not acknowledge her startled response. He simply sat there, cupping the plump curve of her thigh and enjoying the way it filled his hand.</p><p>Though for practical reasons he favored pretty little nothings in a ballroom, when it came to bed sport, Spencer\u2019s tastes ran to substance, in multiple senses of the term. He liked a woman with something to her, both physically and intellectually. Lady Amelia met both qualifications.</p><p>True, she was no great beauty, but she had an undeniable appeal. Her mouth, in particular, he found alluring. Her lips were full and voluptuous, like the rest of her, and a lovely shade of coral pink. Then there was that lone, obstinate freckle still clinging to the inner curve of her left breast. The tiny mark only called attention to the otherwise creamy perfection of the bosom it adorned.</p><p>And after the night they\u2019d just passed wandering through Death\u2019s shadow, it was only natural for a man to crave ... well, to crave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>In sum, he wanted her. Quite fiercely.</p><p>He eased his hand up her thigh\u2014one inch, perhaps two. Past the concealed ridge of her garter. Her breathing went from uneven to erratic as he began brushing his thumb back and forth in a slow, even rhythm. He applied enough pressure that his touch dragged the fabric rather than sliding over it, allowing them both to enjoy the sensation of silk and linen gliding over her bare skin. Whatever petticoat she had on was delightfully spare, worn soft and supple by many launderings. Beneath the fabric, her flesh was just the right pliancy. The taut, smooth texture of a ball of risen dough-perfect for grasping, kneading, shaping with his hands.</p> <p>Erotic images flooded his mind; lust pounded in his blood. He wanted to haul her straight into his lap and wrap those creamy, abundant curves around his body. He would bury his head in that magnificent bosom and clutch her bottom with both hands as he took her, right here in the carriage, letting the swaying motion of the coach bring them closer and closer to release ...</p><p>Yes, she could offer him all manner of comforts\u2014if she were the sort of woman to oblige a man that way. Simply because she remained unmarried, it did not necessarily follow that she was untouched. In fact, some alteration in the latter condition might explain the former.</p><p>There was only one way to find out.</p><p>Spreading his fingers, he gave her thigh a light, appreciative squeeze.</p><p>With a startled cry, she wrested her skirt from his grasp and scuttled sideways like a crab. There, wedged into the opposite corner of the cab, she stared hard out the window and steadfastly ignored him.</p> <p>Well, that settled that.</p><p>And now Spencer looked out his own glass and prayed for a sudden snarl of unnavigable traffic. For they were nearing Bryanston Square, and thanks to his vivid imagination, he was in no condition to be seen in public.</p><p>By the time the coach drew to a halt before an ostentatious rococo edifice, his lust had ebbed. Somewhat. Enough to restore his silhouette to respectability. Spencer alighted first and then posed at the bottom, hand outstretched to assist Lady Amelia in making her descent.</p><p>She ignored his hand. And would have walked straight past him altogether, had he not grasped her elbow.</p><p>She slowly pivoted to face him. \u201cYour Grace, I thank you for delivering me home. I shall keep you no longer.\u201d When he did not release her, she added through gritted teeth, \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d he replied, steering her up the stairs to the front door, which was already held open by a footman. The servant\u2019s rose-pink livery did much to subdue any lingering carnal impulses. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in. I must speak with your brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack won\u2019t be here. He has his own rooms in Piccadilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot him. I meant Lord Beauvale.\u201d</p><p>They entered the house two abreast. Only one of the two doors had been opened, forcing them to squeeze together momentarily as they stepped over the threshold. God, her body felt good against his.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you would wish to speak with Laurent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t make good on Jack\u2019s debt, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>The woman was obviously not thinking straight, but Spencer decided not to hold it against her. It had been a long and trying night, after all. \u201cBy all public appearances, I\u2019ve abducted you from a ball and kept you out all night. Your brother will no doubt appreciate some explanation and assurances.\u201d</p><p>Pulling one of his cards from his breast pocket, he flicked it on the butler\u2019s salver. \u201cWe will await the earl in his study.\u201d There, Spencer hoped, he might be safe from these revolting gilt plaster cockleshells hugging the ceiling like barnacles.</p> <p>Once ushered inside Beauvale\u2019s wood-paneled, shell-free study, they stood awkwardly in the center of the room. As a gentleman, he could not sit until she did\u2014and the idea of sitting had apparently not occurred to her. Her hair had half-fallen from its coiffure, giving her a lopsided appearance. The blue silk that had so closely hugged her curves the evening previous now showed obvious signs of fatigue.</p><p>Her eyes widened at the way he was boldly appraising her form.</p><p>Spencer gave her an unapologetic shrug. \u201cThat gown has done its service, and then some. Earned its pension, I should say.\u201d</p><p>Red bloomed from her throat to her hairline. Her jaw worked a few times. \u201cAre you quite finished insulting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not insult you. That gown insults you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d She made a gesture of exasperation. \u201cYou, sir, have no understanding of women. None at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes any man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Spencer cocked his head. \u201cName one.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the Earl of Beauvale entered. His hair was damp and freshly parted, and his cuffs remained unfastened. Obviously, he\u2019d dressed in a hurry.</p><p>He bowed in Spencer\u2019s direction. Lady Amelia crossed to her brother immediately and threw herself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cAmelia. For God\u2019s sake, where have you been?\u201d Beauvale pulled back from the embrace and studied his sister. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo is dead,\u201d she said, burying her face in her brother\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cHarcliffe?\u201d The earl directed his question at Spencer.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAttacked by footpads, last evening. We have spent the night attending his sister. She was\u2014and remains\u2014in a state of shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, poor Lily,\u201d the earl muttered, rubbing his sister\u2019s arms. \u201cPoor Leo. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t either,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was so young, so vivacious and well-liked. He was ...\u201d Her eyes met Spencer\u2019s. \u201cHe was the answer to your question, Your Grace. A man of true understanding. In all the years I knew him, Leo never once spoke an unkind word to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well. We can\u2019t all be Leo, can we?\u201d</p><p>This bitter, ill-conceived remark was repaid with cold silence. As it deserved to be. Even Spencer realized it had been an unfeeling thing to say, motivated by envy.</p><p>Envy for a dead man, at that. How nonsensical.</p><p>Nothing about this night had made sense, from the moment she\u2019d caromed across that ballroom and grasped his hand in hers. He\u2019d danced with her, argued with her, carted her from the dance floor like some sort of primeval cave dweller, and then together they\u2019d spent the night attending an impromptu vigil. On a morning that should have found him taciturn and withdrawn, she\u2019d made him chatty. Now he found himself taking spiteful swipes at the poor dead fool who earned a word of her praise. It all added up to one inescapable conclusion.</p><p>He was rather taken with Amelia Claire d\u2019Orsay.</p><p>Irrational, perhaps; unexpected, certainly. But there it was.</p><p>The earl spoke over his sister\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThank you for seeing her home, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>It was a clear dismissal, just like her less eloquent version at the doorstep: You may go. But Spencer remained undeterred. He was the Duke of Morland; he would not be dismissed. And once he\u2019d set his mind on something\u2014or someone\u2014he couldn\u2019t rest without making it his.</p><p>He said, \u201cI should advise you, Beauvale, that upon hearing of this tragedy, we left the Bunscombe residence together in surreptitious fashion. To others in attendance, it may have appeared to be an illicit assignation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The earl frowned. \u201cBut nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>Spencer looked to Lady Amelia.</p><p>\u201cAmelia?\u201d Beauvale prompted. \u201cNothing happened, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No. Most definitely not.\u201d Her deep blush did not lend the impression of veracity.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Beauvale glared in Spencer\u2019s direction. \u201cPeople will be talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they will. It cannot be helped. In fact, the gossip is likely to increase with the announcement of a betrothal. We may as well make the engagement brief.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Brother and sister stared at him in open-mouthed shock. Spencer rocked idly on his heels, waiting.</p><p>Lady Amelia left her brother\u2019s side and went to the nearest chair. At last, the thought had occurred to her to sit.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Your Grace,\u201d she began, \u201cbut this has already been a rather unbelievable night. And it is giving way to a positively apocryphal morning. I thought I just heard you refer to an engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ours.\u201d</p><p>More stunned silence.</p><p>Spencer cleared his throat. \u201cIt is not my aim to be cryptic. Allow me to make my intentions perfectly clear. Beauvale, I am offering to marry your sister.\u201d</p><p>The earl lifted a brow. \u201cDo you mean you are requesting the honor of her hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that not what I just said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lady Amelia said, with an odd little laugh. \u201cNo, it is most definitely not.\u201d Regarding Spencer closely, she added, \u201cLaurent, will you leave us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d her brother said, drawing out the word. \u201cReluctantly. I shall wait in the parlor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cWe won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Amelia stared at the duke. His health was robust, his expression composed, his bearing everything ducal, if not downright regal. He looked quite fit indeed. Still, the question tumbled out.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered swiftly. \u201cNo, I am in possession of my mental faculties, and in excellent physical health. If you wish further assurances prior to the wedding, I can refer you to my personal physician.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord, was he serious?</p><p>His mild expression told her he was.</p><p>\u201cThat will not be necessary. Allow me to rephrase my question. What on earth are you thinking, suggesting we should marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d He sat casually on the edge of Laurent\u2019s desk. \u201cYour reputation is endangered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you are endangering it! Nothing happened between us. Why would you lead my brother to believe otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the one who led him to believe otherwise, with your stammering and blushing. I am merely taking the honorable course, by not contradicting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe honorable course? Well, this is a fresh development. Were you taking the honorable course when you groped me in the carriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was ... an experiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn experiment,\u201d she echoed in disbelief. \u201cPray tell me, what did you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo things. First, it assured me of your virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy virtue? You were\u2014\u201d Oh, there was no use in mincing words now. \u201cYou were able to divine my virginity, by fondling my leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She covered her eyes with one hand, then traced her left eyebrow with a fingertip. \u201cForgive me, Your Grace. Are you suggesting a woman is some sort of ... piece of fruit to you? One squeeze, and you know if she\u2019s ripe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed softly. A low, brief chuckle. It took her by surprise, for she had not thought him a man capable of humor. \u201cIt was not what I squeezed that convinced me, but rather your reaction to being squeezed.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s face burned as she recalled her squawk of surprise, and the alacrity with which she had sought the farthest corner of the cab. Even that distance had not been far enough. The heat of his touch had lingered on her thigh, then melted and spread over her entire body. Her mind had been in upheaval, her pulse a mad riot.</p><p>She was not sure she had recovered, even now.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cYou say this experiment of yours brought you to two conclusions, Your Grace. Dare I ask, what was the second?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a bold, scorching look. \u201cThat I would not find it a chore to bed you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>What, pray tell, was the appropriate response to that? Her own body could not come to an accord on the matter. A blush burned on her cheeks, her stomach twisted itself into a knot, and her blood skittered merrily through her veins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Don\u2019t react as though you were flattered, she told herself sternly. Do not take perverse excitement in the fact that the Duke of Morland has evidently given a good deal of thought to the idea of bedding you, perhaps even imagined the act in detail. Do not\u2014do not\u2014dream of imagining it yourself!</p><p>Too late, too late.</p> <p>Amelia pushed the carnal image away and struggled to tamp down any sensation that might be construed as a thrill. The duke had not called her desirable. He had deemed her beddable, and in highly insulting fashion at that. No doubt he would say the same of any chambermaid.</p><p>\u201cI cannot credit this,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cYou believe me insincere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you inconsistent. Here you are offering to marry me this morning. Yet not seven hours ago, you were ready to duel Mr. Bellamy rather than offer for Lily. And she, I might add, has a greater claim on your honor.\u201d And more beauty. And more grace. And more money.</p><p>\u201cI did not wish to marry Lily.\u201d</p> <p>The back of Amelia\u2019s neck prickled, against all her attempts to remind it that the duke\u2019s statement was not a compliment to her.</p><p>\u201cLady Amelia,\u201d he continued, \u201cin all our conversations, you have paid me the compliment of unflinching honesty. May I be completely frank with you now?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand in invitation.</p><p>\u201cAs Lily advised, I have taken Leo\u2019s death as a reminder of my own mortality, and as a call to action. I have a ward, several years my junior. It will be two years before her introduction, and longer still before she is ready to wed. If some misfortune were to befall me in the interim, my title and estate would pass to distant relations, and her fate would be in the hands of strangers. I cannot risk it. Therefore, I have decided to marry and produce an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this morning, you have decided this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy me, and not Lily? Why not one of the other ladies you\u2019ve auditioned, over the course of dozens of balls?\u201d</p><p>He looked taken aback. \u201cAuditioned? Is that what people believe, that I have been conducting a search for my bride? Trial by waltzing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. Twice in one morning now. Astonishing. And this time, his laugh had a rich, velvet quality that stroked her with heat from crown to toe.</p><p>\u201cNo. That has not been my purpose, I assure you. But I will answer your question honestly. I wish to produce an heir, as quickly as possible. I have no inclination to court, flatter, or otherwise woo some silly young chit scarcely half my age. Neither do I have the patience to engage the hand of a grieving woman who will be in mourning for the next year. Dowries are of no importance to me. I simply need a sensible woman from suitable bloodlines, of robust constitution and even temperament, with whom to create a few children.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in horror. \u201cYou want a broodmare!\u201d</p><p>He said evenly, \u201cWhen you draw that comparison, you demean us both. I have many fine mares in my stables, and yet there is not a one of them I would allow to mother my children or manage my household, much less introduce my cousin to society. No, I do not want a broodmare. I want a wife. A duchess.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the magnitude of his offer struck Amelia with sudden force. It was fortunate she was still sitting down. This man would make her the Duchess of Morland. If she accepted him\u2014barbaric, unfeeling creature that he was\u2014she would become one of the highest-ranking, wealthiest ladies in all England. She would host grand parties, move in the most elite circles of society. And at last\u2014oh, her heart turned over at the thought ...</p> <p>\u201cI would be mistress of my own house,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIn point of fact, you would be mistress of six. But I almost never travel to the Scottish one.\u201d</p><p>Amelia gripped the arm of the chair, hard. As if she might slide right off it and fall into wedlock if she didn\u2019t hold on with all her strength. Good heavens, six estates. Surely one of them could use a vicar. She could convince Jack to resume his studies and take orders, see him settled in a wholesome country vicarage, far away from his ruffian friends ...</p><p>No, no, no. There were a thousand reasons why she must refuse the duke. There had to be. She just couldn\u2019t think of them right now.</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d she stammered, \u201cbut we scarcely know one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the past several hours, I have observed you at a social event, witnessed your composure during a difficult ordeal, and engaged you in conversation that hovered some distance above the usual banalities. I am familiar with your ancestry, and I know that you come from a family rife with sons, which bodes well for my purposes of getting an heir. For my part, I am satisfied. But if you wish, you may ask me questions.\u201d He cocked an eyebrow in anticipation.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWhat is your age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you other close family, besides this cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. She is Lady Claudia, fifteen years of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she here with you, in Town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She has spent the past few months in York, visiting her mother\u2019s relations.\u201d</p><p>Amelia paused, uncertain where to go from here. What sort of questions did one ask a gentleman of his stature? It would seem absurd to inquire after a duke\u2019s favorite color, or preferred glovemaker. Finally she blurted out, \u201cDo you object to cats?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cOnly in principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like to keep cats.\u201d She perked in triumph. Here it was, her escape route from this bizarre proposal.</p><p>He tapped a finger on the desktop. \u201cIf you can keep them out of my way, I suppose that desire can be accommodated.\u201d</p><p>Drat. No escape there.</p><p>She tried again. \u201cWhat is the last book you read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Vindication of the Rights of Woman, by Mary Wollstonecraft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d The corner of his mouth curled in a sly, sensual manner. \u201cActually, I read that book some years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? And what did you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think ...\u201d He pushed off from the desk and stood, regarding her with cool challenge in his eyes. \u201cI think you are stalling, Lady Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse did stall, for a moment. Then it jolted back to life, pounding feverishly in her throat. Why didn\u2019t God apportion fine looks in equal accordance with deserving personalities? A horrid man ought to be horrid-looking. He should never be gifted with dark, curling, touchable hair; nor the noble, sculpted cheekbones of a Roman god. He most especially should not possess entrancing, deep-set hazel eyes and a wide, sensual mouth that was near devastating in repose, but even further improved by the presence of a knowing little smile.</p><p>Time for desperate measures.</p><p>\u201cIf I marry you, will you forgive Jack\u2019s debt?\u201d</p><p>Say no, she willed silently. Please say no, or I cannot be responsible for my actions. If you say yes, I may be driven to embrace you. Or worse, give my consent.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>Waves of relief and disappointment crashed within her, leaving Amelia feeling rather adrift. But her course was now clear. \u201cIn that case, Your Grace, I\u2019m afraid I cannot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, of course, settle a substantial sum on you, as part of the marriage contracts. Twenty thousand, I should think, and some property. In addition, you would receive a generous allowance for your discretionary spending. Several hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral hundred pounds? A year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. Quarterly.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s mind blanked. In recent years, she\u2019d become expert at counting up small sums of money, down to the last ha\u2019penny. Two shillings, ten pence at the draper\u2019s, and so forth. But sums so large as these ... they simply weren\u2019t in her arithmetic.</p><p>\u201cYour allowance will be yours to spend as you wish, but I would advise against wasting tuppence on your brother. Even if you pay his debt, you won\u2019t be summering at your cottage. You\u2019ll come to my estate in Cambridgeshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraxton Hall.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She knew it well by reputation. Though the current duke never entertained, his aunt and uncle had, and the older society matrons sometimes waxed nostalgic about the epic grandeur that was Braxton Hall. It was said to be the largest, most lavish house in East Anglia, surrounded by beautiful parklands and gardens.</p><p>She allowed herself one quiet, plaintive sigh for those gardens.</p><p>\u201cHave no doubt that I will provide for your every material comfort. In return, I ask only that you continue to receive my attentions until such time as a son is born. And of course, I will demand your fidelity.\u201d</p><p>She recalled his terse words last night, when he spoke of that blasted stallion: I am not interested in breeding privileges. I am interested in possession. I do not like to share. Such words, such a tone, such an attitude of absolute entitlement\u2014they were repugnant in reference to a horse. They were perfectly debasing, when applied to a woman. Debasing and demeaning and ... God help her, arousing.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, struggling for equanimity. \u201cAnd may I expect your fidelity in kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurse that Wollstonecraft woman. Very well. Until you have birthed a son, you may be assured of my faithfulness. At that time, we can revisit our arrangement. If you wish, we need not even live on the same estate.\u201d</p><p>It only became worse. So she was not even to be possessed, but merely to be rented.</p><p>When confronted with her stunned silence, he added, \u201cIs that not egalitarian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgalitarian, yes. Also cold, convenient, and heartless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can hardly be expecting romantic declarations. They would be transparently false, and an insult to us both.\u201d</p><p>Amelia rose to her feet and said calmly, \u201cI do find myself sufficiently insulted for one morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy patience is also at an end.\u201d He met her in the center of the room. \u201cI have made you an offer of marriage. I am certain it is the most generous and beneficial offer you will ever receive\u2014likely the last such offer you will ever receive. I have answered all your impertinent questions and made you some extremely generous promises. Now, madam, may I have your answer?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. She would give him an answer.</p><p>But she would take some satisfaction from him first.</p><p>\u201cOne last question, Your Grace. You have said earlier, you would not find it a chore to bed me. How am I to be assured of the same? Perhaps I would find it a chore to bed you.\u201d</p><p>He took a step backward, as though he needed the extra distance to properly glare at her. Or perhaps because he suspected her of carrying an infectious disease of the brain.</p><p>She smiled, enjoying the triumph of setting him on edge. \u201cDon\u2019t look so alarmed, Your Grace. I do not intend to squeeze your thigh.\u201d</p><p>At this moment, she made the error of dropping her gaze to those thighs. Those very thick, very muscular thighs that looked as squeezable as granite.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She wrenched her eyes back up to his face. \u201cNo. You see, when it comes to such matters, women appreciate a touch more finesse.\u201d</p><p>He gave a derisive, but\u2014she imagined\u2014also defensive laugh.</p><p>\u201cI may be a virgin, Your Grace, but I am not ignorant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me. More subversive reading material?\u201d</p><p>She ignored his feeble attempt at taunting. \u201cBefore I give an answer to your proposal, I would like to perform an experiment of my own.\u201d</p><p>A wild panic flared in his eyes. Or perhaps that amber spark was desire?</p><p>Don\u2019t be ridiculous, she chided herself. It was panic, surely panic. And she relished it.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of experiment did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d He stepped forward, angling his head as though he would press a chaste kiss to her cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>She held up a hand between them. \u201cOn the lips, if you please. And do it properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProperly.\u201d Disbelief echoed in his tone.</p> <p>His gaze searched her face, and Amelia inwardly cringed as she pictured herself through his eyes. Plump cheeks, gone bright pink with a blush. Puffy eyes, certainly not improved by the purple circles under them this morning. Disheveled blond hair, hanging loose against one side of her neck. What had she been thinking, to bait him thus? Why not simply refuse his proposal and be done with it?</p><p>Because she wanted this, she admitted. She wanted this kiss. She wanted to feel wanted. In all honesty, some depraved part of her wanted to go back to his carriage and do everything differently. To find out what would have happened if she hadn\u2019t startled and moved away, but allowed him to keep caressing and kneading her thigh. Perhaps trail his fingers up and up, to the warm, damp place between her legs ...</p><p>The very thought made her weak.</p><p>His gaze settled on her lips.</p><p>She held her breath. Braced herself. Grew an inch out of sheer anticipation.</p> <p>And then he took two steps away.</p><p>Oh, Lord. He\u2019d rejected her. In a darkened carriage, she was good enough for a squeeze, but one honest look at her in full daylight, and he\u2019d decided she simply wasn\u2019t worth the trouble.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cIf I\u2019m to do this properly ...\u201d</p><p>With his left hand, he began loosening his right glove. First, he undid the small closure at the wrist. Then he began at the little finger and worked inward, working the close-fitted black kid loose with firm, confident tugs. After separating his thumb from its leather sheath, he raised his hand to his mouth. A shiver ran through her as he caught the middle finger of the glove between his teeth ... and pulled.</p><p>Oh, his hand was lovely. Amelia couldn\u2019t tear her gaze from his fingers as they worked. They were long and dexterous, graceful yet strong. Soon he had the second glove loosened, and when he stared her straight in the eye, took that nub of leather between his teeth, and slowly pulled his right hand free ... she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>She sighed. Audibly.</p> <p>At once, she understood why men threw away so much money on opera dancers. She wondered why similar establishments did not exist for ladies. Perhaps they did, and she was simply innocent of them. There was a powerful, illicit thrill to watching a man bare himself\u2014even these relatively innocent parts of himself\u2014for her benefit.</p><p>Tossing his gloves atop Laurent\u2019s desk, the duke closed the distance between them. He raised his hands\u2014not to her face, but to her hair. Those long, deft fingers plucked the hairpins from her debilitated upsweep. He stood close to her as he worked, almost as though he held her in an embrace. The pose gave Amelia an intimate view of the strong line of his jaw, and the exposed curve of his throat beneath it, where the rough beginnings of whiskers dotted his skin. He smelled of brandy and leather and starch; and beneath all these commonplace scents simmered the unique musk of his skin. She inhaled deeply.</p><p>As he freed the last pin, her hair tumbled around her shoulders. His fingers raked deliciously over her scalp as he arranged the locks to his satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said. Strong, warm hands cupped her face and tilted it to his. \u201cNow we can do this properly.\u201d</p><p>A surge of excitement flooded every inch of her body. And it didn\u2019t come from the heat of his breath on her lips, or the firm pressure of his hands bracketing her face. Its origin was that tiny word: \u201cwe.\u201d Now we can do this properly.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he would kiss her. They were going to kiss.</p><p>His lips brushed hers, slowly, sensually. And in an abrupt, volcanic explosion, Amelia d\u2019Orsay\u2019s world gained a whole new continent.</p><p>She\u2019d suffered a number of Mr. Poste\u2019s kisses, back when he\u2019d courted her. Could it truly have been almost ten years ago? Those horrid kisses still lurked in her memory: wet, grabby embraces that had made her feel helpless and ashamed.</p> <p>But this was different. So different. The Duke of Morland had spent the past several hours assaulting her feelings with one rude, arrogant remark after the other. The man had no notion of polite discourse.</p><p>But this kiss ... now, this kiss was a conversation. Again and again, he pressed his lips to hers, then retreated, inviting her to reciprocate. And reciprocate she did, with unabashed pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured, as she gingerly placed her hands on his shoulders. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the way.\u201d</p><p>Encouraged, she moved her hands higher, clutching his neck. His hands slid backward to fist in her hair, and she followed his example, at last twining her fingers in those dark, touchable curls. Oh why hadn\u2019t she removed her own gloves? She would have given much at that moment to feel his hair sliding between the sensitive webs of her fingers. But she took heart in the little growl he gave when her gloved fingertips stroked his nape. Satin did have its advantages.</p><p>He paused to draw breath.</p><p>Oh, don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t stop.</p><p>She caressed his neck again, and he renewed the kiss with even greater vigor. Her body went soft to the bones. His lips were insistent, demanding. But what he demanded was not her surrender, but her escalating response.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known kissing could be like this: not a conquest, but a trade. A steady bartering of caresses, licks, gentle nips. She\u2019d never known the corner of her mouth to be so exquisitely sensitive, until he touched the spot with his tongue.</p><p>Oh, this was dangerous. Delicious, but dangerous.</p><p>He was not just teaching her, he was empowering her. And he was forcing her to reveal far more of herself than she ought. How could he fail to sense her desire for him, when she purred with it? When she drew his lower lip into her mouth to mirror the way he gently sucked her upper one? And oh\u2014oh, Lord\u2014once their tongues had done this, how could she convincingly use this same mouth to refuse him?</p><p>And then she finally stopped thinking and gave herself over to sensation. Blissful, all-consuming sensation. Her body sang, shivered, ached. She needed more. She needed to feel his hands on her body, somewhere below the neck. Everywhere below the neck.</p><p>Lacing her fingers behind his collar, she pitched forward. Her breasts met the welcome resistance of his hard chest. And he rewarded her by sliding his hands from her shoulders, to the small of her back, over the swell of her hips and all the way down to her bottom, which he cupped firmly in both hands. He pulled, bringing her hips flush against his. Pleasure, sharp and intense, burst through her.</p><p>He moaned. \u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><p>Here was a gesture she couldn\u2019t reciprocate. For she didn\u2019t recall his Christian name, and to call him \u201cMorland\u201d seemed just wrong. She certainly couldn\u2019t call him \u201cYour Grace\u201d\u2014not with his hands on her backside.</p><p>Then his tongue was in her mouth again, and she couldn\u2019t have called him anything at all.</p><p>After some time\u2014it might have been minutes, or hours or eons, for all Amelia knew; this kiss had rendered her quite insensible to such frivolous things as the passage of time\u2014he gently pulled away. Shamelessly she chased him, pulling his face down and pressing one last kiss to the corner of his lips.</p><p>He laughed\u2014a breathless, husky, arousing laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cnot a chore, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her closely. One eyebrow quirked. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t your answer, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cOr ... I don\u2019t know. My answer to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hands from his neck and clutched them together in front of her. Oh, what a miscalculation this had been. She\u2019d asked for the kiss. She\u2019d hoped it might be enjoyable. She hadn\u2019t expected it to alter her understanding of the world. How was she supposed to tell him, No, no, a thousand times no. Take your insulting proposal and begone, when every corpuscle in her body was screaming, Yes, yes! Please, Your Grace, may I have some more?</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should begin again.\u201d He covered her knotted fingers with his. \u201cLady Amelia, will you do me the honor, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just say \u2018et cetera\u2019 in a proposal of marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I believe I said \u2018et cetera\u2019 in reprising my proposal of marriage. Have you arrived at an answer yet? I think you\u2019re stalling again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stalling.\u201d</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the tops of hers, making it quite clear to them both that she was, indeed, stalling.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get along at all,\u201d she said desperately.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We\u2019ve been getting along quite well for several minutes now.\u201d</p><p>Yes, they had. They had.</p><p>Knowing herself to be a very poor liar, Amelia opted for honesty. \u201cI\u2019m infatuated with you, I cannot deny it. Physically speaking, you\u2019re a very attractive man. But I don\u2019t like you, the vast majority of the time. So far as I can gather, you behave abominably in public and are only marginally better in private. I only find you remotely tolerable when you\u2019re kissing me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a chastening look. \u201cEven from that stinting description, we\u2019d have a better foundation for marriage than many couples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the marriage I\u2019d dreamed of having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d The duke released her hands and stepped back. \u201cIt would seem you have a choice. Will it be the dreams? Or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo woman should have to make such a choice.\u201d</p><p>But she knew that women did, all the time. Every moment of every day, somewhere a woman surrendered her blissful fantasies to the cruel reality of the world. Years ago, she\u2019d managed to delay the inevitable, but now Amelia knew in her bones\u2014her day, her moment had come. It was her turn to lay down those fantasies of romantic love and grab what she could: security, the opportunity to help her brothers, and something undeniably tempting\u2014the chance to explore physical passion. As for love ... well, there would be children. And Amelia would love those children as no mother had ever loved. No mother except her own, of course.</p><p>She knew what she ought to do; what she would do.</p><p>Still, she could not say the words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make the choice, then,\u201d he said. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>It was not a request, but a command. And she complied, gratefully. His confidence drew her forward, as though he pulled her to him with a string. She stopped, just inches from him, staring up into his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Another command. Another so easily obeyed, because it was exactly what she wanted to do. He bent his head, and she pressed a warm, unhurried kiss to his lips. She would know a lifetime of these kisses. She would know what it was, to see this formidable man unclothed and vulnerable, to feel the weight of his naked body stretched out over hers.</p><p>The kiss ended.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201csay yes.\u201d</p><p>She would be a duchess. She would be mistress of six houses. She would be married from St. George\u2019s in Hanover Square, in front of all London, wearing a gown of the divinely embroidered and obscenely expensive ivory brocade she\u2019d seen last week in Bond Street. She would serve white cake at the wedding breakfast, with three different fillings and rolled gum icing cut in the shape of blossoms\u2014orchids, not roses. Because everyone had roses. She would have real orchids in her bouquet, and she would visit the hothouse this very week to order them.</p><p>Some of her dreams could still come true.</p><p>\u201cSay yes, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. And because it came more easily than she\u2019d expected, she said it again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a smile\u2014slight, yet devastating\u2014and to that subtle quirk of his lips Amelia impulsively hitched all her hopes and dreams. For better or for worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go speak with your brother.\u201d He gathered his gloves from the desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cPlease do give my name to your secretary,\u201d she said, giving in to a flutter of bridal excitement. \u201cWe can begin compiling the guest list, making the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be married here, in this room. Tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>Not thirty hours later, Amelia sat in the Rose Parlor\u2014actually, one of two rose parlors Beauvale House boasted, thanks to Winifred\u2019s fondness for pink. With a fretful sigh, she squeezed Lily Chatwick\u2019s hand and asked for what must have been the fifth time, \u201cAre you certain you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Lily answered.</p><p>Amelia chewed her lip. \u201cIt just feels all wrong, to have you here.\u201d</p><p>It all felt wrong, full stop. A wedding, before Lord Harcliffe was even in the ground? It was so tasteless, so arbitrary ... and so sadly lacking in rolled icing and orchids. But evidently the Duke of Morland considered her whispered \u201cyes\u201d to be Amelia\u2019s last word on the matter. Plans for these hasty nuptials had proceeded apace, whether she liked it or not. Yesterday afternoon had seen a flock of messengers descend on the Beauvale doorstep, delivering legal papers, the special license obtained from the archbishop, trunks emblazoned with the Morland crest in which to pack up her belongings. But before all these, a modiste had presented herself, flanked by two seamstresses and armed to the teeth with straight pins. Apparently the duke had been serious, when he spoke of pensioning off her blue moir\u00e9 silk.</p> <p>For the better part of the hour, the three women had flitted about her, measuring and clucking their tongues portentously, as if they were the three Fates of Grecian myth, sent to snip and stitch the precise shape of Amelia\u2019s destiny.</p><p>Then early this morning, a footman had marched the long path to Amelia\u2019s small bedchamber at the rear of the house, bearing a tower of boxes. The largest package held clouds of white petticoats and a mist-thin chemise; the smallest contained a coil of perfectly matched Baroque pearls. And one of the boxes in the middle had opened to reveal a tasteful, stylish gown of dove-gray satin. The color was understated and respectful\u2014but quietly lovely. Amelia ran her fingers lightly over the skirt, twisting it in the sunlight to coax a lilac shimmer from the fabric.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful dress,\u201d Lily said.</p><p>Amelia balled her hand in a fist, ashamed to have drawn attention to her own vanity. She ought to have refused to wear it and put on her plain black bombazine instead. But she had such a weakness for fine-milled fabric.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it,\u201d Lily said, as if she understood Amelia\u2019s thoughts. \u201cAnd you must not feel guilty on your wedding day. I\u2019m grateful to be here, truly. What else should I be doing? Sitting weeping at home? I found ample time for that yesterday; tomorrow will bring a fresh supply of empty hours to fill. Today, I am glad for the distraction. And to be completely honest, I\u2019m a bit relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved that you won\u2019t have to marry him?\u201d Amelia laughed dryly. \u201cYes, I understand. Better me than you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way. I\u2019m certain His Grace will make you a fine husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you? I wish I could say the same.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s gaze caught hers. \u201cAmelia, you would not believe what he sent to the house yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot seamstresses, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. A bank draft.\u201d</p><p>Amelia buried her face in her hands to disguise her unladylike response. \u201cNot that blasted horse again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad as you suspect. I was astonished to see the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bang.</p> <p>The parlor door swung open with such force, the hinges rattled in the doorframe. Alarmed, Amelia shot to her feet. Lily followed suit, with considerably more grace.</p><p>The Duke of Morland filled the doorway. Tall. Dark. Handsome. Irate.</p><p>Not even the brown-black curls at his temple had the temerity to rebel this morning; they appeared to have been ruthlessly subdued with comb and pomade. His impeccable black topcoat and Hessians were matched by an equally dark expression. The duke looked angry, commanding, arrogant\u2014and so intensely attractive it actually pained her to look him in the face. Truly, Amelia felt as though she\u2019d swallowed all three of his nimble little seamstresses, and they were currently stitching the lining of her stomach into pleats.</p><p>From behind the duke\u2019s imposing figure, Laurent made a chagrined expression. \u201cBeg pardon. I tried to prevent him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, what is it?\u201d In a defensive move, Amelia crossed her arms over her chest. Then she impulsively uncrossed them and clasped her trembling hands behind her back. He was just a man, she reminded herself. Just a mortal, imperfect man. She couldn\u2019t let him cow her\u2014not now, not ever.</p><p>\u201cLady Amelia,\u201d he accused, \u201cyou are ...\u201d He raked her with a glance, and beneath the pearly silk, a thousand pins pricked her skin. \u201cYou are late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate,\u201d she echoed, disbelieving.</p><p>\u201cEight minutes late.\u201d Striding into the room, he drew a timepiece from his waistcoat pocket. \u201cThe wedding was to begin at half-ten. It is now ten thirty\u201d\u2014he raised an eyebrow and paused dramatically\u2014\u201cnine. Nine minutes late.\u201d</p><p>Struggling to remain calm, Amelia advanced to meet him in the center of the room. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d she muttered, \u201cyou have allowed me a betrothal of precisely twenty-seven hours. Twenty-seven hours, in which to reorder my life from that of an unmarried woman to that of a duchess. Now you would begrudge me nine minutes\u2019 delay?\u201d</p><p>He glowered at her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Laurent crossed to her side and laid a hand on her shoulder, drawing her away. \u201cAmelia,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cit\u2019s not too late. You needn\u2019t do this, you know.\u201d</p><p>At the warm solicitude in his voice, her resolve nearly crumbled. For something like twenty-six hours now, Laurent had been urging her to reconsider this whole enterprise. If she said no, even at the last moment, Amelia knew her brother would support her decision. He\u2019d done the same ten years ago, when she\u2019d been unable to stomach marriage to that horrid Mr. Poste. Never mind the money, he\u2019d insisted, your happiness is worth more than gold.</p><p>When she\u2019d been granted that reprieve, Amelia had felt nothing but relief. At the age of sixteen, she never could have conceived that Papa\u2019s debt would balloon so catastrophically, nor that a country widower\u2019s suit would be the last she\u2019d entertain.</p><p>Amelia lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cThis is an opportunity, Laurent. An opportunity for us. Once I am a duchess, I can help our brothers in ways even you cannot. The alliance will greatly improve Michael\u2019s chances of marrying well. Perhaps I can secure a living for Jack, get him out of London and away from his unsavory friends.\u201d</p><p>Her brother shook his head. \u201cI fear Jack may be a lost cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that. If Mama were here, could you say that to her face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Mama were here, could you marry this man? She wouldn\u2019t have wanted this for you. She wanted her children to marry for love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you defied her,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>After Papa died, the debts had mounted higher and higher still. Laurent had made the very sacrifice at which Amelia had once balked: he\u2019d married, sensibly and disaffectionately, to secure the d\u2019Orsay family\u2019s future. She loved him for it and often despised herself for leaving him no other choice. \u201cI can\u2019t cry off this time, Laurent. It isn\u2019t only about the family. I want my own household, my own children. This may be my last chance. I\u2019m not sixteen any longer.\u201d</p><p>No, she was older and wiser\u2014and undeniably lonelier. And disagreeable as his demeanor might be, the Duke of Morland compared favorably to Mr. Poste. Morland wasn\u2019t thirty years older than she. He had straight teeth. He didn\u2019t reek of tallow and sweat. He knew how to kiss. Properly.</p><p>And he was a duke. A duke with six estates, who would settle twenty thousand pounds on her, and some property besides. In her shortsighted, selfish girlhood, she\u2019d let slip one chance to help her family. If this man saw fit to offer her security and children, Amelia supposed she could promise him punctuality in trade.</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely certain?\u201d Laurent cast a wary glance at the duke. \u201cI\u2019ve no compunction about tossing him out on his ear, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. You are very good, but I am decided.\u201d She truly believed the sentiment she\u2019d expressed to the duke the other night, during their waltz. Contentment was largely a matter of individual choice. \u201cI am decided, and I will be happy.\u201d</p><p>Spencer was displeased. Greatly displeased. Twelve minutes now. He could have been married already, perhaps even ordering the carriage for their departure. Instead he was standing here awkwardly in the center of the room, watching his intended bride confer with her brother in heated whispers.</p><p>Damn it, he hated weddings. He didn\u2019t remember ever attending any others, but he was certainly making this one his last.</p><p>To think, not an hour ago, he\u2019d been congratulating himself on his brilliance. He needed a wife, and here was his chance to obtain one without the nuisance of a courtship. When a man of his wealth and station proposed marriage to a lady of hers ... They both knew she couldn\u2019t possibly have refused.</p><p>But she had no problem keeping him waiting. Spencer didn\u2019t like being made to wait. The waiting was making him uneasy, and he didn\u2019t like feeling uneasy.</p><p>This was why he\u2019d insisted on a small, private ceremony in her home. If there was no crowd, no music, no fanfare, he reasoned, he would remain perfectly calm and in control. Except that now a ten-minute delay had him fretting like a schoolboy. And that fact had him resenting her further, because he was intelligent enough to realize that this churning tempest inside him must mean something. Something about him, something about her ... something about them, perhaps? He didn\u2019t know. He just wanted to marry the woman, take her home, and puzzle it out in bed.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d</p><p>His head whipped up. Lady Amelia stood before him. And whatever exorbitant sum he\u2019d paid that dressmaker, it hadn\u2019t been nearly enough.</p><p>Standing with her hands clasped behind her back, she played her figure to its best advantage. Her waist was trim and defined, her hips cuppable, her bosom delectable. Silk covered those lushly proportioned curves, clinging in all the right places. Its silvery, iridescent shade reminded him of dew on heather, or the belly of a trout; and it contrasted pleasantly with the warm, milky texture of her skin. She was all softness and sleekness, and his gaze slipped over her easily even as his thoughts snagged. He wrestled to make sense of her, define her, understand what it was she signified to him and why. He couldn\u2019t say she looked elegant or stunning or beautiful.</p><p>Refreshing. Her appearance was refreshing, like cool, clear water on a sun-baked summer\u2019s day. And he gratefully drank her in.</p><p>She gave him a deferential nod. \u201cI apologize for my tardiness, Your Grace. I am ready. Has your groomsman arrived?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou ... you do have a groomsman to stand up with you? Someone to sign the register as a witness?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. The thought hadn\u2019t even crossed his mind. \u201cWon\u2019t Beauvale do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurent?\u201d Her brow wrinkled. \u201cI suppose he could, but I hate to ask. I\u2019m rather doing this against his wishes. And unfortunately, he\u2019s the only one of my brothers here. Michael\u2019s at sea of course, and Jack\u2014well, Jack is necessarily avoiding you.\u201d She swept a glance around the room, finally settling it on the butler. \u201cI suppose we could have Wycke. But surely you don\u2019t want a servant?\u201d</p><p>If it meant they could be married within the next quarter hour, Spencer would gladly have opened the door and dragged in the first ruffian off the street. \u201cHe\u2019ll do.\u201d He made a curt motion to the butler. \u201cBring the curate. We may as well do it in here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>At the clergyman\u2019s entrance, Spencer summoned the man to his side with nothing but a pointed look and the arch of one brow.</p><p>The curate inclined his balding head. \u201cYes, Your Grace?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a very generous donation in the parish\u2019s future if you make this fast. Ten minutes, at the most.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, the man fumbled open his liturgy. \u201cThere\u2019s an established rite, Your Grace. Marriage must be entered into with solemnity and consideration. I don\u2019t know that I can rush\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes. One thousand guineas.\u201d</p><p>The liturgy snapped closed. \u201cThen again, what do a few extra minutes signify to an eternal God?\u201d He beckoned Amelia with a fluttering, papery hand. \u201cMake haste, child. You\u2019re about to be married.\u201d</p><p>Spencer scarcely heard the fevered rush of words that constituted his wedding. In principle, he agreed with the curate. Marriage should be a solemn, sacred enterprise, and the length of time Spencer took to make a decision had no correlation with how seriously he considered it. This wasn\u2019t something he approached lightly, else he would have married years ago. Somewhere in between mumbled \u201cI will\u2019s\u201d and parroted vows, he managed a brief, silent petition for a few male children and whatever other blessings God saw fit to grant them. It wasn\u2019t much, but it would have to do.</p> <p>At the curate\u2019s direction, they exchanged simple gold bands. All his aunt\u2019s pieces were at Braxton Hall; she\u2019d have her selection of jeweled rings there. Her fingers were chilled, and irrational anger spiked through him. Why was she cold? Hadn\u2019t the modiste sent gloves?</p><p>\u201cI pronounce you man and wife.\u201d</p><p>There, it was done.</p><p>He turned to his bride, looking her in the eye for the first time since the ceremony had begun. And he promptly kicked himself, because this would have been far more pleasant if he\u2019d been looking at her the whole time. Her eyes were really quite lovely\u2014large, intelligent, expressive. A patient, sensible shade of blue.</p><p>He very much wanted to kiss her now.</p><p>And as if she\u2019d heard the thought\u2014God, he hoped he hadn\u2019t said it aloud\u2014she gave a tiny shake of her head and whispered, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>With a plunk, the curate laid open the parish register on a side table and thumbed to the appropriate page. Once their names and the date had been recorded, Spencer took up the quill and signed his name on the line. His was a long name; it took a while. After he\u2019d finished, he dipped the quill again before passing it to Amelia.</p><p>She paused, peering down at the register.</p><p>As the moment stretched, Spencer\u2019s heart gave an odd kick. Oh, come along.</p><p>Before she could lay pen to parchment, a commotion in the hallway disrupted the scene. Julian Bellamy stormed into the parlor, followed by Ashworth. Spencer groaned as the two made straight for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil do you mean by this?\u201d Bellamy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI mean to be married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that much, you despicable blackguard.\u201d Sneering, Bellamy shoved a rectangle of paper in Spencer\u2019s face. \u201cThis. What do you mean by this?\u201d</p><p>It was the bank draft he\u2019d sent over yesterday morning, as promised. \u201cIt\u2019s just as I said. I\u2019m offering Lady Lily compensation in exchange for her brother\u2019s token.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the amount of twenty thousand pounds?\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Amelia gasped.</p><p>\u201cTwenty thousand pounds,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cThere\u2019s no racehorse in the world worth that, much less one retired to stud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t base my offer on the market value of the horse. I offered what the token is worth to me.\u201d Spencer turned to Bellamy. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Lady Lily\u2019s to accept or decline. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>The slender, dark-haired woman stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful, Your Grace, but you know I cannot accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you find my offer insufficient, we can discuss more generous\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Lily said. \u201cYour offer is beyond generous. It\u2019s charity, and I cannot accept it in good conscience.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy cut in. \u201cShe cannot accept it because Leo\u2019s token is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Amelia said. \u201cGone where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely what I\u2019d like to know.\u201d Bellamy shot Spencer a murderous look. \u201cCare to tell us, Morland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know where it\u2019s gone? Wasn\u2019t it with Harcliffe\u2019s belongings?\u201d</p><p>Ashworth shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through everything, twice. It wasn\u2019t on his body, either. Must have been stripped by his attackers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple robbery, then,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cOr perhaps he\u2019d already lost it in a wager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cLeo would never have risked that token, and you know it. You know you had no other way of getting it from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you suggesting?\u201d A cold, leaden weight settled in Spencer\u2019s gut. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean to suggest I had some hand in Harcliffe\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy only raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean to suggest it,\u201d Spencer repeated coolly, \u201cbecause if you did slander my character in such an outrageous, unfounded manner, I would have to demand satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can get my token, too? Pry it from my cold, dead hands?\u201d</p><p>Amelia wedged herself between them. \u201cWhy are the two of you so determined to kill one another? Mr. Bellamy, with all due respect and sympathy\u2014your charges make no sense. If His Grace already had possession of this token, why on earth would he offer Lily twenty thousand pounds for it?\u201d</p><p>Fortunately someone in the room had some sense. And more fortunate still, she was the one he was marrying.</p><p>\u201cGuilt. Blood money, to ease his conscience.\u201d Bellamy gave him a cold stare. \u201cI\u2019ve remembered something, Morland. You were there in the card room the other night, when Leo and I made plans to attend the boxing match.\u201d</p><p>Was he? Spencer supposed he could have been, but he certainly hadn\u2019t been paying attention to Harcliffe and Bellamy. His sole focus had been winning Faraday\u2019s token. \u201cWhat if I were? So were a dozen other gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them had a reason to kill Leo. You\u2019ve destroyed fortunes in pursuit of Osiris already. Why should I believe you\u2019d stop at violence? You knew exactly where Leo was going to be that night. You knew I was meant to be with him. Were you hoping to get us both in one blow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sickening,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cMy gut twists, to think I almost allowed you to marry Lily. And it makes perfect sense, why you wouldn\u2019t. Imagine, sitting across the table from her every day for the rest of your life, knowing you were responsible for her brother\u2019s death. Keeping company with your own damning guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this,\u201d Lily said. \u201cJulian, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. This is nonsensical. We have no reason to believe that missing token had anything to do with Leo\u2019s death. And simply because His Grace declined to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bellamy ignored her. \u201cCouldn\u2019t stand the thought of it, could you? No, you\u2019d sooner pay Lily off.\u201d He jerked his chin toward Amelia. \u201cAnd shackle yourself to the first available female just to settle the matter.\u201d</p><p>It had been fourteen years since Spencer had lashed out at a man in a moment of blinding white fury\u2014but he hadn\u2019t forgotten how to land a punch. His knuckles made a satisfying thwack as they connected with Bellamy\u2019s jaw, sending the man sprawling. The bank draft fluttered to the carpet as Bellamy struggled to his feet.</p><p>Spencer hauled back his fist for another punch, but before he could swing, Beauvale leapt forward to grab his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d accused Bellamy, rubbing his jaw. \u201cHe\u2019s dangerous. He wants to kill me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now,\u201d Spencer ground out. He shrugged out of Beauvale\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cAnd need we guess who\u2019s next? Everyone knows what you did to Ashworth at Eton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do they?\u201d Spencer turned to the soldier. \u201cAnd what, precisely, did I do to Ashworth at Eton?\u201d Damn it, he\u2019d been sent down for that fight. He\u2019d tacitly accepted all the blame. The blackguard had better not sell him out at his own wedding.</p><p>Ashworth shrugged. \u201cObviously something less than killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian, please.\u201d Lily went to Bellamy\u2019s side. She touched a finger to the corner of his mouth, where blood oozed from his cracked lip. \u201cI know you are hurting and angry. I know you want someone to blame, some means of avenging Leo\u2019s death. But surely you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>The room went quiet. Uncomfortably quiet, as all eyes trained on Spencer. He felt the keen scrutiny of every person in the room: Bellamy, Lily, Ashworth, Beauvale, the curate ... Amelia.</p><p>She spoke first. \u201cYou are mistaken, Mr. Bellamy. I was there when he learned of Leo\u2019s death. It took His Grace completely by surprise, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy dabbed his bleeding lip with the back of his hand. \u201cForgive me, but your assurances aren\u2019t worth much.\u201d</p><p>The knave. Spencer wanted to grind him into this revolting pink carpet and cast both pieces of refuse out onto the street. But he wouldn\u2019t waste the effort. There were more effective ways of wounding a man. Julian Bellamy came from nothing. In the eyes of the ton, he was nothing. And there was no one so well positioned to remind him of it as the fourth Duke of Morland.</p><p>\u201cYou will refrain,\u201d he said with crisp, aristocratic diction, \u201cfrom addressing my bride in that familiar manner. You will refrain from speaking to her at all, unless you afford her the respect and deference her superior rank demands. Know your betters.\u201d</p><p>A flash of jealous hatred crossed Bellamy\u2019s face, and Spencer knew his cut had slashed deep. Obviously the man harbored a poisonous mix of envy and loathing for the social elite. Someone ought to inform him such an attitude was a grave weakness, ripe for exploitation. But that someone wouldn\u2019t be Spencer.</p><p>\u201cAs to the value of Lady Amelia\u2019s assurances,\u201d he continued in a low voice meant for Bellamy\u2019s hearing alone, \u201cI assure you, they are worth far more to me than your miserable life. Disparage her again, and you will find yourself at the point of a blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a murderer,\u201d Bellamy growled.</p><p>With a careful appearance of nonchalance, Spencer bent to retrieve the bank draft from the carpet. \u201cIf Harcliffe\u2019s token is missing, I also have an interest in locating his killers. In one hour\u2019s time, meet me at the mews where Osiris is stabled. We\u2019ll discuss the matter further. But for now ...\u201d He carefully pocketed the bank draft, then finally had the satisfaction of speaking the words he\u2019d been longing to say since Bellamy entered the room. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d Amelia clasped her hands together. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. We still need a groomsman.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievable. Spencer blinked at her. \u201cAre you seriously suggesting this ... this cur should witness our wedding?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy put in, \u201cAfter all you\u2019ve heard and seen, are you still seriously planning to marry this villain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d Amelia tilted her face to Spencer\u2019s and studied him quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not yet official,\u201d he made himself say. \u201cYou haven\u2019t signed. I will release you, if you\u2019ve given some credence to Mr. Bellamy\u2019s accusations.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s lip-biting hesitation, she reached forward and touched one hand to his. The light touch dissolved the tension in his wrist, and his fingers uncurled. He hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d been holding them in a fist.</p><p>Wordlessly, she bent over the register and wrote her name in careful, deliberate strokes. After blowing lightly over her signature and returning the plume to its inkwell, she straightened and said simply, \u201cThere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>It took a great deal to humble Spencer, but his bride\u2014his wife\u2014had just managed to do it.</p><p>Lily came forward next. She took the quill and signed in one of the two spaces marked \u201cWitness\u201d before extending the pen to Bellamy. \u201cI think you should sign it, Julian. You know what an amiable sort Leo was. When he conceived of the Stud Club ...\u201d She paused. \u201cForgive me, I still can\u2019t say that without wanting to laugh. Anyhow, he began it with the purpose of making new friends. This was why he decreed membership should be dependent on chance\u2014he wanted to draw together people from different classes, form unlikely alliances. Don\u2019t let his death tear that apart.\u201d She pushed the quill at him. \u201cPlease. Do it for Leo. Or if not him, then\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Cursing, Bellamy ruffled his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t ask it, Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it for me.\u201d</p><p>With a strangled groan, he snatched the pen from her grip and bent as if he would sign. At the last moment, however, he cast the quill away. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. Even if I believed ...\u201d He swore. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d said Ashworth. The battle-scarred warrior elbowed his way past Spencer. \u201cThere\u2019s your unlikely alliance, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Unlikely indeed. \u201cYou don\u2019t think me a murderer, then?\u201d Spencer asked. Strange, that Ashworth should become his defender. In his entire life, Spencer had only come remotely close to killing one man, and it was him.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d As he bent to scrawl his name across the register page, Ashworth spared him a cryptic glance. \u201cYou don\u2019t have it in you.\u201d</p><p>The tone of his remark hardly made it a ringing endorsement of Spencer\u2019s character. Then again, Spencer didn\u2019t really care. \u201cMeet me at the mews,\u201d he told the men. \u201cOne hour.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cThis is a travesty.\u201d As he approached the mews, Spencer swore quietly into the late-morning fog.</p><p>Osiris, the greatest racehorse of a generation\u2014champion at Newmarket, Doncaster, Epsom Downs\u2014was stabled here, amongst common carriage horses?</p><p>The barn was dark and dank as a cave inside. A blizzard of dust motes whirled in the lone shaft of light penetrating the gloom. The horses\u2019 stalls were cramped, as they always were in Town. Spencer\u2019s nose wrinkled at a trough of stale, fetid water\u2014in Cambridgeshire, his grooms drew fresh water twice daily from the stream.</p> <p>At his order, the groom opened the door of the stallion\u2019s stall and released him into the small yard. The horse shook himself, nostrils flared and head swinging from side to side. The groom jerked roughly on the halter, and Spencer\u2019s jaw clenched with anger. Had the man been in his employ, that one move would have cost him his post.</p><p>\u201cHow is he exercised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe turn \u2019im out twice a day. Sometimes a walk about the yard on a lead. Don\u2019t like to be saddled no more, this one. Touchy with the grooming, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re letting him tell you what to do, instead of the other way around?\u201d</p><p>Tsking softly, Spencer circled the horse. His dark bay coat was in dire need of a brisk raking with a currycomb. Gray hairs mingled with the ebony, giving a hoarfrost look to his forelock, a sign of the stallion\u2019s advancing age. He\u2019d worn a bald patch on his right flank, likely from chafing against the stable wall. Despite the deplorable state of his grooming, however, Osiris remained an impressive example of horseflesh. His high, taut haunches and long, arched neck displayed his Arabian ancestry.</p><p>Spencer circled to the front again, standing slightly to the horse\u2019s side, allowing the animal plenty of space to see him, and several snorting breaths to investigate his scent. The look he saw in the stallion\u2019s large, dark-fringed eye pleased him, as did the haughty head toss that yanked the groom off-balance. There was spirit there, and fierce arrogance. That look said, I\u2019m better than this.</p><p>\u201cMost certainly,\u201d Spencer agreed. The horse was spoiled as the devil and would need a great deal of retraining with an expert handler, but at least his spirit hadn\u2019t been broken.</p><p>He removed his gloves and tucked them beneath one arm, murmuring gently as he approached. After extending his hand palm-down for the stallion to nose and inspect, he laid it against the horse\u2019s withers.</p> <p>\u201cFar better than this,\u201d he said, giving the horse a brisk rub. The horse turned and nosed his palm, displaying the narrow blaze of white that ran the length of his nose, with the look of a lightning bolt.</p><p>Spencer was tempted to saddle the beast and ride him straight out of the mews. But as it was, he already stood accused of murder. It would seem unwise to add horse theft, another hanging offense, to Julian Bellamy\u2019s list of suspicions.</p><p>\u201cHoly Christ.\u201d</p><p>Spencer\u2019s gaze jerked to the entrance.</p><p>Ashworth strode into the barn, chasing the fog of his breath with a low whistle of admiration. \u201cThat is one magnificent animal.\u201d</p><p>Spencer\u2019s opinion of the man took a small leap in favorability. No matter their history as youths, there was something to be said for a man who recognized quality horseflesh when he saw it. Or, for that matter, a man who recognized a baseless accusation when he heard one.</p><p>\u201cThat he is,\u201d Spencer said, pride enriching his voice. \u201cHis grandsire was Eclipse; his dam\u2019s line goes back to the Godolphin Arabian, with several champions in between. No finer pedigree to be found in English horseflesh.\u201d He took the stallion\u2019s halter himself, dismissing the groom with a glance.</p><p>Ashworth tilted his head to examine the horse further. \u201cHad a gelding once from the Darley line. Red chestnut, white markings. Fast as a demon, with a temperament to match. I must have pushed that horse over every moor in Devonshire. Perfect mount for an angry, overgrown youth.\u201d</p><p>Spencer wouldn\u2019t have said it aloud, but he too had spent more hours of his youth in the saddle than in the schoolroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ashworth paced idly toward the rear of the yard, and Spencer sensed that he didn\u2019t want to speak of the matter. Strange, that the man would so easily discuss the deaths of his fellow soldiers, only to fall silent when the deceased was a red chestnut gelding.</p><p>Or not so strange, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cSo why are we here?\u201d Ashworth said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering that myself.\u201d Julian Bellamy swaggered into the yard, turned out in a suit of rumpled cobalt velvet that looked like he\u2019d slept in it. Or not slept in it. His hair always appeared slept-upon; that much was no surprise. Why a man would go to such meticulous effort to cultivate a slapdash appearance, Spencer couldn\u2019t imagine. But then, neither could he fathom why anyone would stable a priceless racehorse in this place.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to discuss the investigation of Harcliffe\u2019s murder,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBut first, these boarding conditions are unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d</p><p>He ticked off the list on his fingers. \u201cFetid water. Rotting hay. Inexpert grooms. Poor ventilation. Cramped stalls. And I haven\u2019t even started in on the lack of proper exerci\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough already.\u201d Bellamy flashed an open palm. \u201cTo my eye, looks no different from the stabling of most Mayfair gents\u2019 cattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a carriage horse, nor a gelding for the occasional prance down Rotten Row. Osiris is a former racehorse, from the most noble of bloodlines.\u201d Spencer gave him a cutting look. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect a man like you to understand.\u201d</p><p>Julian Bellamy\u2019s cheeks blazed a very satisfying shade of red. And the red contrasted most pleasingly with the purpling bruise on his left jaw. The man was simply too easy to provoke, once one discovered that raw, tender gash of bitter jealousy.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Bellamy said hotly. \u201cOnly the purebred nobleman can truly understand the purebred horse, is that it?\u201d</p><p>Spencer shrugged. His own breeding had nothing to do with it, but he definitely knew what was best for this horse. \u201cProper handling of a horse like this is no simple matter. He was trained to race, from birth. Not only to race, but to be the best. Once a champion, he was spoiled with attention and permissive handling. Add to that, he\u2019s an ungelded male, with a strong natural mating drive. It all adds up to a horse with a mile-wide streak of arrogance, bloody bored out of his mind. Without proper exercise and opportunities to mate, all that aggressive energy festers. He becomes moody, intractable, withdrawn, destructive.\u201d</p><p>Ashworth raised an eyebrow at Bellamy. \u201cIs it just me, or is this conversation becoming uncomfortably personal?\u201d</p><p>Spencer fumed. \u201cI\u2019m not referring to myself, you ass.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Ashworth was all wide-eyed mock innocence. \u201cOh, of course you aren\u2019t, Your Grace.\u201d He slyly added, \u201cBut it would explain a few things if you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would indeed,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cLike this.\u201d He indicated his bruised jaw.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more of His Grace\u2019s hasty nuptials,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cThough by that logic, his temper ought to improve markedly tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Spencer\u2019s jaw tensed with the effort of self-restraint. \u201cMake all the fun you like. You won\u2019t think it so humorous when Osiris meets with an early death.\u201d</p><p>Now that earned the two men\u2019s attention.</p><p>Bellamy gave a low whistle through his teeth. \u201cYou are a violent one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, it wasn\u2019t a threat,\u201d Spencer said impatiently. \u201cAll issues of breeding and training aside, this horse requires superior accommodations by sheer virtue of his value. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t stable a draft horse here, let alone a priceless racehorse. The risk is too great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kept in the most secure stall,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cThe grooms watch in shifts, and the gate is chained and locked at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe locks are part of the problem. Look at the condition of this barn.\u201d Spencer swept a gesture toward the cobwebbed rafters. \u201cDust everywhere, loft crammed with dry hay. It\u2019s a firetrap. One spark would turn this whole structure into an inferno, and all your chains and locks would simply seal the horse\u2019s fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that point he\u2019s right,\u201d Ashworth said, all hint of humor gone from his voice. \u201cStable fires are a nasty business.\u201d He looked to Spencer. \u201cIf the two of you want to move him, I\u2019ll take no issue with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be interested in selling out your share?\u201d Spencer asked. \u201cI\u2019d be generous.\u201d</p><p>Ashworth fell silent, as though he were seriously considering the offer. Excellent. If he\u2019d been forced to sell out his commission to pay his estate\u2019s creditors, the man had to be short on funds.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t sell out his share,\u201d Bellamy protested. \u201cThe tokens can only be won or lost in a game of chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething of that nature could be arranged,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cFancy a game of cards, Ashworth?\u201d</p><p>Ashworth began to respond, but Bellamy interrupted with a forceful, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The stallion\u2019s head jerked, and Spencer adjusted his grip on the halter, muttering a litany of soft, soothing imprecations that Bellamy was all too welcome to overhear.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t allow it,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cLeo devised this club. He laid down the rules of membership and the code of conduct. Now the man\u2019s dead. The least you can do to honor his memory is to respect the spirit of fraternity this club represents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome spirit of fraternity,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cInterrupting a man\u2019s wedding with unfounded accusations of murder? Listen, the both of you. I\u2019ll forfeit all interest in the remaining tokens, on one condition. That Osiris be stabled at my estate in Cambridgeshire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Bellamy shook his head vigorously.</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThe rules remain the same. Any member of the Club may send mares to be mated\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll the way to Cambridgeshire?\u201d Bellamy snorted.</p><p>\u201cMy stables are the finest in the country, and I include the Royal Mews in that assessment. Large stalls, enclosed pasture. My stable master and grooms are the most capable to be had, anywhere. I also keep an expert veterinarian on my staff. At Braxton Hall, this stallion will be among his equals in lineage and ability. Fed properly. Exercised properly. Bred properly.\u201d He reached up to smooth Osiris\u2019s jet-black mane. \u201cThis horse belongs with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the horse belongs to you.\u201d Barely bothering to turn his head, Bellamy spat in the straw. \u201cYou believe you\u2019re entitled to this beast, just as you believe you\u2019re entitled to everything. What makes you so much better than the two of us? Your title? The remarkable accomplishment of being born to a noblewoman instead of your father\u2019s favorite chambermaid?\u201d</p><p>Oh, now Spencer was thoroughly angered. Whatever clashes they\u2019d had in Spencer\u2019s adolescence, his father had been a decent, honorable man. \u201cJust because you know nothing of your own father,\u201d he warned, \u201cdo not pretend to know something of mine.\u201d</p><p>Hatred burned in Bellamy\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s naught but luck. Simple, dumb, blue-blooded luck is all that separates a man like you from a man like me. Leo understood it. He never thought himself the better of anyone. That\u2019s why he created this Club, made its membership contingent on the kind of good fortune that comes after one\u2019s birth, not before it.\u201d His glare alternated between Spencer and Ashworth. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll allow the two of you to destroy that. I\u2019ll fight you to my last breath if you try to take this horse from London.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lose.\u201d Spencer narrowed his eyes. \u201cMark my words, those tokens will be mine, in time. This horse will be mine, in time. And if you think all that separates the two of us is simple, dumb luck ...\u201d He shook his head in contempt. \u201cOne wonders why you spend such time and effort courting the favor of people you claim to despise.\u201d</p><p>Before Bellamy could recover, Spencer changed the subject. \u201cWhat do we know about Leo\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like I should be asking you that question.\u201d</p><p>Spencer shrugged off the implicit accusation. \u201cHas the prostitute been found yet? The driver of the hack?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy shook his head warily. \u201cSpent all night combing the louse-ridden pig\u2019s arse that is Whitechapel. I\u2019ll be headed straight back when we\u2019re through here. Don\u2019t suppose Your Grace cares to come along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d Spencer beckoned the groom with a nod, then passed him the stallion\u2019s lead. Reaching into his breast pocket, he withdrew an envelope sealed with the Morland crest and extended it to Bellamy.</p> <p>The man stared at it with resentment. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason you\u2019re here.\u201d He pushed the envelope into Bellamy\u2019s hand. \u201cGuard it well. Inside, you\u2019ll find the bank draft for twenty thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy stared at the letter, his sneer fading.</p><p>\u201cUse it to hire every runner and investigator in London. Search every seedy tavern and grimy hole; question every prostitute and footpad. Perhaps you\u2019ll discover some long-lost relations in the process, but you\u2019ll find nothing connecting me to Harcliffe\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Bellamy grasped a corner of the envelope and tugged.</p><p>Spencer kept his grip on the other edge. \u201cWhen the killers are found, the remainder goes to Lily. The token comes to me.\u201d</p><p>He let go, and Bellamy accepted the envelope with a begrudging nod.</p><p>Ashworth spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of coin, but when it\u2019s muscle you need, send for me. If it\u2019s a court trial you\u2019re wanting, though\u201d\u2014his neck cracked menacingly\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t promise there\u2019ll be much left but scraps to stand before the magistrate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDuly warned,\u201d Bellamy said warily. \u201cI thought you barely knew Leo. You\u2019d kill for him?\u201d</p><p>The soldier shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve killed for less.\u201d</p><p>Right. Impatient to end this, Spencer said, \u201cIf you refuse to allow me to move Osiris, I insist on sending one of my own grooms to oversee his care. I\u2019m for Cambridgeshire tomorrow. Keep me apprised of any and all developments. For that kind of money, I expect a daily express.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFleeing Town rather speedily, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Bellamy asked.</p><p>\u201cI am not fleeing anything. I\u2019ve business at my estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoneymoon business, I\u2019d wager,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cA series of pressing engagements with the ducal mattress?\u201d</p><p>As the two others exchanged looks, Spencer blew out an impatient breath. Maybe they were right. Maybe he really did just need a good tumble. All the more reason to end this meeting and return home to Amelia, who had both the good sense to disregard these ridiculous accusations, and the lush body to make him forget them completely.</p><p>\u201cI still say it\u2019s suspicious,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cAll of it. That hasty wedding, your leaving Town so soon.\u201d</p><p>The already-fragile thread of Spencer\u2019s patience snapped. \u201cAnd if I remained in Town, you would accuse me of tampering in the investigation and impeding justice. Nothing I say will convince you of my innocence, because all you can see is your own culpability. You were supposed to be with your friend that night; instead you were out whoring. Now the guilt\u2019s eating you alive, and until Leo\u2019s killers are found, you\u2019re going to make my life miserable. So much is clear.\u201d He jerked on his gloves. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the devil you think of me. Just find the killers. I want to see them brought to justice every bit as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>And I want that token more than you could possibly understand.</p><p>\u201cFind them,\u201d he repeated, staring Bellamy down. \u201cFind the token. And then we\u2019ll meet to discuss the future of this club.\u201d</p><p>A low rumble of laughter dispersed the angry tension in the air.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Ashworth said, still chuckling, \u201cIt\u2019s just amusing, don\u2019t you think? The three of us, comprising the membership of any club.\u201d</p><p>Julian scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Spencer brushed the dust from his sleeves and motioned to the groom for his mount. \u201cYou did say Leo loved a good joke. This one seems to be on us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Amelia was beginning to wonder if her husband ever intended to bed her.</p><p>When staring blankly at the lavender walls of the duchess\u2019s suite passed tedium and strayed toward madness, she flopped back on the counterpane with a frustrated sigh and stared up at the bed\u2019s purple canopy. It seemed to be embroidered with birds. Joyless, awkward birds with wings sprawled at odd angles. Perhaps they were meant to be cranes? To her, they resembled dead partridges ready for plucking. Hardly an inspiring vision for a new bride to contemplate whilst performing her wifely duties. She hoped the duke preferred darkness, when he came to consummate this marriage.</p><p>If he came to consummate this marriage.</p><p>They\u2019d left Beauvale House shortly following that mockery of a ceremony. A tense, silent carriage ride conveyed them to Morland\u2019s residence. At the door, he\u2019d handed her off to the housekeeper with the terse statement: \u201cTripp will show you to your chambers. See that you rest.\u201d</p><p>She had not seen him since.</p><p>She had rested. She\u2019d taken tea. She\u2019d thought to spend the afternoon unpacking her trunks and becoming acquainted with the house, but her new lady\u2019s maid informed her that wouldn\u2019t be necessary. His Grace had decreed they\u2019d be leaving for Braxton Hall tomorrow.</p><p>Tomorrow?</p><p>Confronted with that disquieting information, Amelia had sought refuge in a hot bath. She had dressed with great care for dinner, and then she had dined alone. When she finally summoned the courage to inquire after His Grace\u2019s whereabouts, she was informed that the duke had gone out riding.</p><p>Pah. Her wedding day, and already she\u2019d been abandoned for a horse.</p><p>Now, several hours after that solitary dinner, Amelia lay on the counterpane in her sheerest muslin shift, fingering the eyelet neckline and wondering if she\u2019d made a terrible mistake. Her thoughts returned again and again to that morning, and to Mr. Bellamy\u2019s accusations. At the time, she had rejected the idea instinctively. The Duke of Morland might be a disagreeable, arrogant, cold sort of man, but she couldn\u2019t believe him capable of murder.</p><p>But then she thought of that bank draft. Twenty thousand pounds. He was willing to pay twenty thousand pounds for a one-tenth share in a racehorse\u2014the exact same amount he\u2019d settled on Amelia, who came all of one piece. Independent of any aspersions cast on the duke\u2019s character, those amounts spoke eloquently of his priorities.</p><p>And then there was that breathtaking, violent punch to Bellamy\u2019s jaw.</p><p>No doubt another lady would have found that moment thrilling, when her bridegroom sent fist crashing into face to defend her honor. But Amelia had had five brothers, each of whom had thrown punches ostensibly in her defense, and she knew better. Men hit one another because they felt like hitting one another, and the \u201cfair lady\u2019s honor\u201d bit was usually no more than a convenient excuse.</p><p>If the duke had slammed Mr. Bellamy to the floor for insulting Amelia ... what might he be capable of doing, if the stakes were something he truly cared about?</p><p>No, no, no. She\u2019d been with him that night at the ball. Granted, he\u2019d arrived after Leo was already dead, but ... his behavior hadn\u2019t been that of a murderer. Had it? Amelia had to be honest; she had no idea how a man would act after committing a murder. Might he promptly show his face in public, to allay suspicion? Become pale and ill when challenged, perhaps even abscond to a secluded terrace? Toss obscene amounts of money at the victim\u2019s surviving family, marry the only witness to his suspicious behavior, and make hasty arrangements to leave town?</p><p>She flung her wrist over her eyes. Oh, Lord. What had he done?</p><p>What had she done?</p><p>She snapped up in bed. Perhaps it was not too late. The marriage was not yet consummated. If she could just escape this house and get back to Laurent\u2019s, she could request an annulment. She rose from bed, threw a wrapper over her shoulders and opened the window. For an early summer night, it was quite cool. But if she could dress on her own, evade the servants, slip down to the street somehow, find a hack ...</p><p>No, there was too much danger inherent in a furtive escape, and Amelia wasn\u2019t stupid. Whatever Morland had done, she doubted he posed a threat to her life. She could not say the same for the miscreants who roamed the darkened London streets.</p><p>Maybe she could simply send a note to Laurent, and he would come for her in the landau. Yes, that was it. She would bribe a footman to deliver it without His Grace\u2019s knowledge. Or if everything else failed, she could feign illness and demand a doctor\u2019s attention. It wasn\u2019t even that late yet. It was only just now\u2014she peered at the mantel clock\u2014</p><p>Twelve.</p><p>A latch scraped open, and she jumped in her skin.</p><p>The duke entered through the connecting door, and Amelia clapped a hand over her mouth to suppress a bubble of inane laughter. What a ninny she\u2019d been, to expect his arrival even a minute earlier.</p><p>After all, this was the Duke of Midnight.</p><p>Even she had to admit he lived up to the romantic appellation tonight. Standing in the doorway, dressed only in a shirt and loose trousers, he regarded her with unwavering, unnerving intent. He was obviously fresh from a bath, for his hair was still wet. Dark, untamed curls caught a warm gloss from the firelight. Amelia\u2019s gaze bounced from one newly revealed piece of him to the next\u2014his sinewy forearms, the wedge of chest exposed by the open collar of his shirt, his bare feet. He was so sinfully attractive, he could have been the Devil himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked, his brow creasing. He probably hadn\u2019t expected to open the door and find his bride standing at the open window, pressing a hand to her mouth.</p><p>Amelia considered feigning illness. Clutching her belly, falling to the floor, writhing in agony until a doctor or her brother arrived to rescue her. With a rueful sigh, she decided against it. From her childhood, she\u2019d been a very poor liar.</p> <p>\u201cI am well,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cOnly disturbed by my thoughts. And by the birds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe birds?\u201d He tilted his head and looked toward the window.</p><p>\u201cOn the canopy,\u201d she clarified.</p><p>He crossed to the bed and flung himself on it, rolling over onto his back. The mattress protested with a loud creak.</p><p>\u201cYes, I see,\u201d he muttered, lacing his hands behind his head and staring upward. \u201cDisturbing indeed. Are they vultures?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re meant to be cranes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranes?\u201d He cocked his head for a different angle.</p><p>Amelia averted her eyes. It seemed indecent, somehow, to keep staring at him as he lay on the bed, all rangy limbs and masculine sprawl. At least, the sight took her mind to indecent places.</p><p>\u201cWhatever they are,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019ll be gone the next time we\u2019re in this house. We can\u2019t have such an affront in your bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call it an affront. An affront to cranes, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s an affront to anyone with eyes. But especially to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy especially to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re accomplished with a needle, are you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Puzzled, Amelia folded her hands over her belly. She was indeed proud of her skill at embroidery, but how would he know that?</p><p>Ah, yes. The handkerchief. She wondered briefly what had become of it. Then she wondered briefly what had become of her wits. He could have her silly handkerchief, and welcome to it. She had to get out of this room, out of this marriage.</p><p>\u201cFor tonight,\u201d he said, rolling onto his side and propping himself on one elbow, \u201cI\u2019ll simply put out the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He drew up to a sitting position. \u201cThen let\u2019s move by the fire. It\u2019s gone drafty in here.\u201d</p><p>Amelia watched in silence as the duke rose from the bed and shut the window. He then gathered the pillows and blankets from the bed and arranged them in a heap by the hearth. Taking up the poker, he added more coal and stirred the fire until she could feel the flames\u2019 warmth from the center of the room.</p> <p>Was this the same arrogant, ill-mannered man she\u2019d married this morning? Dukes didn\u2019t close their own windows or arrange their own pillows or build their own fires. And yet he performed these simple tasks with an unaffected, manly strength that was both reassuring and arousing. Here was that flash of humanness again. He certainly hadn\u2019t the look of a cold-blooded killer.</p><p>As the light and warmth of the fire grew, her shadowy suspicions receded, until she began to feel a bit silly for entertaining them. Had she truly been standing at the window a few minutes ago, contemplating scaling the drainpipe in her dressing gown to escape her villainous bridegroom?</p><p>Really, Amelia. This isn\u2019t a gothic novel, you know.</p><p>In her heart, she just couldn\u2019t believe this man capable of murder. But then, she knew herself to be a trusting soul\u2014often to a fault. Nevertheless, if she wanted some assurance of his innocence, there was nothing to prevent her from asking for it.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, clapping the coal dust from his hands and wiping them on his trousers. \u201cNo more disturbing birds. What of the disturbing thoughts? Is there something I can do to exorcise them?\u201d He sat down before the fire and motioned for her to join him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d She gingerly arranged herself atop a pillow and pulled a blanket over her lap. \u201cWhere have you been? The butler told me you\u2019d gone riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, for a while. I was attending to various matters in preparation for our departure. We leave tomorrow for Cambridgeshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my maid informs me.\u201d Beneath the blanket, Amelia crossed her legs. \u201cWhy so soon?\u201d she asked, trying not to sound too disheartened. Had he even considered whether she would wish to leave London tomorrow? She wouldn\u2019t have a chance to bid her brothers farewell. And where was the fun in being a duchess, if her old friends couldn\u2019t pay calls and ply her with \u201cYour Grace\u201ds until they all collapsed into girlish giggling?</p><p>\u201cMy ward, Claudia, will soon return from York. I\u2019m eager to see her again, and eager for her to make your acquaintance. Besides, I have no further business in London at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have married now?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI told you, I didn\u2019t come to London for a wife. I came for the horse.\u201d</p><p>She quietly groaned. Not that horse again.</p><p>\u201cI meant to win Osiris fairly, but the contest is now stalemated. One of the tokens is in unknown hands, and neither Bellamy nor Ashworth will risk his share. There\u2019s no point to my remaining in London. I despise city living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she muttered, trying to come to terms with her status in his life as a sort of consolation prize, barely worth making plans around. \u201cIf you did not come to London for a wife, tell me again why it is you\u2019ve married me?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for several moments. \u201cI\u2019d rather show you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stuttered. What with the pillows, the toasty fire, and all this unpleasant murder business ... she\u2019d nearly forgotten the entire reason behind his visit to her bedchamber.</p><p>Evidently he had not.</p><p>Her blood heated as he swept her with a possessive gaze. She felt a blush rising on her neck and throat. Beneath the translucent fabric of her shift, her nipples rose to tight, self-conscious peaks. She was certain he saw them. She imagined he gave a little smile.</p><p>He reached out to grasp the hem of her shift where it peeked out from beneath her blanket. She stared at his fingers as he teased the bit of fabric, sliding the muslin back and forth over his thumb. He wasn\u2019t even touching her, but her nerves didn\u2019t seem to understand that. Her breath caught audibly, and his smile widened. She had the sense that he was toying with her, just as he toyed with that edge of her shift. Demonstrating that even his smallest actions had such power over her. The wolfish glint in his eyes said, in no uncertain terms, that before the night was out he meant to conquer her absolutely.</p><p>She gulped. And said, \u201cDid you murder Leo Chatwick?\u201d</p><p>Poof.</p><p>He fell back against the pillows, as if she\u2019d kicked him in the chest.</p><p>Amelia took advantage of that increased distance to draw a deep breath. Thank heaven. Now she had him on the defensive.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you murder Leo Chatwick?\u201d</p><p>The hollows of his cheeks blanched. \u201cYou would ask me this now? You seemed convinced of my innocence this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But then you left me alone all day, with only my thoughts and those ghastly cranes for company. And as I recall the scene now, I realize ... you never truly answered the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think there was any question. No one who knows me could give any credit to Bellamy\u2019s accusations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s my point. I don\u2019t know you, not very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough to consent to marry me.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on a blanket, drawing it up to her breasts and wrapping it snugly around her body. \u201cI consented to a betrothal. Normally those last longer than one day.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow at her.</p><p>She repaid the sardonic gesture with an arched brow of her own. Perhaps it was unseemly of her to pursue this line of questioning. But it was true that he\u2019d never expressly denied Mr. Bellamy\u2019s charges. Not that morning, not now. He seemed to think it beneath his effort, and Amelia didn\u2019t like being made to feel beneath his effort. A man ought to be willing to earn his wife\u2019s trust. \u201cWhere were you, before you arrived at the Bunscombes\u2019 ball that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His brow furrowed. \u201cThe servants would support that, if asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they are loyal servants who value their employment, I\u2019m certain they would support whatever their master said.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened with anger. \u201cSee here. I have just this morning given that guttersnipe Bellamy twenty thousand pounds to fund an investigation into Harcliffe\u2019s death. Why would I do such a thing if I were responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cI do know that twenty thousand pounds is a sum you toss around rather lightly. It seems to be the going rate for everything you purchase\u2014wives, shares in horses ... why not exoneration too?\u201d</p><p>He stared hard at her for a long moment, those hazel eyes burning into hers. Then he rose to his feet and quit the bedchamber, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>She winced. That was it, then. Would she find herself tossed out on the pavement? Or would he be so charitable as to send for Laurent\u2019s coach?</p><p>The door crashed open again. The duke entered, carrying a small lockbox under his arm and a ring of keys in the other hand. He crouched beside her, setting the box on the floor and selecting a key from the ring. Once he had the velvet-lined cache open, he positioned the contents for her perusal.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cCount them.\u201d</p><p>Amelia stared down at the scattered brass discs that represented membership in the Stud Club. Each token was stamped with a horse\u2019s head on one side and, logically, a horse\u2019s tail on the other. So irreverent; so boyish; so very Leo. How could anyone think these misshapen coins worth killing for? \u201cI don\u2019t need to count them. I know there are seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe me, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you far too intelligent to place Leo\u2019s token with the others, if you did have it.\u201d</p><p>With a huff, he flung his arms wide in a posture of martyrdom. \u201cSearch the house, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would likely take a week. And this is but one house; you have six, and doubtless some bank vaults besides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t honestly suspect me of murder. Here I thought you were a woman of some sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen treat me like one! You\u2019ve given me no opportunity to know you, no chance to judge your character for myself. All I have are my own observations, and what I see is a man with a great deal of wealth and influence, and very little respect for others\u2019 feelings, who has arranged his life around the procurement of a racehorse, heedless of the lives he ruins in the process. From a purely rational standpoint, I have more reason to suspect you than trust you.\u201d</p><p>Muttering an oath, he ran a hand through his hair. \u201cAmelia ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Spencer?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, obviously surprised at her use of his Christian name.</p><p>\u201cIt was in the vows,\u201d she explained. \u201cWould you prefer I call you Morland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer you call me Your Grace, if you mean to seek an annulment. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want some answers, that\u2019s all. I\u2019d like to feel I know something of your character, before I allow you ...\u201d She blushed. \u201c... certain liberties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited you to ask me questions when I proposed.\u201d His gaze was flinty, affronted. \u201cYou asked me about cats.\u201d</p><p>Amelia knotted her fingers in her lap. It was true, she\u2019d accepted him easily enough, without questioning much of anything outside his bank accounts. She hadn\u2019t considered that her lack of curiosity might be construed as an insult. To be truthful, she hadn\u2019t believed him possessed of emotions at all.</p><p>He sat back on his heels. \u201cTell me what it is you\u2019d like to know. Specifically.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cSpecifically, I want to know my husband is not a murderer. But to that general purpose, I\u2019d like to understand why this horse is worth so much to you. Why you would happily ruin my brother\u2019s hopes in pursuit of it, but you\u2019d draw the line at killing Leo. I want to know why you became ill at the ball\u2014and you were ill, don\u2019t try to deny it. Why did you insist we marry so quickly, so quietly? Why are you hustling me off to the country, away from all my family and friends? Was your youth truly as wild and uncivilized as they say? And on that subject, what\u2019s this mysterious history with Lord Ashworth?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s a very long list of questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Precisely my point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, his voice dark and intense. \u201cThen here are mine. I\u2019d like to know whether that freckle on your left breast is a solitary mark, or part of a vast constellation. I\u2019d like to know if your nipples are the same coral-pink as your lips, or a darker, tawny shade. I want to know if you\u2019ve touched yourself, learned how to give yourself pleasure. And\u201d\u2014he leaned forward, and her heart leapt into her throat\u2014\u201cI have a deep, desperate need to hear the little noises you make when you come. Specifically.\u201d</p><p>Oh my. Amelia quietly reeled. The idea of a man\u2014this man\u2014entertaining such lascivious thoughts about her ...</p><p>Her? Her.</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>Amelia prayed her voice would not tremble as violently as her thighs. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>He swore and turned away, clearly exasperated. \u201cWe reached an agreement. I\u2019m giving you security; you\u2019re giving me an heir. Your body was part of the bargain. An inquisition into my life\u2019s history was not. I\u2019m not in the habit of explaining myself, to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even to a wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not to a wife.\u201d He poked at the fire. \u201cGod damn it, Amelia. When I offered to marry you, it was because I expected things between us to be easy.\u201d</p><p>His words made her wilt inside. Yes, of course. He wanted her because she was easy. Convenient. Desperate. A woman he needn\u2019t take trouble to court or woo. A wife he wouldn\u2019t find it a chore to bed. A vessel for his seed. But did he honestly believe she should surrender her body to him, when he couldn\u2019t be bothered to secure her faith in his basic human decency? If he had the right to question her about her private activities under the coverlet on lonely nights, surely she had the right to be assured he was not a murderer.</p><p>She said, \u201cYes, well. No doubt you\u2019ll think me a foolish, deluded spinster for it, but I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m worth a modicum of effort.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEffort? Do you suppose it an easy task, to arrange our wedding and departure from Town in the space of a single day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a man of your means and influence? Yes.\u201d When he did not respond, she hugged herself and added, \u201cWe seem to be at an impasse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn impasse,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAllow me to be absolutely certain I understand you. You refuse to consummate the marriage until you\u2019re convinced of my innocence? Bellamy\u2019s investigation should unearth that proof soon enough. It had better, considering the funds I\u2019ve provided him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Is it so inconceivable to request a few days\u2019 delay?\u201d She closed her eyes and exhaled slowly. It took no small amount of courage, to set him a hurdle like this. But if she did not assert herself now, she knew she would never have a chance. \u201cLeo\u2019s death, our betrothal, now the wedding\u2014it\u2019s all happened so fast. Too fast for my comfort. I see it angers you, that I cannot take you at your word. It disappoints me, too. A wife should be able to trust her husband implicitly. If you gave me some time, allowed me to understand you better ...\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cMaybe tonight, we could simply talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk,\u201d he echoed.</p><p>\u201cYes. You know, chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChat.\u201d From the disdain in his voice, one would think she\u2019d suggested they quilt, or polish silver. For heaven\u2019s sake, what was so revolutionary about the concept?</p><p>Perhaps it was just a matter of choosing the right topic. Even Michael, the quietest of the d\u2019Orsay men, could go on about celestial navigation until the stars faded at dawn. \u201cTo begin with, why don\u2019t we talk about horses? Why is owning Osiris so important to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d He relocked the box of tokens and shoved it aside. \u201cI don\u2019t want to chat. About horses, or murder, or anything else. I want to bed my wife and then get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, he prowled across the cushions that separated them until he had her body caged between his broad, muscled arms. With a swift tug, he robbed her of the blanket she clutched. His long fingers roughly encircled her thigh, branding her flesh through the thin chemise. \u201cAs your husband, I am entitled to certain rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her pulse pounded in her throat, and she swallowed hard around it. \u201cAnd it would certainly tell me something of your character, if you mean to take them by force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way I \u2018forced\u2019 you to embrace me in Beauvale\u2019s study?\u201d</p><p>His grip on her leg went slack, but he didn\u2019t release her. Rather, he began dragging teasing arcs with his thumb, caressing her inner thigh. Her skin burned beneath his touch.</p><p>When he spoke, his voice was firm but husky. Deeply arousing. \u201cDo you truly want to know me, Amelia?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen know this.\u201d Lifting his hand from her thigh, he trailed his fingertips over her collarbone, dipping to trace the neckline of her shift. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to kiss you all damned day.\u201d</p><p>The words alone left her breathless. And then his mouth took hers in a dizzying kiss.</p><p>She kissed him back. Imprudently. Wantonly. Foolishly. Passionately.</p><p>This was exactly the paradox that had landed her in this situation. She never would have consented to marry him, if not for this kiss. Whenever he spoke, he used that wide, sensuous mouth to dismiss and insult her. But when his lips met hers, he became a different man. Solicitous, considerate. He afforded her respect, never overpowering her with his strength. He encouraged her cooperation with gentle sweeps of his tongue.</p><p>And he made it far too easy to imagine there was something besides mere lust behind this kiss.</p><p>Don\u2019t think it, she told herself. In his own words, this was a business transaction. Her security for his heir.</p><p>But as he deepened the kiss, she sighed. Her hand went up to clasp his neck.</p><p>She teased her bare fingertips through his damp, luxuriant curls, and he rewarded her with a guttural moan that echoed and swelled in her most feminine places. Her aching breasts. The damp cleft between her legs. Her heart.</p><p>He could claim them all, far too easily. She knew herself too well to believe otherwise. Already her blood pounded with lust for him, with the bone-jarring force of an army marching out to war. With the slightest encouragement, her affection would no doubt traipse blithely behind, like the village idiot. As the only woman in a family of five brothers, unreasoned devotion to undeserving men came all too naturally to her.</p><p>The enormity of the day\u2019s events struck home with sudden force. She\u2019d married a virtual stranger. Given him license to possess her body, but taken no precautions to safeguard her soul. With a twenty-seven-hour betrothal, she simply hadn\u2019t had time to prepare. To draw the boundaries that would protect her in this cold, impersonal bargain they\u2019d struck. Within these borders lies the essential Amelia: You may come this far, and no further.</p><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d He breathed her name against her ear. \u201cI must have you.\u201d</p><p>She began to tremble, and a whimper caught in the back of her throat.</p><p>The sound gave him a start. He pulled away and stared hard at the slope of her shoulder, where her flesh quivered under his touch. \u201cYou are truly frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cYou frighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I didn\u2019t kill anyone. You\u2019ve no reason to fear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do. I have every reason.\u201d And none of those reasons had a whit to do with Leo\u2019s death. Her fears were originated right here, in the heat between them and the veiled emotion in his eyes. Could she dare put them into words?</p><p>I\u2019m afraid of imagining you feel more for me than you do. Afraid of wanting too much, needing you more than you\u2019ll ever have a use for me. I\u2019m terrified that there\u2019s more to you than I suspected, but you\u2019ll never let me see it all. That I\u2019ll give you everything I have, and you won\u2019t even offer a few answers in return. And I need some time\u2014just a little time\u2014to learn how to offer you my body without risking my foolish, fragile heart.</p><p>\u201cLeo\u2019s token,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen it\u2019s found, I\u2019ll know you\u2019re blameless.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hardened as he withdrew his hand. \u201cVery well. While Leo\u2019s killers walk free, I\u2019ll not come to you. But once that token is recovered and I am proved innocent, there will be no further delay. And when I do take you, I will have all of you. Touch all of you. Taste all of you. You\u2019ll deny me nothing.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, paralyzed with longing and fear.</p><p>\u201cSay yes, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed. What a devil\u2019s bargain she\u2019d just sealed.</p><p>He rose to his feet and made to leave the bedchamber. Amelia fell back against the pillows and pressed her thighs together, attempting to ease the sweet, maddening ache in her womb.</p><p>At the door, he stopped. \u201cAnd Amelia? Even though I\u2019ve pledged not to come to you, there\u2019s nothing to keep you from coming to me.\u201d With one last burning glance, he reached for the door handle. \u201cThe door\u2019s unlocked, if there\u2019s anything you need.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Juno\u2019s hooves danced under him as Spencer eased into the saddle. He exchanged a nod with his outrider. The groom had been walking her for most of the morning, but now the mare had reached the end of her patience. As had he. A good, hard ride was what they both needed. They\u2019d outpace the carriages for this last leg of the day\u2019s travel and he\u2019d see about procuring rooms at the inn.</p><p>At Juno\u2019s impatient whicker, he nudged the mare into a canter. As the horse found her pace, a fresh breeze whipped through his hair\u2014a refreshing burst of coolness on this warm afternoon. He ought to have been taking in the pleasant countryside, Spencer supposed, but instead all he saw was Amelia, as she\u2019d appeared last night. The soft gold of her unbound hair, burnished by firelight. The enticing pink curves of her flesh, covered by the sheerest white muslin.</p><p>Her clear blue eyes, filled with fear.</p><p>Devil take it. That fear had come as a stab to the heart. Her courage and sensible nature were what attracted him to her in the first place. From her teasing during that that cursed waltz, to the kiss she\u2019d demanded before accepting his proposal\u2014she infuriated, intrigued, and aroused him, all because she refused to be intimidated. Just as she\u2019d said that morning after Leo\u2019s death, in the carriage: When they were alone, they were just a woman and a man.</p><p>Not anymore, evidently.</p><p>Now, thanks to the esteemed membership of the Stud Club, they were a woman and an alleged murderer. This morning ought to have found him a well-satisfied bridegroom, and instead he was frustrated in every way. All because Julian Bellamy had an irrational hatred of aristocrats, Rhys St. Maur had been a hot-tempered youth, and Leo Chatwick had had the poor sense to go walking in Whitechapel alone at night. Now Amelia feared him.</p><p>And then\u2014of all the addled feminine notions\u2014to remedy the problem, she\u2019d suggested they sit up all night and chat. She wished to submit him to her own version of the Spanish Inquisition, examine his sins, his failings, his family history and moral principles.</p><p>Good God. He couldn\u2019t imagine a worse strategy for earning her trust. How, precisely, would that interview go? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Very well, Amelia. I\u2019ll answer your questions. Yes, I spent a wild youth in Lower Canada, disappearing into the wilderness for weeks at a time with people you\u2019d consider heathen savages, causing my excellent father no end of grief. Yes, during my first year in England, I nearly pummeled Rhys St. Maur to death at Eton. Yes, I ruined your brother\u2019s fortunes in pursuit of a horse, for reasons you will find inexplicable and unforgivable. There, now. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m not a villain?</p><p>Oh, that would go over splendidly.</p> <p>And if she thought he would ever discuss his true reasons for abducting her from that ballroom ... well, she would wait in vain. If there was one indisputable advantage to being a duke, it was never having to explain himself to anyone.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t know one another. Ever since their waltz, he\u2019d been seized by an intense desire to know everything about Amelia Claire d\u2019Orsay. Hell, he\u2019d married her in part to assuage it. He just didn\u2019t see why words must be involved. He wanted to learn his new wife from the inside out, starting with the sweet cleft of her womanhood and working his way to her delicate fingers, which he\u2019d discovered last night to be capped with neat round calluses from needlework.</p><p>If they were to become acquainted, Spencer could think of no more logical beginning than to know one another in the biblical sense, as God and Nature intended.</p><p>Fortunately, Spencer had considerable experience winning over wary creatures, undoing the damage wrought by other men. It had been nearly two decades since he\u2019d broken his first mustang to halter in Canada, and at his stud farm he\u2019d gentled countless horses since\u2014most notably Juno, the mare carrying him now. The trick of it was knowing when to walk away. He\u2019d give a fearful horse a few minutes\u2019 tenderness\u2014stroke her behind the ears, murmur encouragement, give her a reassuring pat on the withers. Nothing too bold. Just enough attention to keep her wanting more. The moment the horse began to relax and enjoy his touch, Spencer would walk away. The next time he entered the enclosure, the once-frightened horse would approach him, eager and unafraid. The technique never failed.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d never plied it on a woman before. He\u2019d never needed to. He knew some men took perverse excitement in conquering a reluctant lover, but he wasn\u2019t one of them. He liked his bed partners to be just that\u2014partners. Willing, engaged, aware of themselves. He\u2019d wanted Amelia because she not only possessed the virtue and lineage he required in a wife, she met his ideals for a lover. When he kissed her, she responded with an instinctive, inventive passion that made his bones weak.</p> <p>Until those damned accusations planted doubt in her mind, and she\u2019d trembled. Not with pleasure, but with fear. Oh, he could have persuaded her into consummation if he\u2019d wished. But she would have despised him for it this morning, and he wouldn\u2019t have liked himself much, either.</p><p>He would coax her out again. It might take a few days\u2014time he really didn\u2019t want to bide\u2014but he was a man of self-discipline. With cards, horses, negotiation ... He knew how to be patient when the situation required it, and how to elicit the desired response. Before a week was out, his wife would come willingly, eagerly to his bed.</p><p>The key was all in knowing when to walk away.</p><p>Amelia surveyed the rooms Spencer had procured. If indeed these accommodations truly counted as \u201crooms.\u201d The inn\u2019s best suite consisted of a small bedchamber and an even smaller antechamber. The antechamber was furnished with a table and two chairs, plus a sleeping cot, likely intended for servants. Yet both her and Spencer\u2019s trunks had been carried up to the suite, so she assumed he meant to join her.</p><p>What he meant to do then, she was afraid to imagine.</p><p>One of the inn\u2019s serving girls had brought up a dinner tray. After a day of rough coach travel, the mere smell of stewed beef had Amelia\u2019s stomach roiling. She managed to choke down a bit of bread and tea. Her next thought was to undress quickly and slip into bed before the duke even returned. Surely he wouldn\u2019t disturb her if she was already asleep. Just to be safe, she\u2019d barricade the connecting door with her trunks.</p> <p>Before she could act on the plan, however, the door opened with a rude creak. In came the duke. He had to fold nearly double to avoid hitting his head on the doorjamb, and with the addition of his imposing presence, the \u201crooms\u201d shrank further.</p><p>A curt nod was his only greeting. And, as he\u2019d caught her with a mouthful of tea, her reply was an audible gulp.</p><p>Lord, he was so handsome. She didn\u2019t understand it, but somehow she forgot, when they were apart, what a fine-looking man he was. And every time she reencountered him, the simple fact of his masculine beauty startled her again with fresh, sudden force.</p><p>This man is my husband.</p><p>This man is my husband.</p><p>Surely one of these days the novelty would fade. Or at least she would learn to adjust more quickly, so each time they crossed paths in the corridor, she wouldn\u2019t pull up short and simply stand there, open-mouthed and struck stupid.</p><p>Rather as she was doing now.</p><p>He removed his coat, unfastened his cuffs, turned up his sleeves, and lathered his hands at the small wash-stand. As he rinsed them, he asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve eaten?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs much as I care to. And you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDownstairs.\u201d</p><p>After carefully folding his coat and laying it across a trunk, he worked loose his cravat. Next he sat in one of the chairs and began on his boots. He really was remarkably self-sufficient, for a man of his rank. Amelia supposed he must not have been raised with a valet.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t sit with me, if you\u2019d rather be downstairs,\u201d she said nervously. Didn\u2019t men prefer to be down in the tavern, drinking and carousing?</p><p>He gave her a disbelieving look. \u201cYou think I\u2019d leave you alone in a public inn? Not a chance. This is one of the better establishments, but still ...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAt any rate, crowded alehouses really aren\u2019t my idea of a pleasant evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have we stopped at an inn at all? Cambridgeshire isn\u2019t so very far. Couldn\u2019t we have pushed through to your estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreaking the journey sets a kinder pace for the horses.\u201d</p><p>Well, to be sure, she thought to herself bitterly. Heaven forfend we place human convenience ahead of the horses\u2019 comfort.</p><p>He began unbuttoning his waistcoat. Just how far did he intend to disrobe, right in front of her?</p><p>She rose from her chair. \u201cWell, I\u2019m rather fatigued. I think I\u2019ll retire early.\u201d</p><p>To her dismay, he also stood. \u201cExcellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Surely he didn\u2019t mean to go to sleep with her. Hadn\u2019t he promised to leave her be? \u201cOn second thought, I\u2019m not sleepy just yet. I believe I\u2019ll work on my embroidery.\u201d</p><p>She went to the smallest of her trunks and unbuckled the straps, knowing her needlework basket to be at the top. She imagined she felt him ogling her bottom as she bent at the waist to retrieve it, and she straightened so quickly, all the blood rushed from her head.</p><p>She stumbled, and he grasped her by the elbow to steady her. His firm, arousing touch was of no benefit as she struggled to collect her wits. Curse this wretched infatuation that turned her into a perfect simpleton whenever she came within breathing distance of his warm, male scent. It made her want to fall straight into his arms, never mind if he was a murderer or the very Devil himself.</p><p>She was used to being around strong, protective men\u2014her brothers\u2014and used to being embraced and comforted by them. Now she was miles away from all of them: homesick and weary, and direly in need of a hug. It occurred to her that the duke was her only potential source of strong, engulfing masculine embraces in the vicinity, and that thought made her sad indeed. For while she was tolerably certain he\u2019d bed her tonight if she gave him the slightest encouragement, she knew she\u2019d never be able to ask him for a hug.</p><p>She cringed to imagine his response, if she did. He probably didn\u2019t even know how to give one.</p><p>He released her as she sank back into her chair. Drawing closer to the light, she busied herself unpacking linen, thread, and scissors. \u201cWhat is your usual habit in the evenings, Your Grace? Do you keep country hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep my own hours, wherever I am. I typically retire around midnight.\u201d</p><p>The word \u201cmidnight\u201d sent a shiver through her. \u201cAnd until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil then?\u201d His eyes caught hers, a glint of wry humor in their dark, entrancing depths. \u201cYou mean, in the absence of other nighttime activities?\u201d He paused, giving her mind ample time to fill with other, very nocturnal activities. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not plotting my next vile act of treachery?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. Heat prickled along her skin.</p><p>Finally, he said in a deep, suggestive voice, \u201cI read.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, suddenly unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cBooks,\u201d he added, as if for clarification.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she replied, as if she were stupid enough to need that clarification.</p><p>He opened a small valise, revealing it to be full to brimming with volumes of all sizes, in a variety of bindings. The sight caused a swift, surprising pang in her chest.</p><p>\u201cMy,\u201d she remarked. \u201cYou must be a great reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever I\u2019m in London, I take the opportunity to add to my personal library.\u201d He removed a few books, turning them over in his hands to read the bindings. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend university, you see. Extensive reading has been my only education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to go to university?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot especially. Even if I had, my uncle thought it best not to send me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of what happened at Eton? When you were sent down for the brawl with Lord Ashworth?\u201d She was guessing, but it seemed the logical explanation for both the rumors she\u2019d heard and the strange tension she\u2019d observed between the men.</p><p>He gave her a long, pointed look. Well, there was one of her questions answered.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said coolly, selecting a book and packing the others away, \u201cmy uncle\u2019s health was already failing, and I was his heir. Estate management was a more pressing topic of study than Latin or mathematics. I continued my studies independently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes, it\u2019s like that for many of us.\u201d</p><p>His brow wrinkled in confusion.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean us, as in you and me.\u201d Peering at her needle, she threaded the eye with a strand of blue floss. \u201cI meant, it\u2019s like that for many of us.\u201d She patted a hand to her breast. \u201cWomen. We don\u2019t attend university, either, but many of us still seek to improve our minds through books.\u201d</p><p>Clearly the duke had no idea how to receive that comparison. Frowning a little, he sat down with his book. Amelia smiled at her stitches, rather pleased with herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d she asked, feeling emboldened and just a bit coquettish.</p><p>He held up the book for her inspection.</p><p>\u201cNot Waverley? I thought you called yourself a great reader. You must be the last person in England to read that book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019ve read it already, more than once.\u201d He riffled the pages. \u201cI don\u2019t have the concentration for philosophy or German this evening.\u201d</p><p>Amelia fell momentarily silent to focus on the evenness of her stitches. At length she said, \u201cWaverley. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m surprised to hear it\u2019s a favorite of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why. As you noted, it\u2019s a very popular book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d She gave him a coy glance. \u201cBut it\u2019s a romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not.\u201d He held the green-covered book at arm\u2019s length and stared at it, as though she\u2019d said, But it\u2019s a pineapple. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical novel about the Scottish uprising. There are battles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a love triangle.\u201d</p><p>He made an offended huff. \u201cListen, am I permitted to read the thing in peace, or not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Suppressing a laugh, she forced herself to be quiet and sew. Soon she lost herself in her work\u2014in the precise, familiar rhythm of stitches, the careful selection of colored threads. The room went quiet, save for the low crackle of the fire and the occasional sound of a page being turned. As she worked, her sleepiness increased. When she sensed her stitches becoming less and less even, she knotted off one final strand of blue and cut it free before turning the whole square face-up and surveying her work.</p><p>\u201cHow did you accomplish that?\u201d Spencer asked, reaching over her arm to indicate the rightmost section of the cloth.</p> <p>Startled by his sudden nearness, Amelia jumped in her chair.

How long had he been looking over her shoulder?</p><p>\u201cRight there,\u201d he said, pointing to the little brook she\u2019d stitched tumbling through a glen. \u201cIt truly looks like water. How did you accomplish it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d A hint of pride seeped into her voice. She was rather happy with that bit. \u201cIt\u2019s very thin strips of ribbon in different shades of blue, worsted with silver thread. I twist the needle as I sew, and in that way each stitch catches the light in a different way. As sunlight might dance on a rippling stream.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing. Likely he hadn\u2019t been that interested, to warrant a needlework lesson. Well, he had asked.</p><p>The longer he stared silently over her shoulder, however, the more self-conscious she grew. \u201cI was going to make it into a little settee cushion. Or perhaps use it as the center of a chair cover.\u201d She turned it this way and that in her hands, tilting her head to examine the piece from different angles. Perhaps she ought to frame it in strips of velvet, and use it for a larger pillow, or\u2014</p> <p>\u201cA cushion?\u201d he said abruptly, pronouncing the word as though it were caustic on his tongue. \u201cWhat an abhorrent idea.\u201d</p><p>Amelia blinked. Abhorrent? \u201cWh-Why?\u201d she stammered, taken aback. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in my own room, if you don\u2019t care for it. You needn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. That\u201d\u2014he pointed at her needlework\u2014\u201cis never adorning a chair or settee in my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it here.\u201d</p><p>Before she could protest, he snatched the embroidered square from her hands, opened his valise again, and thrust the fabric inside before slamming it shut with a decisive motion. The nerve of the man! Rather than argue, Amelia hastily packed away the remainder of her needles and thread, worried His Grace might suddenly decide to cast the entire sewing kit into the fireplace. She could always retrieve the embroidery later. She hoped.</p> <p>\u201cEnough reading and needlework. We\u2019ll play cards,\u201d he said, drawing out a deck of cards and sitting down. \u201cPiquet.\u201d He split the deck and began to shuffle the cards effortlessly. He moved so rapidly, fingers and cards were nothing but a colorful blur. The effect was entrancing, and subtly erotic.</p><p>He noticed her staring. One dark eyebrow rose in question.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite adept at that.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m good with my hands.\u201d</p><p>He was indeed good with his hands. But Amelia knew that already. She remembered with near-painful clarity the exquisite pang of yearning she\u2019d experienced when he\u2019d pulled them free of his gloves that day in Laurent\u2019s study. She remembered the way those strong fingers had unpinned her hair, then tilted her face to receive his kiss. And some moments later, clasped her bottom, bringing her body flush against his ...</p><p>Thwack. He rapped the deck against the table to square the edges, jolting her from her reverie.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps just one hand,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou do know piquet?\u201d he asked, beginning to deal.</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course. Though I cannot claim to be an expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. If you were, you should have taught your brother better strategy.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s anger spiked at the mention of Jack and his gaming debt, chasing away any lingering fatigue. \u201cI thought it was brag you played.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, the night he lost the four hundred.\u201d He gathered his cards.</p><p>She likewise retrieved the pile of cards in front of her and began sorting them in her hand. \u201cSo it was not just the once, then? You played together several times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not say several. On a few separate occasions.\u201d He selected four cards from his hand and discarded them.</p><p>She exchanged three of hers. He immediately declared his point to be forty-one, signaling he held one of the strongest hands possible in piquet.</p><p>\u201cDrat,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI see you don\u2019t like to lose any more than your brother does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes to lose.\u201d</p><p>When it came to games and sport, Amelia did have a competitive streak. Losing always put her in a foul temper. Therefore, her temper grew increasingly short as the hand progressed, for Spencer, after building an insurmountable lead in the reckoning of points, went on to take nearly every trick. But it wasn\u2019t simply losing the hand of cards that had her frustrated. No, it was everything else she\u2019d lost thanks to this man. If not for the duke\u2019s equine obsession and luck with cards, at this moment she could have been packing her belongings for a summer at Briarbank. And Jack would have been coming with her.</p><p>Once her defeat was confirmed\u2014confirmed, and then underscored\u2014Amelia quietly gathered the cards and began to shuffle them anew.</p><p>\u201cI thought you only wanted to play one hand,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>She spared him no word\u2014just a brief, sharp look. As if her pride would allow her to walk away after that drubbing she\u2019d just been handed.</p><p>\u201cYou should have discarded the knave of hearts,\u201d he told her as she dealt. \u201cDon\u2019t aim to collect sets, aim to win the tricks.\u201d</p><p>Discard the knave, indeed.</p><p>But though she hated taking his advice, she did so. Once again, she had two knaves in her hand; this time she discarded both and reaped a king in return. Spencer still won the game, to her chagrin, but by a much narrower margin.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he said, as he gathered the cards for his deal. \u201cBut next time, lead with your ace.\u201d</p><p>And so it went, over several hands. She gained on him slowly, coming closer and closer to victory\u2014but each time still falling short. After each hand, he offered her a point of strategy, which she begrudgingly incorporated into her own play. At last, on one of his turns as dealer Amelia reaped a very lucky hand of cards, including two aces and a septi\u00e8me. Falling silent to marshal all her powers of concentration, she discarded strategically, played her cards in the most advantageous sequence, caught a stroke of luck when he had no red king ... and won.</p><p>\u201cI won,\u201d she said, staring with disbelief at the played-out cards on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou did. This once.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWatch me do it again.\u201d She reached out to gather the cards for her deal, but he put out a hand and trapped hers against the table.</p><p>\u201cCare to make it interesting?\u201d</p><p>His hand was heavy atop hers, and warm. Amelia\u2019s heart began to beat a little faster. \u201cDo you mean a wager?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cFour hundred pounds,\u201d she said impulsively. If she could win back Jack\u2019s debt, her brother would not have to avoid Spencer any longer. Perhaps he could even come to Braxton Hall for an extended, wholesome country holiday, away from London and his wastrel friends.</p><p>\u201cVery well. If you win, I will pay you four hundred pounds.\u201d He released her hand. \u201cAnd if I win, you will come sit on my lap and lower your bodice.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear. Her hands curled into tight fists\u2014one still on the table, the other in her lap. \u201cI ... I beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. If I win this hand, you must come sit on my lap, lower your bodice, and expose your breasts to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what will you do?\u201d</p><p>One of his dark brows lifted in a clear signal of carnal intent. \u201cWhatever I wish.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s mind whirled. Dare she take his wager? The odds were against her. He was clearly the superior player, despite her gains of the last hour and this one paltry victory. But she wanted so badly to clear Jack\u2019s debts on her own.</p><p>Even more than that, she wanted to best Spencer at his own game and watch that superior look slide straight off his smooth-shaven face.</p><p>But another part of her\u2014a heated, yearning, deeply feminine part of her\u2014perversely wanted to lose. To sit on his lap and strip this dress from her body and feel those strong, sculpted hands cup her bared breasts. And that ought to have been the strongest argument for getting up and leaving the table that instant.</p><p>\u201cYou will remain clothed?\u201d she asked. She was an utter fool.</p><p>\u201cBut of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be a time limit.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his agreement. \u201cA quarter hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d He removed a timepiece from his waistcoat pocket and laid it on the table.</p><p>Her fists uncurled, and she ran one damp palm over her skirts before reaching for the cards. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>With trembling fingers, Amelia began to gather the cards. The duke\u2019s small discard pile lay off to one side, with the result that she reached for it last and added it to the bottom of the pile. As she turned the deck on its side to divide it for shuffling, the card she saw gave her a violent start.</p><p>The ace of spades.</p><p>Quickly masking her surprise, she split the deck and shuffled with energy. The duke had discarded the ace of spades. It made no sense. No one discarded an ace in piquet. There was only one way to account for such a thing.</p><p>He\u2019d sabotaged himself and allowed her to win. She\u2019d thought herself gaining on him in skill, improving to his level. But in reality, he\u2019d been in control of their match since the very beginning, manipulating the results. And now ...</p><p>She looked up, and his intent, desirous gaze trapped hers.</p><p>Now she\u2019d played right into his hands.</p><p>With an odd sensation in her chest, equal parts dread and anticipation, Amelia dealt the cards. She played them as best she knew how. And she lost. Badly.</p><p>She never had a chance.</p><p>\u201cA stroke of luck,\u201d he said. In a matter of seconds, he had the cards stowed and the table shoved aside. Then he patted his knee meaningfully. It was uncomfortably close to the gesture one might use to call a dog.</p><p>She needn\u2019t obey it. He could make no claim on her honor, when he\u2019d secured the wager through trickery.</p><p>Oh, but she wanted ...</p><p>She wanted.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more. I\u2019m a man of my word, remember? Come here, then.\u201d He extended a hand to her, in almost a gallant gesture.</p><p>And Amelia accepted. She\u2019d wanted to learn how to enjoy physical passion without risking her heart. Wasn\u2019t this the perfect opportunity? It was only ten minutes.</p><p>She rose from her chair and crossed the short distance to his seat before turning sideways and perching awkwardly on his knees.</p><p>\u201cNot like that,\u201d he said impatiently. Grasping her by the hips, he lifted her and half-stood, repositioning them both as he sat back down.</p><p>Amelia discovered, with some horror, that she was now straddling his lap. The thick folds of her skirts bunched up between them.</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d he said, still cupping her hips in his big, strong hands. He raised his eyebrows in expectation. \u201cYou remember the penalty. Lower your bodice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my own? But my buttons ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay you can manage.\u201d</p><p>Drat him, he was right. A lady didn\u2019t grow up in genteel d\u2019Orsay poverty without learning the trick of undoing her own buttons. She slowly raised her arms and folded them at the elbows, reaching behind her head for the topmost button of her gown, positioned at the base of her neck.</p><p>Clutching her hips tighter, he released a soft groan.</p><p>It took just a brief glance downward to learn the reason for it. With her arms raised like this, the bodice was straining at the seams. At the same time, the position thrust her breasts upward, with the combined result that twin scoops of flesh threatened to overflow her neckline. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>His eyes fixed on the exposed tops of her breasts, and Amelia felt unspeakably tawdry. Her fingers trembled as she released the first button. Then another and another still. By the time she\u2019d reached the fourth, her bosom was rapidly lifting and falling with her nervous breaths, and the duke\u2019s breathing had taken on an audible rasp. She paused, unable to reach the fifth button.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he whispered roughly. Desire was plain in his voice. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>Carefully, she lowered her arms and bent them behind her back, flexing her shoulder blades together and stretching her fingers toward the valley between them. His breath caught again. If the previous posture had put her breasts on display, this position all but served them up. His face hovered inches from her brimming cleavage as she undid the fifth button, then the sixth. Although her neckline gaped, her tightly laced stays kept her breasts pert and round.</p><p>Seven now. Then eight.</p><p>How many buttons were there? Ten? Twelve? Twenty wouldn\u2019t be enough. She loved the way he was looking at her, and the power she wielded over him as she eased each button loose. She didn\u2019t feel tawdry anymore. She felt erotic and sensual and wanton ... and completely not herself, for those were certainly not words that applied to Amelia d\u2019Orsay.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t Amelia d\u2019Orsay any longer, was she? She was Amelia Dumarque, the Duchess of Morland.</p><p>She was this man\u2019s wife.</p> <p>As her fingers neared the midpoint of her back, the bodice began to fall away from her body. His pupils widened with anticipation.</p><p>With a little roll of her shoulder, she dislodged one sleeve from its tenuous position on her arm. The fabric slid downward, taking half of her bodice with it. She pulled that arm free, and then easily bared the other. A chemise and stays still covered her torso, but she\u2019d never felt so exquisitely naked. Uncertain what else to do with them, she allowed her hands to dangle at her sides.</p><p>With possessive leisure, his eyes roamed every curve of her body. Perspiration beaded in the valley between her breasts. The room was thick with leftover afternoon heat, and even if it weren\u2019t\u2014his bold appraisal was heating her from the inside out. No man had ever looked at her this way. Oh, she\u2019d been ogled by Mr. Poste, and by a fair number of other men since. When framed by the right neckline, her bosom never failed to draw men\u2019s notice. Unfortunately, none of her other attributes held their attention beyond that brief, greedy glance.</p><p>The duke\u2019s gaze was different, though. Not leering, but appreciative. Speculative. There was more than idle admiration going on behind those eyes. There was thoughtful planning and intelligent strategy. His eyes drew sweeping arcs over the thin gauze of her shift, as though he were mapping out each possible approach.</p><p>What a novel sensation, to be the object of strategy. What would it be like, to be pursued by this man with just a fraction of the determination and resources he devoted to pursuing that wretched stallion? Heat swirled through her at the idea, and she felt herself melting between her legs.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He tightened his grip on her waist and hauled her forward, bunching her skirts higher between them and bringing her pelvis in sudden, startling contact with his.</p> <p>A little gasp escaped her. Obviously men did not melt between the legs. No, they grew hugely, demandingly hard. In response, her own body softened further.</p><p>\u201cYour stays,\u201d he choked out. \u201cUnlace them.\u201d</p><p>Breathless, she shook her head. \u201cOnly the bodice. That was the wager.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he released her hips. She closed her eyes, suddenly afraid. Not afraid she\u2019d angered him, but afraid this interlude would end.</p><p>A touch, whisper-soft, grazed her hand where it dangled at her side. Soon the sensation echoed on the other hand\u2014not only matched, but multiplied. He swept light caresses over the backs of her hands, her sensitive palms, and up the delicate skin of her wrists. Amelia wanted to moan. His touch was so sweet, so unbearably sweet.</p><p>Slowly, gently, with excruciating care, his fingers climbed her arms, lingering in the tender hollows of her elbows and skimming over the rounded flesh of her upper arms. He caressed the exposed planes of her upper back, and she shivered with pleasure as his fingertips traveled up her spine and traced the sweeping curve of her collarbone. He dipped a single finger into the tender valley of her cleavage, then just as quickly drew it out.</p><p>She wished she\u2019d obeyed him and unlaced her stays, so labored was her breathing now. She was faint with longing. Her eyelids trembled, even though she kept them tightly closed.</p><p>She felt him shifting, closing the gap between them. His breath warmed the curve of her neck. And then his lips pressed against her pulse.</p> <p>Her eyes flew open. If he was kissing her neck, he couldn\u2019t meet her gaze ... and in that case, she wanted to see everything. As he lightly nibbled the underside of her jaw, she studied the peeling wallpaper with ridiculous concentration. This is real, she told herself. The Duke of Morland is tasting my neck as though it were the most luscious, succulent fruit this side of Eden\u2019s gates, and this is all real. There is the wallpaper to prove it.</p><p>Grasping her by the shoulders, he gave her a necklace of kisses\u2014kisses that grew increasingly hungry and fierce. By the time he reached the other side of her neck, he grazed her flesh with his teeth.</p><p>And then he really did bite her. Gently, but still she cried out in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he soothed, licking at her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that ever since that damnable waltz.\u201d Before she could even conceive of a reply, he added, \u201cThis, too.\u201d</p><p>His hands slid around to claim her breasts. Greedily, possessively. He kneaded and shaped them, his fingers molding around the soft cups of her stays. Then, resting his forehead to her shoulder and releasing a lustful sigh, he burrowed his long fingers under the edge of her chemise, curved them under the swells of her breasts, and lifted. Her breasts sprang free with a nearly audible pop.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d He reclined, holding them up for his examination. Her nipples contracted to tight peaks. Amelia felt like closing her eyes again, but she just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>His finger covered the small freckle on the inner curve of her left breast. \u201cJust the one,\u201d he said softly. He trailed the same finger down, drawing a wide circle around the circumference of her areola. \u201cAnd tawny, like spice.\u201d</p><p>This is real. The Duke of Morland is eyeing my naked bosom with raw, unmitigated lust, and there are his dark, unwavering eyes to prove it.</p><p>If she required any further evidence of his desire, it pulsed hotly against her feminine core. Bright pleasure sparked through her. Then his thumb brushed her hardened nipple, and she thought she would explode.</p><p>Pushing her breasts together, he leaned forward and buried his face in them, nuzzling either side in turn and swiping teasing licks over her breastbone. Then he pulled back and drew her left nipple into his mouth.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold it in a moment longer. She moaned. But fortunately, so did he, so it wasn\u2019t quite so embarrassing.</p><p>Keening low through her teeth, she brought one hand to the back of his head, teasing her fingers through his soft, curling hair as he sucked and licked. He transferred his attentions to her other breast, and the sensations began anew\u2014so sharp and acute at first, then sweet and dark and deep. Without even thinking what she did, she rocked her hips against his, grinding against the hard ridge of his arousal.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, breaking away from her breast and kissing his way back up her neck. His hands slid to her hips, and he rocked her against him again. And again. Stoking her pleasure to a near-unbearable plateau.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He panted against her neck. \u201cThis is how I wanted you, that morning in the carriage. Just. Like. This.\u201d</p><p>Truly? That morning they\u2019d quarreled in the carriage, he\u2019d imagined them doing this? He dragged her over his hard length again, sending a fresh surge of pleasure through her.</p><p>Her lips parted, and his name rushed out with her breath. A helpless plea for mercy, but he seemed to take it as encouragement.</p><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d He clutched her hips tighter, nuzzled her ear. \u201cGod, we\u2019ll be good together. I\u2019ve known it from the first.\u201d</p><p>No, no. Such dangerous words. She tried to block them out, but her shields faltered, and she let herself imagine, for just a moment, there was more than lust behind them. In her ears, his words echoed and altered, warping around all her girlhood fantasies and romantic dreams. We\u2019ll be good together. I\u2019ve known it from the first. I\u2019ve known you from the first. Oh God, Amelia. I\u2019ve loved you from the first. The foolish, useless craving for affection throbbed in her blood, made her hot between the legs. And her heart ...</p><p>She didn\u2019t think her heart could bear it if he spoke again, so she kissed him, out of sheer self-preservation. Stupid, stupid mistake. The emotions unleashed in that rough press of mouth against mouth ... oh, they were a thousand times worse. His taste was too familiar now. He explored her mouth so thoroughly. It was all so unbearably intimate, it made her ache deep inside. She broke the kiss, intending to break away entirely.</p><p>But then he had his hands on her breasts again, and his mouth captured her nipple ... Pleasure swamped her last hold on resistance. She was lost. Her hips moved of their own accord, rocking against his in a steady rhythm.</p><p>Hot sensation gathered between her thighs, spreading sweetly through her limbs. And still she craved more. She\u2019d never imagined she could achieve pleasure this easily\u2014still mostly clothed, her body not yet attuned to his rough, masculine touch. But, oh, she was close. So close. That shimmering pinnacle of bliss hovered just beyond her reach, but she was striving toward it. Climbing higher ... higher ...</p><p>Thud.</p><p>She fell straight back to earth.</p><p>He lifted her by the waist, abruptly breaking the contact between their loins. \u201cEnough,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Enough? Amelia consulted her body. No. No, that was most definitely not enough.</p><p>Pushing her farther away, he straightened in the chair. \u201cTen minutes.\u201d Red-faced, he nodded at his watch. \u201cThey\u2019re over. The wager is satisfied.\u201d</p><p>Was he mad? Perhaps ten minutes were up, but Amelia wasn\u2019t nearly satisfied. And neither was he, from the looks of the straining bulge in his trousers.</p><p>Nevertheless, he rose from the chair and half-carried her into the bedchamber, abruptly releasing her. His hasty retreat left several paces\u2019 distance\u2014and the connecting door\u2014between them. \u201cGo to bed, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Reeling, she grasped the bedpost for support. Her whole body felt like blancmange, soft and quivering. And she ached ... oh, how she ached for completion. Surely he knew how aroused she\u2019d become, from the way she\u2019d wantonly ridden him. Goodness, from the sounds she\u2019d made. He conquered any resistance with his seductive touch and that hot, wicked mouth. Caught in that haze of lust, she would have surrendered her virtue easily.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed on ten minutes,\u201d he said, turning away to make discreet adjustments to his trouser fall. \u201cAnd I gave you my word.\u201d</p><p>Was she to believe he was being honorable? From the moment he\u2019d drawn out that pack of cards, he\u2019d drawn her straight into his clutches. Literally. And now he was walking away, leaving her a frustrated, trembling mass of thwarted desire and unfulfilled need.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need help with your laces?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She numbly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood night, then.\u201d He started to pull shut the connecting door, then paused to give her an enigmatic look. \u201cI\u2019m just here, if there\u2019s anything you need.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Alone in the antechamber, Spencer unscrewed the top of his flask with trembling fingers. He tossed back a quick, scorching swallow. Then another.</p><p>His movements jerky and agitated, he stripped himself of his waistcoat. He flung open a trunk, pulling out a set of clean linens and snapping them open to cover the narrow cot. As if he\u2019d be able to sleep.</p><p>He strode to the table to light a fresh candle. When his fingers refused to work the flint properly, he cast the damn thing away. Swearing quietly into the darkened room, he tugged at the buttons of his breeches placket, untucked his shirt, and stopped postponing the inevitable. Bracing one hand on the table, he freed his aching erection with the other. He was still hard as a pike, and primed for release. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Her breasts. Her hips. Her mouth on his. Her softness and heat. Her little mewls of pleasure. The sound of his name from her lips. The taste of her skin. Her breasts again, because they bore repeating. And those nipples ... God, she had the most pert, luscious nipples he had ever\u2014ever\u2014laid eyes or thumbs or lips upon. And the look on her face, when he\u2019d carried her to the bedroom. Bewildered, mussed. Half-naked and fully aroused. She was there, right now, in the bed. He could join her. He could have her under him. Surrounding him. Gripping him tight. Panting and writhing and\u2014</p> <p>Sweet. Holy. Merciful ...</p><p>Behind his eyelids, the world went searing bright. Gritting his teeth against an involuntary cry, he came in a frenzy of brisk, tight-fisted strokes, spurting jet after jet into a loose fold of his shirt. His breath grated in and out of his chest as he clutched the table\u2019s edge for support.</p><p>After a minute, he straightened, pulled the soiled shirt over his head and cast it aside, then flopped onto the cot to savor the numb, joint-loosening sensation of release.</p><p>Release, yes.

Don\u2019t ponder it overmuch, a throb in his groin warned.</p><p>The evening really had not gone as planned. Well, it had gone as planned, up to a point. The cards, the wager, her breasts in his hands ... all these he\u2019d counted upon. He\u2019d only meant to give her a bit of skillful stroking. Not too much. Just enough to loosen the tension in her body and offer a taste of the pleasure they could share. Just enough to prove he could be trusted, and keep her wanting more.</p> <p>Well. This was clearly a different endeavor from horse-breaking.</p><p>In his best imaginings, he wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Amelia would respond to him so passionately. He couldn\u2019t have dreamed how strongly he\u2019d respond to her. As a younger man, Spencer would have counted it with great pride, the fact that he\u2019d taken an inexperienced lover from clothed and uncertain to half-naked and teetering on the verge of climax\u2014all in under ten minutes. But the triumph rang a bit hollow tonight, as he realized his victory came with a forfeit.</p><p>He was left wanting more, too.</p><p>Not just more pleasure, more heat, more skin ... although he did want all those things, and desperately ... but more Amelia. He wanted to sit at the table and watch her worry that plump lower lip with her teeth as she embroidered. He wanted her to tease him for his reading choices. Most of all, he wanted to catch her staring at him, when she thought he wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>And he wanted the look in her eyes to be fondness, not fear.</p><p>He stared hard at the connecting door, as though he could swing the warped panel on its rusted hinges by sheer force of will.</p> <p>Come to me, Amelia. You crossed a ballroom to confront me while hundreds looked on. Open that door tonight.</p><p>But when dawn came, he awoke alone.</p><p>God had a very cruel sense of humor.</p><p>Here Amelia was, the newly minted Duchess of Morland, arriving at Braxton Hall in all its early summer splendor. Through the square carriage window, she spied endless acres of rich farmland dotted with neat barns and cottages, then a pleasing expanse of rolling green parklands, and now, as they neared the Hall, a wall of towering, manicured hedges that must contain equally well-maintained gardens. Of this prestigious, lovely, verdant estate she was now mistress.</p><p>And she was a shambles.</p><p>Amelia had never traveled well. The rolling motion of a carriage always nauseated her, and she felt the effects even more strongly in warm weather. Their first day of travel hadn\u2019t been too distressing, but the farther they went from London, the worse the roads became. Late spring rains had left this particular dirt lane rutted and uneven, so that she had not only rolling to contend with, but violent jouncing as well. She ached all over, her muscles stiff from long hours of bracing herself on the seat, and her head throbbing with a persistent, dull pain. Her gown\u2014a sensible chocolate-brown traveling habit two years past its fitting\u2014was wrinkled and coated with a fine layer of dust.</p><p>She was the sorriest-looking duchess to ever live, she was sure of it.</p><p>As they turned the corner onto a smoother drive, Amelia glimpsed the Hall\u2019s brick-and-limestone fa\u00e7ade in the distance. She hastily patted her face and smoothed stray wisps of hair, anxious to make herself presentable before facing Spencer again.</p> <p>Dear Lord, how would she face him? A blush scalded her cheeks at the mere idea. What had happened last night, at the inn ... Those ten minutes in his lap had been a sensual thrill the likes of which she had never thought to experience. And by undeniable, abundant evidence, his desire for her had not been feigned. She hadn\u2019t felt sorry-looking in his arms last night, but attractive and wanton. Until he\u2019d abruptly called a halt to the evening, leaving her confused and frustrated instead. Had he truly meant to respect their agreed-upon boundaries, or to punish her for setting them?</p><p>The carriage door opened, and harsh sunlight flooded the velvet-lined interior. Her headache renewed with double force. She hadn\u2019t expected the sun to be so strong in late afternoon. But as she accepted the footman\u2019s hand and alighted from the coach, Amelia realized it was not the direct rays of the sun that blinded her, but rather their reflection off the gleaming white marble entrance to Braxton Hall.</p><p>Blinking, she raised her hand to shield herself from the stabbing attack of grandeur. Briarbank was covered in ivy and moss, and it never made her wince. In a defensive move, she turned her head to the left. No marble there. Just an endless fa\u00e7ade of crimson brick, glittering limestone, and glazed windows that faded into the distance, most likely somewhere near Cambridge. She swiveled her head to the right. An equally impressive, equally long fa\u00e7ade fronted the Hall\u2019s east wing, seeming to stretch half the distance to the sea.</p><p>And it was hers. All hers to manage, to make both a showplace and a home. Amelia battled the urge to hop up and down with delight.</p><p>She confined herself to a discreet twirl instead, turning just in time to watch Spencer dismount from his horse in one smooth, elegant motion. Of course, he looked magnificent. A touch of dust dimmed the shine on his Hessians, but it only enhanced his masculine appeal, as did the healthful glow of physical exertion and the bronze cast to his complexion after two days spent in the sun. As he handed the reins to a waiting groom and exchanged a few words with the man, she noticed a relaxed, easier way to his manner. He was even smiling.</p><p>Then he turned and caught her eye. The smile disappeared.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d His boots clicked against stone as he covered the distance between them, and just as Amelia was learning to expect, he took what could have been a mildly awkward situation and made it twelve times worse. \u201cYou look dreadful.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed under his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. The carriage ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, obviously. Come inside and rest.\u201d Laying a hand to the small of her back, he guided her up the marble steps toward the open door. The muscles flanking her spine were bunched and stiff. His thumb found the worst of the knots and traced firm circles over it. She sealed her lips over a grateful moan.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d he chided her. \u201cYou might have ridden part of the journey, if you\u2019d liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ride.\u201d</p><p>He halted, looking down at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t ride,\u201d he repeated in a tone of disbelief. \u201cAt all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, chastened.</p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019re joking. I know your family epitomizes noble poverty, but don\u2019t the d\u2019Orsays have some cattle to their name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we do. I just never cared to learn.\u201d</p><p>He merely shook his head and resumed guiding her up the stairs and into the house. The butler and housekeeper came forward to greet them.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Your Grace.\u201d The silver-haired butler bowed to the duke. He then turned to Amelia and made the same gesture of respect to her. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather you received my express,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cYesterday morning, Your Grace.\u201d The housekeeper curtsied. \u201cOur congratulations on your marriage. Her Grace\u2019s chambers are aired and readied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Her Grace is unwell. See that she rests.\u201d In a brisk tone, he introduced the servants as Clarke and Mrs. Bodkin.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely entrance hall,\u201d she said, by way of indirect compliment. She hoped to make the housekeeper a quick ally. Peering at one of the dozen gilt-framed paintings on the far wall, she wondered aloud, \u201cIs that a Tintoretto?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Spencer answered.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d Her family had owned one quite like it, once. It had fetched enough at auction to pay their expenses for a year.</p><p>\u201cSpencer!\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s gaze jerked to the top of the staircase, where a young woman stood clinging to the banister.</p><p>\u201cSpencer, you\u2019re home!\u201d</p><p>And this must be Claudia. Hadn\u2019t Spencer said his ward was visiting relations in York? But it could be no one else. The family resemblance was subtle, but clear. The cousins shared the same dark, curling hair and fine cheekbones\u2014features that must recall their fathers\u2019 side of the family. Claudia\u2019s innocent features contrasted with a developed figure. She teetered on that fulcrum between youth and womanhood.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing home?\u201d Spencer called to her. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to be in York another week yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I begged them to send me home early. And when the decrepit old bat refused, I simply misbehaved until she was glad to be rid of me. We sent a letter, but it must have crossed you on your journey.\u201d The young lady tripped down the cascading river of marble that formed the front hall stairs, pale pink muslin fluttering behind her. As she hurried toward the duke, everything about her\u2014from her fists balled in excitement to her bright, flushed expression\u2014bespoke joy and affection. The girl clearly adored him.</p><p>\u201cIncorrigible chit.\u201d The words might have been a reproach, but Amelia didn\u2019t miss the warmth softening his eyes. In his own reserved, masculine way, he clearly adored her, too.</p><p>The realization hit Amelia very queerly. It was encouraging, she supposed, to learn that her new husband was capable of genuine, tender affection. But it was also disheartening, to contrast that depth of emotion with his treatment of her.</p><p>When Claudia reached the bottom of the stairs, she rushed toward her guardian at a startling velocity. At the last second, however, she pulled up short and looked askance at Amelia. \u201cIs this my new companion?\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s already-upset stomach clenched further. This didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Spencer said slowly. \u201cNo, she is not your new companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Claudia smiled. \u201cJust from looking at her, I knew she must be the new companion\u2019s lady\u2019s maid, but I wanted to be certain she wasn\u2019t the companion first. It would have been rude of me to assume otherwise, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Amelia swiveled to face Spencer, so slowly she heard her own vertebrae creak. Then she lifted her eyebrows. It was all the reaction she could manage.</p><p>Oblivious, Claudia went on, \u201cIs my new companion traveling separately?\u201d</p><p>Spencer clenched his jaw. \u201cThere is no new companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d Her brow wrinkled. \u201cBut you promised that when you came back from Town, you\u2019d br\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaudia.\u201d At the sharp command in his voice, the girl startled and looked up at him with the bewildered eyes of a puppy that had just been kicked. Heavens, this just became worse and worse.</p><p>Spencer lifted Amelia\u2019s hand, tucking it into the crook of his elbow. She stared stupidly at her own fingers, resting leaden and numb atop his arm.</p><p>\u201cLady Claudia,\u201d he said firmly, obviously hoping to inspire some return to decorum, \u201cmay I introduce Amelia Claire d\u2019Orsay Dumarque, the Duchess of Morland. She is not your new companion. She is my new bride.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cYour ...\u201d Claudia stood blinking at Amelia. Then she turned and blinked up at Spencer. \u201cYour ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife. The duchess. Your new cousin.\u201d He gave her a pointed look. \u201cThe lady to whom you must curtsy and apologize. Now.\u201d</p> <p>The girl dipped in a curtsy, tripping over a few words of apology. Then she looked up at Spencer with the resentful eyes of a puppy that had been kicked not once, but many times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ...\u201d Amelia cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to meet you, Claudia. The duke has told me many wonderful things about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow curious,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of his letters mentioned you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaudia,\u201d Spencer warned.</p><p>Amelia squeezed his arm, then withdrew her hand. \u201cI do hope we can be friends,\u201d she said brightly, moving forward to lay the same hand on Claudia\u2019s wrist. It was probably futile, but she had to make the attempt.</p> <p>A prolonged, awkward silence ensued. Just when Amelia thought the tension could not possibly become worse, it did.</p><p>Claudia began to cry.</p><p>\u201cYou married?\u201d Ignoring Amelia entirely, the girl turned brimming eyes on Spencer. \u201cWithout even telling me? How could you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he muttered, drawing his ward aside. \u201cDon\u2019t make a scene.\u201d</p><p>Amelia almost laughed. Too late for that bit of advice. Truly, she couldn\u2019t blame the girl. In any normal betrothal, they would have become acquainted well before the wedding. Claudia would have had weeks or months to adjust to the idea of a new duchess at Braxton Hall, rather than having Amelia thrust upon her unawares one afternoon. No, she couldn\u2019t fault the girl for her resentment. She faulted Spencer for it. It was just one more example of the duke making an impulsive, arrogant decision with no regard for the feelings of those affected.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cthe two of you must have a great deal to discuss.\u201d She turned her back on Spencer. \u201cMrs. Bodkin, would you be so kind as to show me to my chambers now? We can discuss dinner arrangements on the way.\u201d</p> <p>The housekeeper brightened. \u201cOh, yes, Your Grace. Cook will be so pleased to receive your direction. Have you special recipes or menus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d A genuine smile warmed Amelia\u2019s face. Here was some consolation. \u201cAn entire book of them.\u201d</p><p>The handful of hours between Amelia\u2019s arrival at Braxton Hall and dinner were a whirlwind. Ill or no, she had little time to rest. This was her first evening in residence as the Duchess of Morland. She might have entered the house looking like a poorhouse case, but by the time she descended those marble stairs for dinner, she was resolved that she would look and act the part of a duchess.</p><p>No one would mistake her for a paid companion, or worse, a lady\u2019s maid.</p><p>Dinner plans were no simple task. She was forced to rely on Mrs. Bodkin\u2019s estimate of the kitchen stores and devise an elegant yet simple menu that could be prepared from available foodstuffs within the allotted time. Fortunately, the housekeeper seemed overjoyed to assist in any way. After sending the older woman off to the kitchens with a list of dishes, a few custom recipes, and many verbal instructions for the cook, Amelia permitted herself ten minutes\u2019 rest on a chaise longue covered in sumptuous brocade. Her entire suite of rooms\u2014she\u2019d counted six of them so far\u2014was decorated in positively regal shades of royal blue, cream, and gold. From where she lay, she studied the intricate Greek key pattern trimming the plastered ceiling. If she let her head fall to one side, she saw four exquisitely turned wooden legs supporting a polished stone tabletop, which held a blue-and-white Chinese vase, which in turn accommodated a large arrangement of fresh-cut flowers.</p><p>Orchids. At last, she had her orchids.</p><p>The entire tableau was one of beauty, elegance, and harmony. Merely gazing upon it filled her with quiet joy. After years of living with Winifred\u2019s ostentatious displays of pink shells and overfed cherubs, Amelia reveled in the abundant evidence of her precursor\u2019s restraint and good taste.</p><p>For ten minutes. And then she went back to work.</p> <p>Once the maid had drawn her bath, Amelia sent her off to press the new pearl-gray silk from her wedding. The gown was unquestionably the best she had, and this occasion demanded her best.</p><p>Amelia could manage a bath on her own\u2014she\u2019d done so for years\u2014but time was short, and she couldn\u2019t be late for dinner. This was what she\u2019d been waiting for all her life, to be mistress of her own house. She would show Spencer and Claudia both. Soon they would adore her. They would wonder how they\u2019d ever survived without her. One well-planned, satisfying meal, and the duke would realize his immense fortune in marrying a plain, unassuming spinster. He might even rise from his seat, walk the length of the table, and humbly kneel at her side, gazing up at her with sheer worship in his eyes. Amelia, he would say, in that husky, thrilling voice of his, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve lived without you. You\u2019ve made our house a home. I\u2019ll do anything, say anything. Just promise me you\u2019ll never, ever leave.</p><p>Or so it was amusing to dream.</p><p>Working quickly before the water could go cold, Amelia wrestled out of her traveling habit. Stripped down to chemise and stays, she then stood in the center of the room, uncertain what to do with the dress. She didn\u2019t want to just throw the whole dusty mess atop a clean bed. Another lady might have dumped the garments in a heap on the floor, but Amelia\u2019s sense of tidiness and her respect for good fabric just wouldn\u2019t allow it. Surely this room had a closet with a hook or two ...</p><p>Turning slowly in place, she spied a sliding wood panel to one side of the bed. It blended so perfectly into the wainscoting, she hadn\u2019t noticed the closet on first inspection.</p><p>Enjoying the way the carpet\u2019s thick pile cushioned her bare toes, she hurried to the door. It was heavier than she\u2019d expected, but by leaning her full weight into the effort, she managed to slide it open.</p><p>On the other side was Spencer.</p><p>Upon seeing her, he froze\u2014right in the middle of removing his shirt.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Mortified, Amelia dropped the entire bundle of fabric. Which only increased her embarrassment, since she now stood before him in just her shift and stays. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she stammered. Her eyes riveted to the rippling muscles of his abdomen and the line of dark hair bisecting them. \u201cI ... I thought this was a closet.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his shirt, he flicked a bemused glance at the room behind him. \u201cNo. Not a closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Her face burned. Obviously it was the duke\u2019s bedchamber\u2014an exact mirror of her own, but done up in rich, masculine colors and fabrics\u2014and this sliding door connected the two suites. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t expecting ... I mean, this arrangement is very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnusual. That\u2019s what I meant to say.\u201d</p><p>She shifted her weight uneasily. His gaze dipped to her bosom.</p><p>She added, \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never seen this sort of papering before, done up in such complimentary colors. It\u2019s so clever, the way the gold in my room is mirrored with a dark blue in yours, but both carpets have the same pattern of ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d He nodded thoughtfully at her cleavage. He wasn\u2019t hearing a word she said.</p><p>\u201cThe same pattern of unicorns. Alternating with rounds of cheese.\u201d</p><p>Another vacant nod. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s face heated. Here she was, dreaming of elaborate menus and blathering on about room d\u00e9cor\u2014and he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d married her for one reason only, and if she\u2019d momentarily forgotten it, the intensity with which he was currently staring at her breasts would have been a certain reminder. He wanted to bed her, and get an heir. That was all. Despite his assurances to the contrary when he\u2019d proposed, she was here in his home as a glorified broodmare.</p><p>No, scratch the \u201cglorified.\u201d He likely treated his broodmares with greater affection.</p><p>She stepped back, nearly tripping over the heap of clothing at her feet. No way to pick it up without giving him an even bolder view of her cleavage. Discreetly kicking the garments aside, she put one shoulder to the door panel and prepared to slide it closed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at dinner, then.\u201d</p><p>His hand shot out to grasp the edge of the door. Amelia pushed anyway, but the slab of oak wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cAbout Claudia,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s very ... young.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI wish that had gone differently, downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Was this what constituted an apology, in Spencer\u2019s world? It didn\u2019t quite merit absolution in Amelia\u2019s. She nodded. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>His gaze seemed to have settled on her hips now, his lips curving in masculine approval. Yes, yes. They were wide and strong. Excellent for breeding, as she\u2019d been informed by many a well-meaning matron in her day.</p><p>Amelia cleared her throat. The message in the inarticulate sound was clear: Hullo? I\u2019m up here.</p><p>He dragged his eyes back up to her face. But he took his time about it, and as his gaze stroked over her, a pleasant warmth buzzed through her veins. Lord, what a hopeless situation. She enjoyed being lusted after; there was no pretending otherwise.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t stop herself from craving affection in the bargain\u2014even though he\u2019d never offered it, and she\u2019d accepted him knowing that full well. He was a man. Not just a man, but a powerful, attractive duke. He could separate his physical needs from his emotions\u2014but for Amelia, the two were hopelessly entangled. That meant he had all the power.</p><p>Not to mention the physical force. As they stood there\u2014her whole strength marshaled to close the door and his one hand holding it open\u2014it occurred to her how easily he could overpower her, if he wished. For God\u2019s sake, he\u2019d lifted her six inches into the air in that ballroom, and she wasn\u2019t especially light.</p><p>Her eyes went to the door handle.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one latch,\u201d he said, guessing her thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s on my side.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d With an arrogant grin, he released his grip on the door and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019ll never lock it.\u201d</p><p>Amelia shifted her weight, and the door slid shut with a satisfying bang. She thought she heard him laugh.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Dinner was a miserable business.</p><p>Against all reason, Spencer had hoped for a swift improvement in Claudia\u2019s demeanor. Obviously, the fact of his marriage had taken his ward by surprise. But with a few hours to grow used to the idea, perhaps she would embrace Amelia as a welcome addition to the household.</p><p>No. No embracing going on tonight.</p><p>Spencer sat at the head of the table. Amelia and Claudia faced one another across an arctic expanse of white linen and bevel-cut crystal, but their eyes never met. One would think the fish course had been served live and wriggling, considering the violence with which Claudia stabbed it.</p><p>\u201cHow was your time in York?\u201d Spencer asked her. \u201cCan I expect good reports from your tutors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She jabbed at a fillet of turbot. \u201cI was rather a disappointment to my German master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of your music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe music master was rather a disappointment to me.\u201d Sniffing, she laid down her fork. \u201cThe shops were lovely, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent you to York so that you might improve your mind, not distribute your pin money to the local merchants. Why should I bother arranging for tutors if you learn nothing from them?\u201d</p><p>Resentful eyes snapped up to his. \u201cPerhaps you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry, dear?\u201d Amelia interjected in a smooth, conciliatory tone. She nodded at Claudia\u2019s abandoned fish. \u201cYou didn\u2019t touch your soup, either.\u201d</p><p>The girl still refused to look at her.</p><p>\u201cPlease excuse me.\u201d Chair legs scraped the floor as Claudia rose to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve little appetite this evening.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>With that, she fled the room. Spencer braced his hands on the arms of his chair and started to rise. He froze halfway. Should he even bother going after her, or would that only make matters worse?</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Amelia said, reading his thoughts. \u201cShe needs time.\u201d</p> <p>He lowered himself back into his chair.</p><p>With a sigh, Amelia signaled the servants to remove the fish. \u201cSpencer, what do you intend to do about her?\u201d</p><p>He was too fatigued to be anything but honest. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He hadn\u2019t known what to do with Claudia for some time now.</p><p>\u201cHow old was she, when she lost her parents?\u201d</p><p>He started to answer, then hesitated as liveried sleeves reached between them. The servant positioned a roast of lamb in the center of the table. Spencer impatiently motioned for the knife and carving fork. Perhaps dukes didn\u2019t typically carve their own roasts, but he found it easier to talk when his hands were occupied.</p> <p>And surprisingly enough, he wanted to talk about this.</p><p>\u201cShe was an infant when her mother died. That was shortly before my uncle summoned me from Canada. He had no wish to remarry and produce an heir of his own, so he and my father agreed I would come here and prepare to assume the duties of the title. Claudia was nine years old when the late duke passed away. Since my own father had died in the meantime, that\u2019s when I inherited the dukedom and assumed her guardianship.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d begun failing her almost immediately thereafter. At least, that\u2019s the way it had felt. He had tried. He\u2019d kept her close for the year or two after her father\u2019s death. Let her travel with him, taught her to ride, read aloud to her in the evenings from Shakespeare, Homer, Milton\u2014never letting her guess that the classics were new to him, too. She was a clever child, and endlessly greedy for affection. He\u2019d given her as much attention as he could, considering the demands of his own new title, but he\u2019d always known she deserved more. And the older she grew, the less he knew what to do with her. She needed education, refinement, guidance, exposure to society\u2014none of which he could adequately provide.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, flicking aside a sprig of rosemary as he sawed the meat, \u201cI\u2019ve hired governesses through the years. The past few winters, I\u2019ve been sending her to her great-aunt\u2019s in York. She was supposed to have the benefit of some masters there.\u201d</p><p>Amelia sipped her wine. \u201cNo wonder she resents me. Poor girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should she resent you?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened at him over the wineglass, but Spencer truly didn\u2019t understand. He\u2019d hoped Claudia would be happy to have a feminine influence in the house, since she\u2019d never known her own mother.</p><p>\u201cSpencer, you are the sole adult she\u2019s lived with all her life. To her, you are like cousin, brother, guardian, and God Himself, all rolled into one. It was plain from one minute\u2019s observation how much she adores you, and here you\u2019ve only been sending her away. She came home early just to see you, only to learn you\u2019ve married with no warning whatsoever. For the first time in her life, she has a rival for your attention. Of course she resents me.\u201d</p><p>He had the vague understanding that he\u2019d put Amelia in a very awkward situation. The portion of meat he slid onto her plate seemed poor compensation.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered,\u201d she said, testing the lamb with one tine of her fork, \u201cthat Claudia might have hoped to marry you herself?\u201d</p><p>He dropped the carving knife with a clatter. \u201cLord, no. We\u2019re cousins. I\u2019m her guardian. She\u2019s fifteen years old, for God\u2019s sake. Barely more than a child.\u201d He suppressed a shudder. Marry Claudia? The idea made him ill.</p><p>\u201cI know, but ...\u201d She shrugged, cutting into the meat. \u201cSuch matches do happen. And she isn\u2019t unthinkably young. When I became engaged for the first time, I was barely older than she is now.\u201d She took a bite.</p><p>\u201cYou were engaged? To whom?\u201d</p><p>It took her an eternity to chew that damned bit of lamb.</p> <p>Finally, she swallowed. \u201cTo no one you\u2019d know. A wealthy squire, in Gloucestershire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was so old, and ... well, I just couldn\u2019t go through with it.\u201d She poked at her lamb again, looking tense and fragile. Spencer already felt such welling hatred for this Gloucestershire squire, he had no idea how to question her further without ... breaking something. And that wouldn\u2019t do much to assure her of his nonviolent nature.</p><p>Suddenly she said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t care for lamb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. Who doesn\u2019t care for lamb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Amelia sighed. \u201cShe needs your attention. Claudia, I mean. We should make a fuss over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fuss?\u201d Though he was grateful for the sudden change in topic, Spencer wasn\u2019t sure he liked the sound of this. He had a longstanding prejudice against fuss, in all its forms. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpend time with her, to start. Talk to her. Listen to what she has to say. Every girl her age needs a confidante. I\u2019ll try to reach out to her, but that will take time. She needs wider society. If she\u2019s to make her debut in Town, she ought to begin moving in less formal circles now. I don\u2019t suppose we could take her to Bath or Brighton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only just arrived here. My desk has accumulated so many papers in my absence, it resembles a snowdrift. Add to that, it\u2019s stud season and I\u2019ve mares to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. It was only a thought. No travel. A party, then.\u201d She clapped her hands. \u201cI can do a lovely party, and Claudia can help me with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it needn\u2019t be a grand affair. No dancing. We\u2019ll just invite a few good families, with young ladies her age\u2014make it a musicale, perhaps. You did say she plays. That will give her an opportunity to perform in front of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, bringing his fist to the table with a forceful crack. He needed to shut down this discussion, immediately. Braxton Hall\u2014his home and refuge\u2014swarmed with giddy girls and their obsequious relations? His brain spun at the thought. It would be as if Dante had created him an elite tenth circle of hell. \u201cListen. Claudia is my ward. She is my responsibility, and I will deal with her as I see fit. She\u2019s not ready to begin moving in society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought if she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour thoughts aren\u2019t required. Not on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Her eyes fell. She looked utterly conquered.</p><p>Devil, damn, and blast. Spencer picked up his wineglass and drained it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve little appetite tonight. Fatigued from the journey, I suppose.\u201d With quiet precision, she positioned her silver on her plate, then folded her napkin and set it aside. When she rose from her chair, he stood too.</p><p>\u201cWill you show me to my suite?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cOr must I ask a maid for directions? I haven\u2019t learned the trick of these corridors yet.\u201d</p><p>He offered his arm, and together they proceeded in silence. Through the hall, up the stairs, down the passageway toward her rooms. When they\u2019d nearly reached her suite, she pulled up short.</p><p>He halted beside her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019re alone ...\u201d She scanned the empty corridor, then abruptly released his arm and wheeled on him. Her eyes sparked with anger. \u201cYou will not do that to me again. I\u2019ve waited my entire life to be mistress of my own house. As if it wasn\u2019t bad enough to be mistaken for a servant on my arrival, now you would humiliate me in front of the real ones? On my first day in residence? If you\u2019re going to berate and belittle me, at least pay me the courtesy of waiting to do it in private.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to respond. Not verbally, at any rate. His body, however, was responding to her with primal eloquence. His pulse accelerated; blood surged to his groin. At last, here was Amelia again\u2014the bold, spirited woman who provoked him in every possible way.</p><p>\u201cAnd you may not \u2018require\u2019 my thoughts on the matter,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut you\u2019re going to have them. I\u2019ve known since we met how arrogant and self-absorbed you can be, but this is the first time I\u2019ve known you to be stupid. That girl adores you. With the slightest effort on your part, you could make her so happy. Instead, you\u2019re driving her away, devastating her through your own inaction. By the time you deem the relationship worth your effort, it may be too late.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, I could help you. I was once a girl, and I understand how Claudia feels. Now I\u2019m a lady, and I understand how to make a home, welcome guests, care for people who need it. I know you married me solely to get a few children, but if you bothered to look, perhaps you\u2019d see something beyond my breeding potential.\u201d She put a hand to her temple. \u201cYou have no idea what more I could offer you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffer me? You sound like a woman presenting herself for employment. I thought you took offense at the notion of being a paid companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, bristling. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said your very reason for marrying was to protect Claudia\u2019s future. It\u2019s obvious you care deeply for her. When\u2019s the last time you told her so?\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake, he didn\u2019t know. Never?</p><p>He said, \u201cIf it\u2019s so obvious, why should I have to say it? I provide for her material needs and her education. I establish boundaries to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. You\u2019re so generous. You give her everything but your affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s the remedy for everything, tell me again why your brother\u2019s a worthless rogue?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, chest heaving. Moments passed. \u201cAre we going to play cards tonight or not?\u201d</p><p>Nothing she could have said would have stunned him more. Or aroused him further. He looked to the door of her suite. \u201cAre you inviting me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the sitting room. No further.\u201d</p><p>He reached past her and opened the door. \u201cBy all means.\u201d</p><p>She entered and settled herself on a divan. He located a pack of cards in a drawer, then pulled up a table and a chair for himself.</p><p>\u201cWill it be piquet again?\u201d he asked, striving for a bored tone as he split and shuffled the cards.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been pleasantly surprised last night at how quickly her piquet improved. She\u2019d adapted with each successive hand, integrating new points of strategy into her play. With more practice, she might prove a challenging opponent for him. Typically Spencer had to handicap himself by discarding his best cards, just to keep things remotely interesting.</p><p>But if she thought she could best him tonight, she was deluding herself. The only way that could happen is if he purposely lost.</p><p>Perhaps he ought to let her win. At least the first hand.</p><p>As he prepared to deal, she stopped him. \u201cOne round will do tonight, I think. Shall we set the wager now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, surprised anew. \u201cWhat is your forfeit? Four hundred pounds again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour hundred pounds, and you will allow me to plan and host a musicale for Claudia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I win, you will come sit on my lap and undress me to the waist.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. Her wide-eyed gaze seemed to settle on one of his waistcoat buttons. \u201cAnd ... and then what will you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes, as before?\u201d</p><p>He nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Guilt dragged his heartbeat as Spencer dealt the cards. He\u2019d been planning to let her win the first round. Winning had cheered her last night, boosted her confidence. And victory had looked well on her, painting her cheeks a lovely shade of rose pink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t let her win this wager. Opening his home to a bevy of young chits who thought they could sing and play? Being forced to listen to them try? No, he had no desire to host a musicale, but he did want to feel Amelia\u2019s hands on his bare skin. Very much wanted it, with an intensity that concerned him.</p><p>Amelia gathered her cards. Her pale eyebrows drew together as she studied them. Of course, carnal satisfaction wasn\u2019t what she had in mind. She wanted to save her brother and lift Claudia\u2019s spirits, and perhaps her own as well. Bloody hell, she just wanted to be helpful, and he was going to deny her that.</p> <p>He picked up the cards he\u2019d dealt himself. They included three aces and a royal quart. His victory was all but assured.</p><p>Before he could think better of it, Spencer flung the ace of hearts away. There. He would still play to win, but now she at least had a sporting chance.</p><p>As the round progressed, her play was distracted and rash. She made foolish mistakes. Even if Spencer had been trying to lose, he would have had a deuced difficult time of it. In the end, he won handily.</p><p>She clasped her hands in her lap and gave him a reproachful look, as if to say, Well, you blackguard, I hope you\u2019re satisfied.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t. Suddenly the whole game left a bad taste in his mouth. He\u2019d manipulated her last night at the inn, to be sure. But if she hadn\u2019t become a most eager participant in his arms, he never would have let matters go so far. If he\u2019d wanted a fearful, timid lover, he would have taken her on their wedding night.</p> <p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d he said slowly, knowing he would soon regret it, \u201cit\u2019s late, and we\u2019re both tired. We can forget the wager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d She rose from her seat and skirted the table. \u201cLet it never be said that a member of the d\u2019Orsay family does not honor her debts.\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cI believe you\u2019ll have to stand, if I\u2019m to remove your coat.\u201d</p><p>He stood. He was a man, not a saint.</p><p>Beginning at his navel, she ran her hands up his chest, cleaving the sides of his coat from the waistcoat beneath. That brisk, sensible touch, even muffled as it was by several layers of fabric, nearly undid him. Her hands worked over his shoulders, loosening his sleeves. He made his arms straight and pushed them slightly back, and the coat slid off easily. She shook the garment out and carefully laid it aside, so it wouldn\u2019t be wrinkled. He stood waiting impatiently. She could have trampled the thing, and he wouldn\u2019t have cared.</p><p>She attacked his cravat next, pulling the starched linen loose from his neck with sharp tugs. Nimble flicks of her fingertips freed his waistcoat buttons, and soon the carefully folded silk joined his coat.</p><p>Spencer\u2019s breath was ragged. He was painfully hard. There was nothing coy or seductive about the way she was undressing him, but it was undeniably feminine, and powerfully arousing. Hers wasn\u2019t the touch of a lover; it was the possessive, efficient touch of a wife.</p> <p>His wife.</p><p>As she freed his shirt from his trousers with a swift yank, she bobbled a bit on her feet. His hands took her waist. Then they slid over her hips and down, cupping the twin curves of her firm, rounded bottom. He hadn\u2019t bid them to do so, they just did of their own accord.</p><p>With a chiding arch of her brow, she took his hands in hers and removed them forcibly. \u201cNot part of the wager.\u201d Laying her hands flat against his chest, she pressed lightly and added, \u201cBe seated.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed, gladly.</p><p>Hiking the filmy gauze of her skirts, she straddled his lap, just as she had last night. The same as last night, except that much less fabric separated them. He could already feel the heat of her skin burning through that meager excuse for a petticoat.</p><p>His erection throbbed against his trouser fall. Surely she could not fail to notice his aroused state, and virgin or no, she seemed too clever a woman not to understand what it meant. Instead of bringing her pelvis flush with his, however, she sat back toward his knees, denying his aching groin any direct contact. Her hands went to his waist and she gathered the fine lawn of his shirt in trembling fingers, drawing it slowly up.</p><p>As she exposed his bare torso, her tongue darted out to moisten her lips. \u201cLift your arms.\u201d Her words were a husky whisper.</p><p>He obeyed in silence, and she stretched up on her haunches, pulling the shirt over his head. She didn\u2019t fold it this time, but tossed it carelessly aside.</p> <p>His flesh blazed as she surveyed his bare chest. Her breathing was shallow, her throat and bosom prettily flushed. However she\u2019d felt about paying this forfeit a few minutes ago, she was a more than willing participant now. Her obvious desire only multiplied his own.</p><p>Still she sat there, hesitating.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wish,\u201d he scraped out. \u201cDo whatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to cover his. She traced each finger individually and smiled, evidently amused by the way he was clutching the chair\u2019s upholstered armrests. Good. Let her know what she did to him. Yes, Amelia. I\u2019m clinging to restraint by an ever-fraying thread. And if I don\u2019t bed you soon, I may lose my grip on sanity forever.</p><p>Her touch feathered over his wrists and up his forearms, tracing the prominent cords of muscle and sinew. She progressed to his upper arms, pressing her palms flat against the solid swells of his biceps. Just to tease her, he flexed. A little gasp was his reward. Women usually enjoyed exploring the contours of his arms and chest\u2014unlike most gentlemen of his station, he was strong and toned from working the horses.</p><p>She paused, hands balanced on his shoulders. A fresh wave of blood rushed to his groin. As if that part of him needed any further reinforcement.</p><p>Her fingertips swept to the back of his neck. A hot thrill shot to the base of his spine and simmered there. She was repaying him for last night, mimicking his attentions caress for caress\u2014just as he\u2019d hoped she would. It was torture to sit passively and take it, but his inaction was exactly what the situation required. He had to be patient, so patient ... even if it killed him.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his chest.</p><p>Yes. Yes. Touch me there. God, kiss me there.</p><p>He fought the urge to grasp her fingers and direct them, the desire to tangle a hand in her upswept hair and drag her open-mouthed kiss everywhere he craved it. His lips, his neck, his chest, his\u2014</p><p>She leaned in close to whisper in his ear. \u201cYou said last night, you\u2019d been wanting to ... to lick me. To bite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Those carnal words, from her innocent lips ... the image of her neat, delicate teeth closing over his earlobe, her tongue stroking over his skin ... Oh, God. His hips bowed upward, seeking friction to soothe his rampant arousal. His erection brushed ever-so-slightly against her belly\u2014but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough. The light, teasing contact only increased his desperation.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Warm, rhythmic breaths caressed his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting something, too.\u201d</p><p>Sweet heaven. Was it too much to hope that what she\u2019d been wanting required full nudity and a firm mattress? Because he was absolutely ready to oblige. When she hesitated, he couldn\u2019t keep silent any longer. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked into her hair. \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have your word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Every muscle in his body tensed with the effort to keep still. His mind churned with depraved fantasies. What carnal act spun from a virgin\u2019s imagination could possibly make her so abashed? Whatever it was, it was bound to be good. Very, very good.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d she whispered finally. \u201cJust this.\u201d</p><p>Her hands slid over his shoulders and linked behind his neck. She bent her head, and her soft breasts flattened against his chest. Excitement rushed over his skin. Every inch of him anticipated the imminent, exquisite sensation of her kiss.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t kiss him. Instead, she rested her cheek against his collarbone, tucking her face into the curve of his neck. And then she released a deep, full-body sigh and went still.</p><p>Spencer was confused. Had she changed her mind? Perhaps embarrassment had conquered her desire. Damn.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you hold me?\u201d she murmured, nuzzling further into his neck. \u201cPlease? I\u2019m homesick and tired, and it\u2019s been a wretched day.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh, sweet holy infant. What a lust-addled fool he was. She hadn\u2019t shied away from some lascivious fantasy. This was what she wanted. A chaste, comforting embrace. A hug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so very difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cJust put your arms about me. Husbands do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>Damned if he knew how to refuse.</p><p>His arms went around her waist, gathering her close. She was so soft, and so warm, and she all but melted against his bare chest. As some consolation to his frustrated lust, the embrace brought them closer, until her thigh wedged snug against the hard ridge of his arousal. She didn\u2019t startle or squirm away. For his part, Spencer resisted the urge to grind his hips. And so there they sat, hugging. Him in the chair, her on his lap, and the world\u2019s most insistent erection between them. If he\u2019d wanted sweet torture\u2014by the devil, he had it. In trumps.</p><p>The longer he held her, however, the more he became aware of sensations that didn\u2019t originate in his lap. The soft contours of her breasts soothed his pounding heart. Her eyelashes fluttered sweetly against his neck. And she smelled so good. Her enticing perfume blended her usual lavender scent with hints of vanilla and some kind of spice ... was it clove? Perhaps she\u2019d visited the kitchens today.</p><p>He stroked her back, once. Purring, she nestled closer in his lap. An unfamiliar tenderness swelled in his heart. Encouraged, he repeated the touch, skimming his fingers up the delicate ridge of her spine. Up, then down. Slipping the pads of his fingers over each vertebra, as if counting pearls on a string. The slow, steady tempo calmed them both. Their lungs seemed to arrive at some instinctive agreement, and their chests ceased struggling against one another. Instead, they breathed in a rhythm, trading the air back and forth between them. Warm. Fragrant. Intimate.</p><p>More deeply arousing than anything he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cYour parents,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDid they love each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I\u2019m not certain.\u201d</p><p>What a question. He couldn\u2019t recall his mother much, but he remembered his father had wept when she died. They\u2019d wept together, the confused young boy and the hardened soldier. And then they\u2019d never spoken of it again. When he\u2019d learned of his father\u2019s death years later, Spencer hadn\u2019t shed a tear. He\u2019d lashed out with fists instead, because he\u2019d found it too devastating to contemplate weeping alone.</p><p>She said, \u201cMine did. They were devoted to one another. I always thought myself fortunate to have grown up with their example.\u201d She shivered in his arms. \u201cNow I\u2019m not sure. Perhaps it only prepared me for disappointment.\u201d</p><p>He brought her closer, until the heat of her skin seared his chest. That breath they kept trading back and forth\u2014it came more quickly now, and hot. Places inside him were softening, thawing. He recalled her words to him in the corridor: You have no idea what more I could offer you. Oh, he did. He most definitely did. He\u2019d watch his innards removed through his navel before admitting it, but on some fundamental level, he knew why he hadn\u2019t been able to let her go that night. Why he\u2019d bodily removed her from that ballroom; why he\u2019d proposed to her scant hours after that. Because this woman displayed such loyalty to a no-account wastrel of a brother, and he just one of five. Surely somewhere in that boundless reserve, she could find a spare bit of devotion for him. He didn\u2019t deserve it, but he wanted it just the same.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Keeping her hands clasped behind his neck, she lifted her head. She went perfectly, absolutely still in his arms. She seemed to have ceased to breathe.</p><p>He kissed her. Without warning, without permission. Without even deciding to do it, but simply because he couldn\u2019t have done anything else. He needed that breath she was holding. It belonged to him, and he wanted it back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Her lips were warm and soft, her tongue cool and slick against his. Bracketing her face in his hands, he angled her head to deepen the kiss. She squirmed in his lap, but he held her tight, taking more. And then more. Stroking deep with his tongue, clashing teeth against teeth. He had to have this taste, this softness, this heat, and devil take it, he knew he was going to ruin everything by scaring her away, but he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>He slid one hand to her breast and squeezed hard, because part of him wanted to punish her. Inside him, things were cracking and shifting with the deep, bone-shivering howl of ice splintering off from a glacier. Old pockets of emptiness were filling in; new chasms of need split asunder. It hurt. He was being rearranged in deep, forgotten places, and this woman was to blame. He kneaded harder, pinching the tight knot of her nipple, because he wanted her aching, too. It was unforgivable, and so damned unfair. Somehow she\u2019d managed to get inside him before he\u2019d gotten inside of her.</p> <p>She made a startled cry against his mouth, jerking him into consciousness. He froze, breaking the kiss.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d she said, panting. \u201cYou have to let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Struggling against him, she choked on a sob. \u201cSpencer, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I release you, will you come to me tonight?\u201d</p> <p>He felt her head shake before he heard her answer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re still afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more frightened than ever.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a roar of frustration. Damn it, hadn\u2019t he shown her inhuman amounts of restraint? Aside from that little slip just now? How could she sit in his arms like this if she thought him capable of murder?</p><p>Swearing softly, he slid his hands from her body. She couldn\u2019t even meet his gaze. Her eyelashes trembled against her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He closed his eyes and tried to master his breathing. Gripping the armrests so hard his knuckles went numb, he growled out, \u201cGo. Damn it, get off my lap this instant, or I will not be responsible for my actions.\u201d</p> <p>She obeyed in haste, pressing her palms against his thighs for leverage as she rose. His chest sagged with relief as she left him. He leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his knees and letting his head drop into his hands. His own labored breathing was a roar in his ears.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Spencer,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He heard a door latch click, but he didn\u2019t look up. There were three doors leading from this room, and if he knew which one she\u2019d exited through, there was an excellent chance he\u2019d be breaking it down a second later.</p><p>After several moments spent wrestling his own lust into submission, Spencer raised his head. Scrubbing one palm over his face, he blinked at the card table, where their round of piquet remained played out before him. No matter how he stared at the cards, they didn\u2019t make sense. Once he\u2019d handicapped himself by discarding the ace, Amelia had a true chance to win. She\u2019d neglected to reckon her points correctly and played the cards far below her skill level. On impulse, he reached for her discard pile and flipped it over.</p><p>A one-eyed knave winked up at him, and beneath it, two kings.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t possibly have been so stupid as to discard those cards. There was only one way to explain it. She hadn\u2019t even tried to win. All that talk about hosting a party, reaching out to Claudia\u2014what she\u2019d wanted, more than any of it, was simply to be held. By him. And of course, he\u2019d sent her fleeing in fear.</p><p>Emotion caught in his throat, prickly and raw. His patience was exhausted, and he felt shabby as hell. One thing was certain\u2014the next time he took Amelia in his arms ...</p><p>He would not let her go.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>The summer she was twelve years old, Amelia made the grave mistake of screeching at a speckled toad within her brothers\u2019 hearing. Therefore, naturally, her brothers had spent the next month foisting toads upon her. They\u2019d hidden them in her cupboards, her sewing kit, even under her pillow ... Pharaoh was plagued by fewer toads than Amelia shooed from her room that summer. She detested the bulge-eyed animals, but could she do the expedient thing\u2014pick up the toad lurking in her empty chamber pot and merely toss it out the window? No. She had to catch the loathsome lump in her hands, carry it outside in the dead of night, and turn it loose in the garden no worse for wear. Because that was what Amelia did. She was a nurturer. She couldn\u2019t help but take care of creatures, even the vile, unwanted ones.</p><p>Especially the vile, unwanted ones.</p><p>It was perverse and irrational and likely the sign of some severe mental defect\u2014but the further Spencer displayed his gross incompetence as a sensitive human being, the more he engaged her sympathy. The worse he bungled every opportunity to put her at ease, the greater her own desire to soothe. And the longer he kept her at arm\u2019s length\u2014emotionally speaking, at least\u2014the more she yearned to hold him tight.</p><p>When she awoke the next morning alone, staring up at the stamped plaster ceiling, Amelia had to be honest with herself. She\u2019d been delaying consummation in hopes of girding her heart first. But after last night, she knew it to be a hopeless cause. That embrace had stirred her too deeply. True, Spencer had abandoned their chaste hug to press for further liberties, and his lustful aggression should have dispelled her cravings for tenderness. But when he aroused her desire with those demanding kisses and skillful hands, the longing wouldn\u2019t stay put between her legs. It filled her, consumed her. The longer she denied him her body, the more she risked her heart.</p><p>Well, then. That was that. She would go to him today.</p><p>Bolting upright in bed, she threw off her coverlet. She wrapped a light blanket around her shoulders and moved to the edge of the mattress, sending her bare toes down to scout the carpet for her slippers.</p><p>Inwardly, she resolved to banish all craving for romance. And even if that resolve faltered\u2014what was the worst that could happen, really? She would waste a few months\u2019 unrequited affection on him; he would remain indifferent to her. The world had seen graver injustices. Before long, a baby would fill the void. And the sooner she shared Spencer\u2019s bed, the sooner that baby would come along.</p><p>Softly, she padded across the carpet. Now that she\u2019d made the decision, she didn\u2019t want to wait. Nighttime encounters were too personal, too intimate. Surely the act would feel anything but romantic in the bright light of morning. She wouldn\u2019t even bother to brush her hair.</p><p>Putting her muscle into it, she slid open the connecting door to Spencer\u2019s room.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>A woman was. Two women, actually\u2014a pair of chambermaids, briskly making the bed. Each froze instantly, pillow in hand, to gawp at Amelia. Behind them, a curtain fluttered in the open window, silently mocking her surprise.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Your Grace,\u201d the maids said, curtsying briefly before returning to their work.</p><p>Amelia firmed her spine and cleared her throat. \u201cMy husband ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s not here, ma\u2019am. Mr. Fletcher said business took His Grace away early this morning,\u201d said the younger girl. \u201cBefore dawn, even.\u201d</p><p>Crisp linen snapped. The elder maid gave her partner a stern look, but the young girl chattered on. \u201cThe duke\u2019s not expected back until very late, is what I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know that,\u201d Amelia said firmly, even though she\u2019d had no idea. She made a mental note to speak with Mrs. Bodkin about the staff gossiping, and to question why this Mr. Fletcher was having predawn words with a fresh-faced chambermaid. \u201cWhat I meant to say was, my husband\u2019s bed linens should have no starch. Remove those, and start again.\u201d</p><p>She made as graceful an exit as she could, considering the circumstances. At least she managed not to shut her wrapper in the door. It hadn\u2019t been a lie, that bit about the starch. When she\u2019d removed Spencer\u2019s shirt last night, she\u2019d noticed reddened skin at his throat and wrists\u2014no doubt he was sensitive to whatever starch was being used on his collar and cuffs. She\u2019d speak with his valet later about using an alternate preparation.</p><p>If she was going to be mistress of this house, she was going to do it right.</p><p>Since she\u2019d worn her gray silk the evening previous, she was forced to select a frock from her own faded, worn wardrobe today. Even the best of her summer dresses\u2014a striped muslin done up just last year, with sage grosgrain ribbon trim\u2014looked drab here at Braxton Hall. Most un-duchessly.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help matters when Amelia entered the breakfast room to encounter Claudia dressed in a remarkably similar high-waisted striped muslin frock, except hers boasted lace-trimmed flounces. Two of them. She truly was a lovely girl, with the prospects of becoming a great beauty. But she needed someone to gently guide her behavior, and clearly Spencer wasn\u2019t up to the task.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Smiling, Amelia laid a plate of kippers and eggs on the table and prepared to seat herself.</p><p>Claudia stared at the plate, her features contorting in disgust. Before Amelia\u2019s bottom even touched the chair, the girl shot to her feet and made for the door, two lace flounces bobbing pertly in her wake.</p><p>\u201cClaudia, wait.\u201d</p><p>She halted, one hand on the doorjamb.</p><p>Amelia squared her shoulders. \u201cIt may not be my place to say it. But whether you dine with family or strangers, it\u2019s unacceptable to leave the table without excusing yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ill,\u201d she said mulishly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not your place to say it.\u201d</p><p>Amelia sighed. The girl was so ... so fifteen. And desperately in need of a hug. \u201cYou look very well, to my eyes. Won\u2019t you sit down? We need to have a talk. An honest one, woman to woman.\u201d</p><p>Claudia let go the doorjamb and slowly turned. \u201cWhatever about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you resent me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d The girl flushed. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou resent me. Of course you do. I\u2019m a stranger who has invaded your home without warning and taken your late mother\u2019s role. Perhaps the role you wished to one day assume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Claudia blushed as she studied the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fault you for being angry,\u201d Amelia said calmly. \u201cI\u2019d feel the same, were I in your place. And to be perfectly honest, I cannot claim to be any better. If it helps at all, I rather resent you, too.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cYou? Resent me? Whatever have I done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing at all. But you\u2019re young and pretty, and you look better in stripes than I ever have or will.\u201d She smiled gamely. \u201cWhen I look at you, I can\u2019t help but see myself at fifteen, when the world was all marvelous, romantic possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing of me. Don\u2019t speak as if you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. At the moment, I grant that we are little more than strangers. I would like, eventually, to be your friend. But I know that\u2019s too much to expect just yet, given the circumstances. I won\u2019t interfere in your daily routine. I will let you be.\u201d She reached for a tray of jam tarts from the sideboard and extended it. \u201cBut you can\u2019t keep running away from every meal. I insist that you eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou insist that I eat?\u201d The young lady eyed the pastries. Instead of taking one, however, Claudia grasped the entire tray and removed it from Amelia\u2019s hands altogether. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said, stuffing a tart into her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll eat.\u201d Then she and the tray of pastries flounced from the room.</p><p>Well, Amelia would count that as progress. At least the girl would not waste away. Settling down to her own breakfast, she opened her mental recipe book and headed a blank page, \u201cClaudia.\u201d Under that, she noted: \u201cJam tarts. No kippers.\u201d</p><p>As she ate, she wondered where Spencer had gone for the day. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that he had business. After spending some months in Town, surely he must have many estate matters requiring his attention. But wherever he\u2019d gone, she wondered if he was angry with her, after last night. Or disappointed by her. Or yearning for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>She shook herself. The man was busy. He likely wasn\u2019t sparing her a second thought.</p><p>Amelia kept busy, too. She interviewed each member of the staff and acquainted herself with every inch of Braxton Hall\u2014the interior, at least. The gardens would have to wait for another day. As she moved through the rooms with the housekeeper at her side, she made careful note of any fixtures that needed replacing or improvement, any arrangement of furniture that struck her as less than pleasing or efficient. After fifteen years without a mistress, the house was still well maintained but beginning to lag where style was concerned. She limited herself to the public and common rooms, not wanting to encroach on Claudia or Spencer\u2019s privacy.</p> <p>The task took her all day, and well into evening\u2014at which point she was glad that Spencer had not yet returned and Claudia remained cloistered with her tarts, for Amelia had no time to plan dinner. Instead, she and Mrs. Bodkin shared a cold supper as they discussed modernizing the kitchen. Afterward, they began an inventory of all the household silver. Hours later, the entire dining table was covered in gleaming rows of forks, spoons, knives, ladles, tongs ...</p><p>All of which began to rattle in unison, just as the clock\u2019s largest hand neared twelve.</p><p>Amelia grasped the table edge in alarm. Beneath the low clatter of silver, the thunder of hoofbeats swelled.</p><p>\u201cThat will be His Grace,\u201d the housekeeper explained, the corners of her mouth creasing as she suppressed a yawn.</p><p>Spencer. Amelia\u2019s heart kicked into a furious rhythm. Until this second, she hadn\u2019t acknowledged how much she\u2019d been anticipating his return. But she had. She\u2019d been waiting for him all day, every second. Why else would she have spent the day working her fingers to nubs rather than allow herself a stray moment for thought? Why else would she be sitting up counting silver at midnight? And poor Mrs. Bodkin, forced to keep watch with her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re dismissed,\u201d she told the housekeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ll just lock this room overnight and finish in the morning. Thank you so much for your help.\u201d</p><p>Amelia rushed from the room, smoothing her upswept hair and shaking the wrinkles from her skirts. How much time did she have before Spencer would enter the house? Surely he would just hand his horse off to a groom and come inside. Pausing in the corridor to check her reflection in the glass covering the clock face\u2014not much to see, but at least the dim light confirmed her features had not suffered any dramatic rearrangement\u2014she went to the entrance hall and waited.</p><p>And waited. Several minutes passed, and no sign of him. Could he have come in through another door? Perhaps by the kitchens ... he would be hungry, after a long ride.</p><p>She walked toward the rear of the house, crossing into a narrow gallery that connected the main residence with the service wing. It was tiled in marble and lined with windows on both sides, which made it rather cold at night. Amelia hugged herself and quickened her pace. She supposed she might have simply gone up to her suite and awaited Spencer there. But that would mean choosing between her bedchamber and his, and she wanted to meet him on neutral territory. She was going to keep this calm and cool. As emotionless as possible.</p><p>Step one: A smoothly delivered, dispassionate declaration. Your Grace, I thank you for your patience. I\u2019m now ready to consummate the marriage.</p><p>Step two: Lie back and think of Briarbank.</p> <p>Through the blackened gallery windows, a flash of torchlight drew her eye. She halted and turned toward it, walking up to the window and cupping her hands around her eyes to peer into the darkness. Down a gravel-packed lane lined with intermittent lamps sat a low, ranging building with a sloped roof. Golden light emanating from the building\u2019s interior outlined a wide, square door and men moving within. The coach house, she discerned, and stables. Perhaps Spencer had taken the horse in himself.</p><p>Eyes still straining out into the night, Amelia took slow paces sideways. She discovered that toward the far end of the gallery, one of the tall windows was not truly a window at all, but a door. She still had a set of house keys tied at her waist, and she tried each of them in turn until one slender finger of metal turned the tumblers of the lock. The door swung open with a creak, and she walked outside.</p><p>She didn\u2019t follow the drive, but walked straight across the green, not caring to draw attention to herself. The grass was damp with nighttime dew, and it wanted clipping. The blades brushed her exposed ankles as she walked, ticklish and cool. Moths fluttered out of her path.</p><p>The stables drew her like a lodestone. She wanted to see this place that merited so much of Spencer\u2019s effort and attention. It was certainly the largest horse barn she\u2019d ever seen. In construction and outward appearance, it looked finer than most houses she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>A few grooms milled in the entryway, talking to one another. They didn\u2019t notice her as she skirted the main entrance and plunged into the shadows at the side of the building. Barns always had more than one entrance. Before long, she came upon a human-sized door. She ducked inside and found herself in a dimly lit, meticulously kept tack room. The smells of leather and clean horse mingled in air heavy with the dust of hay. Amelia pressed her hands to her face and sneezed into them.</p><p>In the ensuing silence, she froze\u2014waiting for someone to have heard her and come looking. No one did. However, she did hear a voice echoing from the rafters\u2014a low, calming murmur much like the sound of rushing water, coming from somewhere nearby.</p><p>She moved through the tack room and into a wide aisle lined with stalls, taking care to make her steps light. A recumbent horse whickered softly as she stepped toward the low, mesmerizing voice and a flickering light at the far end of the aisle. She paused at the edge of the last stall, well out of the golden aura cast by a single hanging carriage lamp. Cautiously, she craned her neck around the post.</p><p>This was a larger, open area, designed for grooming. And in the center was Spencer, rubbing down a regal dark filly. Amelia observed the pair in silence, digging her fingers into the wooden post to keep her balance.</p> <p>The horse was freed of saddle and bridle, restrained only by a simple halter tied to a ring. Spencer was dressed in an open-necked shirt, knee boots, and breeches of tight-fitting buckskin. Both man and beast were damp in places. Perspiration shone a glossy black on the horse\u2019s flanks, just as it matted the dark locks of hair at Spencer\u2019s nape. The inseams of his breeches were dark with sweat, too. The sight did strange things to her, in analogous places.</p><p>The horse\u2019s breathing was audible, and Spencer rubbed the filly\u2019s withers and back with a towel, wiping the lather from her coat in a smooth, confident rhythm. And as he worked, he spoke. Crooned, really. Amelia could scarcely make out his words, but they were soft and tender. Affectionate.</p><p>\u201cSoftly, then,\u201d he said, coming to stand before the horse and carefully wiping the animal\u2019s nose and ears with a corner of the towel. \u201cHold just a moment, my sweet.\u201d The horse snorted, and Spencer gave an easy, good-natured laugh that resonated in Amelia\u2019s bones.</p><p>He kept up the steady stream of words as he hung the towel on a hook and bent to check each of the horse\u2019s hooves. Each time he asked the horse to raise a hoof, he did so with more patience than Amelia had ever seen him ask a person for anything, with words like, \u201cThis one, if you please,\u201d and \u201cThank you, my pet.\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached. She was seeing an entirely new side of him\u2014a gentle, caring, thoughtful side she would never have guessed he possessed. Having grown up with five brothers, she did understand that paradox about men. They found it easier to display emotions where animals were concerned. Laurent had been her rock at both Mother and Papa\u2019s burials, but when his boyhood sheepdog slipped into permanent rest at the age of fourteen, Amelia had watched her brother weep like a child.</p><p>And seeing Spencer tend the horse with such patience and care, even when he believed himself to be alone\u2014it confirmed what Amelia had known in her heart, from their wedding on: This man could never be capable of murder.</p><p>\u201cNearly done, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He took a brush to the horse\u2019s coat, gently brushing the dirt from her fetlocks and murmuring more tender words. As Amelia watched, a sick feeling gathered in her stomach. She\u2019d known from the first that people came second to horses in the duke\u2019s priorities. After all, that was the entire reason they\u2019d met. He\u2019d all but ruined Jack\u2014and by extension, her own happiness\u2014in pursuit of a stallion. But somehow viewing this scene recast that reality in a new, harsh light. There was no further denying that this man possessed the capacity for real tenderness and solicitude. He just couldn\u2019t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014reveal those things to her.</p><p>Oh, God. Ladies were supposed to become embittered wives when their husbands strayed to other women\u2019s beds. Amelia was going to spend the rest of her life feeling envious of horses. The complete absurdity of it made her tremble.</p><p>She needed to leave, immediately. He would finish grooming his mount soon, and the last thing she wanted was to be caught out here and forced to explain not only her presence, but the tears burning her eyes. She began her slow retreat, feeling her way backward across the tiled brick floor rather than making too much rustle with a turn. But shadows clung to the ground, obscuring her steps, and her slippers were still wet with dew. She slipped.</p><p>Drat, drat, drat.</p><p>Throwing her arms wide, she made a wild grab for the door of a nearby stall. Her fingers closed over the edge, and somehow she stopped her fall before she sprawled completely to the ground. She froze, her pulse pounding in her throat and her spine contorting in ways she\u2019d surely rue tomorrow. At any second, she expected Spencer to round the corner and make her humiliation complete.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. After several moments\u2019 uneventful silence, Amelia struggled to unknot her limbs and regain her feet. For once, luck was on her side. Her wild scrambling had gone unnoticed.</p><p>By Spencer, at least. The same couldn\u2019t be said for the horse whose door she\u2019d borrowed for a crutch. An offended snort came from the darkened stall, and Amelia heard the horse coming to its feet.</p><p>She addressed the animal frantically, making as many mollifying clucks and shushes as her predicament would allow. She didn\u2019t want Spencer to hear the horse, but she didn\u2019t want him to hear her, either. Perhaps she should have simply turned and fled, but her instinct was to quiet the beast first, rather than rouse the whole barn.</p><p>Through the shadows, she could just make out the horse swinging its head from side to side, ears flat and nostrils flared. The beast\u2019s breathing grew heavier. Noisier. Now the horse\u2019s agitation was not only inconvenient, but threatening. This was why she\u2019d never learned to ride. Horses always frightened her. All that intimidating strength, and they never heeded her wishes whatsoever. Just like now.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Amelia pleaded through her teeth. \u201cPlease hush, please.\u201d</p><p>Boom.</p><p>The horse kicked at the bottom of the door, sending a bone-jarring vibration up the rails and through Amelia\u2019s arms. With a startled cry, she released her grip and leapt back, only to collide with an unseen obstacle. She whirled in defense. Strong hands grasped her shoulders and she fought instinctively against them, struggling and lashing out with her fists until reason and the carriage lamp illuminated the obvious. These were Spencer\u2019s hands holding her.</p><p>The ensuing wave of relief dissolved what remained of her strength.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d She sucked in a lungful of air, trying to locate the courage to meet his eyes. \u201cSpencer, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be. What the devil are you doing in here?\u201d He looked her up and down, as he often did, but this time his gaze sought her angles instead of her curves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unharmed,\u201d she told him, hoping that\u2019s what he meant to assess. Behind her, the horse gave another booming kick at its stall, and she jumped in her skin.</p><p>With a rough curse, Spencer released Amelia\u2019s arms. Fairly shoving her out of the way, he went to the door and reached his hand toward the horse. The animal nosed his fingers roughly, as if in reprimand, and stamped the floor. Undeterred, Spencer murmured a steady stream of placating words. Eventually the mare\u2014for Spencer\u2019s soft endearments left no question the horse was female\u2014tossed her head and offered her left side for his touch. He obliged the request, rubbing the horse behind the ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>And Amelia stood there awkwardly, arms crossed over her chest, wondering why it should surprise her in the slightest that when confronted with a frightened mare and frightened wife, Spencer would choose to calm the horse.</p><p>He turned to her and said with cool, even disdain, \u201cWho let you in here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, tell me\u2014\u201d At his harsh tone, the horse started. Spencer paused a moment to calm her again, then made a visible effort to temper his voice before speaking again. \u201cTell me who let you in here,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cWhoever he is, he\u2019s just lost his post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, no one let me in. I came on my own. I entered through the tack room.\u201d The anger in his eyes as he stared at her, juxtaposed with the tender way he still caressed the mare\u2019s ear ... it was just too much. Too insulting, too disheartening.</p><p>\u201cGod, Amelia.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I heard you ride up to the house. I thought you\u2019d be in directly, but then you weren\u2019t. I was tired of waiting and tired in general, and I\u2019ve been wanting to speak with you so I thought ...\u201d She clapped a hand over a sudden burst of laughter. If only he knew what she\u2019d come out here to say.</p> <p>He frowned at her, and she giggled again. Suddenly, the situation was unbearably funny. Her absurd envy for a horse. His unfailing knack for saying the wrong thing on every occasion. The whole dratted marriage.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of you, you insufferable man.\u201d She laughed into her palm, then wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. \u201cAll day long, I\u2019ve been thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>Spencer stared at her, his jaw working as he debated what to say. If he told her he\u2019d been thinking of her all day, too, would it sound trite and insincere? Would it even do the truth justice? To say he\u2019d been merely \u201cthinking\u201d of her seemed inadequate. What was the word for it, when over the course of an endless, wearying, ultimately fruitless day, one\u2019s every act, thought, intent, and breath were directed toward a single purpose\u2014a single person? He supposed he could tell her he\u2019d been \u201cthinking\u201d of her so fiercely all day long that when he\u2019d seen her standing there in the shadows, gripping the door of Juno\u2019s stall, for a moment he\u2019d wondered if his extreme fatigue and longing had conspired to create a hallucination. And that when she\u2019d startled and he\u2019d caught her, and there\u2019d been no further doubt that the soft, trembling flesh beneath his fingers was absolutely real\u2014he hadn\u2019t been sure how to keep touching her without completely losing control.</p><p>But whatever he wished to say, before he could get a word of it out, she turned on her heel and fled.</p><p>Just bloody perfect.</p><p>After wiping his hands and tossing a word or two to the groom at the entry, he hurried after her. She was halfway up the green by the time he caught up. Head down, arms tucked securely around her middle, she made purposeful strides through the grass. The hem of her frock was damp and translucent, tangling about her ankles. The sight made him thirsty.</p> <p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he said, matching her stride for stride. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to visit the stables any time you wish, but don\u2019t ever sneak in alone like that. The mare you startled\u2014she can be dangerous when provoked. Not only does she kick, she bites. She\u2019s taken a few fingers in her day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So that\u2019s the key to earning your affection, is it? Perhaps I should try snapping at you, and then I\u2019d merit better treatment.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve been snapping at me since the night we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. That hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019ve married you, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Her stride hitched. Then she resumed her pace. Then she stopped again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve married me, yes. And when you proposed, you told me you wanted a duchess, not a broodmare. Silly me, to assume the former ranked above the latter in your taxonomy.\u201d</p><p>He bit off his response, because it would only have angered her further. It would doubtless be a very grave error to tell her he found her pronunciation of \u201ctaxonomy\u201d indescribably arousing.</p> <p>Huffing at his silence, she turned and forged on. And now Spencer was beginning to find the entire conversation gratifying.</p><p>She was jealous. Envy was the farthest thing from fear. It implied she wanted more from him, not less. She\u2019d come out to the stables looking for him. By her own admission, she\u2019d been thinking of him all day.</p><p>\u201cFor two people married a total of four days,\u201d he observed, catching up to her again, \u201cwe seem to argue a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting me to apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I rather enjoy it.\u201d And he did. He loved the give-and-take of it, their even match of wits, the responses she provoked from him. She drew him out of his own head and forced him to interact, in a way few people could do. And then there was the lovely pink of her cheeks and the way a defiant posture emphasized her bosom. He enjoyed those things, too. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re just using it as a substitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA substitute? For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what we\u2019re not doing.\u201d He lifted one eyebrow and slid his gaze down her body.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you ever think about? Getting me in a bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLately? Yes. Just about.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a glare that didn\u2019t quite disguise her satisfied blush. He allowed himself to fall behind a few steps, that he might enjoy the brisk sway of her hips as she walked. Perhaps this day hadn\u2019t been so fruitless after all.</p><p>He followed her to the back of the service wing, where she approached the nearest entrance, a small door at the rear. She pulled a key from her chatelaine and fit it in the lock. How did she know the house so well, so quickly? Damn, Spencer had lived at Braxton Hall for almost fifteen years, and he\u2019d never even used this door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked as they navigated a dim, narrow corridor.</p><p>She turned and stared at him. \u201cThe kitchen, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Of course.\u201d Shaking his head, Spencer followed her into the kitchen and watched as Amelia went to a cupboard and pulled out two covered dishes. She set them on the butcher-block counter in the center of the room, then snagged a plate and flatware from a shelf.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked, watching her arrange a single place setting, then pour a large glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are.\u201d</p><p>She whipped the cover from a platter of cold meats. Spencer counted ham, roasted beef, chicken legs, tongue ...</p><p>\u201cNo lamb,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s bread.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the growing buffet before him. \u201cWhat was it you wished to speak with me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d Using the side of her wrist, she brushed back a stray lock of hair.</p><p>\u201cOut in the stables. You said you\u2019d waited up to speak with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will keep until morning. Here\u2019s pickle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, bracing his hands on the wood surface. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it will keep. It was important enough to keep you up late, drive you out of the house in search of me. What was it?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring his question, she plunked a small crock down on the table. \u201cButter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I\u2019m not interested in butter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She took the crock away.</p><p>He thrust a hand through his hair. \u201cDamn it, Amelia. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you treat me like you treat your horses?\u201d</p><p>He could only stare at her.</p><p>Looking a bit embarrassed, she crossed her arms and regarded the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I treat you ...\u201d He shook his head to clear it. \u201cHere\u2019s a thought. Perhaps because you\u2019re not a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. In your view, it would seem I am some lesser creature by far. At least the horses are turned out now and then.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the butter crock again and thunked it down on the table, reaching for a knife. With her other hand, she split open a roll. \u201cNo one eats in this house,\u201d she muttered. She dipped her knife in butter and coated the bread with short, tense strokes. \u201cI may not be a woman of any exceptional accomplishment. Nor do I possess a great deal of beauty or grace. But I\u2019m good at this.\u201d She leveled the knife at him. \u201cPlanning menus, managing a household, entertaining guests. Taking care of people. And you would deny me the chance to do any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t denied you anything.\u201d Good Lord. If anyone was being denied in this marriage, it was him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve denied me everything! I\u2019ve been removed to the country, away from all my family and friends. My meals are spurned, as are my overtures of friendship. I\u2019m not permitted to host guests. You wouldn\u2019t even allow me to make a silly little seat cushion.\u201d She threw the knife down, and it landed with a loud clatter. \u201cWhat does it signify to you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing. The horses are \u2018my dear,\u2019 \u2018my sweet,\u2019 \u2018my pet.\u2019 I\u2019m just Amelia.\u201d She pronounced the name in an exaggerated drawl, mimicking his deep voice.</p><p>Spencer\u2019s chin jerked. She\u2019d overheard him in the stables? How long had she been standing there? The thought of her eavesdropping on him inflamed his irritation.</p><p>\u201cJust Amelia,\u201d he repeated. \u201cVery well, I confess to the egregious offense of addressing you by your Christian name. But with God as my witness, I have never referred to you, in speech or in thought, as \u2018just\u2019 anything.\u201d</p><p>She set her jaw.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish me to address you in endearments, then? Do you truly want to be known as \u2018my dear,\u2019 \u2018my darling,\u2019 \u2018my pet\u2019? I cannot yet truthfully call you my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are right. Insincerely uttered endearments are much worse than none at all. Please forget I ever voiced the complaint.\u201d She took an angry sip of wine. And then another. \u201cI\u2019m tired of arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d Rounding the table, he came to stand directly in front of her. Heat built between their bodies. He took the wineglass from her hand, brushing her hand with his fingertips. Just that simple touch electrified him. God, he was more than taken with her. He was damn near consumed.</p><p>Never breaking eye contact, he drained the remaining wine. As she watched him, her tongue darted out to moisten her lips. Spencer casually set aside the wineglass, and tension all but audibly crackled between them. He thought it might have been the last dregs of his patience, evaporating into the air.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he said darkly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss the alteration in his tone. Anxiety overtook her expression. She blinked furiously, looking everywhere but at him. Reaching for the butter crock, she said, \u201cI should clean up here.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist. \u201cLeave it.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, and the breathy sound stoked his desire. He wanted to make her gasp again. And again. Moan, whimper, call out his name.</p><p>Eyes widening with apprehension, she tugged against his grip. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her into his arms was the work of an instant. Oh, and the gasp she gave that time\u2014it made his blood sizzle.</p><p>\u201cNot without me, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d Amelia protested, even as Spencer carried her swiftly up the stairs, proving he could, quite easily, do this.</p><p>At the top of the staircase, he turned in the direction of her suite.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me your word,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cIf you break it now, I\u2019ll never be able to trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he growled, shouldering open the door to her parlor, \u201cstop pretending you don\u2019t want this, too. You\u2019re so wet for me beneath those skirts, I can taste it from here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Oh, my. If she hadn\u2019t already been damp between her thighs, that little speech would have done it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it like this,\u201d she said, a little less firmly than she\u2019d like. Yes, she\u2019d intended to share his bed, but not in the heat of passion.</p> <p>As he swept her through the door, she cowered into his chest, not wishing to hit her head on the doorjamb. A frantic pulse beat at the apex of her sex, matching the rhythm of his pounding heart. She pressed her cheek to his strong chest, feeling threatened, protected, desired, conquered. Thrilled, in a dozen different ways.</p><p>He carried her through the parlor and antechamber, straight into her bedchamber. Oh, God. He really meant to take her, tonight.</p><p>He stopped short of the bed, dropping her to her feet.</p><p>Dizzy, she reeled on her toes. \u201cI ... I think you should leave.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound of exasperation. \u201cAmelia, turn around.\u201d</p> <p>She turned. And immediately berated herself for it. Why did she obey his arrogant commands so instinctively? He said \u201csit,\u201d she sat. He said \u201cstand,\u201d she stood. He told her to remove her bodice, she stripped herself to the waist faster than a master chef skins an eel. It was a fortunate thing he hadn\u2019t yet ordered her to go to the bed, lift her skirts, and be still.</p><p>A fortunate thing, indeed. Or a considerate one, on his part. Perhaps even a patient, generous, honorable thing?</p><p>Now she was more confused than ever.</p><p>\u201cLook to your right,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you see there, just to the side of the mantel?\u201d</p><p>She raised her hands in bewilderment. \u201cA chair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween the mantel and the chair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d There was a small silver frame hanging there that she didn\u2019t recall seeing before. She took a candle from her dressing table and stepped closer, peering at it hard. \u201cIt\u2019s ...\u201d Oh, goodness. It was her needlework\u2014the little country scene she\u2019d finished the other night-stretched tight and framed under spotless glass. The silver frame complemented the silver threads she\u2019d woven into the brook, and the whole effect was ... even if she did say it herself, it was really quite charming.</p><p>\u201cYou had it framed?\u201d she asked, still staring at the embroidered vignette. \u201cI thought you said you\u2019d never allow it in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it would never adorn a settee in this house.\u201d His voice deepened as he came to stand behind her.</p><p>\u201cBut ... but you took it from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. Because you threatened to make it into a pillow.\u201d He placed both hands on her shoulders. Their weight felt like a reproach. \u201cA pillow, for Christ\u2019s sake. Why should it have to justify its existence by serving some mundane function? It\u2019s lovely. It\u2019s art. In this house, we don\u2019t sit on art. We hang it on the wall and admire it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. Thank you came to her lips, but she wasn\u2019t sure he meant his words as a compliment. In fact, she felt strangely unsettled by them.</p><p>He turned her to face him. \u201cYou are so eager to define yourself in reference to others. Jack\u2019s sister, Claudia\u2019s sponsor, this house\u2019s mistress. You rail at me for not treating you as I would treat one of my horses, my possessions. For not measuring your worth by the food you serve or the musicales you could host.\u201d He gestured impatiently toward the framed embroidery. \u201cFrom the moment we met, you\u2019ve resisted me, provoked me, demanded my respect. Then we arrive at Braxton Hall, and here ... It\u2019s as if you wish to be a settee cushion, and you\u2019re vexed with me for refusing to sit on you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged off his grip on her shoulder. \u201cYou have no right\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I have every right.\u201d He closed the distance between them, taking the candlestick from her hand and placing it atop the mantel. \u201cI\u2019m your lord and your husband, and I have all manner of rights I\u2019ve chosen not to exercise. Yet.\u201d</p><p>That last word gave her chills.</p><p>His hungry, dangerous gaze trapped hers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on behind those pretty blue eyes, but somewhere between those delectable ears and that remarkable brain is a seriously faulty connection, if when I call you \u2018Amelia\u2019 you hear it prefaced with \u2018just.\u2019 Believe me, I could have married \u2018just anyone\u2019 years ago.\u201d</p><p>Did she still have knees? If so, she couldn\u2019t feel them.</p><p>Believe him, he said? Believe that she had pretty eyes and delectable ears and a remarkable brain. Delectable. Her. Believe that a wealthy, attractive duke had held off marriage for years, but something about her\u2014an impoverished, impertinent spinster\u2014had changed his mind overnight.</p><p>Now his words were more than unsettling her. They were threatening everything she believed about herself, and everything she knew about him.</p><p>Which was hardly anything, come to think of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat predictable arrogance,\u201d she said, jabbing her finger in his chest. It was a juvenile gesture, but for some reason she needed to touch him. \u201cWhat utter hypocrisy. You would stand here and ... and analyze my character, pretend to understand all the innermost workings of my mind? This, from the man who lavishes affection on horses, but doesn\u2019t know how to hold a wife.\u201d</p><p>Only a fleeting spark in his eyes betrayed his surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to judge me.\u201d She made a fist and thumped the flat side against his chest. Was that his heart, pounding against it? \u201cDon\u2019t you belittle me for valuing family and friendship and hospitality, simply because you can\u2019t be bothered to care. And how dare you chastise me for seeking ways to be useful, when you\u2019ve brought me here just to give you an heir. You married me for the most mundane function of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, believe me. When we share a bed, it will be anything but mundane.\u201d His hand shot out and captured her chin. \u201cDo you know how I spent my day, Amelia?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Just a little, because he held her jaw fast.</p><p>\u201cWith whores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith ...?\u201d Her voice died in her throat. Oh, Lord.</p><p>\u201cYes, whores. I rose before dawn and rode hard, all the way to London, exhausting three horses on the way. I then spent the entire afternoon turning Whitechapel\u2019s most undistinguished establishments inside out, searching for the prostitute who found Leo\u2019s body. I spoke to whores of every shape and size. Dark ones, fair ones, plump ones, thin ones, ugly ones, pretty ones ... a rare few who were genuine beauties. And for a shilling, any one of them would have cheerfully dropped to her knees or hiked her skirts for me. But I didn\u2019t want any of them. The whole damned day, I thought only of you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes bored into hers. \u201cI thought of you as I rode home, without changing horses in Cambridge as I should have done. I pushed that horse harder than I had any right to do, and yes, she deserved a bit of soothing and apology for it. I never abuse my cattle, but I came damn near to it today. And I didn\u2019t do it because I just wanted a \u2018mundane\u2019 tup, Amelia. I sure as hell didn\u2019t do it because I wanted to come home to roast beef and a nice buttered roll. I did it all just to find that blasted token. So I could show you I\u2019m not a murderer. Earn your trust, convince you there\u2019s nothing to fear.\u201d</p><p>With a bitter chuckle, he released her chin. \u201cAnd the damnedest thing of it is\u2014at this moment, you should be afraid. Terrified.\u201d</p><p>He advanced on her, backing her up until she collided with the wall. The beaded edge of the paneling pressed against her spine. His desirous gaze roamed over her body, turning her firm in places and soft in others.</p><p>\u201cYou should be trembling in your slippers, because I am tired and frustrated and about two heartbeats away from throwing you to the bed, ripping that dress from your body, and making you mine, whether you wish it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He braced his arms against the wall, caging her between them. His heat and scent surrounded her. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d take you right here, never mind the bed.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were dark and wild and hungry, and the intensity in them was enough to make her feel invaded already. Gone was the man who\u2019d kissed her in Laurent\u2019s study with such patient skill. There was nothing of seduction in his manner now\u2014only possession, naked and raw.</p><p>Though she was shivering to the roots of her hair, she forced herself to hold his gaze and remain absolutely still. Until the heat smoldering between their bodies could melt steel.</p><p>At last, her patience was rewarded. He sighed, and the strength tensed in his arms relaxed. It was plain he was exhausted, in both body and mind.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Amelia ...\u201d</p><p>She took that narrow window of opportunity and bolted through it. Ducking under his arm, she darted sideways and ran for the other side of the room.</p><p>With a curse, he lunged at her. Instead of skirting the bed as she had, he vaulted atop it, attempting to cut off her path of retreat. He fell to his knees on the mattress, pitching forward to grab at her as she passed. He caught only a fold of her skirt, and the fabric tore as she wrestled away.</p><p>She hurried toward the connecting door, glancing back to see him sprawled on the bed, clutching a swatch of shredded muslin and glaring pure murder.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, don\u2019t you run from me.\u201d</p><p>Marshaling all her strength, she slid back the panel. The creak of wood was matched by a creak of the mattress as he hastened to rise and give chase. With a little cry of alarm, she scurried through the door and began to slide it closed. Just as the panel was nearly shut, his hand shot into the narrowing gap. But the door\u2019s momentum and Amelia\u2019s desperate energy were too much for him this time. The door banged home, mashing his fingers against the jamb.</p><p>Roaring in pain, he withdrew his hand, and the weight of her body propelled the panel to its resting place. With trembling fingers, Amelia fitted and secured the door\u2019s only latch, locking herself in Spencer\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>Breathing hard, she turned her back to the door and melted against it with relief.</p><p>Bang.</p><p>She jumped. He pounded the door again, and then again.</p><p>\u201cLet me in there,\u201d he demanded, his voice muffled by the thick wood.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to keep me from walking around and entering the other way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve locked that door, too,\u201d she lied, rattling the keys on her chatelaine.</p><p>More muffled curses. Then the loud crash of something breaking against the wall.</p><p>She hugged herself tight, trying to stop trembling. Suddenly, the door panel shifted against her back, as if he\u2019d leaned his weight on the other side.</p><p>And everything went quiet.</p><p>On the outside, at least. Inside Amelia, a whole symphony was playing. Her pulse drummed furiously in her ears. A phantom violist played frantic melodies on the taut strings of her nerves. And in her heart, a chorus of thousands sang. Hallelujah, hosanna, glory be to God on high!</p><p>Spencer wanted her. He really, truly, desperately wanted her. Her, Amelia. She wasn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d a wife to him, a mother for his heirs. He\u2019d said it himself, he could have married \u201cjust anyone\u201d years ago. She was reason enough for a duke to debase himself by crawling through the seediest districts of London. Reason enough for the most horse-mad gentleman she\u2019d ever known to risk the health of a valuable, favored mount.</p><p>She had pretty eyes. And delectable ears. She touched her fingers to her own earlobes, absurdly wishing she had some way to taste them and judge for herself.</p><p>He\u2019d called her an artist. She had a remarkable brain, he\u2019d said. He enjoyed arguing with her. He\u2019d thought of her all day.</p><p>Oh, my. Oh my God.</p><p>She\u2019d waited her whole life to feel this way. Really, truly wanted. Not just nice to have around, or vaguely lusted after, but desired for both her body and her mind. Joy shouted from every corpuscle of her body\u2014and she needed to be alone with it for just a little while longer, or ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Or she would fall in love with him so hard, so fast, she would crash straight through the floor.</p><p>\u201cAmelia?\u201d His voice was very near, and rough with fatigue. She pressed her ear to the door to make it out. He said, \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t like that china shepherdess.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled a wide, secret smile. Quintessential Spencer apology.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bloody tired,\u201d he said, sounding defeated. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep in your bed now.\u201d</p><p>The door didn\u2019t move. So she knew, neither had he.</p><p>Turning her head, Amelia spoke softly\u2014at a volume he could only hear if he was pressing his own ear to the door and listening very hard. \u201cIs your hand all right?\u201d</p><p>Moments passed.</p> <p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a look at it in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn second thought, it may be broken.\u201d</p><p>Smiling again, she ceased leaning against the door and stood under her own power. With a little rattle, the panel shifted as he removed his weight from the other side. She slid back the latch and pushed open the door to find him waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d she said, extending an arm.</p><p>He laid his wounded hand in hers, palm up. His breathing was a slow, seductive rasp as she made her examination. His skin was dry and warm and a little roughened with wear, but each finger wiggled easily. She noted no swelling or blood.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>They stood there in silence, just touching. Both staring at his hand, as if she were a gypsy fortune-teller, peering into his palm to divine the future.</p><p>He said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m not a murderer, Amelia. I know I\u2019ve flattened a man in front of you and behaved like a brute since the night we met. But with God as my witness, I hadn\u2019t raised my hand in violence for fourteen years before our wedding day. I don\u2019t know what the devil you\u2019ve done to me, but you make me lose control. You make me laugh. You make me chatty. You make me hard with a word, or even a look\u2014and there\u2019s damn near nothing I wouldn\u2019t do right now to get inside you. But don\u2019t run from me as if I were a villain, and don\u2019t ever lock me out. I didn\u2019t kill Leo, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, and their gazes tangled. He didn\u2019t even try to mask the vulnerability in his eyes. At last, this was something he needed from her. She was a nurturer, and he didn\u2019t want to be nurtured. She was a care-giver, and he didn\u2019t wish to be looked after. But she had a trusting soul, and he needed this\u2014someone to believe in him.</p><p>It just wasn\u2019t in her to refuse.</p><p>\u201cI know. Oh, Spencer, I know you didn\u2019t.\u201d She lifted his hand, dropping a kiss in the center of his palm before pressing it to her cheek. \u201cIn my heart, I never believed you did.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was afraid. Of getting hurt in other ways. To be truthful, I still am.\u201d</p><p>His thumb stroked her cheek. \u201cI would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can promise me that.\u201d She squeezed his bruised fingers. \u201cBut it makes things a bit more equal, to know that I can hurt you, too.\u201d</p><p>His gaze fell to her lips. He said simply, without any trace of irony, \u201cYou are killing me.\u201d</p><p>He moved through the doorway, taking her into his arms in one swift motion. Together they fell to the bed, and his lips found hers. With no preliminary, he pried her jaw wide, probing her mouth with deep, unrelenting sweeps of his tongue. She clung to him, surrendering to the wild passion of the kiss, her only goal to take from him as much as she gave.</p><p>He lifted his head and stared into her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this.\u201d</p><p>Again, that thrilling little word. We.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo fears tonight. No regrets tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>He sat back on his haunches and pulled her up, until they both stood on their knees in the center of the bed. After fumbling with the row of buttons at her back, he peeled the bodice from her torso, and she helped by wriggling her arms free of the sleeves. He found the laces of her stays and impatiently yanked them loose, casting the entire undergarment aside within seconds and eagerly taking her breasts in his hands, through her thin summer chemise.</p><p>She swallowed hard as he admired them, lifting and kneading the soft globes with his fingers. He seemed lost in those curves\u2014his touch unhurried, his breathing slow and thick. Her nipples grew painfully hard, gathering to tight, prominent peaks that chafed against the thin fabric.</p><p>He eased her neckline down. The gap wasn\u2019t generous enough to afford him access to her nipple. Instead, he bent his head and suckled her straight through her shift. Oh, God. The sensation of his soft tongue licking her through the rough fabric ... it was so intensely pleasurable, she couldn\u2019t help but moan.</p><p>She reached for the hem of his shirt, tugging it free of his waistband and sliding her hands beneath, running her palms over the tight muscles of his abdomen and the faint trail of hair leading to his groin. Emboldened by his gruff sound of approval, she slid her hand downward, cupping the rigid length tenting his breeches.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me what to do,\u201d she said, lightly tracing the shape of him.</p><p>He raised his head from her breast. Seeming to abandon his efforts to undress her, he finished pulling his own shirt loose. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any rules to this. If I do something to you, and you enjoy it\u201d\u2014he yanked his shirt over his head and tossed it aside\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s an excellent chance I\u2019ll enjoy it if you do the same to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Very well.\u201d</p><p>As he reached for the closures of his breeches, she bent forward and took his nipple in her mouth.</p><p>He hissed out his breath, and she jerked back. \u201cNot good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he assured her, sliding a hand over her neck. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>Smiling to herself, she bent and tried again. This time she licked first, teasing the small, flat circle to a tiny bud. He groaned as she fitted her lips around it, suckling gently, then nipping with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cHoly God,\u201d he grit out.</p><p>Heat surged between Amelia\u2019s thighs. She\u2019d never felt so sensual, powerful. With a few swipes of her tongue she\u2019d incited a man to blasphemy, and she cupped the proof of his rampant desire for her in the palm of her hand. As she transferred her attentions to his other nipple, she tentatively stroked up and down his length.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He clapped a hand over hers, pressing her palm firmly to his groin.</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cNot good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo good.\u201d With a pained expression, he pulled her hand away. \u201cI\u2019ve waited much too long for this, for it to be over before it starts. Lie down.\u201d</p><p>She complied, smiling to herself. He said \u201csit,\u201d and she sat. He said \u201cstand,\u201d and she stood. He told her to \u201clie down,\u201d and she lay down ... because at her core, she trusted him instinctively. She always had, from that very first night.</p><p>Kicking her slippers to the floor, she drew the counterpane back before reclining on the pillows. With focused concentration, he divested her of stockings, petticoat, and drawers, until she lay atop the sheets in only her chemise. The dampened cloth clung to her nipples as feverish breaths lifted her chest. He sat at the edge of the bed, wrestling briefly with his boots and then standing just long enough to slide his breeches and smallclothes down over his hips.</p><p>Fully naked now, he straddled her thighs, making no attempt whatsoever to hide his erect member from her view. For about two seconds, a vestige of modesty diverted her gaze elsewhere, but she quickly gave into temptation and stared. His proud, thick shaft jutted out from a nest of black hair, making a dramatic impression against the white lawn of her shift. She had no grounds for comparison, but she found his sheer size and eagerness rather daunting.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be timid.\u201d The hint of amusement in his voice made her blush. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be inside you. You ought to see it first.\u201d He picked up her hand where it lay at her side, whispering, \u201cTouch me.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped her fingers around his shaft, guiding her hand slowly up and down his full length. Petal-soft skin slid with her palm, slipping over thick veins and rock-hard need. This softness, this strength\u2014it would all be inside her soon. Her feminine places ached pleasurably at the thought.</p><p>She stroked him again, and a drop of clear moisture glistened at the tip. Intrigued, she dabbed it with her fingertip.</p><p>His hand tightened, immobilizing hers. \u201cNo more of that.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand away and retreated to grasp the hem of her chemise. Skimming his hands up the slope of her calves, then her thighs, he pushed the fabric to her waist. After pausing briefly to adjust his weight, he hiked the shift higher still, exposing her soft, rounded belly and the swells of her breasts. Fabric wadded beneath her arms. Should she sit up, so he might remove the garment entirely?</p><p>He seemed too impatient to bother. His hands ranged greedily over her body, grasping her breasts, hips, thighs. With one hand, he reached between her legs, parting her sex. She was already damp there, and his fingers slipped easily between her folds. He explored her gently, his breathing growing rough. Growing self-conscious, she found herself wishing he\u2019d at least kiss her while he touched her this way. But then his thumb found that sensitive nub at the crest of her sex, and she just didn\u2019t care anymore. Her back arched, thrusting her breasts upward. With a low moan, he bent and took her nipple in his mouth, sucking firmly as he circled that needy spot with his thumb. He slid a finger inside her, and her intimate muscles clenched around it.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d When he spoke again, his voice shook. \u201cYou\u2019re so tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that bad?\u201d She moaned as he worked his finger in and out, dragging against exquisitely tender flesh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfair. This is going to be damn amazing for me, and damn uncomfortable for you, at best.\u201d He increased the pace of his circular caresses, and her hips jerked with a fierce jolt of pleasure. \u201cCan you come for me? If you come first, it will go easier.\u201d</p><p>What a request. Just like him, to be so straightforward. Could she? Amelia wasn\u2019t sure. She most definitely wanted to. His touch incited unbearable sensation in her, and he drove her closer to the edge with every tiny caress. But there was trusting him, and then there was trusting him. She\u2019d never come for anyone other than herself. It was as though she hovered on the brink of pleasure, but a thin cord of inhibition held her back.</p><p>And then his words began to unravel it.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you come. I\u2019ve been dreaming of it, did you know?\u201d</p><p>No. No, she hadn\u2019t known. She could never have guessed, in a thousand years, that he would be dreaming of that.</p><p>\u201cBoth asleep and awake, I\u2019ve been dreaming of it. What your face will look like. How tight your nipples will get. Exactly what shade of pink you\u2019ll turn, and in precisely which places.\u201d</p><p>Rocked by a fresh surge of pleasure, she let her head roll back and threw her wrist over her eyes.</p><p>He pulled her arm away, while with the other hand he stroked her in a brisk, firm rhythm. \u201cOh, no. Don\u2019t you hide from me. I\u2019m selfish, and I want to see. Right now I ought to sink between your thighs and bring you there with my tongue, but I won\u2019t, because I have to see you when you come for me.\u201d</p><p>She could barely comprehend the carnal picture his words painted, but her body responded to it with enthusiasm. She was so aroused, her body made wet, erotic noises as he plunged his finger into her again and again.</p><p>He had her so close, so close. She whimpered, desperate for release.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>Were there words for it? She couldn\u2019t find them. He\u2019d decimated her vocabulary.</p><p>\u201cSoftly,\u201d she managed. \u201cSoftly.\u201d</p><p>He eased the pressure off his thumb, jiggling it lightly over her swollen bud. \u201cYes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She panted and bucked, biting her lip and grasping handfuls of the bed linens.</p><p>Yes yes yes ... Yes.</p> <p>The last strand of her resistance snapped. She came so fiercely, the climax jolted her hips from the bed. He slid a second finger inside her, doubling the intensity of her peak. The pleasure went on and on, in wave after wave. The last tremors were still rippling through her as he withdrew his hand and positioned himself between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI must have you,\u201d he muttered, forcing her thighs wide and thrusting into her quivering core. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She gasped at the fresh spear of pain mingling with the ebbing wave of pleasure.</p><p>He swore, rooting deeper. \u201cCan\u2019t stop.\u201d Thrust. \u201cToo good.\u201d</p><p>With short digs of his hips, he pushed further and further into her. Her tender flesh ached and stretched. Just when she thought she couldn\u2019t possibly take any more of him, he grasped her backside in both hands, angled her hips, and sank deeper still. Her neck arched as she struggled for breath. She was so full of him, she felt him everywhere.</p> <p>At last fully seated, he rested atop her for a moment, panting against the curve of her neck. The joining hurt, but it also felt indescribably right. She was a woman. She was made for this. She loved the fact that she could take him inside her and hold him there, so tightly, that there was nowhere else on earth he\u2019d rather be.</p><p>\u201cYou put me through hell for this,\u201d he said, punishing her with a sharp nudge against her womb. \u201cAnd I want you to know, it was worth every moment.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and the brief spasm made the pain even worse. But better, at the same time.</p><p>Kissing her quiet, he began to thrust again. Gently now. Her body had adjusted to his, and he moved easily, gliding in and out with smooth, powerful strokes. Within seconds, the act ceased hurting so much and began to feel warm, and quite pleasant indeed. She relaxed her thighs, spreading her legs to take him deeper. Reveling in the weight of his body atop hers, the firmness of his muscled shoulders and arms, the sleekness of his back. As his tempo increased, she ran her hands possessively over the hard angles and planes, even daring to cup the taut, flexing muscles of his buttocks.</p><p>He made a gruff sound, and she sensed a shift in him. Consideration was banished; raw need took its place. He rose up on his knees, lifting her hips from the bed in his strong, sculpted hands. The tendons in his neck stood out like ropes. Her breasts jounced wildly as he pistoned his hips, taking her hard and fast in ruthless pursuit of his own pleasure.</p><p>Now she understood why he\u2019d insisted on watching her peak. Even with his eyes closed, even through the shadows of night ... the look on his face told her he\u2019d rather die than withdraw from her body right now. This was it. This was the very best part. Feeling so desired, so needed. More essential to him than air.</p> <p>He made a rough noise, something between a growl and a moan. And then he collapsed atop her, shuddering and helpless in the throes of his release. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders, smoothing the damp hair from his brow. He made a pillow of her breasts and sighed her name against her skin.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d spoken too soon. Perhaps this was the very best part. Holding him, in every way. Feeling as close as two people could possibly be.</p><p>It didn\u2019t last long enough.</p><p>All too soon, he withdrew from her body. \u201cAre you terribly hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot terribly. I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He rolled over and slumped onto his back. \u201cI failed miserably at that gentleness bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d She eased the fabric of her shift back down over her body. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>With one arm, he drew her close, tucking her body against his. She rested her head on his chest, enthralled by the forceful, distant thumping of his heart. It eventually slowed, as did his breaths.</p> <p>\u201cIt will get better,\u201d he mumbled sleepily. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. It only hurts the once.\u201d His grip on her arm went slack as he drifted into sleep. A gentle snore rumbled through his chest.</p><p>She clutched his waist, shivering despite the heat he radiated. Could he have any idea what she\u2019d just surrendered to him? Not just her body, but her trust, her heart, her future. She would love him soon, if she didn\u2019t already. From this moment forward he possessed the ability to make her indescribably happy, and the power to devastate her completely. He\u2019d revealed to her flashes of true emotion and vulnerability tonight, but then-tonight he\u2019d been at an extreme of frustrated lust. What would the morning bring? She could only cling to a thin cord of optimism and hope that his ... desire, or regard, or whatever he felt for her ... hadn\u2019t been exorcised with the force of his climax.</p><p>You\u2019ll see. It only hurts the once.</p><p>She prayed it was the truth.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Amelia awoke with the first rays of dawn, desperate with need\u2014for the chamber pot.</p><p>That urgent matter resolved, she tiptoed to the wash-stand and quietly washed her face, rinsed her mouth, and brushed out her hair. The knowledge that Spencer lay abed nearby excited her, no matter that he was asleep and oblivious. The mere fact of being in a handsome, virile man\u2019s bedchamber\u2014and of being that handsome, virile man\u2019s lover\u2014gave her a quiet thrill. As she brushed her hair, she imagined he was awake and watching her intently, growing aroused at the undulation of her unbound breasts beneath her shift, and the silhouette of her thighs through the sheer muslin.</p><p>After finishing her toilette, she turned to find him still asleep. However, as she watched, he made a low moan and turned over onto his back. At least the arousal part of her fantasy had been true. The bed linens tangling about his hips outlined an impressive ridge. Just looking at him, recalling the force of his passion last night, her own sex heated and grew damp.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to wake him, not yet. Not while she had his whole suite to herself, and the opportunity to explore.</p><p>Explore she did. Oh, she did not snoop. That would have been low, and demeaning to them both. She didn\u2019t open a single drawer or cupboard. But what lay open to her for observation, she absorbed\u2014thoroughly, and with a certain greed.</p><p>She looked at all the paintings on the walls and she imagined she could tell which ones had been hanging there for generations and which ones Spencer had brought in himself. It was plain to see why he appreciated her embroidered vignette. He favored landscapes-wild, rugged ones in particular. Seascapes, mountain ranges, forests, and vast plains.</p><p>Adjacent to the bedchamber, he had a small room like a study, with a desk he clearly never used. She supposed the library downstairs was his center of business. But there was one side of the room it seemed the maids were forbidden to touch. A generous leather armchair lounged near the hearth, and a low table supported a haphazard pile of sporting newspapers, ledgers, cards, and books. Several books.</p><p>My, but the man had a great many books.</p><p>There were six chambers in all, and in every room there were books. Even the dressing room had a niche of built-in shelves that were likely intended for hats but had been overtaken by books. And none of the volumes were in any order whatsoever. Not that she could discern, at any rate.</p><p>Amelia skipped her fingers over the leather bindings. Several titles were familiar to her, but three times as many were not. Still, she felt among friends. She never would have classified herself a scholar or a bluestocking; she was simply a great reader. A lover of books. And she found ample evidence to suggest that Spencer shared her affection. She found novels, plays, philosophy, several agricultural tomes, the stray scientific treatise, and volume after volume of poetry. Cracks and creases on the spines proved that most of the books had been read, at least once, and the wide variation of subject matter suggested their collector to be in possession of not only a keen mind, but an open one.</p><p>If she\u2019d been aroused earlier, she was desperate for him now. She smiled, wondering what he would say if he knew this worn, jumbled collection of books was such a powerful aphrodisiac.</p><p>She moved noiselessly to the bedchamber and perched on the mattress edge, careful not to disturb his sleep.</p><p>The soft, early morning light was kind to him. He was always handsome, in any lighting, but dawn had a way of illuminating his features evenly without casting those harsh, judgmental shadows on his deep-set eyes and slashing cheekbones. He looked so youthful. The way his eyelashes rested against his cheek\u2014long and thick, as only undeserving men\u2019s eyelashes grew\u2014gave the throbbing pulse of desire a sharp, sweet edge. How had she ever thought this would feel less intimate in the morning?</p><p>Dark stubble covered his jaw and throat. She extended an open hand, flexing her fingers backward as she lowered her palm toward his face, until the sharp bristles just pricked her sensitive skin.</p><p>When he\u2019d turned over, he\u2019d flopped one arm across his belly. The tight ripple of his biceps, the thick cords of sinew on his forearm ... so many lines drew her gaze downward. With a feather-light touch, she traced a prominent vein on his wrist. He stirred, mumbled something incoherent in his sleep, then lay still again.</p><p>A narrow escape, but she couldn\u2019t resist tempting fate once more. His body was so intriguing, so different, so male. Shameless, she drew a single fingertip downward, tracing his hard length through the sheets.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand latched over her wrist. He bolted upright with a start, flipping her back and pinning her to the mattress. Confusion and alarm warred in his eyes as he blinked down at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she gasped, breathless and dizzy from the sudden inversion. \u201cOnly me. Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Oh, please, she prayed. Please let him still want me.</p><p>Recognition softened his face. \u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><p>The way he breathed her name, with such an intoxicating blend of reverence and lust, she wondered why she would ever wish him to call her anything else. No endearment could be uttered with greater tenderness, or to more potent effect. His voice reached places deep inside her, plucked a string connecting her heart to her womb.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, sweeping back the hair that had fallen over his eyes. \u201cYour wife.\u201d</p><p>They stared into one another\u2019s eyes, both breathing hard. Her nipples drew tight beneath her shift, and anticipation coursed through her veins. Releasing his grip on her wrist, he rolled his weight between her legs, spreading her thighs wide. In gentle hands, he cradled her face as his hips pressed home against hers. Pleasure streaked through her, even as she winced.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered, pulling back. \u201cYou\u2019re tender. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>She was wondering how best to convince him otherwise\u2014words or deeds?\u2014when a low rumbling sound demanded her attention. At first she thought it her stomach, or his. They\u2019d both gone to bed hungry in more ways than one. But it grew progressively louder, until it became clear that the noise originated from without their chamber. From without the house, perhaps.</p><p>He noted her distraction. \u201cA carriage in the drive,\u201d he explained. \u201cMost likely a delivery I\u2019m expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to do with the horses, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>In reply, he merely tweaked her ear and rolled to a sitting position. Well, she guessed she was lucky to have held his attention this long.</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to go meet it?\u201d she asked, running a fingertip down his bare back.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t really have to. But I think I should.\u201d</p><p>Before she could protest, he rose from the bed. Nude, he walked across the room and disappeared into his dressing area. Well. Now she was completely at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cAmelia?\u201d he called from the other room.</p><p>She nodded stupidly, then realized he couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. Go into your suite and shut the door.\u201d</p><p>Dismayed, she sat up in bed.</p><p>His head and shoulders poked through the doorframe. \u201cGo. Or I\u2019ll come ravage you like a barbarian again, and I\u2019d rather hoped to accomplish the act with a bit more finesse the next time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>He disappeared again, leaving her wearing a broad grin. She didn\u2019t find the prospect of being ravaged nearly so unpleasant as he seemed to think\u2014but on the promise of finesse, she could be persuaded to take a long, hot bath.</p><p>She rose from bed and crossed to the doorway he\u2019d just exited through. Remaining on the bedchamber side, she leaned one shoulder against the doorjamb and said coyly, \u201cI\u2019ll go ... under one condition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, and what\u2019s that?\u201d His voice deepened, as if muffled by fabric. Perhaps he was pulling on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI want riding lessons.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long moment. The words had surprised even her. She hated horses. Or feared them, more accurately. But after last night, she just couldn\u2019t abide the thought of being locked out of this part of his life forever. She wanted to understand him, which seemed to mean she would need to understand horses, too.</p><p>Suddenly his head and shoulders poked through the doorway again. He had indeed donned a fresh shirt, but his hair was wilder than ever and he still smelled of ... of them. He was close enough to kiss, but Amelia just barely restrained herself. The expression on his face was far too amusing to disturb.</p><p>\u201cDid you say riding lessons?\u201d he said darkly, cocking an eyebrow. His gaze slid down her body.</p> <p>Amelia blushed as she gathered the other, more carnal interpretation of her words. \u201cOn a horse!\u201d she protested, even as her nipples peaked.</p><p>He clutched the doorjamb so hard she thought his fingers might leave dents. \u201cWoman, your chances for finesse are dwindling by the second. Go away. Now.\u201d</p><p>And so she went with a smile. And a sway in her step, because she knew he was watching her leave.</p><p>She went into her suite, shut the door, rang for the maid, and ordered her bath. Then she flopped contentedly on the bed, easing under the blankets to wait for the water to be drawn and heated. Her brain hummed with nervous energy. She found herself wishing she could steal back into Spencer\u2019s chambers and borrow one of his books to distract her mind. Or maybe just to feel close to him.</p><p>Oh, dear. She was already lost.</p><p>When the door swung open a half hour later, Amelia expected to be called to her bath. Instead, a parade of chambermaids entered, each laden with brown-paper-wrapped parcels and hatboxes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d she asked her lady\u2019s maid.</p><p>\u201cYour new wardrobe, Your Grace. Only now arrived from London.\u201d</p><p>This was the delivery?</p><p>Amelia inspected one of the parcels and immediately recognized the lavender ribbon binding. These packages were from the London dressmaker who had fashioned her wedding gown. Spencer must have ordered an entire wardrobe for her, but of course it could not have been completed in one day. It was a small miracle that it had been completed in a week. She surveyed the growing mountain of boxes. They must contain at least a dozen dresses. And if the new gowns were even one fraction as fashionable and lovely as the pearl-gray silk she\u2019d been married in, she likely now qualified as the best-dressed lady in Cambridgeshire.</p><p>Giddiness rose in her as she pulled at the first ribbon bow. She was going to open each package on her own, and she was going to do so slowly. This was better than a lifetime of birthdays.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d An apologetic maid interrupted her little party. She extended a folded note.</p><p>Amelia opened and read it.</p><p>Somewhere in these, you will find a riding habit. Join me in the stables at ten.</p> <p>\u2014S.</p><p>Amelia stared at the note for a long time. His handwriting transfixed her, just as it had the first time she\u2019d seen it, on the parish register they\u2019d signed after exchanging vows. He didn\u2019t follow any of the rules well-bred English children were taught by schoolmasters and governesses. Nevertheless, his writing was eminently legible\u2014also strong, vigorous, unapologetic. Every pen stroke displayed confidence. She found it oddly arousing, then and now.</p><p>But most entrancing of all was a stray mark just before the word \u201cjoin.\u201d As though he\u2019d begun a word, then thought better of it. Amelia studied the diagonal slash, capped with the beginnings of a loop ... to her eye, it looked like an aborted \u201cp.\u201d And even though she knew there were probably ten thousand words in the English language that began with the letter \u201cp,\u201d she could not help but speculate the unthinkable had occurred.</p><p>Spencer had nearly written \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s ready, Your Grace. A bit nervous, as she\u2019s a maiden yet.\u201d With an abrupt whinny, the mare danced sideways. The groom corrected her with a word and a flick of the halter. \u201cShe\u2019s an anxious one.\u201d</p><p>Spencer shook his head. His own cattle were meticulously trained, and it annoyed him no end when gentlemen sent their unprepared horses to his stables. If any animal had a natural instinct to please, it was the horse. An owner failing to secure his horse\u2019s trust and cooperation was, to him, as unfathomable as failing to feed or water the beast.</p><p>He reached out and patted her bay withers, murmuring low. \u201cDid you give the teaser a pass at her?\u201d he asked the groom.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the groom replied. \u201cShe was receptive enough, but reared up when he tried to cover her. We\u2019ll need to hobble her, else she\u2019ll kick.\u201d</p><p>Spencer nodded his assent, moving to scratch the mare behind one dark-tipped ear. Teaser stallions were used to test a mare\u2019s readiness for mating, so as not to fatigue or endanger a valuable stud horse. The teaser would chase her about the paddock, go through the motions of equine courtship, test the mare\u2019s receptivity to being mounted\u2014and then the handlers would pull him back before the deed could be accomplished. It was standard operation for a stud farm, and Spencer had never thought much about it. But this particular morning found him unusually contemplative.</p><p>On the one hand, he wondered if the practice could be detrimental to his stallions\u2019 health or sanity. His own constitution felt remarkably improved, now that he was no longer playing the part of teaser himself. On the other, he felt it as a silent yet stern rebuke, that Amelia\u2019s accusations had been true. He gave more consideration to the comfort of his broodmares than he had his own wife. Remembering the way he\u2019d pounded her against the mattress last night, on their very first time together ... it made him wince with guilt. It also made him semi-hard within seconds.</p><p>He sighed, resolving to turn his thoughts to something else.</p><p>The groom led the mare away, and Spencer leaned against the wall, making a show of kicking the straw from his boots and trying not to look as though he were waiting. The world waited on a duke, not the other way around.</p><p>\u201cSpencer?\u201d</p><p>His boot thunked against the brick-tiled floor. He looked up, and there, framed by the tall, square entryway, was Amelia. Or some new, luminous version of her.</p><p>\u201cYou ...\u201d His voice died as he remembered he just wasn\u2019t the sort of man to blurt out By God, you look lovely in the middle of a horse barn. Or anywhere. He cleared his throat. \u201cYou came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound surprised.\u201d Lifting her eyebrows, she gave him a coy smile. \u201cThank you,\u201d she added, dropping a hand to her skirt. \u201cFor this.\u201d</p><p>Spencer rebuffed her thanks with a wave of his hand. Really, he should be thanking her. He didn\u2019t recall specifying a color for her riding habit, but he couldn\u2019t have possibly chosen better. The dark blue velvet skirt was cut and draped to stunning effect. The jacket was pieced together like mother-of-pearl inlay, angled and sewn so that each panel\u2019s brushed nap caught the light differently, and the result was that Amelia shone. Sparkled, really, like an expertly cut and polished sapphire, offset by the gold filigree curls of her hair, and\u2014</p><p>And bloody hell. When had he started thinking like this? About anything?</p><p>The longer he stood there, staring and not speaking, the further her smile widened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for my first lesson,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Though his lips formed the word easily enough, his boots seemed rather bolted to the floor.</p><p>As she approached him, Spencer realized he\u2019d been utterly wrong\u2014it wasn\u2019t anything about the new dress that made her look so appealing. The allure was all in the way she wore it. The way those curvaceous hips traded her skirts back and forth as she walked. She was cloaked in sensual confidence, and by God, she wore it well.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take this slowly. Of course I don\u2019t intend to put you in a saddle today, not after ...\u201d He cleared his throat again. His face felt hot. God, could he truly be blushing?</p><p>\u201cIs this a bad idea?\u201d she said, looking suddenly self-conscious and unsure. \u201cPerhaps we should wait for another day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s a very good idea. Every lady should know how to handle horses. For her own safety, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>And it was a good idea for other reasons, he admitted to himself. He looked forward to spending time with her, outside of a bed. Showing her this important part of his life, so that she might come to understand what the stud farm meant to him, as well as what it didn\u2019t. Gratifying as it had been to view her jealousy last night, he didn\u2019t wish to awaken to her resentment every morning.</p><p>She craned her neck, surveying the vaulted ceiling. \u201cThis place looks very different in daylight. Would you give me a tour?\u201d</p><p>He released the breath he\u2019d been holding. \u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>He offered his arm, and she took it. They ambled slowly through the stables and outbuildings as Spencer told her of the history of the structure\u2014built by his grandfather, expanded by his uncle, improved yet again by him\u2014and explained the operations of the stud farm. Her comments and questions were few, but they reflected genuine interest and appreciation. No polite \u201cI see\u201ds or disingenuous \u201cHow very interesting\u201ds, but rather \u201cIs this brick locally produced?\u201d (Yes), and \u201cDo you breed your mares every year?\u201d (No), and \u201cHave you foals? Please, may we go see the foals?\u201d</p><p>Well, of course. He should have known to start with the foals. Good Lord, the way she cooed and fawned over the ribby, spindle-legged creatures ... As she crouched in the grass to stroke a white filly through the fence, Spencer considered putting the animal on a ribbon and letting it follow him around Braxton Hall. At least he\u2019d be assured his wife\u2019s warm reception whenever he entered a room.</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d Amelia clapped with delight as the filly made a gangly dash for the far side of the paddock.</p><p>\u201cGoing on three months. And showing off already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful. Can I have her?\u201d She turned and smiled up at him. \u201cFor my riding lessons, can I choose her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cAs a yearling, she\u2019ll fetch a thousand guineas, at least,\u201d he protested. \u201cShe can\u2019t be saddled for a year, and even then she wouldn\u2019t be a safe mount for you. She\u2019s from racing stock, bred for short bursts of reckless speed. Her dam\u2019s last colt won at Newmarket. What you need is a mature, steady gelding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you at least have a pretty one?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cTake your pick, and I\u2019ll have the grooms braid ribbons in his mane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand guineas,\u201d she said thoughtfully, propping one fist on a fencepost. \u201cFor one foal ... Why, this farm must bring in a fortune each year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do well. Well enough that I haven\u2019t raised my tenants\u2019 rents in six years.\u201d Spencer couldn\u2019t keep a hint of pride out of his voice. His uncle had disagreed with him over expanding the stud farm. The late duke had thought the large pastures a waste of good farmland\u2014land that could have been earning rents. Spencer had insisted that the stud farm would more than pay for itself, and time had proven him right. \u201cI also employ a small army of local men, and more than a few farmers make their annual income just supplying our oats and hay. But none of it would be profitable if we didn\u2019t produce the finest racehorses in the country. They don\u2019t admit it aloud at their Jockey Club meetings, but England\u2019s wealthiest racing enthusiasts all bring their custom to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not a member of the Jockey Club yourself? You don\u2019t race any of the horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? You\u2019re a stone\u2019s throw from Newmarket.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNever wanted to. I don\u2019t like attending the races.\u201d When she looked as though she might question him further on the subject, he quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t really need the money. So why do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m good at it. And I enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>She rested her chin on her hand, in an attitude of reflection. \u201cTwo ways of saying the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose they are.\u201d</p><p>As they watched the foals a minute longer, he warmed inside. Somehow he\u2019d known, from the moment she pressed that meticulously embroidered handkerchief into his hands, that she would comprehend this. The deep satisfaction that came from doing something exceptionally well, with both care and skill, regardless of public acclaim. And he understood, suddenly, why she kept angling to plan meals, host guests, nurture everyone around her. These were the things she did well; the things that brought her true enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cAnd Osiris?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re so determined to have him for your own\u2014or at least reduce the number of the club. That\u2019s to protect the superiority of your breeding stock, I assume? If he\u2019s too widely available, the demand for your horses could decrease.\u201d</p><p>He loved how quickly her mind worked. She\u2019d grasped the business rationale instinctively. Spencer often purchased retired racehorses he had no intention of breeding, just so their offspring wouldn\u2019t dilute his own stock\u2019s value. And he gave them an idyllic pension in open pasture, so it worked out well for the horses, too.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201climiting his breeding will be one benefit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not the real reason you want him. That benefit can\u2019t be worth tens of thousands of pounds.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly he realized how far this conversation had strayed, and how it was now on course to collide with some long-held secrets. His body stiffened, as though encased in armor. \u201cHow does this pertain to riding lessons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. But I\u2019m not truly here for the horses. I just want to know you, Spencer. I want to understand.\u201d</p><p>She laid a hand next to his on the fence rail. Her little finger just barely grazed his, but the warmth in that touch went a long way toward melting his resistance. His conscience tore down the rest.</p><p>Long before his uncle died, he\u2019d made a bargain with himself. Yes, he would assume the title and do his duty, but he\u2019d do it on his own terms. To the devil with what people said or thought. He wasn\u2019t going to explain himself to anyone. But cards aside, he had a keen sense of fairness. On their wedding night, he\u2019d demanded her body, her loyalty, her trust. In return, she\u2019d asked only some answers. Now that she\u2019d given him everything so freely, it felt wrong to deny her this.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He offered his arm, and she took it. \u201cI can better explain inside.\u201d Keeping her close, he led her back into the horse barn and down to the farthest end. She tensed against his arm as they neared Juno\u2019s stall, and he knew she was remembering his harsh words to her the night previous.</p><p>\u201cI regret shouting at you,\u201d he said, stopping a few feet from the mare\u2019s stall, \u201cbut I was concerned for your safety. As I\u2019ve said, Juno bites. And kicks, as you saw last night. She doesn\u2019t like new people. Or most people, for that matter.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cShe\u2019s the devil\u2019s own nag, is what she is.\u201d</p><p>Amelia cast a wary glance at the mare, and Juno released a gruff snort, as if in confirmation. \u201cThen why do you keep her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one else would. She\u2019s the first horse I ever bought in this country. My father left me a small legacy, and when I came of age, I took the funds to an auction and came home with this creature. I was young and stupid\u2014made my decision based on pedigree without taking temperament into account. She was four years old and had noble bloodlines and some modest racing success. Thought I\u2019d made a fine bargain. What I didn\u2019t know was that she\u2019d always trotted the line between spirited and flat-out dangerous, depending on her rider, and she\u2019d spent the previous year boarded at some country estate, in the care of an incompetent stable master. She\u2019d been kept tethered in a dank stall, barely groomed, beaten often.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped and drew a deep breath. Even now, he felt the old fury rising in his chest. When he\u2019d mastered his voice, he went on, \u201cBy the time I bought her, her trust in men had been completely destroyed. No one could saddle her. No one could even get near her without risking his fingers. Clearly we\u2019d never be able to breed her. My uncle wanted to put her down, but I wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Amelia stroked his arm in a sympathetic manner.</p><p>\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t so noble as it sounds,\u201d he told her. \u201cPride was my true motive. I\u2019d bought the damned mare, and I didn\u2019t want to lose the investment. Or admit defeat.\u201d Releasing Amelia, he walked forward to offer his hand to Juno. She nosed his fingers with rough affection, then turned her head to offer him her favorite spot under her left ear. She liked to be rubbed there, so he humored her for a bit.</p><p>\u201cI took personal responsibility for her and then turned her out to pasture for a full year,\u201d he said. \u201cMade no attempts to train her, asked nothing of her. I fed her, watered her, groomed her as much as she\u2019d allow. Even once I\u2019d gained her trust, it took a full year of slow training to ride her. With time, I was able to break her to halter, bridle, eventually saddle ... Strangely enough, those rides were what finally improved her disposition. As if that\u2019s what she\u2019d been waiting for, been needing\u2014the chance to carry a rider and gallop across an open park. So I began riding her regularly, and her mood improved. Now it\u2019s our habit. She\u2019ll let the stablehands feed and groom her, but to this day, I\u2019m still the only rider she\u2019ll allow.\u201d</p><p>He looked to Amelia, and she gave him a slight, disarming smile. It occurred to him he\u2019d been talking for an uncharacteristically long time, and she\u2019d been standing there patiently for a long time, too\u2014pointedly silent, unwilling to interrupt until he finished.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting old,\u201d he went on. \u201cToo old to be ridden by anyone, much less a man my size. I\u2019ve always been more weight than she really ought to carry. But if I try tapering off the frequency of our rides, she grows touchy again. Starts refusing to eat, kicks at the stall. I hate to keep riding her, but I\u2019m more concerned about what will happen if I stop altogether.\u201d He rubbed the mare\u2019s withers briskly, then stepped back and folded his arms. \u201cThat\u2019s where Osiris comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOsiris?\u201d she asked, obviously baffled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain.\u201d</p><p>Again, she gave him that patient, friendly silence.</p><p>So he explained, and found it wasn\u2019t so difficult after all. \u201cI\u2019d been trying to learn more about Juno\u2019s early years, to see if there might be something else to calm her, or someone else she once trusted. A groom, a jockey perhaps. It wasn\u2019t easy, so many years after the fact. But I found the farm where she\u2019d been bred to racing age, and the old stable master was pensioned but still living nearby. He remembered her, of course. He told me she\u2019d always been difficult\u2014no surprise\u2014but that in her second year she\u2019d formed a strong bond with an orphaned colt. Horses are much like people, you see. They form friendships and often remember one another, even if parted. We once had a pair of geldings who\u2019d been separated for years, but once they ...\u201d</p><p>He stopped, absorbing the fact that her blue eyes had grown wide as shillings. God, he knew this would sound ridiculous spoken aloud.</p><p>\u201cSo this colt that she bonded with ... it was Osiris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He tapped his heel defensively. \u201cI know it sounds absurd, but it was the only possibility I could think of. Juno\u2019s never socialized well with the other horses here. But I thought if she\u2019d bonded with Osiris in her early years, before the horrific abuse she endured, perhaps she\u2019d warm to him again and have some companionship to ... to soothe her.\u201d</p><p>They stared at one another for a while.</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d She pursed her lips around the drawn-out word. \u201cThis is why you\u2019re pursuing Osiris. You\u2019re willing to spend tens of thousands, rearrange your life, risk the fortunes of others\u2014including my own brother\u2014all so your ill-tempered mare can be reunited with her childhood friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The surprise in her expression suggested she\u2019d been expecting him to protest, but really ... Amelia was a clever woman. She had it pegged. He hadn\u2019t anything else to say.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYes, I put your brother in insurmountable debt just to buy my old, crotchety horse a consort. Make of it what you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll tell you what I make of it.\u201d She closed the distance between them, step by slow, deliberate step. \u201cSpencer ... Philip ... St. Alban ... Dumarque. You\u201d\u2014she jabbed a finger in the center of his chest\u2014\u201care a romantic.\u201d</p><p>The air left his lungs. Damned inconvenient, that\u2014because bloody hell, if ever there was an accusation he needed the breath to refute ...</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are. I\u2019ve seen your bookshelves, and all those stormy paintings. First Waverley, now this ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not romanticism, for God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s ... it\u2019s simple gratitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGratitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis horse saved me, as much as I saved her. I was nineteen, and my father had died. I\u2019d spent my youth bashing about the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly I was here, preparing to inherit a dukedom. I was angry and unfocused and out of my element, and so was this horse, and ... and we tamed one another, somehow. I owe her a debt for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only making it worse, you know.\u201d She smiled. \u201cKeep talking, and I might just deem you a sentimental fool.\u201d</p><p>He was about to object, but then her hand flattened and crept inside his coat. The bronze fringe of her eyelashes fluttered as she leaned forward. Her breasts pressed against his chest, soft velvet on the surface and softer still beneath. Perhaps he should rethink his disavowals. Really, he had no objection to this.</p><p>He put a finger under her chin and tilted her face to his. And then, because it suddenly seemed he should have had a reason to do that, he asked her, \u201cYou know all my names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. From the parish register.\u201d</p><p>He froze, recalling the image of her poised over that register, quill in hand, peering down at it for long, agonizing moments. He\u2019d thought she was having misgivings, and she\u2019d merely been memorizing his name. Some emotion ballooned inside him, hot and dizzying and much too vast for his chest to contain it. And for a moment, Spencer wondered if he just might be a sentimental fool after all.</p><p>\u201cIt was just ...\u201d Her voice broke as he slid his hand along the smooth, delicate flesh of her neck. \u201cYou already knew my middle name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her pulse leapt against his palm.</p><p>Smiling a little, he lowered his lips to hers. \u201cIt\u2019s Claire. Amelia Claire.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the sweetness of this kiss. The softness, the warmth. The soul-shaking beauty of it. He took her mouth tenderly, and her arms slid around his chest under his coat, and ... and oh, God. This was so, so different from any of their kisses since they\u2019d wed. They hadn\u2019t kissed standing up since they\u2019d shared that first incendiary embrace in her brother\u2019s study, and deuce if he knew why not. When they kissed like this, it emphasized how small she was against him. He had to bend his head to reach her lips, shore her up with his arms so his kiss wouldn\u2019t send her stumbling back on her heels. When he held her this way, she felt delicate and breakable in his arms. And he knew Amelia was anything but fragile, but for some loutish, deeply male reason he liked pretending she was. Cradling her tight against him, giving her the heat of his body, inclining his head to cherish her lips with the softest, most tender of kisses ... as though her mouth were a delicate blossom and those dewy pink petals would scatter if he dared breathe too hard. As though he needed to be very, very careful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Because then it became an easy thing to imagine she trusted him. Not only trusted him, but needed him. Relied upon him. He liked imagining that, because he was beginning to worry, in some rogue corner of his mind, that the truth was quite the other way around.</p><p>Then something changed. She stiffened in his arms, breaking the kiss.</p> <p>\u201cOn second thought\u201d\u2014her gaze focused\u2014\u201cperhaps you are merely a fool. Has it occurred to you, that instead of bankrupting my brother in pursuit of this stallion, not to mention enduring suspicions of murder, you might simply be honest with Lord Ashworth and Mr. Bellamy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d he said. \u201cI offered to stop pursuing the remaining tokens if they would let me stable Osiris here. They refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell them your true reasons for wanting him?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. Oh, yes. Because it was his life\u2019s ambition to hear Bellamy and Ashworth deem him a romantic, sentimental fool. \u201cThey won\u2019t give a damn. Why should they do a thing for me, much less an old, maltreated mare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re your friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrecisely what gave you that impression? The part where Bellamy accused me of murder? Or the part where I ground him into the carpet? I took my swings at Ashworth years ago, no need to revisit those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cThe part where I asked if you\u2019d nothing more important in your lives than a silly club and a handful of tokens, and the three of you discovered a sudden fascination with your boots.\u201d Her arms tightened around his waist. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re not friends, not yet. But if you expend the time and effort to make friends with them, they\u2019ll give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mad? They believe I killed Leo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Ashworth doesn\u2019t. And Mr. Bellamy\u2019s investigation will clear your name any day now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not. Amelia, I turned that neighborhood upside down and shook it with vigor. There\u2019s a very real possibility Leo\u2019s killers will never be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will prove yourself and earn their trust. Just give them a chance to know you, the same as you\u2019ve done with me.\u201d Her lips curved in a smile. \u201cMuch as it might pain you to do it, you\u2019d save yourself a great deal of trouble simply by revealing your most deeply buried secret of all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh? And what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek with the back of her hand. \u201cThat against all reports to the contrary, you\u2019re a decent, kind, shockingly likable man. At least ...\u201d She paused. \u201cI know I\u2019m coming to like you, a great deal.\u201d</p><p>What a sweet thing she was. Not innocent or na\u00efve, just ... truly good-hearted. Only the most generous of souls could conceive of such a thing\u2014three men putting aside class, fortune, hatred, and suspicion and becoming the sort of friends who traded heartfelt secrets over port. Even men who weren\u2019t divided by class, fortune, hatred, and suspicion didn\u2019t trade heartfelt secrets over port. That\u2019s what made them men.</p><p>But staring into those clear blue eyes, he almost wished he could make it happen, just for her.</p><p>And suddenly, a thought came to him. The best idea he\u2019d had since proposing to this woman. By God, every once in a while he scared himself with his own brilliance.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but grin with self-satisfaction as he asked, \u201cWould you do me a very great favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me, and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to have a house party. Just a small one,\u201d he added in a rush, before her eager gasp of excitement carried her away. \u201cI\u2019ll invite both Ashworth and Bellamy, and the three of us will hash out this business once and for all.\u201d Not in the way Amelia was envisioning, but she need never know. That part would take place behind closed doors. But to execute his plan, he needed the other men loosened up first. Relaxed, well fed, content, and complacent. \u201cI need a hostess. Do you mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted, and you know it. But only two guests, in such a grand house as Braxton Hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not here. I think it\u2019s best if we meet on neutral ground.\u201d Here was the truly brilliant part. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of renting a summer property. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s a cottage for lease, in Gloucestershire.\u201d</p><p>Gripping his shoulders, she pulled back to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cThe rent\u2019s horribly inflated,\u201d he went on. \u201cFour hundred pounds, for a summer cottage? For that price, it had better not be drafty.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers laced behind his neck. \u201cBriarbank is the loveliest cottage you ever saw. And only the slightest bit drafty.\u201d She launched herself into his arms. \u201cOh, Spencer. You\u2019ll love it there. It\u2019s beautiful country, with the valley and the river. You can take the men angling. May I invite Lily? She told me she\u2019d be returning to Harcliffe Manor, and it\u2019s quite nearby. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be glad for the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d In fact, the idea struck him as fortuitous. If anyone could make that idiot Bellamy see sense, it might be Lily Chatwick.</p><p>\u201cWill Claudia go with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d There was no way he could leave her behind.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Then my dinner table will have equal numbers of ladies and gentlemen. And it will be so good for her. For you both. No one can be unhappy at Briarbank, it simply isn\u2019t possible.\u201d She slid back to the ground. \u201cWhen can we leave?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her impatience. \u201cNot for a few weeks, at least. I\u2019ll need to make arrangements, and so will you, I imagine. And in the meantime\u201d\u2014he stroked her back\u2014\u201cwe\u2019ll be occupied with your riding lessons. It\u2019s three days by carriage to Gloucestershire, and you\u2019ll be miserable if you can\u2019t ride part of the way.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in acquiescence, catching her plump lower lip between her teeth. Oh, how he needed to kiss that mouth.</p><p>But before he could act on the impulse, she kissed him first, throwing her arms around his neck to pull him closer. Her tongue teased his, stoking wild sensations in his blood. Raw lust powered through him, sweeping away any vestige of restraint. Together they stumbled into an unused stall, and he threw an arm out to soften the impact as her back collided with the wall.</p><p>So much for fragility. And tenderness be damned. Her fingernails raked his scalp, and the kiss was barely a kiss anymore, but more a series of hot, gasping clashes of mouth against open mouth. He slid his palms over all her velvet-cloaked curves\u2014breasts, hips, bottom, thighs.</p><p>\u201cAmelia. We shouldn\u2019t begin this if ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she breathed, rolling her hips against his.</p><p>Between the husky promise of her words and the grinding friction of her pelvis, Spencer thought he might spill right then and there. He fisted his hands in her skirts, lifting the folds of velvet above her knee and thrusting his fingers into the flurry of petticoats. She said she wanted him, but he wanted proof. He needed to feel it.</p><p>She sighed, biting her lip as his fingertips grazed her bare inner thigh.</p><p>The devil in him wanted to tease her, draw out the contact inch by torturous inch\u2014but he\u2019d expended his reserve of patience days ago. He cupped her sex in his palm. A low groan escaped him. God, was she ready. Her most feminine places were hot and wet and quivering under his touch, both erotic and innocent.</p><p>But much as he wanted to take her now, he hated to take her here. A sweaty tup against the wall, in a barn reeking of horses\u2014on the second day of their true marriage? He\u2019d planned to make love to her properly the next time, with patience and care. He\u2019d spent the past several days caught up in a haze of his own unrelenting want, and he was beginning to realize, as the fog cleared, that Amelia might have wants of her own.</p><p>\u201cSpencer?\u201d Leaning forward, she licked the underside of his jaw and ground her moist heat against his palm. \u201cLast night, when you threatened to take me against the wall, never mind the bed?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus.</p><p>\u201cCould you do that now?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, if that was what she wanted, he most definitely could. And if she met him halfway with the buttons, they could be under way in seconds.</p><p>\u201cHullo?\u201d A faraway voice echoed through the barn. \u201cHullo there! Amelia, are you in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014?\u201d Her eyes sparked like candles. Her hands instantly flew to her riding habit, redraping the skirts and smoothing the bodice. Craning her neck, she called to the rafters, \u201cYes. We\u2019re just here!\u201d</p><p>What the devil? Spencer jerked around, hastily running one hand through his hair and adjusting his breeches with the other. He knew that voice, but he couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me this is the duchess\u2019s suite.\u201d The voice and accompanying footfalls approached. \u201cMarriages of convenience are all well and good, but I rather expected Morland to provide you finer accommodations than these.\u201d</p><p>Spencer still didn\u2019t know who it was, but whoever it was, he felt like hitting the man. But Amelia ...</p><p>Amelia blushed. And laughed.</p><p>She dashed into the aisle to greet the newcomer, and Spencer followed her. When the owner of the irreverent comments came into view, he instantly understood. Understood that a very promising afternoon had just gone to hell.</p><p>Biting back a groan, he watched his wife embrace her brother.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said warmly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cI must admit,\u201d Amelia said some time later, directing the servant to deposit the tea service on the table, \u201cit\u2019s quite a surprise to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA happy one, I hope,\u201d said Jack, shoving his blond hair back from his face. He shared Amelia\u2019s fair coloring\u2014all her brothers did\u2014but he had a greater share of their mother\u2019s refined features. He\u2019d always been \u201cthe handsome brother,\u201d long before he\u2019d eagerly donned the black-fleece mantle of \u201cthe ne\u2019er-do-well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she replied. \u201cClaudia, would you be so good as to pour?\u201d</p><p>Even Spencer\u2019s ward had made an appearance, obviously curious about the arrival of this impromptu house guest. The young lady accepted the tea-pouring duty with reluctance, but Amelia offered her no reprieve. Claudia needed the practice serving, and Amelia needed to think.</p><p>Why on earth was Jack here?</p><p>Of course she\u2019d hoped he\u2019d come out for a visit. She\u2019d spent the last several months dreaming up methods of removing Jack from his debauched London life. That was why she\u2019d sent him a hasty note the day of her marriage, extending him an open invitation to stay at Braxton Hall whenever he wished. But the very same week?</p><p>\u201cI would have come even sooner, had I known what lovely scenery Cambridgeshire has to offer.\u201d He gave Claudia a dashing smile, and worry twanged in Amelia\u2019s gut. That quintessential Jack grin worked entirely too well on impressionable young ladies.</p><p>It did little for Claudia, however. The girl\u2019s eyes widened a fraction, and then she simply turned her head.</p><p>Good for her.</p><p>Shrugging, Jack reached for a sandwich and bit into it eagerly. \u201cTraveling all night on the mail coach leaves a man devilish hungry. The cooks in those posting inns have nothing to match your skill, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a bit of cold ham. I\u2019ve ordered all your favorites for luncheon, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I knew you would. Even removed to Cambridgeshire, you\u2019re the best sister a fellow could hope to have.\u201d</p><p>As Claudia busied herself with the tea things, Amelia leaned forward and addressed him in a low, confidential tone. \u201cThe duke will join us any moment. Dare I hope this visit means you\u2019ve raised the funds to pay him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that?\u201d He reached for a second sandwich. \u201cThat debt\u2019s been dispatched already. Rents from the cottage, you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Amelia blinked. \u201cYes, of course. That was ... fast.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Spencer mentioned this? She supposed he hadn\u2019t yet received the payment. So much for their country house party. She hated thinking of Briarbank occupied by strangers, but it did lift a weight from her shoulders, to know that Jack was clear of debt. Perhaps that was the reason for this new lightness in his demeanor.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cA few weeks, if you can put up with me. Thought I\u2019d ride over to Cambridge one of these days and see about resuming my studies.\u201d</p><p>Her heart soared into her throat, and she swallowed her tea with difficulty. She couldn\u2019t have dreamed of a better morning. First her conversation with Spencer, where he\u2019d finally begun to reveal to her what a good-hearted, remarkable man he was\u2014if inexplicably determined to hide it from the world. And now Jack\u2019s fortuitous arrival, his intention to reform.</p><p>It was all so perfect. Jack could stay here for several weeks, away from his miscreant friends. Spencer would be such a good influence on him. Perhaps Jack could even live here when he resumed his studies\u2014Cambridge was only a nine-mile ride away. In time, Spencer could find Jack a living somewhere: a nice vicarage, a few hundred pounds a year. It wasn\u2019t much perhaps, but it would be a good life\u2014and as much as the fourth son of impoverished nobility could reasonably expect. With a summer like that, she would scarcely miss Briarbank.</p><p>Brimming with optimism, Amelia nipped a lump of sugar into her tea. \u201cWho did let it, in the end? Briarbank, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, Jack rose to his feet. It took her only a moment to discern why.</p> <p>Spencer stood in the salon entrance, freshly bathed and dressed in immaculate linen and dark, chocolate-brown wool.</p><p>Oh, dear. All the sensual excitement of their encounter in the stables ... it rushed back in the space of a moment. When Jack had arrived, Amelia had carefully banked the fire of her lust\u2014she\u2019d had no choice\u2014but beneath her every motion and every breath, desire had been quietly smoldering all the while. And now Spencer appeared, and he was ... the poker, or the bellows, or the very long straw one used to light tinder\u2014heavens, take any crude male analogy, and it fit. One glance at his tall, strong, handsome figure, and heat washed over her, instantly. Perspiration beaded in inconvenient places\u2014the cleft of her bosom, the backs of her knees, her inner thighs. Even her mouth watered. Her choices seemed to be two: look away, or liquefy. She opted for the former, hoping to spare the silk upholstery of her chair.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Jack made an elegant bow. He did have very pretty manners, when he chose to use them.</p><p>\u201cMr. d\u2019Orsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come now, Morland. Won\u2019t you call me Jack?\u201d Jack took his seat. \u201cWe are brothers now, you know.\u201d</p><p>Amelia risked a glance at Spencer then. His face revealed no pleasure at Jack\u2019s sudden familiarity. His eyes were hard and unforgiving. Magnetic and entrancing. Demanding and arousing.</p> <p>Look away, look away. A good hostess doesn\u2019t salivate.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jack.\u201d He strode into the room and joined their group, dropping his muscled frame onto a slender, straight-backed chair that looked, Amelia worried, rather unequal to the challenge. \u201cLet\u2019s dispense with the pleasantries, then. What is it you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s come for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, has he?\u201d</p><p>Amelia couldn\u2019t fathom the reasons for Spencer\u2019s suddenly cool demeanor. But Jack didn\u2019t seem overly surprised.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Her brother chuckled nervously. \u201cA visit. Fine way to welcome me.\u201d</p><p>Spencer raised his eyebrows in a clear expression of skepticism.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I want to see how you\u2019re treating my sister,\u201d Jack said, his voice growing defensive. \u201cYou took her from us rather quickly, don\u2019t you think? And there\u2019s talk\u201d\u2014he leaned forward\u2014\u201cabout you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat sort of talk?\u201d Claudia asked.</p><p>Everyone froze, surprised by the young lady\u2019s sudden question. By appearances, she\u2019d spent recent minutes arranging lemon slices with tiny silver tongs rather than heeding the conversation.</p><p>\u201cThe usual talk?\u201d Claudia\u2019s dark eyelashes fluttered with interest. \u201cOr something new?\u201d</p><p>Amelia bit her lip, both appalled at Claudia\u2019s rudeness and eager to hear Jack\u2019s answer. Obviously Claudia knew nothing of Leo\u2019s death and the mysterious circumstances surrounding it, but Amelia wondered if Julian Bellamy had been spreading his suspicions through Town. She prayed not. Spencer would be proved innocent eventually, but the stain of scandal was difficult to scrub clean. Rumors of the duke\u2019s involvement in a murder would damage the prospects of all connected with him. Claudia, most of all.</p><p>\u201cClaudia.\u201d Spencer addressed the girl without even looking at her. \u201cLeave us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, leave us. Now.\u201d</p><p>His tone was rapier-sharp, and though Amelia understood his reasons for wanting Claudia gone, she hurt for the girl. No one deserved that sort of dismissal, especially not in front of a guest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear,\u201d she whispered, laying a gentle touch atop Claudia\u2019s wrist. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you at luncheon.\u201d</p><p>Tears gathering in her eyes, Claudia rose from her chair. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As she fled the room, Spencer winced just a little. Amelia filed away a thought for some later date: Give His Grace some lessons on the care and feeding of children. He did well enough with foals, but he was a disaster with young humans. She\u2019d best find a way to work on that, before birthing him a child of his own.</p><p>Oh, heavens. The mere thought of carrying his babe inside her ... Her heart gave a sweet, sudden kick.</p><p>\u201cNow, then.\u201d Spencer braced his elbows on his knees and leaned forward over his linked hands. \u201cLet\u2019s settle this. You\u2019ve come here to see how I\u2019m treating Amelia?\u201d</p><p>Jack fidgeted in his chair. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. The devoted brother who deserted her at a ball without chaperone, transportation, or a coin to her name. Who played high with money he didn\u2019t have, to the detriment of her hopes and prospects. Who failed to appear at her wedding. You ... are questioning my treatment of her. Do I understand this?\u201d</p><p>Jack blinked.</p><p>Spencer turned to her abruptly. \u201cAmelia, how are you being treated? Well enough?\u201d</p><p>After a stunned moment, she replied, \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you have your answer, Jack. The reason for your visit is satisfied. You\u2019ll remain here as my guest tonight, and tomorrow you\u2019ll head back the way you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Amelia blurted out. \u201cWhy, he traveled all night by coach just to get here. I\u2019d hoped he could stay for some weeks. He means to ride over to Cambridge and see about resuming his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d The word was a verdict, not a suggestion. End of discussion. But his gaze trapped hers, and the conversation continued.</p><p>Why? she felt herself silently asking. Why are you retreating to this cold, arrogant behavior, after the lovely morning we just shared? If I truly mean something to you, why can\u2019t you extend the slightest consideration to my kin?</p><p>There were answers there, in his eyes. But she couldn\u2019t quite make them out.</p><p>And then something clattered to the table between them, breaking the silent communication with a sharp, metallic clang.</p><p>Amelia\u2019s eyes flew to the object instinctively, and she gasped at what she saw. A small, roundish disc of brass, stamped with a horse\u2019s head.</p><p>Leo\u2019s missing token.</p><p>\u201cOh my ...\u201d She reached for it in surprise.</p><p>Jack clapped a hand over the coin. \u201cI have what you want, Morland. And I know what it\u2019s worth to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seriously doubt that,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>Enmity sparked between the men, exploding all Amelia\u2019s hopes for a happy, idyllic summer.</p><p>\u201cHowever did you get that token?\u201d she wondered aloud. \u201cThere are investigators searching all London for that scrap of brass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well. The investigators haven\u2019t come asking me.\u201d Jack\u2019s lips quirked in a strange little smile, and a sliver of fear pierced Amelia\u2019s heart. Oh, God. He couldn\u2019t have been involved in Leo\u2019s murder. Not her own brother. No, no, no. It simply couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>No.</p><p>It simply couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>She replayed the events of the evening, slowly filling her lungs with relief. Jack had been with her at the ball all evening. True, he\u2019d departed early, at half-eleven. But Mr. Bellamy and Lord Ashworth had appeared not an hour later, and Leo had already been dead for some time. Jack could not possibly have been involved. Thank God. But the question remained ...</p><p>\u201cHow did you get your hands on that token?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the damnedest thing,\u201d her brother said, speaking to Spencer. \u201cI\u2019d been passing some time with a\u2014\u201d His gaze flicked toward Amelia. \u201cWith an acquaintance, a few days ago. We had cause to exchange a coin or two, and I spied this in her purse. Offered her a guinea for it, and she happily made the exchange.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s stomach turned. This \u201cacquaintance\u201d had to have been the prostitute who found Leo. She knew Jack had been sinking lower and lower ... but this exceeded even her worst imaginings.</p><p>As usual, Spencer didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cSo where\u2019s the whore now? Could you find her again?\u201d</p><p>Jack stammered a bit, rising to his feet. \u201cLook, man. Perhaps we could discuss this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Amelia\u2019s no simpleton. She already knows you\u2019ve been taking her money and throwing it away on dockside bunters.\u201d Spencer stood, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit late to spare her the shame, Jack. If you want to try redeeming yourself, start with information. Where did you find this woman? Where did she take you? What does she look like? What did she tell you about the attack, about Leo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you anything? So you can get to her first and hush her up?\u201d</p><p>The room went very quiet.</p><p>Jack strolled forward. \u201cJulian Bellamy thinks you killed Leo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what Julian Bellamy thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not. But others do. When he talks, the ton listens. And public suspicion like that is hard to live down. Your pretty little ward there\u201d\u2014Jack\u2019s chin jerked toward Claudia\u2019s exit route\u2014\u201cmight suffer for it. As would my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re so concerned for Amelia, you have the evidence to exonerate me right there in your hand. Julian Bellamy thinks I killed Leo to get that token. Obviously, I don\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Jack flipped the coin into the air and caught it in his hand. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s heart plummeted. Of course. He needed money. Though his debt to Spencer was dispatched, he must have landed himself in worse straits now, and he hoped to buy his way clear with that token.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she said, coming forward. \u201cJust tell us what trouble you\u2019re in. There\u2019s no need to extort assistance from the duke. As you say, we are all family now. We can find some way out of your scrape, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not getting a penny from me,\u201d Spencer bit out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me, Morland,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m not a blackmailer. Now that would be low, even for me. Besides, the Stud Club tokens\u201d\u2014he tossed the coin and caught it again\u2014\u201ccan\u2019t be bought or sold. Everyone knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to play you for it,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>Jack nodded.</p><p>\u201cBy God, you truly are an idiot. A prideful, stubborn idiot.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut if you insist ... In my library, then.\u201d</p><p>He walked swiftly from the room, with Jack following after him. Amelia stood there for a moment, stunned. Then she picked up her skirts and gave chase. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said, catching her brother by the sleeve halfway down the corridor. \u201cWhat is it? Are you in debt again?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word. He didn\u2019t have to.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI have access to funds now ... We\u2019ll find some other way. You\u2019ll never win against the duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d He shook off her grip and kept walking. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of chance,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so very exciting.\u201d</p><p>Chance had nothing to do with it. Not against Spencer.</p><p>Abandoning all hope of reasoning with her brother, Amelia charged forward and overtook her husband. At least he had a logical mind, if not compassion. She pulled up short, stopping him in front of the library entrance.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered through her teeth. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does. We both know Jack has no chance to win against you. And he\u2019s clearly in trouble with someone. If he leaves here defeated and upset, he\u2019ll only dig himself deeper still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s mine. And if you ...\u201d Her voice trailed off, leaving the remainder of the sentence unspoken and obvious. If you care for me at all, you won\u2019t do this.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Amelia.\u201d Jack stepped between them. \u201cThis is men\u2019s business. Stop meddling in my life, for once.\u201d</p><p>Before Amelia could even begin to respond\u2014Jack wasn\u2019t there anymore. He was on the carpet, moaning in pain, and Spencer was shaking out his fist.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d She clapped a hand to her cheek and gaped at Spencer. \u201cYou hit him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But not half as hard as I wanted to.\u201d He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cDamn it, d\u2019Orsay. That was barely a punch. Pick yourself up. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>A stunned Jack struggled to his feet, rubbing his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered through rapidly swelling lips.</p><p>\u201cNot to me, you jackass. To Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Staring at the spot of blood on fingertip, Jack swore incoherently, then mumbled, \u201cSolly, Ameeya.\u201d</p><p>Spencer flung open the library door. \u201cNow let\u2019s finish this.\u201d</p> <p>It took all of twenty minutes.</p><p>Amelia waited in the corridor, arms crossed over her chest, pacing in time to the hall clock\u2019s ominous ticks. Dread welled inside her with each passing minute. Surely Spencer could have beaten her brother in the first round, had he wished to. Perhaps he was toying with Jack, the way he\u2019d toyed with her. Drawing him further into the game, building false confidence ... and of course, Jack would not know when to walk away.</p><p>Finally, the door swung open, and Jack emerged. Amelia flew to him, scanning his expression for clues to his state of mind. \u201cWill you be all right?\u201d she asked. No need to ask whether he\u2019d won or lost.</p><p>He stared vacantly at the wainscoting, rubbing his neck with one hand. An impressive bruise bloomed across the left side of his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what will become of me now. I thought ...\u201d He blew out his breath slowly, then turned and gave her a defeated half-smile. \u201cI wish you better luck than mine, Amelia. I fear you\u2019ll need it, married to that man.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek, then strode off down the long, carpeted passageway.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called after him. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving already?\u201d</p><p>He did not break stride to answer\u2014which was, she supposed, an answer in itself.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>He halted, but did not turn around.</p><p>\u201cHave you enough for your fare home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will I see you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he replied, throwing her a cryptic glance over his shoulder. \u201cOr never.\u201d He jammed his hand into a pocket and resumed strolling away. Turning right toward the entrance hall, he disappeared from view.</p><p>Amelia wheeled around and charged straight into the library. \u201cHow could you do that to him? How could you do it to me?\u201d</p><p>With deliberate calm, Spencer closed the drawer he\u2019d been holding open, then stood from his desk chair. The crisp linen of his shirt stretched taut across his shoulders as he rose. He\u2019d removed his coat for the game, evidently.</p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d His eyes went to Leo\u2019s brass token, which lay in the center of the ink blotter. He scooped the coin into his palm. \u201cI couldn\u2019t risk allowing him to leave here with this. God knows where he\u2019d lose it, or what further damage it might cause, should it fall into the wrong hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why take it from him this way? He is in financial straits; you want that token. Why not find a solution beneficial to you both?\u201d</p><p>He gestured toward the door. \u201cYou heard your brother. He didn\u2019t want a price for it. The damn fool wanted to play. Was I supposed to refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! You know better, even if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where you expect your brother to get some sense, if you keep thinking for him.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cPerhaps now he\u2019ll have learnt his lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s learned nothing, except not to visit me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that comes as a disappointment.\u201d He walked out from behind his desk.</p><p>\u201cNot to you, perhaps. It\u2019s a grave disappointment to me.\u201d More than a disappointment. More like devastation. She hated to even think about what would happen once Jack returned to Town.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake. Jack is a no-good wastrel. He takes your money and in return gives you no end of worry. And yet you defend his horrid behavior. You coddle and reward him for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cI continue to love him despite it. And I hold out hope he\u2019ll reform. You needn\u2019t have simply thrown him money. Jack told me he wants to resume his studies at Cambridge. Take orders in the Church.\u201d He hadn\u2019t truly said that last bit, but it was the logical extension. \u201cYou could offer him a living as a vicar, or some other chance to earn back his debts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tenants are my responsibility. You want me to place their spiritual welfare in Jack\u2019s hands? Inconceivable.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t come here with any intention of resuming his studies or taking orders, Amelia. He came for money. He changed his tale the moment I challenged him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe changed his tale the moment you cast him out! Without so much as a word to me, I might add. I thought after this morning, you might begin to see the virtue in engaging your wife in open conversation. We might have at least discussed the matter before you swindled him out of that token and tossed him out on his ear.\u201d</p><p>When his only answer was a gruff sigh, she pressed a fist to her chest. \u201cYou say your tenants are your responsibility. Well, my brothers are mine.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been ten years old when Young William was born. Mama had been so weakened from the birth, it was all she could do to tend the baby. Hugh and Jack were seven and six at the time, and their care fell to her. You must be my little mother, Amelia. Look after the boys. And she\u2019d done her best, ever since.</p><p>\u201cSpencer, please. I\u2019ve already lost Hugh. I can\u2019t lose Jack, too.\u201d</p><p>He came to stand before her. His face was dark with emotion, his posture one of power and strength. His sheer physical nearness roused her body, and she recalled the way he\u2019d tangled his limbs with hers in the stable, kissed her throat, stroked her bare thigh ... Despite her anger, she was a breath away from launching herself into his arms and begging him to hold her, kiss her, pleasure her, care for her.</p><p>Love her, and understand.</p><p>And then he said quietly, \u201cJack is already lost, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>No. Amelia gaped at him, tears burning in her eyes. Marrying Spencer was supposed to mean her brother\u2019s salvation, not his doom. He\u2019d exhaust his fortune for an ill-tempered horse, but he\u2019d write off her brother with a single remark?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you say that,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him. He and Hugh were just a year apart, and such close friends. It\u2019s like a part of Jack died with him, and he keeps trying to fill that emptiness with gaming and drink. You don\u2019t know how he was, before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are blind to the man he is now. I\u2019ve seen this before, in reckless youths with a taste for high stakes and brains starved for good sense. I tell you, he is lost. He may yet find his way back, but only if he discovers the will and strength within himself. Nothing you can do will make him change. You need to snip his leading strings, for both your sakes. No more consoling, no more cajoling. No more money. If you\u2019re not strong enough to cut the ties, I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the ties? With my own flesh and blood?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe that this was the same Spencer she\u2019d conversed with in the stables this morning. He knew how important her family was to her. How could he even suggest this? \u201cOf all the arrogant, unfeeling ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d With a humorless laugh, he unfolded his hand. Between them, the brass token glittered in his palm. \u201cI\u2019m the villain. Jack can show up at this house, drowning in gaming debt, having recovered this coin from a low prostitute. He can impugn my honor, threaten my cousin\u2019s reputation, and insult you to your face\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hit him!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I\u2019m the villain.\u201d He muttered a vicious oath. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a week laboring under wrongheaded suspicions. I\u2019ve exhausted every scrap of patience and consideration, worked day and night to see these accusations proved false. You claimed to believe me, even when my efforts failed. Now Jack appears with the very evidence of my innocence in his pocket, and I\u2019m the deuced villain. Worthless ingrate that he is, he gets your loyalty. He\u2019s the one you defend.\u201d</p><p>The wounded look in his eyes ... God, she felt it twist in her heart. But what could she say? \u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband!\u201d</p><p>The force in his voice sent her stumbling a half-step in retreat. The predatory gleam in his eyes sent her back another two. Her heart drummed furiously in her chest.</p><p>\u201cI am your husband. We exchanged vows, in case you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d He held up the token between his thumb and forefinger as he advanced. \u201cAnd that same night, you made me a pledge. Once this token was found, I would have all of you. You would deny me nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? You\u2019ve just threatened to forcibly separate me from my family. Now you expect me to behave as if nothing has changed? Lie back on the bed like a good, obedient wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d In a rush of strength, he caught her by the waist and swept her backward, until she collided with the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll take you right here, never mind the bed.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her slightly, wedging his legs between hers and supporting her weight with his thighs as one hand dropped to burrow beneath her skirts. She gasped for air as he shoved the heavy velvet up to her waist, too stunned to resist. His fingers found her sex, and she was still wet for him from earlier, still tender from the night before. The sensation was overwhelming. Without preliminary, he pushed two fingers inside her, and her inner muscles cinched around their girth.</p><p>He stilled, breathing just as heavily as she. \u201cYou wanted this.\u201d</p><p>Wanted what? To marry him in the first place? To be taken hard and fast against the wall? To witness the hurt in his eyes and feel that sharp edge of retribution, after the way he\u2019d devastated her just now?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed. Yes, she wanted all of this.</p><p>He withdrew his fingers, and she felt him tugging at the placket of his trousers. He gritted his teeth as he struggled to free himself, supporting her weight and endless wads of velvet with one arm as he worked the buttons with his other hand. Amelia let her own arms dangle at her sides. She didn\u2019t want to help him, but neither did she want to push him away. Despite all her anger and wounded feelings, she still yearned for the pleasure he could give. It was as if her heart had walked out the door with Jack, but her body was still here, mindlessly craving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Once he ceased struggling with the buttons, he grasped her hand in his and pulled it between them, tunneling through all the layers of cloth. He wrapped her fingers around his swollen, rigid length. His skin was hot to the touch, scalding against her palm.</p><p>\u201cShow me you want it.\u201d He tightened his fist until she was sure their combined grip must be hurting him. \u201cGuide me in.\u201d</p> <p>He released her hand, leaving her clutching his manhood between them. He cupped her thighs in his hands and lifted, spreading her legs wide.</p><p>Using the hard, pulsing handle he\u2019d provided her, she pulled him closer. Not down between her folds, where she knew he wanted to be, but where she wanted him. She rubbed his engorged crown against the sensitive place at the top of her cleft. Pleasure rolled through her as she massaged the swollen bud with his hardness and heat.</p><p>He groaned, and his fingers bit into her thighs as he tilted her pelvis. His hips bucked, and he thrust against her, dragging his full length through the moist folds of her sex. She tightened her grip, pulling him away. He\u2019d given her control, and she wouldn\u2019t relinquish it now. This was what she wanted\u2014to grind against his hard length, to rub his velvety heat against her in just the way she liked. She wouldn\u2019t have dreamed lovemaking could be so good when begun in anger instead of tenderness ... but it was. Oh, it was.</p><p>Writhing her hips, she worked herself closer and closer to release. As the sweet tension grew, she released her breath in a low, taunting purr.</p><p>\u201cCurse you.\u201d His hips jerked again. \u201cGuide me in.\u201d</p> <p>And she did. Not because he\u2019d told her to, but because it was what she wanted now. To feel him inside her, filling her, thrusting with helpless abandon.</p><p>She clutched his neck and stared at the ceiling. He gripped her thighs and pressed his face to her throat. There was no more eye contact, and no more conversation. Just a frantic rhythm and building sensation and a climax so sharp, so stunning, her mouth fell open in a silent scream.</p><p>He growled against her shoulder, filling her deep as he reached his own peak.</p><p>And in the aftermath, as he slumped breathless and shaking against her\u2014a miracle occurred. Amelia put her hands on his shoulders. And then she pushed him away. The physical bliss of her climax had nearly split her in two, but her anger and confusion remained intact. She had no foolish desire to hold him, to cradle him close and stroke his hair. No deep, secret wish to hear him murmur words of praise and love in her ear. She\u2019d taken what she wanted from him, and she was satisfied.</p><p>Finally, she\u2019d reached a position of equality with her husband. She\u2019d learned how to give him her body without risking her heart.</p><p>What a cold, bitter triumph it was.</p> <p>Spent and trembling, Spencer withdrew from his wife\u2019s body. His knees locked as he lowered her to the floor.</p><p>She said, \u201cI thought I was promised finesse.\u201d</p><p>Spencer winced. He wasn\u2019t especially proud of that performance. It had been brutish, angry, brief ... and goddamned amazing, which somehow made it worse. \u201cDo I owe you an apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd.\u201d Her eyes were the pale blue of river ice. \u201cWe both enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>He turned aside to straighten his garments, needing to escape her gaze. He\u2019d just enjoyed the most intensely pleasurable sexual experience of his life, with the eager participation of his creative, willing lover. And he felt lower than the carpet fringe.</p><p>Shaking out her skirts, she said, \u201cWhen can I have my money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Had she honestly just asked him for money? As if she were a common whore, lifting her skirts in a darkened alley for a tup against the wall? There was angry but amazing, and then there was ... coarse.</p><p>\u201cAs you\u2019ve just reminded me, we had an agreement when we married. I give you children; you give me security. Those were your words, Spencer. Specifically, you promised me twenty thousand pounds. I\u2019d like to know how soon I can have it. If you refuse to let me see my brother, I\u2019ll help him on my own. I\u2019ll ... I\u2019ll ...\u201d Her words tumbled together, growing increasingly fraught with emotion. \u201cI\u2019ll do something. Perhaps I can send him back to university, or buy him a commission, or just find some place for him away from Town ...\u201d</p> <p>Spencer put a hand to his temple. Her loyalty to Jack was admirable\u2014and the very reason they\u2019d met\u2014but her protective efforts were doing her brother more harm than good. There was no way in hell he was going to hand over thousands of pounds and let her squander it by proxy in London\u2019s seediest brothels and worse. \u201cThe money is held in trust. I can\u2019t just give it to you. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you could make it work that way, if you wished. You\u2019re quite free with your chequebook when it suits you.\u201d She cast a glance at the wall they\u2019d so recently buttressed. \u201cI\u2019m holding up my end of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>Bile rose in his throat, giving his words an acid tinge. \u201cYou\u2019re not with child yet. By that logic, I don\u2019t owe you anything until a son is born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf,\u201d she said numbly. \u201cI want half in advance. Or there\u2019ll be no son at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil has come over you? Holding your favors for payment, as if you were a harlot? This conversation is beneath you, Amelia. It\u2019s beneath us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve driven me to it!\u201d A tear streaked down her face. \u201cDon\u2019t you have the slightest capacity for empathy? Leo was attacked while wandering the same neighborhoods Jack\u2019s frequenting. Jack could so easily have been the one who was killed. I can\u2019t just idly sit by and wait for him to come around. By the time he does, it could be too late. Yes, I would barter my body to save him. I would give my life, if that\u2019s what it took.\u201d Turning away, she buried her face in her hands.</p><p>A rough sigh deflated his chest. He closed the distance between them and slid an arm around her shoulders. She flinched, but he held her tight. He might not have possessed a natural talent for this hugging business, but he\u2019d always been a quick study. He stroked a hand down her spine. \u201cJack doesn\u2019t deserve that kind of devotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho truly does?\u201d She ceased struggling and buried her face in his waistcoat, and he folded both arms around her. \u201cBut you can\u2019t ask me to stop loving him. It isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>He held her as she cried, trying to come to grips with his own painful conclusion\u2014that he couldn\u2019t ask his wife to stop loving her fool of a brother, any more than he could force her to feel the same for him. He let himself imagine, for a treacherous moment, what it would be like to know that Amelia would do anything for him. Give her last worldly possessions, her body ... her life if it came to that. If he were ever so fortunate as to be the recipient of such affection, he damned sure wouldn\u2019t be spurning it to chase idle pleasure in gaming halls.</p><p>All he need do was throw some money at Jack, and he\u2019d be in her good graces again. But the whole cycle would just repeat. Sooner or later\u2014most likely sooner\u2014Jack would resurface, having squandered it all, promising to reform if only they\u2019d give him a little more. And Spencer would be forced to refuse, and Amelia would cry ...</p><p>No amount of reasoning or explanation could change her mind right now. She was too compassionate, too tenderhearted to break the pattern. He had no choice but to be the arrogant, unfeeling villain and do it for her.</p><p>\u201cSpencer, please. If you could just talk to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cThere will be no discussion, Amelia. My decision is made. I cannot, in good sense or good conscience, give your brother any funds. Now that he\u2019s realized that, I think you\u2019ll find Jack will be the one cutting the ties.\u201d</p><p>She cried some more. He would have held her longer, but she pulled away. Instead he just stood there awkwardly, watching her weep. It was a miserable way to pass a quarter hour.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she said finally, hugging her arms across her chest. \u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go to Briarbank. As soon as possible.\u201d At least he could offer her that much consolation\u2014a holiday at her cherished cottage. \u201cNow that Leo\u2019s token is in my possession, it won\u2019t help my cause with Bellamy. More than ever, I need to gather him and Ashworth in one place and talk matters through.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the carpet, and he sensed two factions warring within her: the wish to see her home again, and the desire to rebel.</p><p>Spencer might not yet have the key to her heart, but he did know the five words that would improve her disposition and win her cooperation. The same ones that must have worked for Jack, time and time again. He played that trump card now. \u201cAmelia, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders softened instantly. God, it was so easy, he almost felt guilty about it. She lived to be of service to those around her, to the point that she would deny her own happiness to secure others\u2019. It might be low of him to take advantage, but if it was that or lose her completely ...</p><p>She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. \u201cDidn\u2019t Jack tell you? Briarbank is already let for the summer. You\u2019ll have to rethink your house party plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her brow crinkled. \u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d He sighed. Brilliant. Now he was lying to her. He abhorred deceit, but if he told her the truth now, she would take it all the wrong way. He\u2019d forfeit whatever remaining grain of esteem she might still have for him. \u201cI\u2019ll make them a better offer. Will you still want riding lessons?\u201d</p><p>Will you still want to spend time with me?</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIf we\u2019re to leave as soon as possible, I\u2019ll be too busy.\u201d She looked toward the door. \u201cI should go begin writing letters now.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t move. She just stood there, staring at the door, as if waiting for him to say something. It felt like a test, and he\u2019d spent his boyhood living in terror of just such oral exams. He never knew the right thing to say.</p><p>\u201cAmelia ...\u201d He exhaled slowly. \u201cI still need an heir. But as you ask, I\u2019ll honor our initial agreement. If, once you have borne me a son, you no longer wish to live with me ...\u201d He hated the thought of it, but at least he had the better part of a year to change her mind. \u201cI will release the entirety of your trust and provide you with a completely separate home.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip trembled. Then thinned. Then folded under her teeth and all but disappeared.</p><p>Wrong thing. Wrong thing to say, completely. Devil, damn, blast.</p><p>For midday in summer, the air in the room took on an odd chill.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, avoiding his eyes. \u201cThat was our agreement, wasn\u2019t it? I should never have expected more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just ...\u201d Damn it, how had this past hour gone so wrong? This morning, they\u2019d been on the cusp of something wonderful. Closeness. Friendship. Intimacy. Now there was a wall between them. \u201cAmelia, I just want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I shall be.\u201d Lifting her chin, she smoothed her palms down her stomach and hips. \u201cI am going to Briarbank, and I have a house party to host. Of course, I will choose to be happy.\u201d Her cheeks tightened with a forced smile as she headed for the door. \u201cWell. Now that\u2019s settled. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I have dinner to plan.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The weeks passed quickly, once Amelia fell into a routine. She spent the majority of her day with Mrs. Bodkin, attending to matters of the household. In the afternoon, she took some time for correspondence, making arrangements for their journey and their stay at Briarbank. Sometimes she found a stray hour or two for a walk through Braxton Hall\u2019s park or gardens.</p><p>By night, she went to Spencer\u2019s bed. They did not talk a great deal there, and almost never otherwise. It was all very much as a marriage of convenience should be. There were no more cards, no more discussions of books. No more arguments, and no more dangerous emotions. Just separate days, and temperate bedding, and polite distance. With every day of relative silence that passed, the number of things left unsaid grew\u2014until that heap of unspoken remarks made a formidable wall of protection around Amelia\u2019s heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>And she needed to protect her heart, or what pieces of it remained. For one passionate night and perfect morning, she\u2019d made the mistake of surrendering it to Spencer, and he\u2019d stomped it to bits. If he cared anything for her, how could he cut her off from her own brother? She couldn\u2019t begin to understand it, and Spencer showed no willingness to explain.</p><p>So silence it was.</p> <p>Claudia remained aloof, as ever. Her presence at meals was unpredictable, as was her mood at any given moment. She rebuffed every one of Amelia\u2019s attempts at friendship, and eventually Amelia ceased making them. The girl would doubtless come around in time, but in the interim, a duchess had more pressing matters demanding her attention. Such as writing invitations to her guests, and sending servants ahead to Briarbank with supply ledgers and lists of cleaning tasks and heaps of crisp linens.</p><p>She was so busy, the appointed date for their departure arrived before she expected it. Rather than take the longer route through London, Spencer had decided they would travel directly west, to Oxford and then Gloucester. But the roads were smaller and poorer, which made for slow and nauseating travel. Both Amelia and Claudia spent their time jouncing about the coach and trading the basin between them.</p><p>As they crossed into Oxfordshire on the third morning, Amelia perked up. She\u2019d written to her second cousin, now styled Lady Grantham, and arranged for the party to break their journey at Grantham Lodge. Amelia had never been particularly close to Venetia, nor even particularly fond of her. But she did keep a lovely home in Town and had a rapacious taste for the society of nobility, so Amelia had hopes for warm hospitality.</p><p>The sun was still high in the sky when Grantham Lodge came into view. It was a friendly looking manor house, quite modern in its architecture. The shallow reflecting pool before the house provided a mirror image of the white fa\u00e7ade and its many glazed windows. A swan or two paddled idly about. Sir Russell must be doing rather well for himself, Amelia mused. But then, the Granthams had always been an ambitious couple.</p><p>The carriages rolled to a halt in the drive. When she and Claudia alighted, Sir Russell and Lady Grantham were waiting to greet them. Venetia wore apricot silk and that same strange, thin smile Amelia remembered. Her cousin had elaborate theories about too-wide smiles causing premature wrinkles. Amelia thought she would rather look wrinkled and happy than smooth-skinned and camphorized.</p> <p>\u201cAmelia, dear child. It\u2019s been far too long.\u201d</p><p>It had barely been two months by Amelia\u2019s counting, but she embraced her cousin and accepted a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d the lady gasped and gave a little laugh. \u201cBut I must call you Your Grace now, mustn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Amelia assured her. \u201cWe are family.\u201d Internally, though, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Lady Grantham\u2019s slip were truly an accident. Was she destined never to be recognized as a duchess? Always taken for some impoverished relation or lady\u2019s maid?</p><p>She introduced Claudia, whose ill pallor provided a convenient excuse for her usual withdrawn demeanor. Soon Spencer joined the group, having dismounted and passed his reins to a waiting groom.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Lady Grantham said, dropping a graceful curtsy. \u201cWe are honored to welcome you to Grantham Lodge.\u201d</p> <p>No one ever mistook Spencer for anything less than a duke. Well, and why would they? He looked magnificent, as always. Tall, handsome, noble, perfect, and only improved by a day spent in the sun. He acquitted himself as well as could be expected in the introductions, which was to say he nodded curtly and refrained from making any outright rude remarks.</p><p>\u201cDo come inside.\u201d Sir Russell\u2019s waistcoat could barely contain his excitement as he made a beneficent sweep of his arm.</p><p>Venetia cozied up to Amelia, taking her arm as they followed the men toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you, my dear. When we heard of your marriage, we were so disappointed to have missed the chance to celebrate. And I knew you must have been disappointed as well, long as you\u2019ve waited. But now you are here, and everyone is so excited to welcome you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d Amelia asked, as they breached the entrance hall.</p><p>Lady Grantham made an expansive gesture by way of a reply, and Amelia looked around her to see ...</p><p>Everyone.</p><p>Or at least, the better part of the population of Oxfordshire.</p><p>Applause broke out amongst the assembled guests, mingled with cheers. Good heavens, there were dozens of them. A few Amelia recognized as relations or old acquaintances, but the majority she assumed to be the neighborhood gentry, all drawn by the promise of a newlywed duke and duchess.</p> <p>She caught Claudia\u2019s eye. The girl swallowed hard, looking positively ill.</p><p>Spencer blinked disdainfully at the crowd, which was typical Spencer behavior.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d Venetia whispered, gripping her arm. \u201cI know you were cheated out of an engagement ball or a proper wedding breakfast, but never despair. Lady Grantham is here to put matters to rights. We\u2019ve a whole evening planned. Dinner, music, dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow ... how very kind of you,\u201d Amelia said, allowing her cousin to draw her to the center of the room, but at the same time trying to keep Claudia close. The girl needed protection from this horde.</p><p>\u201cCome now, you must meet everyone,\u201d Venetia said. \u201cIt will take the footmen some time to bring in your trunks, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Amelia saw Sir Russell give Spencer a hearty slap on the back, propelling him forward into the crowd. The introductions began. And went on. And went on. Amelia pasted a polite smile on her face and warmly greeted each old and new acquaintance. She kept a watchful eye on Spencer, who clearly did not appreciate Sir Russell\u2019s bold familiarity. Amelia couldn\u2019t make out their words in the din of conversation, but by appearances, Spencer was about as happy to greet the assembled guests as he would be to devour their hats and bonnets, plumes and all. Amelia sighed. She knew this sort of gathering didn\u2019t appeal to him, but couldn\u2019t he at least make the pretense of etiquette?</p><p>Lady Grantham took her arm again to steer her toward another group of waiting ladies. Craning her neck to keep watching Spencer, Amelia looked on as a tall, elderly man smiled and nodded through Sir Russell\u2019s fulsome introduction, then made a sweeping, elegant bow as was once the style at Court. While the man was still doubled over his extended calf, Spencer turned on his heel and quit the room.</p><p>Oh, now Amelia was incensed. Had he truly just cut that elderly gentleman, mid-bow? Without very good reason, such a move was the height of rudeness. And here they were guests in her cousins\u2019 home ... His complete disregard for her relations was insupportable.</p><p>A murmur of dismay made a small ripple through the assembled guests, only increasing Amelia\u2019s mortification.</p><p>\u201cLady Grantham,\u201d she said, \u201cwill you please forgive me? I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s an important parcel amongst my things that requires very special attention. I meant to mention it to the footman, but it slipped my mind. I\u2019ll just go out and see to it, and then I\u2019ll return in a moment.\u201d Before the lady could object, Amelia pulled away. \u201cWon\u2019t you introduce Claudia to your daughter Beatrice? She\u2019s fifteen and eager for new friends.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Claudia in the hands of her cousin, Amelia hurried out the door the way Spencer had left. Not seeing him immediately, she turned left and followed the drive that led toward the coach house and stables. No doubt he\u2019d spurned human company to look after the horses again.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t gone but twenty paces before a harsh, choked cough drew her eye to a side garden. Surprised, Amelia walked toward the sound, passing through a shaded arbor.</p><p>What she found astonished her.</p><p>\u201cSpencer, is that you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Christ. He knew he should have gone farther from the house.</p><p>He tugged fiercely at his cravat, pulling the cloth loose from his neck. He cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just needed some air,\u201d he said, striving for a calm, collected tone. \u201cBloody hot in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t think it warm at all.\u201d Her voice was crisp. \u201cIf there was anything intolerable in the room, it was your attitude.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head in his hands and exhaled slowly, trying to subdue the pounding in his chest. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me they would be having a goddamn party, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d He hated the accusation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cBut what if they are? I know it\u2019s not precisely the cream of London society in there, but they are earnest, well-intentioned people. What have they done, to earn your disdain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. And even if he wished to explain it to her, he was in no condition to do so. His head was spinning. He didn\u2019t even think he could stand. So many people, such a small space ... and he hadn\u2019t been prepared. When he attended balls in Town, he spent hours preparing himself beforehand\u2014physically, mentally. And he brought brandy. God, what he wouldn\u2019t give for a brandy right now.</p><p>\u201cJust go on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>A bit of solitude was all he needed to get put to rights. Although a minute of it might not be quite enough. Hours worked better.</p><p>She dropped onto the bench next to him. \u201cYou\u2019re truly ill, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, far too quickly to sound credible.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trembling. And so pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer ...\u201d</p><p>The quality of her voice had changed, from scolding to concerned. He would far rather have the scolding. He quite liked the Amelia who scolded him. He\u2019d missed her, in the past few weeks.</p><p>\u201cYou look as you did that night,\u201d she said, \u201con the Bunscombes\u2019 terrace. What is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Bloody wonderful. Why did he have to marry a clever, inquisitive woman? He had two choices now. Let her drag it out of him slowly, or just have out with it on his own terms.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said, burying his face in his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s just ... something that happens sometimes, when there are too many people about. I don\u2019t like crowds.\u201d</p><p>She placed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t like crowds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t abide them, actually. Never have been able to. They make me ill. Physically ill.\u201d There, he\u2019d said it. He\u2019d never said that aloud to anyone in his life. He wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d fully admitted it to himself. Oddly, a sense of relief accompanied the admission. His thumping pulse began to slow, and he lifted his head. He\u2019d never been able to comprehend his reaction in these situations. He was a strong, competent, intelligent person in every other respect, and his whole life, this one weakness had maddened him. Perhaps Amelia could help him understand it.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m prepared in advance,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine for a time. A half hour or so, at most. If I stay any longer, or I\u2019m taken by surprise ... something happens to me. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. I get warm. My head spins; my heart pounds. The air is suddenly too thick to breathe. It\u2019s as if my whole body insists that I must leave, immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you have to sweep an impertinent spinster off her feet and take her with you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling a little, he arched a brow at her. \u201cYou asked for that.\u201d Clearing his throat, he went on, \u201cSo long as I\u2019m prepared, I can attend these things. I just make sure to leave before the scene goes bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you told me that. The key is all in knowing when to walk away. So this is why you only stayed for one set of dances? That whole \u2018Duke of Midnight\u2019 routine ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cWas not my idea. I just wanted to keep my appearances brief, and it\u2019s easiest to leave after the supper set. But the whole thing mushroomed, and ...\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, shaking her head. \u201cAll that gossip and rumor. All that speculation. For nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for nothing.\u201d He scratched his neck, and her hand slid from his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the gossip. I\u2019ve never given a damn what people think of me. It\u2019s amusing\u2014and sometimes useful\u2014to be feared.\u201d</p><p>Or at least it had been, until talk of murder was added to the mix, and he\u2019d lost the trust of his wife before he\u2019d any real opportunity to earn it.</p><p>\u201cSpencer?\u201d She took one of his hands in hers. \u201cAs we are baring our secrets, I feel I should confess something. I may have been responsible for starting a most pernicious rumor about you. Worse than any other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d he asked, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Biting her lip, she gave him a doleful look. \u201cI may have told a group of impressionable young ladies that by the light of the full moon, you transform into a ravening hedgehog.\u201d</p> <p>He struggled to maintain a reproachful silence.</p><p>She continued, \u201cWell, if it helps, I do regret it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. It was an insult to hedgehogs everywhere.\u201d</p><p>A throaty laugh shook free from his chest, and it felt damned good. He squeezed her hand in silent thanks.</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d she said, \u201cthis has been the case all your life?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cFor as long as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just ballrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He only wished it were so simple. \u201cAnywhere with too many people and not enough space. Arenas. The theater.\u201d He gave her a meaningful look. \u201cWeddings. Musicales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her face softened. \u201cAnd schoolrooms? Those, too?\u201d</p><p>He gave a tense shrug. Damn, but it galled him to realize how much he\u2019d sacrificed over the years. It hurt worse that she\u2019d realized it, too. \u201cI know, I know. Everyone else seems to manage those settings with ease. That only makes it more irritating. I don\u2019t know what the devil is wrong with me. I\u2019ve spent my whole life feeling like ... like a fish with no talent for swimming.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers went to his temple, feathering through his hair. \u201cOh, Spencer ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He batted her hand away. \u201cAmelia, don\u2019t. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t pity me. I can bear anything but that. It\u2019s an annoyance, I\u2019ll grant you, but not a deprivation. In the absence of attending frivolous parties, I\u2019ve mastered some very useful talents. Cards. Horsemanship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read a great many books.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. That, too. I\u2019m happy with my life as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d She looked doubtful.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he told her honestly. Because at this particular moment of his life, he was. Things had been strained between them, to put it mildly, since Jack\u2019s visit. He\u2019d almost forgotten how much he enjoyed simply talking with her. He\u2019d forgotten how good it felt to laugh. She had a way of dragging his demons out of the shadows and ... not ignoring them, or making them over into gleeful cherubs ... but simply tweaking their ears. Looking them in the eye with that oh-so-Amelia combination of good sense and dry humor.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m happy,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019m happy with my life as it is. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps crunched on gravel nearby.</p><p>\u201cI think someone\u2019s coming,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPerhaps we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Firmly at first\u2014until the shock wore off and she realized that she was being kissed. And then sweetly, tenderly\u2014because she deserved his care. Holding her chin between the pads of his thumb and second finger, he urged her close. He explored her mouth with his lips and tongue, patiently coaxing her to open for him. Wooing her into full participation. Because she was worth that effort, too. This was a woman who ought to have been courted by a legion of suitors. How was it she\u2019d remained unmarried all those years, standing on the fringes of ballrooms? How was it he\u2019d never picked her out from the crowd himself and asked her to dance?</p><p>God damn, he was a fool. But a very lucky one.</p><p>All too soon, she pulled back. \u201cI think they\u2019re gone.\u201d She flashed a look over her shoulder, and her cheeks turned a pretty shade of pink. \u201cQuick thinking, that. You really are brilliant at disguising this problem. Honeymooners are forgiven all manner of rude behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then there\u2019s the solution. We\u2019ll spend the rest of our lives on permanent honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, as though it were a ridiculous notion. He wished it weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Spencer. I can\u2019t help but wonder ... Surely something can be done. Have you tried\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t finish my ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. If there\u2019s something you can think of to try, I\u2019ve tried it. Nothing has worked. This is just part of who I am, Amelia. I reconciled myself to it long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her chin ducked in disappointment. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Spencer rubbed his face with his palm. Of course, this was now\u2014not some long-ago time. He was married. He had a ward. And as much as he might have reconciled himself to a life without social events, was it fair of him to ask Amelia to reconcile herself to it, too? Hospitality and friendship ... those things were part of who she was. Not to mention the obligations they would have for Claudia\u2019s season. A bitter taste filled his mouth, making him grimace.</p><p>\u201cIs there nothing I can do for you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Just leave me be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could send for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me be,\u201d he said, with too much force. They both cringed. He knew he was only alienating her further, because she lived to be helpful. But in this case, there was nothing she could do. He took a breath and calmed his voice. \u201cWhen this happens, all I need is to be let alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She rose to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll go. Stay here as long as you wish, and I\u2019ll make excuses with our hosts.\u201d</p><p>With that, she hurried back toward the entrance of the house. Spencer sighed, feeling a weight of guilt settle about his shoulders. In the past few minutes, he\u2019d felt closer to Amelia than he had in weeks, but this damned condition of his was the brick wall he\u2019d spent a lifetime banging his head against. And no matter what he said, or what she did, they would always remain on opposite sides of it. She needed society to make her life complete; he only felt whole in relative solitude.</p><p>Had he really tried everything? Not truthfully. In his youth, he\u2019d attempted to overcome the damned problem through any number of strategies\u2014most of which involved drinking and plain force of will\u2014but he\u2019d always been motivated by his own selfish needs and desires. The wish to attend school. The desire to chase girls. Sheer frustration with his ineptitude.</p><p>But there was one thing he hadn\u2019t yet tried. He hadn\u2019t tried conquering it for Amelia.</p><p>At the very least, he owed it to her to try.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite certain?\u201d Amelia studied her husband\u2019s expression for any trace of reluctance.</p><p>He leaned against the wall, crossing one ankle over the other. \u201cFor the fifth time, Amelia. I\u2019m quite certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on her gloves. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t have to go down at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suggest we wait until after the dancing\u2019s started, but I suspect they\u2019ll be waiting on us to begin it. We\u2019ll only stay for a dance or two. The moment you want to leave, just tell me. You don\u2019t even have to say a word. We\u2019ll have some sort of signal. Touch the top button of your waistcoat, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA signal?\u201d He arched a brow. \u201cWhat are we, spies for the Crown? Can\u2019t I just bodily remove you from the hall? It worked well enough last time.\u201d</p><p>She threw him a disapproving look. Which was difficult, because there was simply nothing about his appearance to inspire her disapproval. Even swathed in silk and pearls, Amelia felt unequal to his simple, black-and-white-attired elegance. He looked splendid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look. I think you rather enjoyed it.\u201d His eyes darkened. \u201cI know I did.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. Well, she had rather enjoyed it, truth be told. \u201cA discreet signal will do for tonight. Save the bodily lifting for later, in private.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged smiles, and a giddy flutter rose in her belly.</p><p>Something had changed, since the garden that afternoon. He\u2019d opened himself to her, revealing his vulnerabilities as he hadn\u2019t done since that conversation in the stables. He was a man who\u2019d spent his life actively wishing to be misunderstood, but he\u2019d bared a piece of his true self to her. And now, each time their eyes met, it was as though a silent message passed between them\u2014sometimes a joke, sometimes an observation, other times a carnal suggestion. They were behaving like a couple, instead of two individuals who happened to be married.</p><p>His sudden openness made Amelia imprudently hopeful. Her foolish optimism was only increased by the fact that she knew he was making a great sacrifice, attending this party with her. She worried her heart was in serious peril, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to erect the barriers again. She could only hope for a change in his views. Once they arrived at Briarbank, he would see what her home and family meant to her\u2014how they\u2019d molded her into the person she was, much as his own past had formed him. Perhaps then he would understand how it hurt her to be separated from Jack.</p><p>As Spencer looked her up and down, his appreciative expression turned to a frown.</p><p>Self-conscious, she put a hand to her throat. \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d But as he stared at her, the little furrow of concentration between his eyebrows deepened. The expression was one of bemusement, as though he\u2019d expected a different image from the one his eyes beheld.</p><p>\u201cDoes the gown look well?\u201d She twisted a little, hoping he\u2019d praise the dress at least and send her downstairs with a smidge more confidence.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cBut then, blue always looks well on you.\u201d</p><p>Well, that seemed to be all the reassurance she would receive.</p><p>She took one last fretful glance at her reflection in the mirror and then met Spencer at the door. Before they left the room, Amelia paused a moment to smooth his lapels and waistcoat with her gloved hands.</p><p>Their gazes met. She kept her hands flat against his chest. It would have been the perfect moment for a kiss ... if he wanted to kiss her. In the garden earlier, he\u2019d embraced her so sweetly. But perhaps that had just been one more tactical move in a lifelong campaign of evasion and disguise.</p><p>After staring into her eyes a long moment, he reached to open the door. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>As balls went, this was a much more forgiving assembly than a London rout. The country setting not only afforded more spacious rooms, but also kept the guests to a reasonable number.</p><p>Still, as they entered the Granthams\u2019 modest hall, Amelia felt her husband\u2019s arm tense against hers. She had the urge to murmur something encouraging, or give him a soothing touch\u2014but she checked the impulse, knowing it would only add to his annoyance. The last thing he would want was to be fussed over. He just wanted to be let alone.</p><p>And of course, they were instantly beset. Fortunately, she\u2019d become acquainted with several of the guests earlier that day. She made quick introductions, and once Spencer had made his typically gruff acknowledgments, she took over the burden of making conversation. They made their circuit of the entire room this way, moving from small group to small group. Spencer made his terse, barely civil greetings, and Amelia gladly did the rest. She inquired after distant relatives\u2019 health, exchanged sympathies with those who\u2019d known Leo, deflected impertinent questions about their hasty marriage, and accepted well-intentioned wishes of joy with equal grace. By pushing herself to the forefront, she was able to spare Spencer an undue burden of curiosity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>And as the evening wore on, she found herself enjoying the attention. This was their first public appearance together, and it was really something, to be the lady on the Duke of Morland\u2019s arm. Despite his faint, persistent frown, Spencer hadn\u2019t touched his top waistcoat button yet, nor tossed her over his shoulder to cart her from the room. The evening was going quite surprisingly well, and Amelia reveled in the freedom to laugh, converse, and joke as boldly as she wished.</p><p>In fact, she was having the time of her life.</p> <p>When she looked up from a conversation to find her father\u2019s old friend Mr. Twither had cornered Spencer to question him mercilessly on farriers, Amelia even resorted to a new tactic: shameless flirtation. She sidled up to the old man, complimented the turn of his legs, remarked upon his youthful vigor, praised the delightful shape of his spectacles, and then discreetly pulled Spencer away, leaving a flushed, stammering, and quite-pleased-with-himself Mr. Twither in their wake.</p><p>And then, before anyone else could approach them, she loudly decried the heat and closeness of the room, gathered two glasses of cordial from a passing servant\u2019s tray, and beckoned Spencer aside.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an alcove just there,\u201d she whispered, pretending to sip from her glass as she indicated a paneled screen.</p><p>He took the other glass from her hand. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>The musicians picked a fortuitous moment to strike up the first chords of the quadrille, and amidst the excitement of partnering and queuing up, Amelia and Spencer slipped behind the screen. The triangular space was small and mostly occupied by a forlorn-looking potted palm.</p> <p>Spencer drained his cordial in one draught, then grimaced and wiped his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell ...?\u201d she asked cautiously, scanning his appearance for any signs of unease.</p><p>\u201cThis cordial is abominable.\u201d He glowered at the glass before setting it on a ledge behind them. His eyes slanted toward the screen. \u201cAnd the musicians aren\u2019t much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but how are you? I\u2019m so sorry about Mr. Twither. He\u2019s harmless, you know, but he holds his end of a conversation like a dog holds a bone. Oh, and those dreadful Wexler twins.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re shameless. Did Flora truly pinch your bottom, or did it just look that way?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Just smiled a little, in that devastatingly handsome and seductive way he smiled on rare occasions. Between that smile and the cordial, a very pleasant tingle warmed her insides.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying yourself,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI am.\u201d She sipped her drink. \u201cI know you hate this sort of thing, and this must be the most trying evening imaginable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Something thumped against the screen from the other side, startling her. Spencer\u2019s arm slid about her waist, drawing her back. She pivoted to face him, and his hand slid over her waist as she turned, until his palm settled at the base of her spine. A palm frond tickled against her neck. Suddenly stricken with a girlish flutter of nerves, she stared hard at his cravat.</p><p>\u201cAre you truly enjoying tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2014\u201d Quiet, you ninny. He\u2019s here for you. This night is going so much better than you have any right to expect. Don\u2019t ruin it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he prompted, absently stroking his thumb over the small of her back.</p><p>She forced her gaze up to his and swallowed hard. The cordial must have made her bold. Or stupid. Likely both. \u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at me so strangely all evening. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re disappointed, somehow. With me.\u201d</p> <p>That mild frown he\u2019d been wearing now etched itself into a stern mask of censure.</p><p>Words spilled from her mouth. Silly, irrational, painfully truthful words. \u201cYou\u2019re so handsome, you see. Just ridiculously so. I think you\u2019re the finest-looking man I\u2019ve ever known, and I know I just don\u2019t look like your duchess. I know feigned affection wasn\u2019t part of our bargain, and I know you don\u2019t give a damn what anyone else thinks. But I do give a damn what they think. Just a little one; I can\u2019t help it. And I seem to care a great deal ... far too much, I fear ... about what you think, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He laid a finger against her lips.</p><p>And then said nothing.</p><p>Did he not know what to say? What a fool she was.</p><p>Lie. Oh, please. Just lie to me. Just tell me I\u2019m lovely, and I\u2019ll pretend to believe you, and we can forget this ever happened.</p><p>He tilted his head toward the screen and mouthed, Listen.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d A matronly laugh resonated through the screen. \u201cRather a coup for Lady Grantham. Their first public appearance since the wedding, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the Lord,\u201d the unseen lady\u2019s companion replied in a gruff voice. \u201cNow you can cease nattering on about the \u2018true\u2019 reason behind the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Obviously a love match. I never doubted it.\u201d</p><p>A loud harrumph.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t!\u201d came the protest. \u201cAmelia always was a delightful girl, but marriage has been very kind to her. And anyone can see His Grace is completely besotted. He won\u2019t be torn from her side.\u201d</p><p>Behind the screen, Amelia nearly burst out laughing. Spencer covered her mouth with his palm.</p><p>The man snorted. \u201cYes, and any man with two eyes can see exactly which of her charms he\u2019s drunk on. They\u2019re on rather public display.\u201d</p><p>Amelia felt her eyes go wide. Spencer just flicked a devilish glance at her breasts and kept his hand pressed to her lips.</p><p>The man lowered his voice, and she held her breath to make out his words. \u201cI\u2019d keep her close, too, were I the duke. If she flirts that shamelessly right in front of him, imagine what she\u2019ll get up to when he\u2019s not looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, pish,\u201d the lady said. \u201cAmelia\u2019s not like that. And what if they are in one another\u2019s pockets? Nothing wrong with newlywed bliss.\u201d</p><p>By this time Amelia was laughing so hard, her shoulders were shaking. Spencer gave her a quelling look, and she struggled to regain her composure. She failed. She giggled helplessly into his hand for a solid minute, tears rolling down her cheeks, until the musicians struck up a livelier tune and the gossiping couple drifted back into the crowd.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t stop laughing. If she stopped laughing\u2014ceased acting like everything they\u2019d just heard was patently ridiculous\u2014she\u2019d have to admit how desperately she wished it all were true. If she stopped shedding helpless tears of laughter, she would just be ... crying.</p><p>Is it safe to release you? his expression asked, after a long moment.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens,\u201d she whispered, wiping her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that was so ...\u201d Another inane giggle choked on a sob. \u201cImagine, if they only knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d His hand shot out again. But this time he didn\u2019t press a finger to her lips. He cupped her cheek instead, and tilted her face to his intense, searching gaze. \u201cThe truth?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she wasn\u2019t laughing anymore. She was barely breathing anymore.</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d he whispered, \u201cat this moment, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d recognize the truth if it pinched you on the bottom.\u201d</p><p>He dropped a firm kiss on her forehead. She couldn\u2019t decide what that kiss meant, or even whether she liked it or not.</p><p>\u201cHere is what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen this dance ends, we\u2019re going to sneak back out of this alcove the way we came in, and we\u2019re going to crawl out of one another\u2019s pockets. I\u2019m going to make my passing nod at etiquette by inviting one of those grabby Wexler twins to dance. Hopefully Flora.\u201d She bit back a laugh, and he brushed a fingertip over her cheek. \u201cAnd after that, I\u2019m off to find a bit of brandy and quiet, and no one will notice. I\u2019ll come back for you in an hour, and in the meantime, you\u2019re to dance and enjoy every minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue. Just enjoy.\u201d</p><p>The music ended, and he was gone before she could object. Not two seconds had passed, and she missed him already.</p><p>She remembered her half-drunk glass of cordial. After downing the remnants in one swallow, she patted her cheeks dry and slipped out from behind the screen. Without her most striking accessory\u2014a duke on her arm\u2014she prepared to spend the next hour resuming her life as Just Plain Amelia. Having a pleasant, if unspectacular time. Chatting with the ladies on the fringes of the ballroom.</p><p>Blending into the wallpaper.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>His wife was the center of the party.</p><p>From his shadowed gallery overlooking the hall, Spencer nursed his brandy and watched Amelia dance with her fourth partner in as many sets. She tripped gaily down the reel, smiling as she went. Once returned to her place, she exchanged a furtive remark with an adjacent lady, and several people in her circumference laughed. All ears were tuned to her remarks. All eyes were on her\u2014on the shimmering cobalt silk that hugged her curves tight, and the yet more brilliant blue of her eyes.</p><p>To be sure, she was a duchess now, and doubtless some measure of the assembly\u2019s collective fascination could be attributed to her new title. But a mere title wouldn\u2019t hold them all enthralled. It was simply Amelia. Outgoing. Vivacious. Alluring as hell. Gone was the plain, retiring spinster. Tonight, her essence was uncorked and bubbling like fine champagne. Everyone wanted to be near her. To laugh with her. To get just a taste of her intoxicating charm.</p><p>And Spencer wanted it more dearly than anyone. A quality brandy enjoyed in solitude was one of life\u2019s saving graces, no question, and he did have a hard-earned misanthropic reputation to keep up. But he hadn\u2019t needed to leave. He hadn\u2019t experienced any head-spinning or blood-pounding to speak of tonight. In fact, he\u2019d scarcely noticed the crowd this evening.</p><p>Like everyone else, he\u2019d been captivated by his wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The voice came from behind him.</p><p>He turned. \u201cI ought to ask you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching the party, of course. Just like you.\u201d Claudia stepped forward to join him at the gallery rail, and together they stared down at the dancers. \u201cI\u2019m weary of Bea Grantham. She\u2019s a very silly girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she\u2019s the same age as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in any way that counts.\u201d Leaning on the balustrade, she propped her chin in one hand. \u201cAmelia looks rather pretty tonight.\u201d There was surprise in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, she does.\u201d</p><p>Hm. Now he had the answer to his question.</p><p>The night they first met, if someone had asked him to describe Amelia d\u2019Orsay, he would have called her plain. Unremarkable, at best. By the morning, he\u2019d come to think of her as passable, even lovely in the most flattering light. He\u2019d always found her alluring, in a voluptuous, sensual way.</p><p>But when she\u2019d emerged in their suite earlier, dressed in that gown ... Good Lord. He\u2019d felt as though he\u2019d been kicked in the gut. His heart had stuttered, and then there\u2019d been an ache that settled in his chest. He\u2019d realized, quite suddenly, that he now must count her among the most beautiful women he\u2019d ever known. When had that happened? He\u2019d spent the evening puzzling\u2014was the change in her, or in him?</p><p>He had his answer now. It was her, all her. Perhaps she hadn\u2019t changed, but she\u2019d been revealed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very popular with the gentlemen, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Claudia\u2019s voice took on a cheeky tone. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll apply to her for advice.\u201d</p><p>An uneasy feeling welled in his gut. Ever since Amelia had suggested Claudia might be envious of Spencer\u2019s marriage, he\u2019d felt uneasy around his ward. He doubted Amelia\u2019s supposition was true, but he was afraid to ask and find out. In general, he just didn\u2019t know how to talk to Claudia anymore. Not that he\u2019d ever been especially proficient at it, but lately she was so prickly and difficult. He hated that she was growing up, and growing further away from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past your bedtime,\u201d Spencer told her.</p><p>She sighed dramatically. \u201cDo you plan to treat me like a little girl forever?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s what guardians do.\u201d To her sulky pout, he replied pointedly, \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Once Claudia had gone, he turned to find Amelia in the crowd again. It wasn\u2019t difficult. All he had to do was look for the knot of slavering men.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t alone in his admiration of her, and he couldn\u2019t pretend to be pleased. Humbling as it was to admit, he\u2019d rather liked believing she had no better alternatives than marriage to him. That even if he bungled everything\u2014which he was obviously wont to do\u2014he needn\u2019t worry about losing her to another man.</p><p>He tossed back another swallow of brandy. Tonight, he was worried. Very worried. Behind that screen she\u2019d looked up at him with such heartrending doubt in her eyes. Didn\u2019t she have any idea what she meant to him? For God\u2019s sake, he was here. At a party. In Oxfordshire. For her. That ought to tell her something.</p><p>Evidently it didn\u2019t tell her enough. There was no way around it. He was going to have to explain a few things to her. Very slowly, and in some detail. And for a man who\u2019d long ago vowed never to explain himself to anyone ...</p> <p>Spencer was rather looking forward to it.</p><p>He descended the stairs and entered the hall just as the first strains of a waltz began. Amelia was already partnered with another man\u2014some local gentleman farmer whose name he\u2019d forgotten already\u2014but Spencer didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>\u201cI believe this is my dance,\u201d he said, extending his hand right in front of the waiting man\u2019s.</p><p>Amelia gave him a reproving look, but the farmer was already gone. Taking her in his arms, Spencer swept his wife onto the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cIs it midnight already?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cNear enough.\u201d He took her through a brisk series of turns. \u201cI owe you an answer, from earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she stammered. \u201cNo, please. I was so silly to even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been staring at you all night, you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ... just a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have been. So has every man here. Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re only drawn by the novelty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re calling them tonight?\u201d He cast a glance at her cleavage.</p><p>She blushed. \u201cI suppose a well-cut gown does do wonders for a girl\u2019s confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He tightened his arm around her waist. \u201cNo, Amelia, I don\u2019t believe it has much to do with the gown, or the novelty. It\u2019s just you. They\u2019re drawn to you. You\u2019ve been courting notice tonight. Flirting and dancing and laughing with every man to pass your way. And you\u2019ve been enjoying their attention. Don\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well, I won\u2019t.\u201d Her expression turned wary. \u201cAre you displeased?\u201d</p><p>An excellent question. He\u2019d been asking himself the same thing. But he couldn\u2019t begin to give an answer here.</p><p>\u201cWe need to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cImmediately.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened with concern. \u201cOh. Oh, of course. You\u2019re ill.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cCan you last to the end of the waltz? It will be less noticeable if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmediately.\u201d He brought them to a swift halt.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. You go ahead, and I\u2019ll just make our excuses to Lady Grantham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I must\u2014\u201d</p><p>Damn it, when would she learn to stop arguing with him? With an impatient sigh, Spencer tightened one arm behind her back, bent to slide the other behind her knees, and straightened, lifting her into his arms. Her breathy gasp of surprise heated his blood.</p><p>Around them, all dancing ground to a halt.</p><p>It was a struggle to keep from grinning as he said, \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. Together. Now.\u201d</p><p>The man was a barbarian.</p><p>Amelia could see it in the eyes of the party guests. Because, of course, every eye in the room was on her and Spencer. The guests\u2019 expressions mingled shock and glee. A display like this was exactly what they\u2019d come hoping to see, and she pitied poor Lady Grantham, because this excitement would herald a swift end to the evening. The guests would empty the hall immediately, desperate to go home and discuss it amongst themselves, write letters, regale their servants with the tale. Rumors of Spencer\u2019s uncivilized nature would double within hours of their exit from this ballroom.</p><p>He truly was a genius.</p><p>As he carried her past a slack-jawed Lady Grantham, Amelia attempted to take their leave. \u201cThank you so much for a lovely evening. We\u2019ll see you at breakfast, then.\u201d</p><p>Spencer tightened his grip on her body and said, loud enough for all to hear, \u201cDon\u2019t make any promises.\u201d</p><p>Amelia couldn\u2019t help it. She burst out laughing.</p><p>And with that, he carried her from the room.</p><p>As they headed for the stairs, she expected him to put her down. Obviously, if he\u2019d needed to leave the room so quickly, he must be feeling ill. How brilliant of him, though, to let everyone believe he simply couldn\u2019t exist another moment without carting his wife up to bed. It was true, newlyweds were forgiven all manner of rude behavior. And she counted it as a small victory, that Spencer would let a roomful of gawking dancers believe she was his weakness, rather than appear simply haughty and rude. The whole scene was immensely satisfying.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she whispered as they mounted the stairs, \u201cI can walk from here.\u201d</p><p>He gave a dismissive snort and continued carrying her, taking the risers two at a time. Amelia ceased arguing. This was enjoyable, too.</p><p>He did put her back on her feet at the entrance to their suite, and after they reached the bedchamber and closed the door, he stalked off across the room, tugging at his cravat.</p><p>Wanting to give him some space to recover, Amelia went to the dressing table and removed her gloves. She undid the clasp of her bracelet and laid it on a gilt tray. \u201cThank you for tonight,\u201d she said quietly, watching Spencer\u2019s reflection as he tore off his coat and cast the garment aside. \u201cI know what a trial it must have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Stripped down to his waistcoat and shirt, he came to stand behind her.</p><p>Their gazes locked in the mirror. His eyes were dark and intense.</p><p>Swallowing self-consciously, Amelia reached for the clasp of her earring.</p><p>\u201cLeave them on,\u201d he said.</p><p>Frozen in place by the brusque command, she stared at her husband\u2019s reflection. He didn\u2019t look pale or ill in the least. To the contrary, he radiated strength and virility. The only one perspiring or trembling was Amelia.</p><p>\u201cLeave the pearls,\u201d he repeated, settling his hands on her hips. \u201cI want you looking just as you looked down there, in the hall.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hands, pressing them flat atop the dressing table. The posture pitched her forward on her toes.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word was a husky groan. \u201cMore. Give me a nice, full view of what you\u2019ve been showing the other men all evening.\u201d He yanked her hips back, so that her weight canted onto her arms. The posture thrust her bosom forward, and in the mirror, the twin swells of her breasts puffed for attention. Even she couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>His hands roamed possessively over the curves of her backside and hips. \u201cDo you really know what a trial it was, Amelia? To look on from a distance while my wife danced and flirted and captivated every man in the room? Can you truly understand how that feels?\u201d</p><p>Yes, she thought. Yes, you ridiculous man. Of course I know what it feels like, to stand by unnoticed while you hold every woman in the room in thrall. She hadn\u2019t considered it until this moment, but was it possible she\u2019d enjoyed tonight partly out of revenge?</p><p>The devil in her said, \u201cTell me. Tell me how it feels.\u201d</p><p>His reflected gaze trapped hers. Meanwhile, his hands were doing unseen, wicked things. \u201cPerhaps I should say it made me immensely proud. That wouldn\u2019t be a lie. But neither would it be the whole truth.\u201d</p><p>She felt her skirts lifting in back, tangling about her ankles and teasing the sensitive hollows of her knees. Air rushed over her exposed legs, both cooling and inflaming her.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is\u201d\u2014his thigh nudged her legs apart\u2014\u201cit also made me angry.\u201d</p><p>His fingers brushed the sensitive slope of her inner thigh, traveling up to stroke her sex. She was ready for him, her intimate flesh already swollen and damp with excitement, and the discovery dragged a low moan from them both. The hard ridge of his arousal branded her hip.</p><p>\u201cIt made me want to teach you a lesson.\u201d</p><p>He roughly prodded her legs apart and moved to stand between them. Excitement rushed through her. In the mirror, the reflection of her breasts rose and fell at a suggestive pace, as though he were already moving inside her. His own breath came faster as he leaned against her, propping her skirts at her waist with his abdomen while his hands worked the buttons of his fall.</p><p>Within seconds, she felt him poised at her entrance. Her body ached for him. Wept for him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Yes. He entered her in one hard, quick thrust that rocked the dressing table on its legs. Her body cringed at the sudden assault, but he gave her no quarter. He slowly withdrew, pulling out almost to the tip before driving home again, all the way to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cThis is mine,\u201d he said, clutching her hips. He nudged deeper still. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>He was so deep inside her, so hard and strong. He was all she could feel. Toes, fingers, lips, ears, skin ... all the fringes of her body melted to insignificance.</p><p>Lifting her at the waist, he began to thrust, setting a brisk, unforgiving rhythm. Atop the dressing table, her bracelet rattled on the gilt tray. The reflection of her breasts bobbed in time with his movements, bouncing erotically and threatening to overflow her bodice. As the force of his thrusts increased, the dark border of one areola eased free. Now the neckline chafed her hardened nipple ... back and forth, back and forth as he moved, hemmed silk rubbing against the exquisitely sensitive nub.</p><p>And inside her ... oh, God, inside her he was reaching places she hadn\u2019t known existed. Pleasure coiled in her womb, volatile and intense. A devastating explosion seemed inevitable, and she worried that afterward, she would never be the same again. The strength left her arms. She leaned forward over the table, resting her weight on her elbows. The change in position earned his grunt of approval, and he began to thrust faster still. The folds of her skirt and petticoat wadded between her pelvis and the table edge, and as he moved, the bunched fabric stroked her just where she needed it.</p><p>\u201cSpencer,\u201d she gasped. She let her head roll forward, resting her feverish brow on one forearm.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His fingers tangled in her hair, pulling her head back up. The sharp yank on a thousand nerve endings sent pain and pleasure rushing from her scalp to her toes.</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself,\u201d he commanded her. \u201cWatch yourself as you come. Every other man can see you as you were downstairs. Witty. Desirable. Charming. Elegant.\u201d Each word drove home with another thrust. \u201cBut this is when you\u2019re goddamned beautiful, and this beauty is mine. It\u2019s for me, and me alone. Now and forever. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible, but he doubled the force of his motions again. A bottle of eau de cologne rolled to the floor, crashing open in a flood of rich scent. Her senses were overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he said, on a hard, spanking thrust.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She watched, mesmerized, as her reflection flushed pink. Her swollen lips fell apart, exposing the tip of her tongue. She stared into the jewel-like blue of her own eyes, soaring closer to release with each delicious thrust. He was right; there was true beauty there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh, Spencer. Yes.\u201d Her eyes squeezed shut as she came. She couldn\u2019t have stopped them, any more than she could keep her eyes open for a sneeze. The force of her climax was too powerful, too sudden. It went on and on, as he drove into her relentlessly.</p><p>As the tremors in her core ebbed, she sensed the shift in him\u2014that slight hitch in his motions that signaled he\u2019d gone past the point of return.</p><p>And now she forced herself to look. She watched in the mirror as his jaw went tight, and his lip curled back to reveal gritted teeth. His face was contorted with pleasure, as if it felt so good it hurt. His eyes closed, and his neck arched.</p> <p>That mask of primal, raw lust\u2014it was for her. She\u2019d done that.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she urged him. \u201cCome for me now.\u201d</p><p>He gave a harsh cry and froze as he spent inside her, digging his fingernails into her hips. She would have bruises there tomorrow. She would cherish them.</p><p>They remained there, joined, gasping and shuddering against the much-abused dressing table. He laid his brow on her bare shoulder. Perspiration misted them both.</p><p>He withdrew from her body, and she trembled helplessly in his arms. Her knees refused to solidify. She wondered if she\u2019d even be able to stand.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Amelia,\u201d he finally said, sounding drugged and weak. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He helped her to the bed. She lay boneless atop the coverlet while he played lady\u2019s maid, removing her gown, stockings, and undergarments. He dampened a cloth at the washstand and swabbed her brow and neck with cool water before dragging the cloth lower, to soothe the tender flesh between her legs.</p><p>He stretched out beside her on the bed. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>She managed a nod.</p><p>He smoothed the stray hairs from her face and kissed her cheek. Then he kissed her neck. And then that delicate pulse just beneath her ear. He kissed her everywhere. No eager nips or seductive swipes of his tongue. Just tender, reverent brushes of his lips against her skin, from crown to toe. Her exhaustion was so complete, she wasn\u2019t even ticklish. He kissed the insides of her elbows, her belly, her knees, and even the broad, fleshy mound of her hip. She didn\u2019t so much as flinch. Then he settled between her legs, spreading her thighs to accommodate the breadth of his shoulders. His fingers parted her gently, and he dropped a soft kiss against her sex.</p><p>Her hips bucked, just a little.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting forever to do this.\u201d He stroked her with his tongue. \u201cYou taste so good.\u201d</p><p>And with that, any fight in her was gone. She lay there, letting the beautiful pleasure sparkle and swirl through her veins. She brought one hand to his hair, sifting through the dark curls as he kissed her languidly. Within her, the need mounted again, and she knew he would soon bring her to another blissful crest\u2014but she didn\u2019t want to hurry. In some ways, she couldn\u2019t imagine a greater pleasure than this. Knowing that there was a party downstairs and a bottle of brandy next door, but what her husband most wanted to do at this moment was just this: to lie between her legs and worship her body with his lips and tongue. She fought the rising climax as long as she could, wanting to prolong this time they were sharing together.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t make it last forever. He pursed his lips around her bud and did something indescribable with his tongue, and her peak was upon her before she even had time to breathe. First piercing, then soft and buoyant as a wave.</p><p>Oh. Oh.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He rested his head on her belly. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, stroking his hair. They\u2019d shared a bed every night for weeks now, and they\u2019d never done exactly \u201cthis\u201d before. But she knew what he meant. He meant he\u2019d missed her. Emotion thickened her throat.</p><p>\u201cSpencer?\u201d</p> <p>He lifted his head, a silent question in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease speak,\u201d she begged him. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely moment, and this is where you ruin it. This is where you say something arrogant and insensitive. You know, to save me just in time, before I lose my heart to you completely.\u201d</p><p>He gave her only a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d She let her head fall back to the pillow. \u201cThere it went. I\u2019ve fallen in love with you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now?\u201d Chuckling, he rolled off her and came to a sitting position, resting his forearm on one bent knee. \u201cWell, thank God for belated blessings.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s been coming on rather longer than that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She sat bolt upright. \u201cWhat can you mean? Since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the first, Amelia. From the very first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He cast a meaningful look at his waistcoat pocket, where a corner of white peeked out.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth are you still clothed?\u201d she teased as her fingertips closed over the bit of linen. Her hands went utterly useless, however, once she plucked the cloth from his pocket and stared at it. It was her handkerchief. The one she\u2019d pressed on him that first night on the Bunscombes\u2019 terrace. Embroidered with her initials in purple script, twined round with ivy and decorated with a single buzzing honeybee. Had he truly been carrying it ever since? Carrying a tendre for her, as well? She could never have believed it, had she not been holding the evidence in her hand.</p><p>She looked up at him, astonished. \u201cSpencer ...\u201d</p><p>Color rose on his cheekbones, and he shifted defensively. \u201cGo on, do your worst. You have already accused me of being a romantic and a sentimental fool. I don\u2019t know what more you can say to discredit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a sweet man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, there it is.\u201d He flopped back on the bed, as if shot through the heart. \u201cRepeat that to anyone, and I will have you brought up on charges of slander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of telling a soul,\u201d she said, smiling as she nestled close. \u201cI like it being our secret.\u201d</p><p>His arm encircled her naked shoulders as he heaved a contented sigh. \u201cMight I be allowed an endearment now? Or will you accuse me of treating you like a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would depend on the endearment, I suppose. What did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear? My darling? My sweet?\u201d Skepticism tainted his voice as he tested each phrase.</p><p>\u201cNo, none of those. Too overused to have any meaning.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to face her. \u201cWhat about my pearl? My blossom? My treasure?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNow you\u2019re just making fun.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face in his palm, and what she saw in those entrancing hazel eyes made her breath catch. A capacity for emotion so fierce and loyal, it flashed with the enduring fire of diamonds. Deeply buried, but worth any effort to reach.</p><p>All teasing fled his voice. \u201cMy wife. My heart.\u201d He tilted his head, considering. \u201cMy dearest friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Emotion pinched sweetly in her chest. \u201cI think I rather like that last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I, Amelia.\u201d He pulled her close for a kiss. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Briarbank.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s mount pranced sideways as she pointed. Spencer nudged Juno forward and let his gaze follow the indicated direction, scaling down a craggy bluff and winding into a bend of the river. There, tucked against a wooded bank, sat an ancient stone cottage. Smoke puffed in welcome from its chimney, rising above the trees and hovering above the river like a miniature cloud.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely prospect, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Her eyes swept the verdant countryside and winding valley.</p><p>It was indeed, he thought, surveying the view. Lovely didn\u2019t begin to describe it.</p><p>The green plateau they currently occupied was home to the ruins of Beauvale Castle. The castle\u2019s crumbling turrets had been well positioned for defense. They overlooked the valley of the River Wye, and from this high bluff, one could see for miles in any direction. Miles of forests and farmland, displaying every shade of green in Nature\u2019s palette. Dark, mossy glens that swallowed the sunlight; fields of summer alfalfa that sparkled as a mild breeze teased the grass.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Once again I see these hedgerows, hardly hedgerows, little lines of sportive wood run wild,\u2019\u201d she recited quietly. \u201c\u2018These pastoral farms, green to the very door.\u2019\u201d She gave him a smile that arrowed straight for his heart.</p><p>How could he not love her? He\u2019d married a woman who quoted Wordsworth. And not merely to impress or sound well versed in modern poetry, but because the verse meant something to her, and she kept it in her heart.</p><p>She looked at him through her lashes. \u201cYou\u2019re very quiet. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>At the anxious note in her voice, her mount moved beneath her. For her first lesson, she was doing quite well, but she still lacked the confidence to fully control a horse. It would be some weeks yet before he could allow her to ride alone.</p><p>Spencer calmed Amelia\u2019s gelding with a few clucks of his tongue and dismounted from Juno to give her a rest. Likely he shouldn\u2019t have pressed a mare Juno\u2019s age on such a long journey, but he\u2019d seen with his own eyes the destruction she wrought on her stall and herself when left behind. He needed to secure ownership of Osiris, and soon. But all these were thoughts better kept to himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said simply, looking out on the valley. Really, that was God\u2019s truth. Caught between the wild, uneven landscape spread below, the primeval forest at his back, and the brilliant blue sky overhead ... he found his breath squeezed from his lungs. The sight made his heart ache for his own boyhood home. Canada\u2019s untamed landscape offered many such vistas, and in his youth he\u2019d often slipped away, paddled hard, ridden far to find them. Now an adult, he rarely let himself feel how much he missed that inspiring beauty.</p><p>Nature never did betray the heart that loved her.</p><p>Here was a dark alcove of his spirit he\u2019d never examined too closely, but Amelia had forged straight in and drawn back the curtains, illuminating everything. He wasn\u2019t especially sentimental, but he was a true Romantic, in the vein of Wordsworth and his like. Spencer had never been able to sit in a crowded church pew and feel anything but hopeless and tormented. But Nature was his cathedral. In places and moments like these, he truly felt the presence of the divine. Both humbling and comforting, at once.</p><p>It was a good thing, at times, for a duke to feel humbled. The same could be said\u2014or at least tacitly admitted in rare moments of self-examination\u2014that it was sometimes a welcome thing, to be comforted. And he didn\u2019t need to go chasing, swimming, or scaling wild landscapes in pursuit of those feelings now. Fortunate soul that he was, he\u2019d married a woman with the wit and generosity to dispense both comfort and humility, and the spirit to keep him guessing which he\u2019d receive on any given day.</p><p>And he loved her for it. Such a new endeavor for him: loving. And an intimidating one to undertake. He was a man who tended to excel at a few select pursuits and fail catastrophically at the rest. He hated to ponder the consequences if this one fell into the latter category.</p><p>\u201cHow long has the castle been like this?\u201d he asked, nodding toward the ranging pile of stone.</p><p>\u201cNot so very long,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom what my father told me, it was standing until a few generations ago. It was weakened by fire and then fell into disrepair. Most of the walls are still standing, but there are no roofs or floors to speak of.\u201d She turned shining blue eyes toward the castle\u2019s entrance, where a stone arch bridged a pair of rounded towers. \u201cWell, except in the gatehouse. That\u2019s where my brothers got up to all their mischief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Where did you get up to your mischief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a good girl,\u201d she said, raising her eyebrows. \u201cI didn\u2019t get up to any mischief.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a subtle wink. \u201cNever too late to begin.\u201d To give his mare a bit of rest, he led her in a slow walk about the ruined castle\u2019s perimeter. Pity the heap was entailed to her brother. He found himself wishing he could rebuild it for Amelia, make it into the home she deserved. Wake up to this sparkling green landscape and those brilliant blue eyes every morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>After rounding the castle, he returned to Amelia, observing her delicate profile as she looked down at the river. He could imagine her ancestors standing here, in centuries past. Generation after generation of strong, noble women who partnered the strong, protected the weak, and made the keep worth defending.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s well situated,\u201d he said, following her gaze to Briarbank. In lieu of their own private castle, he supposed they\u2019d have to make do with the cottage. \u201cBut it\u2019s dreadfully small.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. And it will soon be full of people. I\u2019ll understand, if sometimes you feel the need to slip away.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnyhow, the neighborhood begs to be explored. There\u2019s the river, the forest, all sorts of ruins. Someday we\u2019ll ride down to Tintern. That would be an excellent excursion for Claudia.\u201d</p><p>Spencer frowned at the mention of his ward, shooting a glance back toward the coach. Certainly, the ruined medieval abbey would be an excellent excursion for her\u2014if they could coax the girl to go. Claudia hadn\u2019t been riding since her return from York. He didn\u2019t know whether her boycott stemmed from resentment toward Amelia, or toward him.</p><p>\u201cCome along,\u201d Amelia chided, evidently mistaking his frown for reluctance. \u201cYou know you want to see the view of Tintern Abbey. \u2018When the fretful stir unprofitable,\u2019\u201d she quoted, teasing him with another line from Wordsworth\u2019s poem, \u201c\u2018and the fever of the world have hung upon the beatings of my heart ...\u2019\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow, extending him a dare.</p><p>\u201c\u2018How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,\u2019\u201d he finished in a murmur, looking over his shoulder as though there might be someone to hear.</p> <p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d She smiled. \u201cRomantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur secret, remember.\u201d He made his voice deep with mock threat. \u201cYou\u2019re not to tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>Four days later, Spencer sat in Briarbank\u2019s small library, shaking blotting powder over the letter he\u2019d just finished. A knock sounded at the door. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only me.\u201d Amelia entered the library, closing the door behind her and approaching the desk with a delicious sway in her hips. A quite promising sway, if he read the signals right.</p><p>This place was good for her. He\u2019d noticed the change in her the moment they\u2019d arrived at Briarbank. She was in her element, brimming with confidence and cheer, and for his part, Spencer had been reaping bountiful rewards in their bedchamber. And in their dressing room, and in the bath, and even once in the drawing room. But not yet in this library, and he dearly hoped this afternoon\u2019s interruption was intended to remedy that oversight.</p><p>He sealed his letter and set it aside. \u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA rider just arrived from Harcliffe Manor. Lily and the gentlemen are under way. They should arrive within an hour or two.\u201d</p><p>Spencer received the news with surprising ambivalence. This was the original reason he\u2019d journeyed here\u2014to get Bellamy and Ashworth in one place and put an end to this Stud Club business. But now he\u2019d been enjoying his time alone with Amelia. He hated for the honeymoon to end.</p><p>Evidently, she felt the same. Skirting the desk, she sauntered around to his chair and made herself at home in his lap. \u201cSoon the house will be full of people,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be busy making everyone feel at home. This may be our last time alone for a while.\u201d</p><p>She wasted no time with coyness. Her hand went straight to his groin.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d she teased, stroking his erection through the fabric of his trousers.</p><p>\u201cFrom the moment you entered the room.\u201d He hauled her further into his lap, taking her mouth in a kiss that was equal parts playfulness and passion. God, he loved her mouth. So sweet and lush, just like the rest of her.</p><p>She reached between them, unbuttoning his fall and smallclothes with practiced skill. He cupped her breasts, teasing her nipples to peaks through the thin muslin as she freed him from his trousers. Her cool, delicate fingers wrapped around his thick length, stroking him boldly. He reclined in the chair, reveling in the sensation. She was a quick study, his Amelia. She\u2019d already learned just how he liked to be touched.</p><p>Another rap at the door had him jolting in the chair.</p> <p>\u201cStay here,\u201d she said, scooting off his lap. \u201cOne of the servants, no doubt. I\u2019ll be back in a trice.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed her. Because really, he had no desire to stand and greet whoever it was with a rampant erection. He didn\u2019t even bother to tuck himself back in, just moved closer to the desk. Amelia conferred with the intruder in hushed tones, and then shut the door and locked it. If his arousal had flagged the slightest bit during the interruption, the sound of that tumbler in the lock had him throbbing again, instantly.</p><p>As she hurried back across the room, he pushed back in his chair and surveyed the desk. Would he lay her atop it? Or bend her over it? Decisions, decisions.</p><p>Amelia had ideas of her own, however. She walked over to where he sat in the chair, took his eager length in her hand, and sank to her knees.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>That sweet, lush mouth closed over the swollen head of his cock, and Spencer thought he would erupt. \u201cAmelia, wait.\u201d</p><p>She backed off and looked up at him.</p><p>Damn it. Why the deuce had he done that?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure ...?\u201d He hadn\u2019t wanted to push her into this too soon.</p><p>Her eyes twinkled. \u201cYou told me that if I enjoy something you do to me, there\u2019s an excellent chance you\u2019ll enjoy the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case, it\u2019s not an excellent chance. It\u2019s a certainty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Stop interrupting.\u201d</p><p>She took him in her mouth again, this time smiling while she did it. And it was the damnedest thing, but it felt different when she smiled. Even better than before, if such a thing were possible. Her tongue curled around the sensitive ridge beneath, and her soft palate rubbed against the crown, and a helpless burst of profanity tore from his throat.</p><p>Which made her laugh, and then it got even better.</p><p>She was a little tentative, but that was good, because if she\u2019d been any more free with her lips and tongue and hands, he would have come in an embarrassingly brief ten seconds.</p><p>He fell back into the chair, surrendering to the mounting pleasure. With one hand, he swept a stray lock of her hair aside, to better watch as she sucked him between those plump, coral-pink lips. She looked up and caught him watching, and she gave an erotic sigh that had him clawing the upholstery.</p><p>Sweet heaven. Embarrassing or not, he was already close. So close. Perhaps he ought to warn her. She\u2019d never done this before. She might not realize she had a choice, but ... bloody hell. Why would he want to give her one? Really, of all the times for a man\u2019s nobility to be put to the test.</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d he groaned. There. That was all the warning she\u2019d get. He knew she\u2019d recognize the desperation in his voice.</p><p>Bless her, she only increased her efforts. Her very effective efforts. Her brilliant, amazing, soul-shattering, credibility-defying, best-ever-in-his-life efforts.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d He arched off the chair, his whole body racked by bliss.</p><p>In the aftermath, he stared unfocused at the cracked plaster and roughhewn ceiling beams. Amelia had been right. This drafty little cottage was paradise on earth.</p><p>She rose from the floor and sat on the desk facing him, wiggling her bottom backward and letting her legs dangle between his sprawled boots. Her kittenish expression was one of extreme self-satisfaction.</p><p>Minx. He would teach her something about satisfaction. Just as soon as he recovered his breath. Reaching out with a leaden arm, he encircled her ankle with his fingers. \u201cNow you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThank you, no. I don\u2019t want to get mussed. They\u2019ll be here any time now. The beds are prepared, but I\u2019d hoped to gather fresh flowers for each room.\u201d Her brow wrinkled. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still missing a vegetable dish for dinner. How do you feel about parsnips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m completely indifferent to parsnips,\u201d he said, sliding his hand up her calf. \u201cBut I very much want to taste you.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she slid back on the desk, out of his reach. \u201cNot now. I\u2019ve so much yet to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t finish, what does it matter? Amelia, you are too quick to put others ahead of yourself.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and flicked a glance at his lap. \u201cAre you saying you wish I hadn\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Are you mad?\u201d He grinned. Tucking himself back in, he straightened in his chair and took a more serious tone. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been wondering something. At the Granthams\u2019 the other night, you were radiant. Bewitching. The center of attention. If you\u2019d behaved like that in Town, I could not have attended a single ball without noticing you, let alone dozens. How is it I never saw that Amelia in London?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019ve been pondering that question myself. Obviously, you\u2019re a great boost for my confidence. I defy any woman to be a wallflower with a handsome duke at her side.\u201d She tickled his knee with her toes. \u201cBut before I met you ... I think I once mentioned Mr. Poste to you. The squire I was engaged to marry?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy father owed him a great deal of money, you see, and he made certain I understood he would forgive the debts in exchange for ... well, for me.\u201d Her voice grew soft. \u201cHe had his eye on me, from the time I was very young. Too young. I developed earlier than most girls, and even when I was twelve, I would catch him leering at me. It made me feel so unclean, and I was only a child.\u201d</p><p>Spencer wanted to hit something. Hard. \u201cDid he touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few pinches, here and there. Nothing more. But I didn\u2019t know how to cope with that sort of attention, and I never spoke of it to my parents. I was afraid they wouldn\u2019t let me marry him, and I wanted so much to help. In the end, I just couldn\u2019t go through with it. My motives were entirely selfish. I dreamed of having my turn at courtship and romance. But even after I broke the engagement, it took years before I could feel a man\u2019s eyes on my body and not simply ... wither where I stood.\u201d</p><p>Damn it all. There was nothing to make a man feel more useless than the revelation of a wound suffered years in the past, healed over in the present, that he couldn\u2019t do a blasted thing to remedy now.</p><p>\u201cSo if no one saw me, I suspect it was because I didn\u2019t want to be seen. Perhaps I didn\u2019t feel worthy of attention.\u201d She gave him a bittersweet smile. \u201cYou see, Poste died soon after our betrothal ended. If I\u2019d endured just a year of marriage to him, my family would have been saved so much trouble. And I\u2019d be a wealthy widow now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t feel guilty for that.\u201d</p><p>One of her shoulders lifted in a shrug. A clear admission that she did.</p><p>Dear, addled girl. To have carried that misplaced guilt\u2014and the weight of her family\u2019s financial distress\u2014all these years. Simply because she\u2019d balked at marrying a lecherous old stick? At least it made some sense now, why she would so eagerly deny herself in the name of helping her brothers.</p><p>He caught her hand and squeezed it. \u201cI\u2019m very glad you didn\u2019t marry him.\u201d</p><p>She slanted her gaze away.</p><p>He waited, hoping she\u2019d return the sentiment and say she was happy with the way life had turned out, too. That being a wealthy widow was nothing compared to being the Duchess of Morland, and she would not give up Spencer for anything\u2014not even to redeem her father\u2019s debts.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t say any of that.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said.</p><p>His heart cinched with disappointment. He knew the words were sincere. The only trouble was, there were a great many people Amelia sincerely loved. And he\u2019d never felt comfortable in a crowd.</p><p>Needing a diversion, he dropped his gaze to the papers scattered on his desk. \u201cWho was that earlier, at the door?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cOh, it was Claudia. I told her you\u2019d be along in a minute. A shockingly accurate estimate, in the end.\u201d</p><p>He gave her backside an affectionate swat as she hopped down from the desk.</p> <p>\u201cOne other thing,\u201d she said, turning at the door. \u201cWhen the men arrive, you\u2019re to take them angling. I\u2019m counting on fresh salmon for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s another.\u201d With a quick jerk of his wrist, Ashworth snagged a wriggling fish from the Wye.</p><p>Spencer congratulated him and recast his own line, once again marveling at his wife\u2019s cleverness. He\u2019d planned this holiday with the intent of disbanding the Stud Club once and for all. But in order to execute his plan, he needed an opportunity to speak with Ashworth without Bellamy present. Amelia had handed him the perfect excuse. Course fishing was a gentleman\u2019s sport, a pastoral occupation. As a child of privilege raised in the country, Rhys would have grown up angling on summer afternoons, as had Spencer.</p><p>But Julian Bellamy ... ha. This cottage was likely the closest he\u2019d ever come to a river other than the Thames. The more Spencer learned of the man, the more he was convinced Bellamy\u2019s provenance was a direct line back to the gutters of London. His jokes and fashionable attire were enough to grease his way in Town, but not out here in Gloucestershire. Here, he stood out like the impostor he was. He\u2019d balked at the mere mention of angling, making some pitiful excuse about tuning the pianoforte.</p><p>Spencer wondered how much Leo had known about the man\u2019s true history. By all accounts, they\u2019d been close friends.</p> <p>\u201cI need funds,\u201d Ashworth said, saving Spencer the trouble of easing into the topic. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here. Once we\u2019re done, I\u2019ve decided to go straight to Devonshire, see what\u2019s left of my torched estate. I\u2019ll need money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to have money,\u201d Spencer said with nonchalance.</p><p>\u201cAnd I happen to have a token. I\u2019d suggest we make a simple exchange, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Bellamy won\u2019t hear of it, I know.\u201d Derision pitched his voice to a drawl. \u201cHeaven forfend we neglect the Stud Club Code of Good Breeding.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed a little. Just a little, because the joke was Leo\u2019s, and Leo was dead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll play for it,\u201d Spencer said. A nibble on his line stole his attention, but as he began reeling in the line, the catch slipped away. \u201cOne of these nights, we\u2019ll convince Bellamy to sit down to cards. There\u2019s not much else to do out here. It shouldn\u2019t take long. Just let me take the lead. I know how to play these situations slowly. When I lose ten thousand pounds to you on one hand, you\u2019ll lose the token to me on the next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want twenty thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen. That\u2019s as high as I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou offered twenty to Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s grieving and pretty. You\u2019re ugly and unlikable.\u201d</p><p>Ashworth shrugged. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>They fell silent again for a time.</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re here, the two of us ... I suppose we\u2019re years overdue for a conversation.\u201d Spencer took extra care rebaiting his hook. \u201cAbout Eton ... I wasn\u2019t really fighting you that day.\u201d That was as close to an apology as he could get. After all, he hadn\u2019t started the fight.</p><p>A dragonfly buzzed past. Spencer recast his line.</p> <p>Finally Ashworth said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t really fighting you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe needn\u2019t speak of it further.\u201d God forbid they accidentally wade into heartfelt conversation. Spencer cocked his head, wondering if that was the true reason Amelia had sent them out angling. The little minx.</p><p>\u201cSo if you weren\u2019t fighting me,\u201d Ashworth said, \u201cwhat were you fighting?\u201d</p><p>Spencer sighed. Of course it couldn\u2019t have been that easy. This would have been an opportune time for a fish to bite and remove all possibility of further discussion.</p><p>None did.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said finally. \u201cFate.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been miserable at Eton. He was seventeen, and one of the oldest students there, but his Latin lagged behind that of the second-form boys. Then there was his little problem to contend with: breaking into a cold sweat in crowded classrooms. The only boy who\u2019d rivaled him for surliness was Rhys St. Maur\u2014one year younger than Spencer, but already two stone heavier. The two of them had waged a silent competition for the title of Worst Boy in School. Spencer had no idea why Rhys made so much trouble, but on his side, the rabble-rousing was intentional. If he misbehaved enough, his uncle might send him back to Canada. Or so he\u2019d hoped.</p><p>Then the letter came that day. It was February and sunny, yet still cold as a bitch. He\u2019d been happy, initially, to be summoned from a Greek lesson to receive the missive. Inside, he found the news that his father had died in Canada, a month before. He\u2019d been an orphan for a month, and he hadn\u2019t even known. And now it didn\u2019t matter how much he misbehaved. There was no going back home. There was no home to go back to.</p><p>He\u2019d been devastated. Angry with himself, his father, his uncle, God.</p><p>And Rhys St. Maur had picked that day to start a brawl.</p><p>\u201cFighting fate?\u201d Rhys asked. \u201cYou never struck me as that stupid. A man can\u2019t win against fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIn the end I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry I lost.\u201d</p><p>Whatever regrets or guilt Amelia might harbor about her past, he had none. Here he was, a duke with every material advantage and a thriving business concern to boot, married to a clever, desirable woman who also happened to be his best friend. He wouldn\u2019t change a damn thing. He only wished his wife felt the same.</p><p>God, he was a greedy bastard. A few weeks ago, he would have thought nothing could make him happier than to hear Amelia say she loved him in the same selfless, devoted way she loved her brothers. Now he\u2019d heard it. And it wasn\u2019t enough. He wanted to be first in her life. First, last, and everything in between.</p><p>Rhys pulled in another salmon. \u201cThere\u2019s three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Spencer replied, reeling in his line. \u201cNow we can go up to the house, and Amelia will be satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her I caught them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. And neither are you, if you want your fifteen thousand.\u201d Spencer opened the tackle box. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair bit of money, fifteen thousand. Enough to take a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wife?\u201d Rhys scowled as he helped Spencer untangle the lines. \u201cYou should confine your strategy to the card table. That\u2019s the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you might start smiling?\u201d He persuaded the box\u2019s stubborn latch to close. \u201cBellamy may be an ass, but he may have been right about one thing. Perhaps Lily could benefit from a husband\u2019s protection.\u201d</p><p>In retrospect, that was Spencer\u2019s one regret: the rudeness with which he\u2019d rebuffed the idea of marrying Leo\u2019s sister. At the time, he\u2019d simply rejected the idea on instinct, without questioning why it felt so unthinkable. No one could have seen it then\u2014least of all him\u2014but he\u2019d already been half in love with Amelia.</p><p>Rhys snorted. \u201cOh, Lily has a protector. Good Lord, that was a miserable ride today, with the two of them in the coach. Never saw a man working so hard at looking disinterested and failing so completely.\u201d</p><p>So Spencer had been right. There was something between Bellamy and Lily Chatwick.</p><p>Rhys gave him a devilish look. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll threaten to marry her anyway, just to watch Bellamy\u2019s reaction.\u201d</p><p>Oh, now that would be amusing.</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor,\u201d Spencer said, picking up the rods in one hand and the tackle box in the other. \u201cMake sure I\u2019m in the room when you do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cIs it my imagination?\u201d Amelia said, kneading a taut lump of bread dough. \u201cOr are matters tense between you and Mr. Bellamy?\u201d</p><p>Lily laughed, propping her elbows on the kitchen table. \u201cTense does not begin to describe matters between us. Julian won\u2019t stop pressuring me to marry.\u201d</p><p>With a floury hand, Amelia brushed back a wisp of stray hair. \u201cBut it\u2019s barely been a month since ...\u201d She bit her tongue.</p><p>\u201cSince Leo died,\u201d Lily finished. \u201cI know. And his heir has yet to arrive from Egypt. He probably hasn\u2019t even been notified yet. The town house and estate are mine to live in for months, but Julian insists I need a protector.\u201d She tilted her head at the lump of floured dough. \u201cYou make your own bread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on special occasions.\u201d Or in this case, when a fit of nerves had caused her to accidentally consume, in its entirety, one of the loaves Cook had prepared that morning. She had an old habit of eating when she was anxious.</p><p>On the other side of the wall, Julian Bellamy attacked the drawing room pianoforte with vigor. Dark, furious chords shook the plates on their shelves. She wished he had gone angling with the other men, but he seemed unwilling to leave the house. Interesting, that he would choose to occupy himself at the pianoforte. It kept him close to Lily, without her knowing it.</p><p>\u201cI can hear him,\u201d Lily said, as though reading Amelia\u2019s thoughts. She cast a glance at the wall separating the kitchen from the drawing room. \u201cOr rather, I can feel him. He always plays with a great deal of passion, but he used to play happier tunes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the difference?\u201d She glanced up at the shelves. \u201cHappy tunes don\u2019t rattle the plates.\u201d</p><p>Amelia gave the bread dough a thoughtful pat. \u201cLily, have you considered that Mr. Bellamy might be in love with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I believe he thinks he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a friendship for years, but it\u2019s never been anything more. Then when Leo died ...\u201d Lily\u2019s shoulders hunched. \u201cI think Julian\u2019s grief and guilt are exaggerating the depth of his attachment to me. He couldn\u2019t save Leo, so he feels obligated to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019ll act on his feelings? Or imagined feelings?\u201d</p><p>Lily shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as well, then,\u201d Amelia said, hoping that her friend did not return the man\u2019s affections. Nothing good could come of such a match. Lily was a refined, delicate lady from one of England\u2019s most noble families. Julian Bellamy was a hellraiser of indiscriminate origins. That alone wouldn\u2019t lower him in Amelia\u2019s estimation, but she didn\u2019t quite trust the man. Mr. Bellamy couldn\u2019t be too terribly in love with Lily, if he\u2019d been bedding another woman\u2014a married woman\u2014the night Leo died.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019ll never lack for a place to live,\u201d Amelia continued. \u201cYou\u2019re always welcome to stay with me and Spencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you. And Spencer.\u201d Lily gave her a sly look. \u201cDid I not say he would make you a fine husband?\u201d</p><p>Amelia blushed, turning the dough and slapping it to the table. \u201cYes, you did. And it took some time, but he eventually proved you right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>Amelia was happy, too. But it seemed uncouth to gush on about it, when Lily was still mourning her brother.</p><p>At the thought of brothers, her own heart gave a twinge. More than ever, she hoped this holiday could lay the foundations of reconciliation between Spencer and Jack. Though Spencer remained his usual reserved self, Amelia noticed the signs of her husband warming to Briarbank\u2019s beautiful scenery and homely atmosphere. She understood now that he\u2019d been raised on a series of British forts in Canada, then transferred straight to the grandeur of Braxton Hall. He\u2019d never known the comforts of a cozy home and affectionate family. After their time here, surely he would understand why Amelia couldn\u2019t turn her back on a member of her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>She asked, \u201cAre you certain you don\u2019t mind sharing with Claudia? It\u2019s such a small cottage, only four bedchambers. But if you do mind, we can put someone in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Lily interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the company. Even the taciturn variety.\u201d</p> <p>Amelia sighed. \u201cShe never talks, does she? I don\u2019t know how to reach out to her.\u201d She felt a pinch guilty for turning Claudia away from the library that afternoon. She wondered if Spencer had ever caught up with her, to find out what she\u2019d wanted. The coaches had arrived so soon thereafter; he might not have had the chance. \u201cI have to admit, that\u2019s why I put the two of you together. Perhaps you can succeed where I\u2019ve failed. I\u2019ve tried and tried making friends with her, but she only becomes more withdrawn.\u201d</p><p>She punched down the dough. Her failure to win over Claudia had her frustrated and, yes, a bit resentful. Strolls along the river, pianoforte duets, even trips to the shops\u2014the girl rejected her every suggestion. She didn\u2019t know what more to do.</p><p>After setting the bread aside to rise a final time, she clapped the flour from her hands and turned to wash them in the basin.</p><p>While her back was turned, she heard Lily say, \u201cWhat a surprise! I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be joining us.\u201d</p><p>Had the men returned from the river so soon? It couldn\u2019t be Mr. Bellamy\u2014she still heard a haunting melody emanating from the pianoforte. Shaking her hands to dry them, Amelia turned around.</p> <p>What she saw made her knees go weak.</p><p>\u201cHullo, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d For a moment, she thought she was seeing a ghost. The phantom of Jack\u2019s fourteenth summer, when he\u2019d shot up four inches in six weeks and devoured every scrap of food in the house before picking the nearest trees clean of green apples, too. But of course she wasn\u2019t seeing a boy, nor a ghost. This was truly her brother standing awkwardly in the middle of the kitchen, like a stranger in his own house. He looked haggard, gaunt. His clothes hung loose on his frame, giving him that boyish, bony appearance. Dark shadows haunted his eyes, and his last shave had been at least three days ago.</p><p>Her eyes welled. The tears streaked down her cheeks before she could get them back.</p><p>\u201cOh, come now. Is that any way to greet your favorite brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d She threw her arms around him, hugging him close. What\u2019s happened to you? she wanted to ask. How had he sunk to this low? She was failing him, so miserably. Failing her mother\u2019s memory. Failing Hugh\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d She clutched him tighter still. No matter what Spencer did or said, this time she would not let Jack go. Not until he told her everything, and together they made some plan to get his life put to rights. She\u2019d lost one brother already, and she couldn\u2019t bear the pain of losing another.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve a full house,\u201d she said, wiping her tears and striving for a cheery tone. \u201cCan you make do with the attic while you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Assuming Morland doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>A deep voice interrupted. \u201cAssuming Morland doesn\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>Spencer tromped into the kitchen, holding a set of sleek fish. \u201cThree salmon, as ordered.\u201d He flung the fish on the table and turned to Jack.</p><p>Amelia\u2019s stomach knotted. She didn\u2019t know how Spencer would react to Jack showing up again uninvited. Even though he shouldn\u2019t need an invitation\u2014not to his own family\u2019s house.</p><p>Lord Ashworth followed Spencer into the room. At the sight of the giant, Jack held up his hands in a gesture of truce. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make trouble. I\u2019ve brought the papers from Laurent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapers?\u201d Amelia asked. \u201cWhat papers?\u201d</p><p>No one heeded her question. Amelia held her breath as Spencer dragged a wary gaze over her brother\u2019s disheveled clothes and sharply angled form. Would he curse Jack? Dismiss him? Welcome him? It seemed too much to hope for the last, but she couldn\u2019t help but dream.</p> <p>In the end, he didn\u2019t speak a word to Jack. \u201cAshworth, this is Amelia\u2019s brother. Jack d\u2019Orsay.\u201d He caught Amelia\u2019s gaze. \u201cHe\u2019ll be staying with us for a while.\u201d</p><p>Tears of relief pricked at the corners of her eyes. Oh, how she loved him. She loved both these men, more than she loved her own life. And she adored Spencer for not forcing her to choose between them. Thank you, she mouthed to her husband.</p><p>\u201cJack, Lord Ashworth is Lieutenant Colonel St. Maur,\u201d she said, clearing the emotion from her throat. \u201cHe served with Hugh in the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m doubly glad to make your acquaintance, my lord. Your courage was legend, from my brother\u2019s letters.\u201d Jack bowed, then drew a sheaf of papers from the bag slung over his arm. \u201cYour Grace, shall we discuss these in the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever are you talking about?\u201d Amelia said, inwardly pleased with her brother\u2019s sudden formality. She gave Spencer a merry look, as if to say, See? He\u2019s already reforming. \u201cDinner will be ready soon. Whatever you need to discuss, it can wait until after we\u2019ve eaten.\u201d</p><p>And by then, she would have pulled Spencer aside to learn just what these papers were all about.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d she continued, \u201cyou\u2019re all of you men in desperate need of a bath. Go on, get out of my kitchen. Go bathe and dress for dinner, and let me finish here.\u201d She briskly shooed them through the door.</p><p>Lily rose, too. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll rest for a bit. I\u2019m fatigued from traveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course you are. Shall I show you upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I know the way.\u201d</p><p>Once she was left alone, Amelia braced her hands on the tabletop. She drew a deep, slow breath. And then she began to weep uncontrollably. Great, racking sobs left her cheeks wet and her throat aching. What was wrong with her? She just couldn\u2019t stop crying, and she had no idea why. Jack was here, Spencer hadn\u2019t thrown him out, and this was her chance to set everything right between them. She ought to be rejoicing, not crying.</p><p>From the basin, a salmon accused her with one round, glassy eye. Actually, what she ought to be doing was preparing fillets for dinner. But as she reached for the fish, her stomach gave a wild lurch. Tears forgotten, she grabbed the nearest empty bowl and retched into it.</p><p>Oh, dear. Though her head spun, she performed a hasty calculation on her fingertips. Suddenly it all made sense. Her helpless tears, her sudden nausea, her cravings over the past few days\u2014for baked goods and Spencer. All thoughts of her house guests, her husband, even bedraggled Jack and his mysterious papers fled her mind.</p><p>She was with child.</p><p>When dinner came, Spencer found himself seated across the table from Claudia. He didn\u2019t appreciate the childish manner in which she picked at her food. But he truly hated the way in which she shifted her fascinated gaze from one egregiously inappropriate man to the next: Ashworth, Bellamy, Jack d\u2019Orsay. The last passed Claudia a debonair grin along with the bowl of parsnips, and Spencer began to question the wisdom of placing his ward in close society with three men who could be called his enemies.</p><p>He tried to catch Amelia\u2019s eye, but she\u2019d taken quite an interest in her water goblet. It wasn\u2019t like her to be so distracted.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s truth, this room is quiet,\u201d Jack said. \u201cTell us a joke, Bellamy. Or one of those amusing stories. You\u2019re always the life of the party in Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in Town,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t feel so amusing, of late.\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement. From the looks of them, Jack and Bellamy were having a competition to see who could closest resemble a wraith. First man to waste to vapor wins.</p><p>Amelia took the nudge, rousing herself to make conversation. \u201cLord Ashworth,\u201d she said, \u201chow do you find the scenery?\u201d</p><p>Thick eyebrows knitted in a frown. \u201cI\u2019m not a man inclined to flowery description, but if pressed ... I think I might use the word \u2018charming.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you have an estate in Devonshire,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, in the heart of Dartmoor. The countryside cannot be called charming. Forbidding is probably the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I\u2019ve passed that way, when visiting cousins in Plymouth. What a study in contrasts the area is. Such beauty and such desolation.\u201d Amelia turned to Bellamy. \u201cAnd you, Mr. Bellamy? Where were you raised?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy took a slow draught of wine. When he put down the glass, he looked dismayed to see Amelia patiently awaiting a response, fork poised in midair.</p><p>\u201cFarthest reaches of Northumberland,\u201d he said. \u201cMiddle of nowhere. Don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve any cousins there.\u201d</p><p>Spencer put in, \u201cActually, I\u2019ve land in Northumberland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Bellamy\u2019s tone was bored.</p><p>\u201cYes, really. Mines. Did your people work in mining?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy said, \u201cWhat else is there to do, in Northumberland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoal, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy gave him a cold, slashing look, and Spencer leaned forward in anticipation. He\u2019d been waiting to catch this fraud in the act.</p><p>\u201cNo. Copper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBollocks. There\u2019s not a vein of copper in all Northumberland.\u201d Spencer\u2019s knife clanged the edge of his plate. \u201cAnd if yours is a Northumberland accent, then I speak like an Ottoman King. Where do you get off, accusing me of crimes? You\u2019re nothing but a petty swindler and a fraud.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy\u2019s eyes went to Lily.</p><p>Spencer repeated his words, making sure the dark-haired woman could read his lips clearly. \u201cYou are a lying bastard, Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow look here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how have you been spending my money?\u201d Spencer asked. \u201cThat massive investigation I\u2019m funding has yielded precious little in the way of results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s because the killer isn\u2019t in Town,\u201d Bellamy said, his voice tight. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s because the culprit\u2019s been hiding out in Cambridgeshire.\u201d</p><p>Ashworth groaned. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, can we move on from this? Morland isn\u2019t a killer. It\u2019s not in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d Bellamy said.</p><p>\u201cBecause if he were, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. I\u2019d have died fourteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>The room went silent.</p><p>Spencer stared at the scarred, hulking warrior. \u201cAre you talking about Eton?\u201d</p><p>He remembered the way their fight had dragged on, blow after blow, while boys ringed them and cheered and the schoolmasters stood passively by\u2014helpless to stop it, since both he and Rhys were larger and stronger than any adult there. They were both big youths, but Spencer\u2019d had the advantage of age and the force of grief and anger behind his blows. But no matter how many times he smashed Rhys to the dirt, the mad bastard wouldn\u2019t stay down. He\u2019d kept dragging his bleeding carcass off the ground and coming back for more. Until he hadn\u2019t even been throwing punches of his own, just lumbering forward on shaky legs to receive Spencer\u2019s next punishing blow. At the time, he had interpreted Rhys\u2019s persistence as foolish pride, and as he\u2019d been in the mood to keep dealing blows ... foolish pride seemed as worthy an offense as any.</p><p>But when Rhys staggered to his feet yet again, with one eye swollen shut and his chest hunched over broken ribs\u2014on his last blow, Spencer had heard them cracking under his fist\u2014he just couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of hitting the idiot one more time. It had become a matter of his own pride, to walk away.</p><p>Rhys\u2019s expression told Spencer they were recalling the exact same scene. \u201cI wanted you to kill me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Around the table, eyes widened. Wineglasses tipped.</p><p>\u201cPardon the bluntness.\u201d Rhys addressed the group in a diffident tone, forking another bite into his mouth. \u201cI never did master the art of genteel dinner conversation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to kill you,\u201d Spencer repeated.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I kept getting up. I wanted to die, and I knew if I kept putting my face in front of your fist, you had the strength and fury to do me in.\u201d He looked to Bellamy. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cYou would have left me with that guilt all my life, believing I\u2019d murdered you in cold blood? What the devil is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Rhys shrugged. \u201cToo many things to list tonight. You were the first I tried that with, but not the last. Took me a long time to give up on the strategy of picking fights in hopes of getting pummeled into my grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Rhys cocked his head. \u201cUntil a month or so ago? In the infantry, they kept decorating me for it. Finally realized only the good die young. At any rate, Bellamy, I can assure you His Grace isn\u2019t capable of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was years ago,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t prove a damn thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps not. But this does.\u201d Spencer drew Leo\u2019s token from his waistcoat pocket and tossed it onto the table. \u201cIt\u2019s his,\u201d he said, answering the silent question. \u201cI\u2019ve seven more upstairs, if you want to count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Bellamy said, his face going red. \u201cI knew you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was me,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI mean, it wasn\u2019t me who killed Leo. But I found that token. It was in the possession of a wh\u2014\u201d</p><p>Spencer threw his fist down on the table. \u201cNot now,\u201d he growled, casting a look at Claudia. For God\u2019s sake, he suddenly realized they\u2019d been discussing violence and murder right in front of her. They weren\u2019t going to discuss whores, too. \u201cWe\u2019re not having this conversation in front of the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child!\u201d Claudia protested, banging a fork against her plate. Her eyes swam with tears. \u201cWhen are you going to realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat your salmon,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to eat the dratted salmon.\u201d She stabbed it with her fork and muttered, \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>Spencer sighed. He didn\u2019t suppose that comment was directed at the fish. He looked to Amelia, hoping she would intervene and use her hostess\u2019s charm to rescue this wreck of a dinner. But his wife wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze. She was staring down at her own salmon, wearing a puzzled frown. All evening, she\u2019d been strangely preoccupied.</p><p>Bellamy said, \u201cSend the girl to bed if you must. But I\u2019ve been slaving day and night for the past month to find the men who killed Leo, and if anyone at this table has information, I want to hear it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found the token,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt was in the possession of the wh\u2014\u201d He absorbed Spencer\u2019s cutting glare. \u201cOf the witness to Leo\u2019s attack. The one who called for the hack and delivered him to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you recover it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the day after his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you told no one?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know you were looking for it, or even that it was Leo\u2019s. I met with her in Covent Garden, but I suppose she\u2019d made a special excursion to Whitechapel that night for the boxing match. Anyhow, when I tried to find her again, she\u2019d disappeared. I\u2019d given her a guinea in exchange for the token. Seems she\u2019d decided to take a holiday with her windfall and gone to visit her mother in Dover.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer caught Bellamy\u2019s gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s why neither of us had any luck finding her ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018neither of us\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d He most definitely was not discussing his day of searching Whitechapel taverns and brothels in front of Claudia. \u201cBut at least we know this. Whoever killed Leo, they weren\u2019t after his token. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have ended in the hands of a passerby.\u201d He turned to Jack. \u201cBut you did find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually, yes.\u201d He gave Spencer a look. \u201cThought it might help.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. So now Jack wanted to help him? Spencer had no doubt what sort of help Jack would ask in return.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you just left her again?\u201d Bellamy speared both hands through his unkempt hair in exasperation. \u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelaxing in finer accommodations than she\u2019s ever enjoyed in her life,\u201d Jack answered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s not going anywhere. Someone\u2019s watching her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have any further information? Did she see his attackers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly glimpses, in retreat. Her descriptions of them are vague at best. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in coarse attire. She couldn\u2019t describe them with any helpful detail. What was interesting\u201d\u2014he raised an eyebrow in a theatrical pause\u2014\u201cwas her description of Leo\u2019s companion.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bellamy finally managed. \u201cBut ... but he was alone that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t. There was another man with Leo when he was attacked. The harlot remembered his features quite well\u2014hair, height, clothes, looks.\u201d He turned a steely gaze on Bellamy. \u201cFrom her description, the man looked a great deal like you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Julian Bellamy\u2019s face went pale with shock. \u201cHe looked like me?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Spencer was going to enjoy this. Not only was he cleared of all suspicion, but now he could repay Bellamy the favor. \u201cWell, well. This is an interesting development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not with Leo that night,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cI wish to hell I had been, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s curious, isn\u2019t it, that Leo was seen with a man who matched your description?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI set the trends for fashion. Men try to match my description. Every brainless toff in London wants to resemble me.\u201d He gestured toward Jack. \u201cHe\u2019s one of them, for the love of God. Why would you take his word, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Spencer picked up the token from the table. \u201cPerhaps because the brainless toff was able to locate in a matter of days the person you\u2019ve been seeking for nearly a month? The fact that he found Leo\u2019s token proves he\u2019s not fabricating the tale. And it would certainly explain a great deal, if you were involved. Like why Leo\u2019s body was delivered to your house that night. Why your vast investigation has gone nowhere. And why you\u2019ve been so eager to pin the blame on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t with Leo,\u201d Bellamy said edgily. \u201cI have an alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Spencer narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat was her name again? Lady Carnelia? I don\u2019t suppose she\u2019d rush to confirm your story. What makes you think a married noblewoman would invite public scandal just to save your miserable hide?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy shot a look at Lily, as though hoping she hadn\u2019t understood Spencer\u2019s remark.</p><p>Lily bowed her dark head quickly and pushed back from the table. \u201cLady Claudia,\u201d she said, extending a hand, \u201cwould you kindly show me the way to our chamber? Silly me, I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Reluctance was plain on Claudia\u2019s face, but Lily clutched the girl by the wrist and fairly dragged her from the room. In unison, the men rose from their chairs. Because, naturally, that was the polite thing to do when driving two innocent ladies from the dining room with talk of murder and whores.</p><p>Amelia remained seated, looking stunned and pale.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Spencer said. He didn\u2019t truly believe the man had killed Leo. He\u2019d witnessed Bellamy\u2019s shock that night, and he could see plainly the toll recent weeks had taken on him. Even Julian Bellamy wasn\u2019t a gifted enough performer to pull off the role of grief-stricken friend so convincingly. Whether Leo had been alone or with a friend, the simplest explanation for his death was still the most likely\u2014he\u2019d been the unlucky victim of random thievery. But let Bellamy know, for a moment, just how it felt to live under unfounded suspicions of murder. Let him watch the woman he cared for scurry from the room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to discuss this alone, Morland,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cIn your library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshworth comes, too,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to do more than discuss the matter.\u201d He tossed the disc of brass in his hand. He hadn\u2019t planned to do this so soon, but this was the perfect opportunity\u2014when emotions and enmity were running high. \u201cWe\u2019re going to sit down to cards. It\u2019s time to disband the Stud Club once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d Ashworth said.</p><p>Spencer turned to Bellamy and stared him down, filling his gaze with unspoken challenge. This was the moment. Unless the lying bastard balked, victory would be his, tonight.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Hatred was keen in Bellamy\u2019s eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s end it. And then you\u2019ll tell me where this bit of skirt\u2019s being put up, and I head back to London in the morning. I need to question this woman as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the library, then.\u201d Spencer moved aside as Ashworth and Bellamy stalked from the room and crossed the narrow corridor to enter the library.</p><p>He shot out an arm to prevent Jack from following. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Morland,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cLet me play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the harlot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Blue Turtle Inn in Hounslow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Jack withdrew them from inside his coat and slung them on the table. He lowered his voice. \u201cNow let me play. I found that token. I found her. You owe me a seat at that table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d That was all Amelia needed, for Jack to run up a fresh debt of thousands just when he was on the verge of getting clear. \u201cYou\u2019ve done what you came to do. You\u2019ll leave tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d Amelia finally jolted from her reverie. \u201cHe\u2019s just arrived. And this is our family\u2019s house. You can\u2019t boot him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur family\u2019s house?\u201d Jack turned an accusatory gaze on Spencer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell her, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Amelia asked, rising from her chair.</p><p>Spencer sighed. He hoped she\u2019d take this well, in the spirit it was intended. \u201cI\u2019d planned to tell you tonight. I\u2019m buying the cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuying the cottage?\u201d She looked to the rafters. \u201cThis cottage? Briarbank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, to all three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly buy this cottage. It\u2019s entailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. The land surrounding the castle, yes. But not this property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo those papers ...\u201d Her eyes fell to the table.</p><p>\u201cWill make the house mine.\u201d Damn it. \u201cOurs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d She blinked furiously. \u201cBut this house has belonged to the d\u2019Orsay family for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Bollocks. She was not taking it well. Not well at all.</p><p>\u201cYou really should have told her,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Spencer snapped. He needed to discuss this with Amelia in private.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d Amelia grabbed her brother\u2019s arm. \u201cStay. Don\u2019t you let him chase you from this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, but the two of you are exhausting in your demands,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll just go to bed. If I\u2019m allowed.\u201d</p><p>After his brother-in-law left the room, Spencer placed his hands on Amelia\u2019s shoulders. In a belated attempt at tenderness, he stroked his thumb back and forth along her collarbone. \u201cAmelia, I\u2019ve made inquiries in recent weeks. Your brother owes a vast sum of money. Thousands. To a man far less forgiving than I.\u201d He didn\u2019t give the man\u2019s name; she wouldn\u2019t recognize it anyhow. But Jack\u2019s creditor was the proprietor of several of London\u2019s most infamous gaming halls, and he was a man known for his ruthlessness. It wasn\u2019t a business a man rose to the top of without excelling at ruthlessness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>The tears began to spill from her eyes. \u201cHe looks so terrible, so haunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it. He\u2019s probably living in streets and taverns, unable to go to his own home for fear of endangering his safety. If he doesn\u2019t make good on the debts soon ...\u201d He let the fear in her eyes complete the sentence for him. \u201cI can\u2019t countenance simply giving him the funds, but I will purchase this house. For you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy on earth would I want it for myself?\u201d</p><p>A small spark of hope warmed him inside, to know that she\u2019d so completely forgotten the terms of their original agreement. \u201cI intended to buy it in case you were unhappy living with me. After a child is born.\u201d He reached to wipe a tear from her cheek. \u201cOf course, now I\u2019m hoping it can be a summer retreat for us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer, this place is a piece of d\u2019Orsay history. Our house in Town is long gone, and you\u2019ve seen the ruins of Beauvale Castle. This cottage is all we have left. Our family pride is the very mortar holding these stones together. I can\u2019t believe you would so callously strip it from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallously? Perhaps this place belongs to Beauvale in name, but you are the one who cares for it so deeply. And what of our family? Why can\u2019t we begin a new chapter of this house\u2019s history, together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of chapter begins with tossing my brother to the wolves?\u201d</p> <p>By the devil, he was tired of hearing about her brother. When he managed to speak, his voice vibrated with anger. \u201cHow long are you going to keep defending him? You heard Jack. He\u2019s on the verge of clearing his debt, once this transaction is completed. And all he wants is to get right back at the gaming table and drown himself again. He\u2019s on course to meet with true disaster, and he has no compunction about dragging you along with him. If he stays in this house, he will work on you, make you all manner of promises ... and then just devastate you all the more when you wake up one morning to find he\u2019s made off with your pearls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Her hand went to her throat as she shrugged away. \u201cAnd if you truly thought I\u2019d be so happy for you to purchase Briarbank, why didn\u2019t you tell me? Instead you\u2019ve gone behind my back, manipulating everyone to your own purpose. Even the first week of our marriage ... you held my brother\u2019s debt over my head, just to get me to the card table and get your hands on my\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, she pulled up short. She gestured toward the library and lowered her voice to an accusatory whisper. \u201cThat\u2019s the entire reason for this house party, isn\u2019t it? That little card game you\u2019re about to play. You\u2019ve arranged this whole holiday just to win those tokens and that dratted horse.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, unable to refute it.</p><p>Closing in on him, she jabbed a finger in his chest. \u201cAnd you would lecture me on misplaced priorities. You led me to believe we were welcoming these people as friends and guests. I thought you wanted to be open and honest with them, gain their trust and cooperation. But no. Forget sincerity, we\u2019re back to gamesmanship. All I ask is for you to give Jack a chance. Talk with him, help him see his errors, let him learn from your example. But you won\u2019t hear of it\u2014and no surprise, given the manner in which you treat your own kin. You never did speak with Claudia today, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He heaved a guilty sigh. No, he hadn\u2019t. He could have offered some excuse, but it would have been a lie.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. My brother may have his problems, but you\u2019re delusional if you present yourself as an exemplar of behavior. You\u2019re so closed off and insular, it\u2019s a wonder you can see beyond your own nose. The wealthy, intelligent duke who welcomes all manner of insidious gossip rather than admit to feeling uneasy in crowds? Who\u2019d stand accused of murder rather than fall under suspicion of possessing a heart?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, wounded. How could she say that? Perhaps he was reserved with everyone else, but he was different with her. She\u2019d pulled him out of that insular, smug, goddamned lonely existence and made him yearn to be a part of this\u2014this family, this home. Why couldn\u2019t she see that he wanted it not just for her, but for them?</p><p>\u201cAmelia ...\u201d As he began, his voice broke. He cleared his throat and started again, clearly and calmly. It shouldn\u2019t be so hard to say this. \u201cYou are everything to me. The world is welcome to know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would they? Because you\u2019ve carried me out of a few ballrooms and tend to throw punches when I\u2019m around? You\u2019re wrenching this house away from my family. Uprooting it from centuries of d\u2019Orsay history.\u201d A sob caught in her throat. \u201cMeanwhile you\u2019ve been using me and my love for this place, just to gain custody of a horse. And now you\u2019d cast my brother out, again.\u201d</p><p>He caught her by the shoulders. \u201cDamn it, you are the one who is letting Jack come between us. You\u2019re so invested in this selfless martyr role. Somewhere inside you is that sixteen-year-old girl who believed she deserved her own happiness. The woman who has captivated me from the first time I held her and found I couldn\u2019t let go. I\u2019ve done my best to be understanding, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour best? Oh, Spencer. I know you too well to believe that. If you would accuse me of denying myself, then please queue up for your share of the blame. I\u2019ve never known a man so remarkable, so complex and caring ... and so determined to hide it from the world. If I were ever so lucky as to glimpse your true, shining best, I\u2019d probably expire where I stood from the brilliance.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d intended those words as a compliment, they damn well didn\u2019t feel like one. They felt like brilliant shards of glass.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSay what you will, Amelia, you can\u2019t deny that I\u2019m making an effort. And I\u2019m tired of coming in second to Jack for my pains. At least I\u2019m trying to secure your happiness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy happiness? How can I possibly be happy, when I know my brother is living on the London streets, brushing sleeves with danger every moment of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you\u2019ll have to learn. Because Jack isn\u2019t going to change.\u201d He tipped her chin and lowered his voice. \u201cSooner or later, you\u2019ll have to decide where your loyalties are. With him, or with me?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as though he were some sort of monster. Damn it, he wasn\u2019t a monster. He was human. He wanted to know his wife loved him above any other man. Wouldn\u2019t any husband want the same?</p><p>\u201cIf you knew me at all,\u201d she said in a shaky voice, \u201cyou would understand how dearly I love my family. And if you ask me to deny them ... you\u2019ve made the choice yourself.\u201d She grabbed the sheaf of legal papers from the table and clutched them to her chest. \u201cThese aren\u2019t signed yet. So long as this house belongs to the d\u2019Orsays, my brother is welcome in it. Jack stays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing good will come of it,\u201d he warned. \u201cHe\u2019ll only hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot half as much as you\u2019re hurting me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia ...\u201d He slowly stretched a hand toward her, but she flinched away before he\u2019d halved the gap.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said, jerking her chin toward the library. \u201cGo win your damn horse. We both know where your loyalties are.\u201d</p><p>She was so prickly and emotional and filled with wrongheaded notions ... he couldn\u2019t even conceive of how to argue with her.</p><p>So he did what she\u2019d asked. He went.</p><p>The library was small, and they huddled around the desk to play. Their game was brag. Piquet was Spencer\u2019s forte, but it was only a two-player game.</p><p>It took time to lay a trap, and no small amount of patience. The first and most difficult task was to create the illusion that chance had a seat at the table. For the first hour or so of play, Spencer won a few hands and purposely lost several others. On a few occasions, his opponents\u2019 superior play truly caught him off guard. He knew he ought to be using this time to observe Bellamy carefully. Every man, even the best of players, gave unconscious physical clues to what sort of cards he held. But Spencer just couldn\u2019t focus on the arch of Bellamy\u2019s eyebrow or the tapping of his finger. Memories of Amelia kept distracting him. He kept seeing her lovely blue eyes marred by redness. He heard her bitter words rattling in his ears. And other parts of him recalled the way she\u2019d lavished her passion on him earlier that day, as he\u2019d sat in this very chair. She had him more than distracted. He was damned confused.</p><p>She was right, to some extent. He had manipulated her with this holiday, along with everyone else. Purchasing the cottage in secret, conspiring with Rhys to get Bellamy to the card table. But did Amelia truly think her own imagining of this house party would have culminated in success? In her fantasy, she would open her house, her arms, and her heart to everyone, and Spencer would reveal a few long-held, mildly embarrassing secrets. Add in a week of angling and parlor games ... conflict resolved. The three men would emerge as friends.</p><p>A na\u00efve, impossible notion. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>As Bellamy shuffled the cards and prepared to deal, Spencer cleared his throat and looked to Rhys. \u201cSay, Ashworth ... we\u2019re not friends, are we?\u201d</p><p>A healed gash scored the soldier\u2019s face, and his eyebrow split as he looked up in surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019re not enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny further traumatic childhood incidents you feel moved to discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. You?\u201d</p><p>Spencer shook his head. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy rapped the deck to square it, then began to deal. \u201cWhile we\u2019re having this little chat, I\u2019ll take the opportunity to say I despise you both. And as far as you two are concerned, I was born to nomadic goatherds in Albania.\u201d</p><p>That settled it. So much for friendship. Spencer gathered his cards. No pair, few prospects. Time to make good on his deal with Rhys. \u201cLet\u2019s stop mincing around, then. Ten thousand.\u201d He scratched the sum on a piece of paper and shoved it to the center of the table.</p><p>Play turned to Rhys. \u201cI don\u2019t have ten thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accept your token as an even wager against mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen?\u201d His eyes said, I thought we agreed on fifteen. \u201cTwenty, and we\u2019ll call it an even exchange.\u201d</p><p>Sly bastard. Spencer didn\u2019t even feel like arguing. He just wanted this over. With a stub of charcoal, he altered the notation on the paper. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Ashworth shook the brass token loose from his purse and laid it on the table before him, giving Spencer an enigmatic look. \u201cIt\u2019s up to fate now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make my own fate, thank you.\u201d Bellamy lifted the corner of his cards where they lay on the table. His face remained impassive. Spencer expected the man to get out of the way, wait to see how things shook out between him and Ashworth before risking anything of his own.</p><p>But Bellamy wasn\u2019t that clever. He reached into his breast pocket and withdrew a brass coin. \u201cLet\u2019s do this. I\u2019m tired of pushing pennies back and forth. I need to talk to that whore before her memories fade any further and find out who was with Leo that night. Perhaps his companion could lead me to the killers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps his companion died too,\u201d Ashworth said.</p><p>\u201cWe would have known by now, if another gentleman of the ton went missing or turned up dead the same night. That wouldn\u2019t make sense.\u201d After a pause, Bellamy added thoughtfully, \u201cUnless he had something to do with the attack ...\u201d</p><p>Spencer groaned. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, stop looking for vast conspiracies in a random crime. No, it doesn\u2019t make sense. By definition, a senseless tragedy never will. Maybe the prostitute was lying, or simply confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Bellamy tapped his coin on the table testily. \u201cBut the sooner I talk to her, the sooner I\u2019ll know, won\u2019t I?\u201d He flung the token to the center of the table. \u201cOne hand. All ten tokens. Winner takes all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already put in twenty thousand,\u201d Spencer protested. \u201cYou expect me to put in all my tokens, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want the horse, or don\u2019t you?\u201d Bellamy\u2019s eyes were hard. \u201cThis is your only chance. Win or lose\u2014after this hand, I get up from the table and walk away.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer stared hard at the man\u2019s expression, scanning in vain for some tic in his jaw or telltale dilation of his pupils. Damn it, he ought to have forced himself to concentrate earlier. If he had, he might have known whether Bellamy truly had the cards to back up his bet, or just wanted to scare Spencer off, so he could leave the table with his token and dignity.</p><p>Regardless of what cards Bellamy held, Spencer knew his own were worthless. True, there were more cards to be dealt and he might catch a stroke of luck, but if Spencer called this bet, the odds were he would lose everything.</p><p>Well, not everything. The excessive drama of the thought struck even him as overwrought. What was truly at stake here? A few lumps of brass and an aging stallion? Suddenly, none of it seemed worth a damn. His wife, on the other hand\u2014now, Amelia was irreplaceable.</p><p>He\u2019d been pursuing this goal with such focus, for so long ... giving it up simply hadn\u2019t been an option. After all this time, he\u2019d practically lost sight of why he wanted the stallion in the first place. If he gave up on Osiris, he\u2019d reasoned at the outset, he would be giving up on Juno. And to give up on Juno would have felt uncomfortably close to giving up on himself. Would have, in the past. But this was the present. More to the point, this was the beginning of his future. The only reason they were gathered was because Leo Chatwick, his peer and contemporary, had died far too young. Was this truly what Spencer wanted inscribed on his own grave marker? \u201cBrilliant cardsharp, good with horses?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he imagined what would happen if he lost. He would leave all ten tokens and any stake in Osiris on this table, and then go upstairs to make amends to his wife. Pledge to make her his priority, and hope and pray that she could one day find it in her heart to return the sentiment. Cover her body with kisses; whisper words of love against her skin. Make love to her until neither of them had the strength to stand.</p> <p>How would losing feel? It would feel damn good. It would feel remarkably like a victory.</p><p>This was the moment to walk away.</p><p>Apparently, Bellamy had decided the same. He picked up the token and replaced it in his pocket as he rose. \u201cWell, then. If you haven\u2019t the stones\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Spencer told him, flipping Leo\u2019s token into the center of the desk. \u201cWe\u2019re going to finish this tonight. The other tokens are upstairs. Let me send a servant for the lockbox.\u201d</p><p>He rose from his chair, but before he could even reach the door, Amelia burst through it. Behind her came Lily, dressed in nightclothes and wrapper, her unbound hair hanging to her waist. Both women wore expressions of fear.</p><p>\u201cGood God, what is it?\u201d Spencer moved to take Amelia in his arms. To the devil with horses and cards ... At that moment, embracing her was the only thing in the world he wanted to do. It seemed the thing he\u2019d been made to do. She needed him, and she\u2019d come to him. He wouldn\u2019t let anything hurt her now.</p> <p>But as he reached for her, her arms stiffened. She held him off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve no time,\u201d she said, swallowing hard. \u201cClaudia is missing.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d Spencer\u2019s face turned the color of ash. He gripped her elbow. \u201cAre you certain? Perhaps she\u2019s only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s gone, and she\u2019s not alone.\u201d Amelia swallowed hard, wondering how she could possibly tell him this next. But she had to do it. If there was any hope, it depended on swift action. \u201cShe\u2019s gone with Jack. They left a note.\u201d</p><p>Raising her fist in the gap between them, she bade her fingers to relax. In her palm lay the crumpled scrap of paper she\u2019d found tacked to the kitchen doorjamb, in that pockmarked patch just below the lintel where countless coats of enamel had worn through to the grain. Her brothers had always left their messages there. The d\u2019Orsay Post, they called it. And true to form, Jack\u2019s message was succinct:</p><p>We\u2019re for Gretna.</p><p>The paper was signed by them both.</p> <p>Spencer stared at the words so fiercely, Amelia would not have been surprised to see the scrawled letters roust themselves from the paper and rearrange to spell different words, just to escape his displeasure. She too wished there were some way she could alter the facts.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d he asked brusquely.</p><p>\u201cWe ... we don\u2019t know. Obviously sometime since dinner, so a few hours at most. The horses are all still here, so they must be on foot.\u201d Surrendering the note, she knitted her fingers in a tight clasp. \u201cI can only imagine he\u2019s after her dowry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Lily said from behind her. \u201cI retired early, and of course I didn\u2019t hear her go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cMy ward isn\u2019t your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>He gave Amelia a sharp look, stabbing at her conscience. Of course, Claudia was partly her responsibility. And Jack ... Jack wouldn\u2019t even have been here, if she hadn\u2019t insisted he stay. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said feebly. \u201cThat he would run off with her like this, in the middle of the night ... I simply can\u2019t believe it of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can\u2019t. You haven\u2019t believed anything I\u2019ve told you of him. No matter what he does, you defend the rogue. Why should you stop now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s some misunderstanding, some other explanation,\u201d she said feebly. Feebly, because even she knew the words were foolishness.</p><p>Steeling his jaw, he headed for the desk. \u201cI told you nothing good would come of letting him stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d But she\u2019d been willing to take that risk, assuming stupidly that hers were the only feelings at stake. That if Jack wrought more mischief, he would be hurting only her. She\u2019d never dreamed his actions could affect Spencer and Claudia, too. Oh, Lord.</p><p>By this time, Bellamy and Ashworth were on their feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Bellamy asked.</p><p>\u201cMy brother has eloped with Claudia,\u201d Amelia told him. When Spencer shot her a look, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s not as though we can hide it from them. For God\u2019s sake, let them help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich way would they have gone, Morland?\u201d Ashworth asked.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Spencer looked to Amelia. \u201cYou know the area best.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged helplessly, catching one fingertip between her opposite thumb and forefinger and pinching it hard. \u201cAny number of ways. Most likely toward Gloucester, to catch a mail coach headed north. But to get there they might have gone north through Colford, or east, toward Lydney. Then there\u2019s the river. They might have headed south toward the Severn, intending to ferry over to Aust and continue to London. The fastest coaches to Scotland leave from there. Or they could have hoped to board a ship ...\u201d Her voice dwindled, along with her hopes. The possibilities seemed endless; the likelihood of catching them, slim. \u201cIn any direction, they\u2019re not much more than a half-dozen miles from transport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ashworth said, \u201cthere are three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll order my fastest horses saddled,\u201d Spencer said, pulling open a low drawer of the desk. \u201cWe\u2019ll each take a different route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely when did I offer my assistance?\u201d Bellamy asked.</p><p>\u201cJust now.\u201d Spencer withdrew a pistol from the desk drawer. With a bit of show, presumably for Bellamy\u2019s benefit, he jammed the gun into the waistband of his trousers.</p><p>At the sight of the weapon, Amelia\u2019s joints went weak.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d Bellamy acquiesced with an impatient tug at his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll go south, toward the Severn and Town. If I find them, you\u2019ll hear of it. But I\u2019ll continue on to London if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. You\u2019ll find her at the Blue Turtle, in Hounslow. You\u2019ll probably need to pay her account.\u201d</p><p>Amelia had no idea what that last bit meant, but Bellamy seemed to understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go north,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cIf they\u2019ve taken a coaching route, someone ought to have seen them on the way to Gloucester.\u201d</p><p>Spencer said, \u201cI\u2019ll take east, then, through the forest.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy drew a deep breath and riffled his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll be needing proper boots.\u201d</p><p>He left the room, and Lily slipped out the door after him.</p><p>Ashworth went next, tossing a parting comment over his shoulder: \u201cWe\u2019ll meet you at the stable.\u201d</p><p>Spencer\u2019s reply was a curt nod.</p><p>Amelia stood alone with her husband, hugging her arms across her chest. She watched as he shook open a pouch and counted shot into his palm, then replaced the round balls of lead and cinched the bag tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSave the apologies.\u201d He exhaled roughly, plucking his coat from the back of the chair and shrugging into it. Bracing his hands on the desk, he fixed her with a look of sharp concentration. \u201cGive me the route. Road names, landmarks. Any description you can offer.\u201d</p><p>She did her best, though it had been years since she\u2019d traveled straight through the Forest of Dean. And what details she remembered\u2014the primroses and violets, the carpets of ferns dotted with mushrooms, the remarkable sight of ducks nesting in a chestnut tree\u2014weren\u2019t likely to help him tonight. She forced herself to focus and gave him what information she could: stream crossings, steep grades.</p><p>Until she was interrupted by a pattering sound.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Spencer muttered, stooping to peer through the window glass. \u201cNow it\u2019s raining.\u201d</p><p>Could this get any worse? Amelia hoped it would only be a brief summer shower. The thought of Jack and Claudia on foot in the rain ... not to mention, the three gentlemen in pursuit on horseback, riding over slippery, unfamiliar terrain ... And all of this in the dark of night, with no moon.</p><p>Bloody hell, indeed.</p><p>He brushed past her on his way to the door. She caught his arm, swiveling him to face her. \u201cSpencer, wait. Do you blame me for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to stand here and discuss blame, Amelia. I have to find them and bring Claudia back before she\u2019s lost her reputation. Or worse.\u201d</p><p>She cringed, understanding his meaning all too well. Jack might be desperate, but surely her brother wouldn\u2019t defile a fifteen-year-old innocent? She wished she could reject the idea with greater certainty. At this point, she hardly knew what to think. \u201cIs there nothing I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d Cupping her chin roughly, he tilted her face to his. \u201cDo you hear me? Stay here, in case they come home.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and released his sleeve. \u201cWhat will you do, if you find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to protect Claudia.\u201d</p><p>Fear drummed in her chest. He meant he would deal harshly, even violently, with Jack if he felt it necessary. And given the circumstances, she would not have asked him to show mercy ... if Claudia\u2019s abductor were any other man.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she choked out. \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill him. I just couldn\u2019t bear it if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you lost your brother,\u201d he finished bitterly. With one last wounded glance, he turned to leave. \u201cI know what he means to you, Amelia. Believe me, I know it all too well.\u201d</p><p>After two hours of pacing the drawing room, Amelia thought she would go mad with worry. For her brother, for Claudia, for Spencer ... even for Lord Ashworth and Mr. Bellamy. The more time that passed, the harder it became to imagine any happy outcome. If Claudia and Jack spent the night together away from home\u2014the girl would be ruined. Whether or not they were found before reaching Scotland, whether or not Jack had actually touched her. Spencer might be forced to let them marry with his blessing, simply to preserve some shred of her reputation. He would not consider that a happy outcome, and neither would Amelia. Jack and Claudia would no doubt live to regret it, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>Assuming Spencer let Jack live.</p><p>Her skin prickled with dread. She\u2019d been desolated by the mere idea of choosing between them. Now the events of this night threatened to make the decision for her. And Spencer might never forgive her if Claudia came to harm.</p> <p>Lily dozed fitfully in an armchair nearby, but Amelia knew she\u2019d never find sleep. Her mind buzzed, her thoughts flitting from one possibility to the next. None of it made any sense to her, and that was what kept her circling the carpet, trailing her fingers along the mantel, skipping to the windowsill, then tracing the back of the divan. She understood why Jack would wish to elope with Claudia\u2014obviously a duke\u2019s ward would come with a significant dowry. But why on earth would Claudia agree to go with him? Jack was handsome enough, and he could be charming when he wished to be ... but he certainly didn\u2019t look his fittest at the moment, and the girl had scarcely spent any time in his company. Claudia obviously resented Amelia and Spencer\u2019s marriage, but was she so thoroughly steeped in adolescent rebellion that she would go so far as to elope out of spite?</p><p>And ... Scotland? He would have to forgive her for saying it, but Jack just didn\u2019t seem industrious enough to stage an elopement to Gretna Green. It was a long, hard journey, and an expensive one. He obviously had no funds, and Claudia\u2019s pin money wouldn\u2019t go far. Perhaps they had some goods they hoped to sell.</p><p>Had they taken things from the house?</p><p>Driven by a sense of dread, and the desire to be anywhere but the drawing room, she grabbed a candlestick and charged up the stairs to her and Spencer\u2019s bedchamber. She yanked open the small corner closet and pried up the panel at the bottom, holding the candle over the hidden cache ... straining her eyes into the darkness, searching ...</p><p>There. It was still there, the cloth-wrapped bundle of Mama\u2019s jewelry. None of it was worth a great deal\u2014not in coin, anyway. But the strands of seed pearls and topaz earrings were priceless to Amelia.</p> <p>After replacing the secret panel, she stood.</p><p>And immediately crumpled back to the floor. She had to pull herself together. Her heart pounded in her chest, and she felt so lightheaded.</p><p>Oh, God. Suddenly it all made sense.</p><p>Stay here.</p><p>Those were his words to her, his only request. Stay here, in case she comes home.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Spencer,\u201d Amelia muttered as she stepped over the cottage threshold. She wrapped her foul-weather cloak around her shoulders and closed the door behind her. The rain was lighter now, but cold. The moon shone through a gap in the clouds, but Amelia didn\u2019t trust it to last. She reached for the carriage lamp hanging beside the door. Splashing through shallow puddles, she made a hasty sprint for the stable.</p> <p>She simply couldn\u2019t stay put in the cottage and wait. If her suppositions were right\u2014and the small voice in her gut told her they were\u2014Claudia was in even greater danger than Spencer realized. But the girl might not be so very far away.</p><p>Ducking into the humble stables that temporarily housed beasts bred for kings, Amelia saw that her mature, steady gelding had been left behind. Of course, the men would have taken the fastest mounts.</p><p>\u201cNow there, Captain. Would you like to go for a ride?\u201d She extended her hand and let the horse sniff it before cautiously giving him a pat. Stretching up on her toes, she unlooped his halter from the ring. The gelding shuffled forward, and Amelia realized that\u2014logically\u2014her saddle had been removed. As had the bit and bridle. She swung the carriage lamp and her gaze toward the tack hanging on the wall. Could she even remember how it all went together?</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Startled by a sudden nudge at her waist, she nearly dropped the carriage lamp. It was only Captain nosing her pocket, looking for a treat. But it made her realize she was completely out of her depth. It would be stupid of her to try to saddle him herself, and perilous to her unborn child if she took a kick or a fall. She would have to go on foot.</p><p>The decision made, she left the stable. Eschewing the smooth but circuitous carriage lane, she hurried toward the narrow, winding footpath that climbed the bluff. Few trees grew here, and the way was paved with exposed limestone and moss\u2014rain didn\u2019t improve the traction of either surface. She slipped and stumbled as she went, at one point clawing her fingernails into a bit of turf to keep from tumbling headlong into the river. Somehow she managed to reach the bluff\u2019s plateau with body and carriage lamp intact.</p><p>She allowed herself a few moments\u2019 rest and thanksgiving. And then she dashed for the ruins of Beauvale Castle. That was where the d\u2019Orsay boys had always got up to their mischief. As she covered the half-mile\u2019s distance to the walls of crumbling stone, she said a prayer that old habits would have endured.</p><p>By the time she reached the gatehouse, she was gasping for breath. Her heart lightened as she saw the door was already ajar. She pushed the slab of oak open and thrust the carriage lamp inside.</p><p>Jack stood in the center of the darkened tower. His hair was matted to his forehead in thick, pale locks. He scarcely looked surprised to see her.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, Amelia.\u201d He cast a glance over his shoulder. Behind him, Claudia shivered in the corner, hugging her knees to her chest. \u201cI swear to you, I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool,\u201d she said, hanging the lamp on a candle sconce blackened with centuries of soot. She brushed past him to go to the girl. \u201cDo you think she\u2019d agree to run off with you on the basis of a dashing smile? You\u2019re not so very handsome as that.\u201d</p><p>Hurrying to the corner, Amelia knelt before Claudia. The girl\u2019s lips were blue and quivering; her eyes, unfocused. Tears and rain streaked her face.</p><p>Amelia untied her cloak and quickly arranged it around the girl\u2019s trembling shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear. Everything will be fine. Claudia.\u201d She waited until the girl met her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I know. I know everything.\u201d</p><p>And then the girl fell into Amelia\u2019s arms, sobbing helplessly against her shoulder. Amelia held her tight, murmuring words of reassurance. The poor dear. She\u2019d been needing this embrace for so long, and Amelia had been too absorbed in her own problems to realize all Claudia\u2019s rudeness had been aimed at pushing her away\u2014not because she resented Amelia, but because she was afraid of anyone learning her secret.</p><p>Even Amelia couldn\u2019t have possibly guessed the truth until today, after that tearful epiphany in the kitchen. The girl\u2019s aloof demeanor, her strange moods, her wild fluctuations in appetite and illness in the coach ...</p><p>Claudia was with child.</p><p>\u201cYou poor thing.\u201d She stroked the girl\u2019s wet hair. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d What a terrible burden for a fifteen-year-old girl to struggle under on her own. \u201cDid it happen in York?\u201d</p><p>Claudia nodded against her. \u201cMy music master. I was so lonely there, and he was so kind to me, at first. He promised I wouldn\u2019t ...\u201d The girl\u2019s voice broke, and Amelia held her tighter still. \u201cOh, Amelia. I was such a fool. And how will I ever tell him?\u201d</p><p>Amelia knew she wasn\u2019t referring to the music master.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear it,\u201d the girl sobbed. \u201cHe\u2019ll be so furious with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Amelia said, shifting to cradle the girl in her arms. She rocked them both, gently. \u201cI will tell him. And if he reacts with anger, it won\u2019t be anger at you. He cares for you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought ... if I ran away, married\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone would believe the child was Jack\u2019s,\u201d Amelia finished for her. \u201cAnd you would never have to tell the truth.\u201d She rubbed Claudia\u2019s back briskly, feeling the girl warm in her arms. Wet muslin clung to her body, clearly delineating a rounded belly\u2014the telltale sign her high-waisted gowns had heretofore concealed.</p><p>\u201cIt was all her idea.\u201d From the other side of the small room, Jack spoke up. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was with child until the rain soaked us through. You must believe me. She just came to me, and I was so desperate ...\u201d His back met the stone wall, and he slid down it until he sat on the floor. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched her, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why, Jack? How can you do this to me? Don\u2019t you know how I\u2019ve defended you? Again and again, I\u2019ve helped you, believed in you. And this is your thanks, absconding with my husband\u2019s ward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a bad way, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Spencer told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse than even he knows. Exile or death, those are my options.\u201d He buried his face in his stacked arms. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d mind the second.\u201d</p><p>His words caught Amelia sharply in the chest, driving a wedge between her ribs and slowly levering them apart. She thought of going to her brother, but then Claudia whimpered. Instead, she tightened her arms about the girl to offer more comfort and warmth.</p><p>And then she began to shiver with fear. Between Claudia and Jack, the two of them needed so much. Not only comfort and warmth, but reassurance, assistance, absolution. Amelia wasn\u2019t sure she had enough within her to give them, and even if she did ... there might be nothing left. Perhaps she would simply disappear.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame him,\u201d Claudia whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s right. It was all my idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he should have known better. You\u2019re fifteen years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly sixteen,\u201d she sniffed.</p><p>\u201cSixteen.\u201d Jack raised his head and stared unfocused toward the ceiling. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember the summer you were sixteen, Amelia? You were engaged to Poste. Hugh and I, we spent the whole summer up here at the gatehouse, plotting to stop the wedding. We may have been only thirteen and twelve, but we were blood sworn to never surrender you to that decrepit troll. We made black-powder grenades to create a diversion, a catapult ...\u201d He gave a hollow chuckle. \u201cThere was some strategy involving riled-up chickens, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in Amelia\u2019s eyes, even as she laughed to imagine the confluence of chickens, black powder, and a catapult interrupting her wedding. Old Mr. Poste would have likely expired on the spot. \u201cWhat valiant plans. You must have been gravely disappointed when I cried off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His gaze met hers\u2014utterly devoid of cynicism or deceit. \u201cWe were relieved, Amelia. Not just me and Hugh, but everyone. You deserved so much better. That\u2019s why ...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s damned miserable, knowing I\u2019ve driven you to marry Morland now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, that\u2019s completely different. Spencer is nothing like Mr. Poste. I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love everyone, no matter how undeserving. He\u2019s still not good enough for you. No one is.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIf Hugh were alive, we\u2019d have found a way to interrupt that wedding, too. Chickens, black powder, whatever it took.\u201d</p><p>Had they laid siege to all Bryanston Square, she doubted Spencer could have been dissuaded. If he wouldn\u2019t stop the wedding to answer murder allegations, a homemade catapult wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jack said, \u201cif Hugh were alive, everything would be different, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Her brother tipped his head back against the wall and stared up at the leaking ceiling. \u201cWe spent our boyhoods in this crumbling heap. Couldn\u2019t bear to come back here, after. Thought I\u2019d be relieved to see it sold, but ...\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed. So that\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t been able to get Jack out here last year. The same memories that comforted her were simply too much for him.</p><p>\u201cI should have gone with him. I hated Laurent for buying Hugh a commission, and not me. I always followed him everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t follow him now, Jack. Not to the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said forcefully.</p><p>Water dripped slowly from the rafters. Plink, plink, plink. And then a realization exploded inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cMy God. That\u2019s why you\u2019re just sitting here, isn\u2019t it? You want to be found. You want Spencer to call you out.\u201d</p><p>Again, he said nothing.</p> <p>Her brother wished to die. It was an admission that should have wrung her heart till it hurt\u2014and it did. But it also angered her beyond belief.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered anyone but yourself, with this plan of yours? I know you loved Hugh. We all loved Hugh. His death devastated the entire family. So now you would inflict that devastation on us again, by goading my husband into a duel?\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cI tell you now, that will not happen. Spencer is not a murderer, and I won\u2019t allow you to make him one.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed Claudia\u2019s hair. \u201cAnd this girl is fifteen years old, Jack. I don\u2019t care whose idea it was, or what assumptions you were laboring under when you took her from the house. Nothing excuses this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Jack hugged his own knees and rocked himself. She thought she heard him weeping.</p><p>The sound only frustrated her further. Her brother wasn\u2019t the frightened, ill-used, powerless child in this room. That role was Claudia\u2019s, and in his self-centered myopia he\u2019d done nothing to help the girl. For God\u2019s sake, she was pregnant, terrified, chilled through with rain, and Jack was keeping her huddled in this drafty tower. He hadn\u2019t even offered her his coat.</p> <p>Strangely enough, Amelia was glad of it. That small example of thoughtlessness might be inconsequential compared to his other misdeeds\u2014but it was this final ounce of selfishness that tipped the scales. For many months, she\u2019d believed she could save her brother if only she loved him hard enough. But she saw her error clearly now. She\u2019d accused Spencer of being insular, but Jack was the one incapable of seeing beyond his own grief. Other men lost brothers, friends, even children and wives\u2014and still avoided abject dissolution. Why Jack had stumbled into the chasm when others managed to skirt it, she would never know. But she finally understood it was beyond her power to pull him out.</p><p>She murmured to Claudia, \u201cDo you feel well enough to stand?\u201d At the girl\u2019s nod, Amelia hooked a hand under her elbow. \u201cCome, then. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me, Amelia?\u201d Jack asked weakly. \u201cWhat becomes of me now? You\u2019re so fond of telling me what to do.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as she helped the girl to her feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Jack. I truly don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>In the final black hour of night, Spencer crested the ridge of forest and began his descent toward Briarbank. The moon shone brightly now, though a mist still hung over the earth, blanketing the ground with moisture.</p> <p>The scent of powder clung to his clothing. His boots were spattered with blood. His limbs were boneless with fatigue, and the early morning air was so humid, he felt as though he were swimming through it. Struggling, flailing. Drowning.</p><p>He could only pray Ashworth or Bellamy had succeeded where he\u2019d failed.</p><p>He passed the stables on his way to the house. He was almost afraid to turn his head as he walked past the small, humble horse barn\u2014but he made himself do so, wondering if he would see either of the other men\u2019s horses returned. He didn\u2019t. But what he did see chilled his blood.</p><p>Captain was missing. Amelia\u2019s steady gelding, gone. He\u2019d been tied near the barn entrance, and with the moon so bright, Spencer ought to have been able to glimpse his gray coat from here. Nothing.</p><p>His legs\u2014or rather, the numb, wooden stumps currently occupying his boots\u2014quickly pumped to life, propelling him toward the barn. He rushed inside, looking frantically from stall to stall. No Captain to be found. Oh, Christ. She barely knew how to hold the reins. Surely she hadn\u2019t dared to take the horse out herself. With her inexperience and these conditions, to do so would have been an invitation to disaster.</p><p>His breath came quick and panicked now, and with every inhalation pain stabbed his side. He pressed an arm to his ribs, wondering if he\u2019d broken just one, as he\u2019d initially thought, or several. Wincing in pain, he half ran, half stumbled out of the barn and toward the cottage. The windows were dark, save a faint light from the library window. He moved toward it, drawn by that warm glow that seemed the embodiment of hope itself. Leaving the paved walk, he headed straight for the window and peered inside.</p><p>There she was. Seated in a chair by the wall of bookshelves, a sheaf of papers in her hand. Alone.</p><p>Gratitude swept the last bit of strength from his knees. He propped a hand on the wall for support, sucking in a lungful of air and relief. If he\u2019d lost her, he couldn\u2019t have borne it.</p> <p>Well, she might be lost to him yet, after tonight. And God only knew where Claudia was right now. But he stood there for a moment, gazing through the window glass at her pale, lovely profile and trying to imagine he wouldn\u2019t emerge from this night a complete failure at protecting everyone and everything he\u2019d ever loved.</p><p>He went to the door and found it unlatched. Within seconds he stood in the entry of the library. His jaw worked a few times, sliding his thirst-thickened tongue over a tooth that had jarred loose. He couldn\u2019t think of a word to say.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d With shaking fingers, Amelia swept the papers aside. \u201cSleeping upstairs. She is safe.\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded his lungs, until his chest ached with it. Still, he couldn\u2019t find words. So he crossed the room, knelt before his wife, laid his head in her lap, and wept.</p><p>\u201cOh, Spencer.\u201d Her fingers smoothed the hair from his brow. \u201cLord, you smell of death. And you\u2019re all scratched and bruised. What\u2019s happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said, curling one arm around her legs. \u201cCaptain is gone from the barn. When I saw it, I thought perhaps you\u2019d ...\u201d He clutched her tighter, feeling that moment of black terror more keenly than before. \u201cGod, Amelia. You must promise to never leave me.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers stilled in his hair. His heartbeat scudded to a stop, as well.</p><p>\u201cI have news,\u201d she said at length. \u201cIt will be difficult for you to hear.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to keep his face buried in her skirts out of sheer cowardice, but he forced himself to sit back on his heels, rub his bleary eyes clear with one hand, and face this \u201cnews\u201d like a man.</p><p>She pressed her lips together, hesitating. \u201cThere is no easy way to say this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say it straight out.\u201d He propped his arms on either side of her skirt, bracing himself for the worst.</p><p>\u201cClaudia is with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaudia. Claudia, with child?\u201d Emotion struck him in the chest. Several emotions, as a matter of fact, hitting him one after the other in quick succession, like a series of punishing blows: shock, disbelief, sorrow, guilt. Fury. A dozen questions tumbled in his mind, but only one really mattered. \u201cWhose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Jack\u2019s,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been. It was her music master in York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Spencer bit out.</p><p>\u201cWhat good would that serve? The man doesn\u2019t even know. And from Claudia\u2019s own account, it seems the tutor seduced her, but she was not ... unwilling.\u201d</p><p>The mere idea of a man touching his ward sent nausea rolling through his gut. \u201cShe\u2019s fifteen years old. A child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any longer.\u201d Amelia grasped one of his hands and folded it in both of hers. \u201cShe\u2019s so frightened, Spencer. She\u2019s known for some time, but she\u2019s terrified of how you\u2019ll react. Just the same, I think she meant to speak with you. Earlier.\u201d</p><p>Earlier. When he and Amelia had been ... otherwise engaged in this very room and they\u2019d sent her away. And afterward, Spencer never had spoken with her as promised. Truth be told, he\u2019d been avoiding speaking with Claudia for weeks.</p><p>\u201cThe elopement was her suggestion,\u201d Amelia continued quietly. \u201cBut Jack seized the idea eagerly. He\u2019s desperate for funds; she was desperate to conceal her pregnancy. It was a ridiculous plan, and I think they both knew it. They didn\u2019t make it any farther than the castle gatehouse, in the end. That\u2019s where I found them, wet and chilled through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou climbed up there? In the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the idea did cross my mind to take Captain, but I realized quickly what a stupid notion that was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d He bent his head to her lap again. \u201cI should have known you were too clever to attempt a stunt like that.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cIf it had been just my safety at stake, I might have been tempted to try, but ...\u201d He felt her sigh. \u201cI know you must blame me for this. If only I hadn\u2019t insisted Jack stay, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, lifting his head to capture her gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. Nothing excuses Jack\u2019s actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said in a rush, squeezing his hand. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my right to deal with him, Amelia. He all but kidnapped and ruined an innocent girl, and he must be made to face consequences for it. You can\u2019t keep protecting him any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I\u2019ve already sent him away.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his heels, stunned.</p><p>\u201cFor both his good and yours. This can\u2019t end in violence.\u201d Averting her eyes, she swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019ve promised to meet with him soon. I let him borrow Captain, but I swear you\u2019ll have the horse returned to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlast the horse.\u201d As if he gave a damn about the horse. He\u2019d give every last stallion, mare, and gelding in his stables this instant to undo this night\u2019s events. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jack gone?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look him in the eye. \u201cSpencer, you know I can\u2019t tell y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. And you will, because I\u2019m asking it.\u201d He grabbed her chin and forced her to face him. Devil take it, he couldn\u2019t abide this any longer. \u201cYou have to choose, Amelia. I\u2019m damned tired of always coming in second to that brigand, watching you squander all your sympathy and tenderness on him. This time, you cannot be loyal to us both. He abducted my ward. Either you tell me where Jack\u2019s gone and let me deal with him, or ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d Red rimmed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOr you leave. You go to him, and you leave me. I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d</p><p>All throughout his brain, alarms trumpeted, trilled, blared. Recant, you idiot. Take it all back, before she realizes what you\u2019ve said. He knew, rationally, that he\u2019d just made the most impulsive, ill-calculated, goddamned foolish wager of his life, forcing the issue now. Asking her to make such a choice on a morning when lives and futures hung in the balance. But his brain wasn\u2019t making the decisions at the moment. His heart was speaking for him, and his heart was in shreds. He needed her\u2014all of her. And if she couldn\u2019t give him everything, he\u2019d best face it now and start learning to live with the pain.</p><p>Her eyes told him her answer, long before her lips could form the words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I must go to him this morning.\u201d</p><p>The alarms in his brain muted, one by one, leaving only a low, mournful bugled dirge: It\u2019s what you deserve, you witless fool. Now she\u2019s leaving you. This morning.</p><p>It was nearly morning, wasn\u2019t it? Faint light seeped into the room, illuminating the sweet, familiar features of her face. God, she\u2019d always been so lovely at daybreak. Even that very first morning, in the carriage. He\u2019d decided then and there to marry her, claim her, make her his own. And somewhere between that dawn and this one, he\u2019d grown to love her best when she clearly belonged to herself. It just wasn\u2019t in him to force her to stay. He wanted her willing, or not at all.</p><p>Dawn might be breaking over the river bluff, but a dark, endless night loomed inside Spencer\u2019s soul. He stared down at the crescents of blood and grit beneath his fingernails, the milky white quarter-moons of hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>She said, \u201cYou should take Claudia home to Braxton Hall. She ought to be seen by her physician, for one thing. But more than that, she needs comfort and guidance. The girl needs you, Spencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d Oh, hell. He should just say it. \u201cBut I need you. I\u2019ve no idea what to do with her, or even how to talk to her about such a thing.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a wry smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a man of frightening intelligence. I have faith in you to figure it out.\u201d She reached for the papers on the desk and furled them into a scroll, but not before he recognized them as the still-unsigned purchase agreement for Briarbank. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking these with me.\u201d</p><p>He blinked furiously. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Yes. In the light of morning, it all was too painfully clear. When her feelings for him clashed against her obligations to family ... the d\u2019Orsay pride would win out every time. She would tend to her brother\u2019s needs before his. She wouldn\u2019t allow her family cottage to become theirs. And by refusing to share her, Spencer had driven her away. He\u2019d forced her to choose between her husband and her family, and now he must abide by her choice. No matter how much it hurt.</p><p>And damn, did it hurt. As he shifted his weight from one knee to the other, his ribs gave a sharp twinge.</p><p>Her gaze fell to their hands as she continued, \u201cThere is one thing more I must tell you. I suspect I, too, am with child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, God. Oh, Amelia.\u201d Never had words filled him with such bright joy and such utter misery at the same time. The image of her body swelled with his child, the thought of cradling their infant in his arms ... it was like a small star had burned through the atmosphere and blazed a trail straight for his heart. He wanted a family with her as he\u2019d never wanted anything in his life, and nothing should have made him happier than this news. But at the same time, his own arrogant words came back to haunt him. I give you security; you give me an heir. She was leaving him this morning, and she carried within her the perfect excuse to never come back.</p><p>Spencer said a fervent prayer to God for a girl.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked, swallowing hard. \u201cIs there anything you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him, smiling a little at her belly. \u201cVery fit indeed. D\u2019Orsay women are built for breeding, you know. Sturdy.\u201d</p><p>Before he could grasp a few of the thousand adjectives that described her with far greater justice than \u201csturdy,\u201d her gaze slanted away.</p><p>\u201cYou never finished your game,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He followed her gaze to the desktop. Atop the blotter, their cards and wagers lay untouched, frozen in time. In the center were his note for twenty thousand pounds and two of the Stud Club tokens: Rhys\u2019s and Leo\u2019s. Bellamy had never laid his token down, and Spencer never had the opportunity to fetch the remaining seven from upstairs.</p><p>Not that it mattered anymore.</p><p>He rose to his feet slowly, feeling aches in muscles he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d strained. He suspected his injuries would take turns announcing their presence over the course of the next few days. As he took a step, pain shot through his ribs, and he grimaced, leaning one hand on the desk for support.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s mercy, Spencer.\u201d She was at his side. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you?\u201d</p><p>With morning light filtering into the room, she was no doubt noting the abrasions on his skin, the gore spattering his boots, the shredded cuff of his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cTook a fall,\u201d he said, drawing a painful breath. \u201cI\u2019ve broken a rib or two, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send for the doctor immediately. Are you cut somewhere? There\u2019s so much blood ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t ask for an explanation. Unfortunately. He could have deflected a question, but this damn endearing patient silence thing she always did ... he had no defense to that.</p><p>\u201cI was on Juno,\u201d he said quickly, wanting to have it out and over with. \u201cOn the way back from Lydney she stepped in a hole and fell. Threw me clear of her, fortunately. I could have been banged up far worse. But her leg was broken, in more than one place. She was in a great deal of pain. No way to get her back here for treatment, and even if there was, she\u2019d have been completely lamed, so ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cYou had to shoot her.\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned as he confirmed her suspicions with a nod.</p><p>\u201cSpencer.\u201d Wiping her eyes with her hand, she surveyed his torso. \u201cWill I hurt you terribly if I give you a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take it anyway.\u201d</p><p>She moved toward him gingerly and slid her arms beneath his coat, around his waist. And then, with agonizing slowness, she brought her body flush with his and buried her face in his shoulder. It still wasn\u2019t enough. He wrapped one arm around her shoulders and crushed her tight to his chest. And yes, it hurt like the devil\u2014but not nearly as much as it was going to hurt when he inevitably had to let her go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said, weeping against his soiled coat. \u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry, for Jack, Claudia, Juno, everything. I wish things were different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Sniffing and dabbing at her eyes with her wrist, she pulled away. \u201cI\u2019d best go dress and pack my things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He pulled a handkerchief from his breast pocket and held it out to her, knowing she\u2019d recognize it even without opening it to view the stitching. If she was truly leaving him, he ought to give it back. Somehow he mustered the ghost of an irreverent grin. \u201cCan\u2019t a duchess afford handkerchiefs?\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, she took it. Stared at it a moment. And then she left.</p><p>He stood there for a while, exhausted and in too much pain to move. It might have been a short while or a long while\u2014he really didn\u2019t know. He likely would have still been standing there at midday, had Ashworth not rapped on the door.</p><p>\u201cI hope they\u2019re here,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re nowhere between Colford and Gloucester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d Spencer replied. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Ashworth grunted. \u201cAs it should be, then.\u201d His eyes narrowed as he took in Spencer\u2019s gory boots. \u201cNow, when you say \u2018gone,\u2019 do you mean ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019d blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his,\u201d he said, indicating the blood spattering his boots. \u201cMy mare took a bad fall. Had to ...\u201d He swore, glancing at the waxing trapezoid of sunlight shining through the window. \u201cI have to get out there and bury her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cI\u2019ve dug a grave or two in my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out all night already. I can\u2019t ask you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask. I offered. And I\u2019ve worked through a night or two in my time, as well.\u201d He kicked his boot against the doorjamb. \u201cIt\u2019s no more than any friend would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case ...\u201d Spencer sighed, dragging a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful for the help.\u201d He gestured toward the desktop and the aborted card game. \u201cDon\u2019t neglect to take your winnings.\u201d</p><p>The soldier\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWe were interrupted. I don\u2019t recall anyone winning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left the game first. Anything on the table is my forfeit. Technically, Bellamy never placed a bet. Besides, my cards were rubbish. I would have lost anyway.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI wanted to end this joke of a club once and for all, but it seems Harcliffe isn\u2019t through poking fun at us yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Bellamy will find the man responsible for his death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he finds him every time he looks in a mirror. That\u2019s the damn problem.\u201d Spencer took the note and two tokens and held them out. \u201cJust take them, Rhys. Aren\u2019t you the great believer in fate? Perhaps it was meant to be.\u201d</p><p>They took their time returning to Braxton Hall, traveling at a slow pace out of consideration for Claudia\u2019s stomach and Spencer\u2019s healing ribs. He rode with her in the coach. It seemed right to keep her company, and he needn\u2019t worry about giving Juno exercise anymore.</p><p>God. There\u2019d been so much lost in the past week, he didn\u2019t know where to begin grieving. Juno, his marriage, Claudia\u2019s innocence\u2014all were casualties. The fault was shared among many, but he blamed only himself. Amelia had been right. If he\u2019d only been more open with those around him, all of it might have been avoided.</p><p>Still, he didn\u2019t know how to begin fresh. He and Claudia traveled the entire journey in silence, save for the most banal of discussions. Which inn to choose for their stopover; whether the weather would hold fair. He didn\u2019t want to press his ward to talk until she was ready. They had months yet. Ample time to discuss.</p><p>They reached home on the fourth day, rather late. But the days were still long in summer, and an extended gray-gold twilight stubbornly held the night at bay. While the servants brought in the trunks and prepared their rooms, Spencer ordered a light supper brought to his library and invited Claudia to join him.</p><p>To his surprise, she agreed.</p><p>They shared a tray of sandwiches, and then he watched her eat tarts and sip chocolate. When the hour grew late enough that their rooms ought to have been readied for bed, she addressed him.</p><p>\u201cWould you read to me? Like you used to do when I was a girl?\u201d She gave her cooling chocolate a deep, searching look. \u201cI ... I rather miss it.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cOf course. Have you any particular book in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You choose.\u201d</p><p>He chose Shakespeare\u2014the comedies, naturally. God knew they\u2019d seen enough tragedy of late.</p><p>Leafing through the volume, he located Act I of The Tempest and began to read. Claudia curled her legs under her skirt and rested her head on the arm of the divan, closing her eyes. He couldn\u2019t tell whether she was still listening or had fallen asleep, so he just kept reading, for himself. It had been too long since he\u2019d read through Shakespeare. The plays only made sense to him when read aloud, and it felt deuced awkward to sit around by oneself, reading to the candlewick.</p><p>He read clear through to the end that night, then drew a blanket over Claudia\u2019s sleeping form and left her to rest undisturbed. The next evening after dinner, he read through three acts of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream before her light snoring intervened. They finished the play the next night, and then she asked for an old favorite: Johnson\u2019s Rasselas. He remembered how, as a girl, Claudia had enjoyed the story of the fabled Abyssinian prince traveling the world in search of contentment. It was the adventure that held her attention then\u2014the princesses and pyramids. Spencer wondered if she remembered that in the end, the prince never found the happiness he sought.</p><p>As he paused to sip his brandy and turn a page, Claudia suddenly sat up on the divan. \u201cWhat will become of me?\u201d</p><p>At last, here they came to it. Feeling both grateful and apprehensive, he laid aside the book. \u201cThere are a few alternatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I see them, they are three. If you wish to be married, I could find a man to marry you. A good man of limited means, who will benefit from the connection. He must agree to raise the child as his own and delay any further\u201d\u2014he shifted in his chair\u2014\u201cchildbearing until you are ready.\u201d</p><p>She studied her palm. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly like that alternative.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. Neither did he.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to preserve your reputation,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou can give birth in secret. The child would be fostered with a local family, and you would be free to have your debut season, be courted by suitors, and marry where you liked. Perhaps you might see the child on occasion, but you would never be able to acknowledge him as your own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cHer.

You said there was a third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe third option,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cwould be to give birth and keep the child. You would be disgraced, and your chances of making a good marriage would be slim. You most certainly would never know the excitement of a London season.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I would have my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He allowed her a moment\u2019s contemplation.</p><p>Leaning forward and bracing his elbows on his knees, he said, \u201cThey are none of them easy choices. Your life will be drastically altered, no matter which you take. But you should also know this. Whichever course you choose, you may be assured of having my support, both material and otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Amelia\u2019s as well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ... I can\u2019t speak for Amelia.\u201d God, saying her name aloud after so many days apart ... He missed her, terribly. What he would not give to have her here. She would know what to say to Claudia, how to comfort her. How to cross the room and fold the girl into a warm hug, in a way that didn\u2019t feel awkward and forced. But she wasn\u2019t here, and he had no one to blame for her absence but himself. What the hell had he been thinking, forcing her to choose between him and her family? Her love for her family was in her blood; it was who she was. It was the reason they\u2019d even met. He should have known he could never offer her anything to compete.</p><p>Claudia took the words from his lips when she said, \u201cI\u2019ve made a muddle of everything, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake. I\u2019ve made my share, as well.\u201d Such as believing she\u2019d outgrown these evenings spent reading aloud, and that he had nothing more to offer her. \u201cBut now you must decide how you can live with that mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should make your own choice, in your own time.\u201d He hesitated. He didn\u2019t want to make the decisions for her, but if she asked for guidance, wasn\u2019t it his duty to give it? \u201cI will say this much. We both know what it\u2019s like to grow up without a mother. It isn\u2019t easy. I don\u2019t believe the avoidance of gossip is a good way to choose the direction of one\u2019s life. And as for marriage ... How much do you remember of your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you were always fighting with him.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cWe had our disagreements. A great many of them, as a matter of fact. Most of that was my fault. It was devilish hard laboring under his expectations. Easier sometimes to purposely misbehave, rather than make the effort and come up lacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>He winced, hating himself for ever making her feel that way. \u201cNo matter our arguments,\u201d he said, \u201cI had tremendous respect for your father, and for my own father, as well. They were good, honorable men, and exceedingly loyal. When your mother died, your father could have married again, with hopes of getting a son of his own to assume the title. But he couldn\u2019t bear the idea of remarrying, that\u2019s how much he loved your mother. So he sent for me from Canada instead, and I gave him so much hell in those first few years, it\u2019s a wonder he didn\u2019t reconsider. But he never did remarry. And neither did my father, after my own mother died. That\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t like to see you trapped in an unhappy union, Claudia. Love, for a Dumarque, is not a passing fancy. We remain devoted to the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel that way about Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply. No matter how many differences he\u2019d had with his father and his uncle, here was one thing they shared in common. He was a Dumarque man at his core. He would love one woman until he died, and there could never be another. God help him if she didn\u2019t feel the same.</p><p>Claudia looked askance at him. \u201cIf you truly feel that way, you could do a better job of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI could do a better job of it with you, too. I plan to improve.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shimmered. \u201cDo you plan to start soon?\u201d</p> <p>When he was seventeen years old, Spencer had spent five miserable weeks aboard a two-masted brig to cross the Atlantic Ocean. That trip had been a pleasant afternoon jaunt compared to the arduous journey he made now. He rose from his chair, crossed the vast expanse of the library carpet, and sat down beside his ward.</p><p>He placed a hand on her shoulder. \u201cWhatever you decide, Claudia, you will always have a home here. And you will always be loved.\u201d</p><p>She started to weep. He hoped they were a good sort of tears. Regardless, he slid his arm around her shoulders and gathered her into a hug.</p><p>He felt rather proud of himself for it, but evidently he still needed practice to perfect the art. After a moment, Claudia sniffed and said, \u201cI miss Amelia.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her even closer then, because he needed to be hugged back. \u201cI miss her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is she coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She may not come back to Braxton Hall.\u201d</p><p>Claudia straightened, pulling back to stare at him. \u201cWhatever do you mean? Go fetch her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... I\u2019m not certain exactly where she is at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Duke of Morland. Find her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure she wants to be found.\u201d He could scarcely believe he was discussing this with Claudia ... but then again, who else did he have to ask? \u201cI bullied her quite a bit at the outset, and I don\u2019t want to make the same mistake again. I miss her, yes. But I want her to be happy most of all. If she comes back, I want her to come freely. Willingly.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cThen convince her. Fall at her feet and grovel. Make some grand gesture of apology. Tell her that sweet little story you just told me and profess your undying love. Really, Spencer, don\u2019t you know anything about romance?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>It was a fine summer morning on the Bristol docks, and for once a ray of fortune was shining on the d\u2019Orsays. A merchant brigantine called the Angelica sailed with the tide, bound for Boston.</p><p>Jack would be on it.</p><p>Amelia\u2019s nose wrinkled as she squinted at her brother through the blaring midday sun. She wished she\u2019d thought to purchase him a hat with a wider brim. With his fair skin, he\u2019d be crisped to currant red after one day at sea.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he said.</p><p>In a last sisterly gesture, she smoothed the lint from Jack\u2019s coat sleeves with her gloved hands. \u201cWhat a grand adventure you\u2019re going to have. I believe Hugh would be very envious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to think he\u2019s coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he is.\u201d She threw her arms around her brother and hugged him tight. \u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered fiercely. \u201cDon\u2019t ever dream otherwise. But I just can\u2019t take care of you any longer. It\u2019s time you learned to take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and withdrew a small bundle from her reticule. The knotted handkerchief contained a heavy clutch of coins. \u201cYour passage is already paid. This is all I have to give you for expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, reaching for the makeshift purse of gold and silver. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to lose it the first night out from land.\u201d</p><p>She tried to laugh, but she knew the danger of him doing just that was great. She kept her hand on the handkerchief, refusing to let him take it yet.</p><p>\u201cIf you do lose it, don\u2019t write me for more. If you wander home a few months from now, having landed yourself in trouble again and looking for my help ... I won\u2019t give it.\u201d Much as it pained her to speak those words, she knew she had to say them. Cut the leading strings. Perhaps if Jack understood she wouldn\u2019t be there to catch him, he might take greater precautions not to fall. \u201cThis is the very last time I save you, do you understand? I will pray for you and always love you. But after this, not a penny more.\u201d</p><p>With that, she let go of the handkerchief. It was much easier to release her grip on that bit of linen than it was to let go of her responsibility for him. But she had to do both. She deserved to be happy, too, and she couldn\u2019t imagine happiness without Spencer. She simply couldn\u2019t risk letting Jack come between them again.</p><p>Spencer was right; she did have to make a choice. But this wasn\u2019t a matter of deciding between her brother and her husband. It was a matter of deciding to seize happiness and let go of guilt.</p><p>Amelia was choosing herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d best be going, then.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder at the Angelica\u2019s gangplank. \u201cI hate to leave you alone here. Is Morland coming for you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s taken Claudia home to Cambridgeshire. I\u2019ve sent an express to Laurent. He\u2019ll help me close up the cottage, and then we\u2019ll travel back to London together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia?\u201d He chucked her under the chin. \u201cWhen I said no one\u2019s good enough for you, I meant it. And I include myself. I know I haven\u2019t deserved half the help you\u2019ve given me, but ...\u201d His lips twitched at the corner, tugging on Amelia\u2019s heart. All the d\u2019Orsay men made that face when they were struggling not to cry. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for it. Thank you for loving me, even when I\u2019ve done my devil\u2019s best to be unlovable.\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes, the catch in his voice ... her heart squeezed. She was a breath away from flinging her arms around his shoulders and vowing to take him back home, solve all his problems for him.</p><p>Taking a step backward instead was quite possibly the bravest thing she\u2019d ever done. But she knew in her heart, it was best for them both.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Jack,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss you. Please take care.\u201d</p><p>Then she turned on her heel. Took one step. Then two. Every pace she took away from him felt like a step taken on wobbly foal legs, but as her boots clopped hollowly on the planked dock, she slowly gained in coordination and confidence. It had taken a little time and much sorrow, but she\u2019d finally mastered the lesson Spencer had given her the night they first met:</p><p>Turn those hapless d\u2019Orsay fortunes around. Learn when to walk away.</p><p>\u201cWhere shall I take you?\u201d As they neared Charing Cross, Laurent turned to her on the carriage seat. \u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>Home.</p><p>Amelia mused on the word. She wondered which house her brother referred to: the Duke of Morland\u2019s, or his own? Which one was \u201chome\u201d? That was the question for her to decide, she supposed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d No house felt like home without Spencer in it. And though he would still be at Braxton Hall, she couldn\u2019t abide the thought of rattling around that cavernous town house alone.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re welcome. Winifred\u2019s planned some sort of party tonight. Lucky for me we\u2019re returning in time for it. She\u2019d have my head if I left her alone to host.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a large party?\u201d Now this might change Amelia\u2019s mind. After two days of carriage travel and a week\u2019s worth of melancholy, a busy social gathering wasn\u2019t really how she wished to spend her evening.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. A few couples over to dinner. Perhaps a bit of cards and dancing after, you know.\u201d</p><p>Well, that didn\u2019t sound too dreadful. As a matter of fact, dinner itself sounded most welcome. And as for the amusements afterward\u2014she could easily plead a headache and slip upstairs. It wouldn\u2019t even be a falsehood. She\u2019d done so much ruminating and pondering and reconsidering in the past two days, her brain ached.</p><p>\u201cDid I do the right thing?\u201d she asked her brother, for likely the tenth time since Jack had sailed with the Angelica. \u201cWill he be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019ll fare,\u201d Laurent answered, reaching for her hand and giving it a reassuring squeeze. \u201cBut you did absolutely the right thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Tessa Dare</p><p>\u201cI just still feel guilty, letting him believe his debts will remain unpaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he never would have left otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cWill you have a difficult time finding another buyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect so. It\u2019s a choice piece of land, even if the cottage is modest. The Earl of Vinterre expressed some interest in it. Wants to tear down the place and build an Italianate palace overlooking the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. I may vomit.\u201d</p><p>Laurent passed her the basin. It wouldn\u2019t have been the first time she\u2019d been ill on this journey. Nor even the second, or fifth. Apparently her unborn child didn\u2019t enjoy coach travel any more than she did.</p><p>Afterward, he soothed her back. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset. I\u2019ll find another buyer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d She pressed her sleeve to her mouth. \u201cI think it would be easier to see Briarbank razed than inhabited by another family. Sell it to Vinterre, and do it quickly.\u201d</p><p>The sooner all the dealings were completed, the sooner Jack\u2019s debts could be paid. And the sooner that happened, the sooner Amelia could return to Braxton Hall, pockets empty but heart undivided. She would set about convincing her husband that she was devoted to him, above all.</p><p>The coach made its creaking turn into Bryanston Square and soon lurched to a halt before the house. Laurent helped her alight from the carriage.</p><p>At the door, they were met by a wild-eyed Winifred. After sparing Amelia a brief nod, she latched on to Laurent\u2019s arm. \u201cOh, thank goodness you\u2019re finally home. I\u2019m beside myself, utterly. We need to order more wine\u2014whole casks of it, likely. And spirits for the gentlemen.\u201d She pulled her husband into the house, and Amelia followed them over the threshold.</p><p>\u201cThe fish course is a horrid dilemma. Naturally this would happen on a Monday, when there\u2019s no decent fish to be had for gold or silver. Naught but common oysters in the market.\u201d Her voice pitched a half-octave closer to hysteria. \u201cI can\u2019t serve oysters to a duchess!\u201d</p><p>Amelia laughed. \u201cI shall do just fine with oysters, thank you. You\u2019ve served them to me many a time before.\u201d</p> <p>Her sister-in-law turned to her, wearing a puzzled expression. \u201cForgive me, Amelia. But of course I didn\u2019t mean you.\u201d</p><p>Of course not. Amelia sighed.</p><p>Winifred\u2019s voice lowered to a whisper. \u201cHer Grace, the Duchess of Hampstead will be joining us for dinner. I\u2019ve just received the note from one of my dinner guests, Mrs. Nodwell. Her cousin is married to Her Grace\u2019s nephew\u2019s adopted brother, you see?\u201d</p><p>Amelia didn\u2019t, but she nodded politely anyway.</p><p>Winifred turned back to Laurent, pulling him into the Rose Salon, where servants were removing porcelain cherubs from the shelves and pushing the furniture to the sides of the room. \u201cObviously,\u201d she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t decline. And then Mrs. Petersham sent a note round, asking if she might bring her cousins visiting from Bath. I couldn\u2019t say no to them, either. And now these cards keep coming ...\u201d She gestured toward the row of calling cards propped on the mantel. \u201cI do believe tonight we\u2019re going to be overrun with Quality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d Amelia shook her head to dispel her confusion. \u201cAt this time of summer? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, of course! They all assume you and Morland will be in attendance. Everyone is desperate to see your first public appearance in London since the marriage.\u201d She lifted an eyebrow. \u201cThere are some very interesting\u201d\u2014she pronounced each syllable distinctly, EEN-ter-est-ting\u2014\u201crumors coming out of Oxfordshire, you know.\u201d</p><p>A bittersweet smile curved Amelia\u2019s lips. She\u2019d known there would be gossip, after that display at the Granthams\u2019. The memory of that night\u2014the dancing, the lovemaking, the conversation and sweet embraces lasting into morning\u2014it wrung her heart with surprising ferocity. The pain made her think of Spencer\u2019s broken ribs. She hoped they were healing well.</p> <p>Lord, she missed him, with everything she had.</p><p>Moving to the side of the room, she took a seat on a recently relocated footstool. \u201cWell, I fear your guests will be disappointed,\u201d she told Winifred. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well enough for socializing this evening, and the duke is not even in Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is!\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cHe is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he arrived this very morning in Mayfair, and the news has already appeared in the afternoon papers.\u201d Winifred snapped her fingers at a footman. \u201cNot there. By the window.\u201d</p><p>Amelia quietly reeled, trying not to betray the magnitude of her shock. Spencer was here in Town? Could he have any idea of her own arrival? And what about Claudia? Where was she?</p><p>As Winifred went into another flurry of instructions for the servants, Laurent crouched at Amelia\u2019s side. \u201cShall I have the carriage take you to Morland House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d She couldn\u2019t see him like this, not yet. She wasn\u2019t prepared. She wasn\u2019t even certain he\u2019d want to see her. \u201cI will send him a note.\u201d</p><p>With a few more snaps of Winifred\u2019s fingers, a lap desk and quill materialized before Amelia. The paper was a terrifying expanse of white. She was afraid to lay her pen to it at all, fearful of marring that blank perfection with the wrong word and mucking up everything again. In the end, she simply wrote:</p><p>I am here in Town, at my brother\u2019s house. You are invited to dinner this evening.</p><p>\u2014A.</p><p>There. If he wished to see her, he would know where to find her. Laurent dispatched a runner with the note, and Amelia passed two fretful hours unpacking in her old, modest bedchamber whilst Winifred renovated the downstairs. Finally, just as light was fading, she glimpsed the runner through her open window as he made for the house\u2019s back entrance. She rushed down the service stairs to find the boy.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked him breathlessly, once she\u2019d collared the youth. He held a folded paper in his hand. \u201cIs that my reply?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head no. \u201cThe duke weren\u2019t at home, ma\u2019am. Footman told me he\u2019d gone out for a game of cards.\u201d</p><p>A game of cards? He\u2019d come back to London just for a game of cards?</p><p>\u201cGo back there,\u201d she told the boy. \u201cFind out where he\u2019s gone, and find His Grace to give him that note. Don\u2019t bother coming back until you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She released the lad, and he darted off the way he\u2019d come.</p><p>Circling one palm over her belly\u2014a habit she\u2019d already developed, even though her abdomen didn\u2019t protrude yet\u2014she took deep breaths and tried to remain calm.</p><p>Hours later, she was panicking.</p><p>Laurent\u2019s house was crushed, wall to wall, with guests. They\u2019d begun arriving shortly after sundown and continued to stream in even now. The entirety of Bryanston Square was congested with coaches and teams. Most of the recent arrivals didn\u2019t even seem to understand they were lacking an invitation. Amelia wasn\u2019t certain they knew whose house they were at; they were just following the crowd. Winifred\u2019s food had run out hours ago, much to her despair, but her reinforcements of wine and spirits were holding strong for the moment. No one showed the slightest inclination to leave.</p><p>In the hall, the hired quartet gamely played over and through the din of rumor and laughter. A few couples carved out enough space to dance a cramped quadrille.</p><p>Amelia couldn\u2019t imagine why they all hadn\u2019t given up and gone home hours ago. The duke\u2019s absence was obvious, and tonight she lacked the spirit to compensate with flirtation and witty remarks. Even with every window thrown open to the night air and the barest minimum of candles burning, the air in the rooms was exceedingly close, and Amelia had done her best to seek out the few pockets of relative seclusion. Whenever someone asked after Spencer, she murmured a few words of excuse. Recently arrived in town, delayed by business ... et cetera.</p><p>She was on the verge of slipping out entirely and hiring a hack to Morland House, where she could perhaps find some restful quiet and wait for Spencer in peace. Then the musicians struck up the first few bars of a waltz, and a raucous male voice called out, \u201cNot yet! Not yet!\u201d</p><p>Bemused, she watched as every head in the room swiveled toward the ancient clock, where the short hand wavered just on the brink of twelve. A collective hush amplified the tick, tick, tick ... as then the long hand swept past the ten. Amelia suddenly understood why the guests wouldn\u2019t give up on the duke and simply go home.</p><p>They were waiting for the hour of twelve, of course. Breathless with anticipation to see if the Duke of Midnight would remain true to his name.</p><p>And that realization began the longest ten minutes of Amelia\u2019s life.</p><p>She passed the first five minutes asking after and then slowly imbibing a glass of tepid lemonade.</p><p>By straightening every seam of her gloves, she managed to while away another two.</p><p>Then there came a dark, endless minute in which guilt and regret swamped her, and doubt followed close behind. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t come because he was still angry and didn\u2019t want to see her. Perhaps he had no use for her now, since she was already with child.</p><p>Another minute ticked past, and she scolded herself. If he didn\u2019t appear tonight, it meant nothing. Except that he was off somewhere else, and she would see him the next day. Or the next.</p><p>And then the entire assembly passed the final minute simply waiting, watching, listening to the clock\u2019s inexorable ticks. When the slender minute hand finally clicked into unison with the squat hour hand, the room went dead silent. And then the clock\u2019s cuckoo bird popped out from its window and cheerfully mocked them all.</p><p>Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Twelve. Dratted. Times. The wretched little wooden creature had probably never enjoyed such a rapt audience.</p><p>It was midnight. And no duke had arrived.</p><p>Well, that was that.</p><p>Now the party was truly over. The musicians struck up a waltz, as they\u2019d no doubt been bribed to do, but no one cared. The guests murmured amongst themselves on mundane, uninteresting topics, in the way people do when they\u2019re thinking of leaving a party.</p><p>A week\u2019s worth of fatigue settled on Amelia\u2019s shoulders. For heaven\u2019s sake, she needed to rest. She pressed forward through the packed drawing room, heading for the little pocket door behind the pianoforte. It led to a service corridor, and she could use it to make her escape upstairs.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, wait.\u201d</p><p>The deep voice rang out over the crowd. Over the musicians. Over even the violent pounding of her heart.</p><p>\u201cWait right there. Please.\u201d</p><p>Well, that couldn\u2019t be Spencer. She\u2019d just heard the word \u201cplease.\u201d She wheeled around anyway and felt positively biblical when the crowd thronging the hall parted like the Red Sea. And there, standing at the other end of that freshly carved valley of humanity, was her husband. The tardy Duke of Midnight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten past,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said earnestly, starting toward her. \u201cI came as soon as I could.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, astonished. Not only \u201cplease,\u201d but \u201csorry\u201d now? In public, no less? Was this man truly her husband?</p><p>But of course he was. There was no other man on earth so handsome.</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d he said again. \u201cI\u2019m coming to you.\u201d</p><p>He took an awkward, hobbled step in her direction, and then another. A grimace pulled at his mouth. His injuries were clearly still paining him. As gratifying as it was to watch him at long last moving across a dance floor toward her, and not some preening debutante, she realized this was going to take far too long.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, stay put,\u201d she said. Her heel caught on the carpet fringe as she hurried toward him, and she would have fallen to the floor without the well-timed assistance of a smartly dressed gentleman in green velvet. It made her conscious, as she met her husband halfway and he pulled her into a tight embrace, that they were being observed by one and all.

She pulled him as far to the side as possible, putting his back toward the horde of onlookers.</p><p>\u201cThere now,\u201d she said, keeping her arms laced around his neck. \u201cJust pretend we\u2019re dancing.\u201d</p> <p>He winced. \u201cThe ride from Braxton Hall nearly killed me. With these ribs, pretense is all I can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in town at all? I heard you were playing cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I meant to. That\u2019s the reason I came to London. I\u2019d no idea you\u2019d be here. My intention was to win back Jack\u2019s debt from the gaming lord himself. I\u2019d arranged the game, prepared my stakes and sharpened my strategy\u2014do you know that man\u2019s one of the best piquet players in England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect you\u2019re better.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tipped with an arrogant grin. \u201cI suspect I\u2019d have proved you right, in the end. It might have taken me hours, though, and we were just sitting down to the table when your boy found me, and I read your note. And after that ...\u201d He blew out a breath. \u201cAfter that, I just said to hell with it. I wrote him a bank draft instead.\u201d</p> <p>She gasped. \u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Because whatever amount your brother owed, it wasn\u2019t worth a single hour\u2019s delay in seeing you.\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cAll Jack\u2019s debts are paid, Amelia. You needn\u2019t worry about his safety anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Spencer. You\u2019re very good to have done that. But I wish I\u2019d had the opportunity to speak with you first. Jack\u2019s gone. He sailed from Bristol on a brigantine bound for America. You were right. I was doing him more harm than good. He\u2019s my brother, and I\u2019ll always love him. But I\u2019ll have to love him from afar just now. Our marriage is more important to me than anything.\u201d She lowered her voice and gripped him tight. \u201cYou are more important to me than anything. I\u2019ll never let anything come between us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d He blinked away a glimmer of emotion. \u201cWhat of the debt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurent has another buyer for the cottage.\u201d When he began to form a question, she added, \u201cThe debts are ours to dispatch, not yours. We\u2019ll repay you every penny. Jack is our problem, our family\u2019s responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour problems are mine. Your family too, if you\u2019ll have me. I was a complete bastard to ask you to choose. And you can\u2019t give up that cottage. It\u2019s your home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a house. Just a pile of stones and mortar, and a crumbling one at that. It\u2019s meaningless without love to fill it. My home is wherever you are.\u201d She felt a smile warming her face. \u201cHere we are right back where we started, aren\u2019t we? You owning my brother\u2019s debt, me with only a drafty cottage in Gloucestershire as collateral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it wrong of me to demand Briarbank in payment anyhow? The property needn\u2019t change hands. A very long lease will suffice. I love it there, and I love being there with you. And I love you. God, I haven\u2019t said that to you nearly enough, but I\u2019m going to make up for it now by telling you five times a day. I love you, Amelia. Since the very first night, I knew you were the only woman for me. Until the day I die, I will love you. I love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d She put a finger to his lips. Had he gone mad, or had he forgotten the crowd of onlookers at his back? Leaning in close, she teased, \u201cIt\u2019s a quarter past midnight. Don\u2019t exhaust all five so early in the day. I\u2019d like something to look forward to, once we get home.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her hand and kissed her fingers warmly. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry on that score.\u201d He brought her close and whispered in her ear. \u201cGod, how I\u2019ve missed you. Not only in bed, but especially in bed. It\u2019s a very big bed, and it\u2019s damned empty without you. Life is empty without you.\u201d</p><p>Feeling it prudent to change the subject before she went to custard, she cleared her throat and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Claudia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Braxton Hall. I\u2019ve promised to return quickly. She\u2019s still considering her options, but I\u2019ve told her she\u2019ll have my support, no matter what her choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will have our support.\u201d</p><p>He released a deep sigh. \u201cThank you.\u201d He raised a hand to her face, cradling her cheek in his palm. \u201cAnd you? You are well?\u201d He flicked a glance downward, toward her belly.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBoth of us.\u201d</p><p>As his thumb stroked sweetly over her cheek, his eyes warmed to rich shades of gold and green. He gave her one of those rare, devastating smiles. \u201cWhat a beautiful mother you\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head, clearly seeking a kiss.</p><p>She put a hand to his chest, holding him off.</p><p>\u201cSpencer,\u201d she whispered, darting a glance to either side. \u201cThere are hundreds of people about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart\u2019s pounding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>And now her own heart skipped a beat. She\u2019d spent her whole life loving those around her, and still she\u2019d never dreamed she could love someone this much\u2014so much it stretched the very seams of her soul. Better yet was the knowledge that the love would only grow, and she would have to grow with it.</p><p>\u201cYou realize, you do have a certain reputation,\u201d she murmured. \u201cEveryone here is expecting to watch you cart me from the room in a scandalous, barbaric display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll be disappointed. I\u2019m scarcely fit to lift a kitten at the moment, and even if I were ...\u201d He cupped her face in both hands, and his gaze reached so far into hers she felt it warming her toes. \u201cIt\u2019s never been my desire to conquer you, Amelia. If you leave this room with me, it must be at my side. As my wife, my lover, my partner ...\u201d His thumb brushed her lip. \u201cMy dearest friend. Would you do that?\u201d</p><p>She managed a tearful nod.</p><p>\u201cThen may I kiss you now, in front of all these people?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again, this time smiling through the tears. \u201cOn the lips, if you please. And do it properly.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
