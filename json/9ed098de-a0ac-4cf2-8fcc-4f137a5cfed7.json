Her hair was blond, her skin a sun-kissed gold. And her eyes\u2014they were the coldest blue he\u2019d ever seen in his life. \u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, the sound deep and loud.</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \u201cAnd you\u2019re an assassin.\u201d</p><p>Cade kept the smile on his face. \u201cLady, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d A thread of anger\u2014no, that thread was far closer to fury\u2014rumbled beneath her words. \u201cI\u2019m here to hire you.\u201d</p><p>Cade glanced to the left. To the right. In this pit of hell that passed for a bar in some hole-in-the-wall Oregon town, no one was paying any attention to anyone. Or anything. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong man,\u201d he said slowly.</p> <p>Her gaze searched his face. \u201cNot too many men have scars like yours.\u201d And that icy stare had locked on the scar that slipped from his right eyebrow all the way down to his jaw. Another scar sliced around his neck. There were more, so many more, hidden beneath his clothes. \u201cCut you with silver, didn\u2019t they?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWhen you were so young that you could barely heal.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, yeah, they had. His back was covered with long, twisting scars. Wounds administered by sick pricks that Cade had personally sent to burn. Cade had been fourteen when he made those kills.</p><p>His first, not his last.</p><p>\u201cWerewolf...\u201d She breathed the title. \u201cI\u2019ve got a vamp for you to slay.\u201d</p><p>Now the lady had his full attention. He dropped the act and focused totally on her.</p><p>Vampires had been the ones to torture him. To destroy his family. His pack. They\u2019d introduced him to hell.</p> <p>Made him into the monster that he was today.</p><p>She leaned closer. Her scent\u2014already too strong for someone with his enhanced senses\u2014surrounded him. A bitter scent, heavy with incense. A witch. The scent of their spells always clung to them.</p><p>His would-be-client told him, \u201cThe vamp\u2019s name is Allison Gray, and she\u2019ll be such easy prey, especially for someone like you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slid over to touch his hands. His claws weren\u2019t out\u2014not yet. Not yet. \u201cWhy do you want the vamp dead?\u201d Dade demanded to know</p><p>Hell, vamps were already dead. They only kept living by draining their prey. Feeding on them.</p><p>Like they fed on me.</p><p>Parasites.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pureblood.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. Now the witch was talking some serious power. Most vampires were made the old-fashioned way\u2014they were humans who were bit, drained, and brought back as vampires. But a pureblood? Purebloods were extra strong because they were born as vampires.</p><p>Lucky for the rest of the world, most purebloods were rare. Otherwise, hell would be calling on earth every damn night.</p><p>But killing a pureblood? \u201cThat\u2019ll cost you extra,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Her smile didn\u2019t make her eyes appear any warmer. Beautiful, but the witch was stone cold. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you one hundred thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Paranormal hits were never cheap\u2014or easy. \u201cMake it two.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>He offered her his own, cold smile. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll want the cash up front, before I take my prey.\u201d</p><p>The witch hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYou can always go find someone else.\u201d Total bullshit. There weren\u2019t any other werewolves in this part of the U.S. And when it came to vamp killin\u2019, no one got the job done better than a wolf.</p><p>The witch would know that.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDone.\u201d Then she eased back, licking her lips. \u201cBut you have to do it fast, before the next full moon.\u201d</p><p>Five days away. Werewolves always knew exactly when the next full moon would rise. They were at their strongest when the full moon hung in the sky.</p><p>Her fingers drummed on the table. \u201cAnd you have to make it hurt.\u201d</p><p>Killing a vamp? Torturing her? Cade shrugged. For two hundred grand... \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>His conscience had died long ago. He\u2019d left it, broken and bloody, in that pit where the vamps had tortured him.</p><p>Besides, it wasn\u2019t like he was slaughtering the innocent. The world would be a far better place with one less bloodsucker on the streets.</p><p>He reached for his whiskey. Barely felt the burn as the liquid slid down his throat.</p><p>One more down...thousands to go.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>She was being hunted.</p><p>Allison Gray had felt the unseen eyes on her for days. Ever since she\u2019d left Alliance, Nebraska, and begun this crazy journey.</p><p>Ever since she\u2019d started to change.</p><p>Her hands fisted as she slid through the crowd inside Blood Bath. Blood Bath? Jeez, just what kind of name was that for a bar? Nestled near the Cascade Mountains, the bar was like the rest of the small town\u2014pretty damn scary.</p><p>Allison found what she hoped was a private corner. One hidden by shadows. She\u2019d never expected this town\u2014not here. The tiny spot of Lost, Oregon, was filled with folks who looked like they could\u2014and would\u2014kill at the drop of a hat. She\u2019d been told that she had to journey to this town. That she\u2019d find the answers to all her questions here.</p><p>Her breath eased slowly from her lungs as her gaze swept around the bar. As always these days, she was aware of the strange ache in her gut. Hunger, one that just couldn\u2019t be satisfied with food. No matter how much she ate, she stayed hungry.</p><p>And her senses\u2014they were in freaking overdrive. So many scents burned her nose. Alcohol. Cigarettes. Cheap perfume. Sex. Blood.</p><p>Her nostrils flared.</p><p>Blood shouldn\u2019t smell good. But, lately...the scent had started to\u2014</p><p>\u201cWell, hello, pretty lady...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t start in surprise. She\u2019d known the big biker was heading her way. The guy with tribal tattoos that covered his arms and shaved head. A dozen piercings penetrated his face. And...the guy had blood under his fingernails.</p><p>She was betting that blood wasn\u2019t his.</p><p>\u201cYou all alone tonight?\u201d he asked as he closed in on her.</p><p>Allison kept her chin up. Elsa, the witch who\u2019d found her, had promised that Allison would find a guide in this bar. A protector who would help her on the rest of her journey. Elsa had said that her guide would come to Allison immediately. The witch had also told her that he\u2019d be the strongest guy in the bar.</p><p>Allison could sure use some strength to help her out. Especially since she didn\u2019t have any of her own to speak of at that moment.</p><p>She licked her lips and studied the guy before her. Big, check. Definitely strong, but...</p><p>But he scared her. His eyes were hot, almost feral as they slid over her body.</p><p>Allison realized she should say something. \u201cUh...I\u2019m...waiting for someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to wait no longer.\u201d He reached for her hand. Pulled her up against him. Allison was barely five foot three, and this guy towered over her. \u201cI\u2019m right here, baby.\u201d</p><p>Laughter followed that comment. The guy had friends in this place\u2014a lot of them by the looks of things. And they were all watching her now.</p><p>Why weren\u2019t there more women in the bar? Allison counted two in the whole place. Her and a chick who was\u2014leaving.</p><p>Okay, that wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>She put her hands on the biker\u2019s chest. \u201cAre you...are you my guide?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a hard burst of sound that grated in her ears. \u201cOh, yeah, baby, I\u2019ll guide you all right.\u201d His hands dropped to her ass. \u201cI\u2019ll guide you all night long.\u201d</p><p>Crap. This guy wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>The biker was pulling her even tighter against him now, and she was trying to get away but she wasn\u2019t strong enough.</p><p>Story of my life.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been strong enough to save her family. Hadn\u2019t been strong enough to stop the death.</p><p>Not strong enough to\u2014</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d</p><p>The voice was low, but it cut sharper than a knife, and the hard order pierced through the laughter in the room.</p><p>Because she was staring up at the brick wall of a biker\u2019s face\u2014a face that looked like it had actually hit a few brick walls over the years\u2014she saw the fleeting expression of fear that whispered over his features.</p><p>\u201cThain.\u201d The hands holding her eased as her captor bit out the name.</p><p>Allison hadn\u2019t even seen the new guy yet, but if he was scary enough to make the biker tremble...</p><p>Trouble.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine, Griggs.\u201d Lethal words accompanied by the hard thud of footsteps as the Thain guy stalked closer. \u201cSo I\u2019ll say it again, but only once more...let her the fuck go.\u201d</p><p>No one seemed to be breathing in the bar. No one-including her. Allison\u2019s lungs burned, but in that moment, she was too afraid to move at all. Griggs slowly, very slowly, released his hold on her. \u201cWasn\u2019t gonna hurt her. Just gonna give the pretty lady some fun.\u201d</p><p>She bet they had different ideas of fun.</p><p>\u201cAllison.\u201d Now that hard, dark voice of Thain\u2019s was saying her name. If he knew her name...he had to be her guide. No one else should know her in that place.\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She eased around the biker, took a step, and froze.</p><p>Because Griggs looked a hell of a lot more safe and welcoming than Thain did.</p><p>He was big, probably taller than Griggs, and far more muscled. His shoulders just...stretched. Allison swallowed. His muscles had the black t-shirt he wore pulling taut over his chest and arms.</p><p>His eyes were dark green and burning with intensity. A thick scar slid from the top of his right eyebrow all the way down to the underside of his square jaw. The scar just made him look...</p><p>Scary. Extremely scary. No\u2014actually, it was the eyes that did that. Eyes that promised hell would be coming.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know if she wants to go with you,\u201d Griggs said. His hand came up to clasp her shoulder. \u201cYou can always stay with me, pretty lady.\u201d</p><p>Allison sucked in a deep breath and stepped toward Thain. Her gaze slid over his face once more. This time, it was his mouth that caught her stare.</p><p>She took another step. The biker\u2019s hand fell away.</p><p>Thain\u2019s lips, strangely both cruel and sensual, were parted a bit to reveal the edges of his white teeth.</p><p>Her gaze lifted again. His hair, a shade darker than her own locks, was thick, heavy, brushing back from the strong lines of his face.</p><p>\u201cTouch her again,\u201d Thain warned, \u201cand you\u2019ll lose the hand.\u201d</p><p>Everyone backed up a few feet.</p><p>Even Griggs. She heard the fast scuttle of his feet.</p><p>She was almost close enough to take Thain\u2019s offered hand now. Almost.</p><p>Allison saw Thain\u2019s nostrils flare. His eyes narrowed and swept over her. When he glanced back up, there was no mistaking the fury in his stare.</p><p>His hand began to lower.</p><p>No.</p><p>Allison grabbed his hand and held tight. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>A muscle jerked in his jaw. Then he pulled her forward. His scent\u2014a little wild and with the richness of the forest clinging to him\u2014wrapped around her. Allison stared up at him and tried not to show her fear.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to be afraid anymore. This was the man Elsa had told her about. The man who would end her nightmare.</p><p>She just had to trust him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Allison whispered. They could leave. Go someplace safe. Then maybe she could finally stop feeling like death stalked her every minute.</p><p>This man...he could stop death. To her, he looked like he was strong enough to stop anyone and anything.</p><p>His arm wrapped around her shoulders. He led her from that godforsaken bar and out into the still night with the moon that hung high in the sky.</p><p>Her heart raced so fast, she could feel it thudding in her chest.</p><p>He paused and glanced down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me.\u201d His voice was still a deep rumble.</p><p>Allison managed a nod. Despite her efforts, she couldn\u2019t help it. She couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he told her as he pushed them into a dark alley.</p><p>Whoa, wait\u2014good?</p><p>In the next instant, he had her shoved against the alley\u2019s wall. \u201cYou should be scared.\u201d His face came toward hers. Dangerous and threatening in the faint moonlight. \u201cYou should be damn well terrified.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s body shook.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being hunted,\u201d he told her, \u201cstalked. There are people who want you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I know.\u201d Some had wanted her dead for years.</p><p>He leaned in closer. Odd. His teeth seemed sharper than before. \u201cAnd you just blindly walk off with me? How the hell do you know I\u2019m not one of the assholes who wants to kill you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know that. But she wasn\u2019t stupid. Or crazy.</p><p>Allison slipped her concealed knife up to press against his heart.</p><p>Okay, maybe she was a little crazy. \u201cIf you\u2019re the guide that the witch sent to collect me, then you\u2019ll be able to tell me her name.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a breath and could almost taste him because he was so close.</p><p>Actually she wanted to taste him. What in the hell was up with that?</p><p>Allison pressed her knife harder against his chest. Not hard enough to break the skin, but hard enough to show that she meant business. \u201cTell me her name.\u201d So she could trust him. So she wouldn\u2019t have to be alone any more. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the knife. A faint furrow pulled between his brows as if he were trying to figure out a puzzle.</p><p>\u201cElsa,\u201d he breathed the witch\u2019s name slowly. \u201cElsa sent me to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heartbeat began to slow. Her knife slid away from his heart. \u201cThen it is you.\u201d Big, scary, tough\u2014yes, she\u2019d take him, please. He\u2019d keep her safe. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who has been sent\u2014\u201d</p><p>He ripped the knife from her hand. Tossed it to the ground. And in the next second, his hand was at her throat. Only...something was wrong. Something sharp had burst from his fingertips.</p><p>Claws?</p> <p>He had claws at her throat. Why would\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one she sent,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s here to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shout broke the night. Not so much a shout, but more a bellow that was her name.</p><p>The watcher. She\u2019d only been in town a few hours. Had he already caught up to her?</p><p>Thain\u2019s head whipped to the right. His nostrils twitched. \u201cVampire.\u201d He said the word like a curse.</p> <p>Because it was.</p><p>Most thought vampires weren\u2019t real. Just stories to tell in order to frighten children.</p><p>She\u2019d been a scared child once. She\u2019d seen the vampire that came into her house. That fed on her family.</p><p>Not just a story.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Thain glanced back at her, frowning.</p> <p>Why wasn\u2019t he moving? Did the guy want to get eaten by vampires? That wasn\u2019t exactly the best way to go.</p><p>He stepped back. Well, that was something. Movement. Then Thain shook his head and stared at her like she was some kind of mental case. Yeah, she\u2019d seen that look before. After her parents were killed, she\u2019d tried telling the cops about the vampires. Only the cops hadn\u2019t believed her. They\u2019d just given her the look that said she was insane. The same look Thain was giving her now.</p><p>So not time for this.</p><p>\u201cAllison!\u201d That roar again. Closer this time. Coming too near.</p><p>A growl rumbled in Thain\u2019s chest.</p><p>Uh, okay.</p><p>Then he caught her hand and they started to run. Not away from that yell. Oh, sweet baby Jesus, they were running toward it.</p><p>Allison dug in her heels. \u201cWe can\u2019t! Stop!\u201d</p> <p>But it was too late. The blond vampire had rounded the corner. He rushed at them with fangs barred.</p><p>Thain leapt forward and drove his claws\u2014yes, definitely claws, very definitely\u2014right into the vampire\u2019s throat.</p><p>Using those claws, Thain lifted the vampire up and tossed him back through the air. A good ten feet through the air.</p><p>Allison realized her jaw was hanging open.</p><p>The vampire thudded into the side of the alley. Blood gushed from his throat as he shoved his hands up to cover the wounds. He tried to speak, but only a gurgle slipped from his lips.</p><p>A gurgle, and more blood.</p><p>Thain lunged for him again, but vampires were fast\u2014so fast.</p><p>The vampire leapt up and raced away.</p><p>For an instant, she thought that Thain would give chase. Instead, he turned to her, breath heaving, claws still out.</p><p>His green eyes were glowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Allison whispered.</p><p>He smiled. His canines had lengthened to razor sharp points.</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d he mocked. She couldn\u2019t even hear the vampire\u2019s footsteps anymore. He\u2019d run too far, too quickly.</p><p>Allison shook her head and hurried to Thain\u2019s side. She knew there was a whole lot more to this world than met the eye. Vamps were real, and she\u2019d heard stories of other monsters lurking in the dark.</p><p>Right then, she didn\u2019t really care what Cade was...all that mattered was that he\u2019d just rescued her ass from the vamps. Laughing, she threw her arms around him. \u201cThank you!\u201d He could do it. He could keep her safe. Elsa had been right. This man\u2014he was the one she needed.</p><p>The one man who could help her.</p><p>Thain stiffened in her arms. His whole body felt rock-hard. She glanced up and stared into eyes that were too bright.</p><p>Slowly, his arms closed around her. His head lowered toward hers.</p><p>She actually thought her hero might kiss her. Even wilder, in that instant, she wanted him to put his mouth on hers.</p><p>Sensual and cruel...how would he kiss?</p><p>But Thain pulled back. He took her hand and led her through the alley and to a motorcycle that waited in the shadows. He climbed onto the back of the bike and glanced over at her. \u201cIf you come with me, there\u2019ll be no going back.\u201d</p><p>Allison slid on the bike behind him. Her thighs hugged his even as her arms curled around him. \u201cI have nothing to go back to.\u201d</p><p>Only death. But Thain...he offered her life.</p><p>The motorcycle\u2019s engine snarled, and they raced forward into the darkness.</p><p>Elsa LaSpene crept slowly through the night. She didn\u2019t head into the bar. No point. Her prey would be long gone by now.</p><p>She closed her eyes and inhaled. The sweet scent of blood had her smiling.</p><p>Fresh blood.</p><p>She slid deeper into the alley. There. Against the wall. The dark stain of blood could be seen in the moonlight. Her fingers lifted and touched that perfect wetness.</p><p>So fresh.</p><p>The little pureblood hadn\u2019t lasted long. Not long at all. Not once the wolf had gotten his hands on her.</p><p>He\u2019d taken Allison from the alley, just as he\u2019d promised. Taken her, but blood had already been spilled.</p><p>The wolf had started his fun early.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better make it hurt,\u201d Elsa whispered as she tilted her head back and gazed up at the moon. \u201cMake it hurt.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>Cade drove the motorcycle deep into the forest. Allison held on tight behind him. Her body was soft, warm.</p><p>Human.</p><p>That witch had lied to him. Set him up. Dammit. He hadn\u2019t signed on for killing a human.</p><p>Not one that smelled like roses and looked like the sweetest sin he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Not her.</p><p>The motorcycle roared as he pushed it faster. Faster.</p><p>Soon the trees thinned, and he saw the stark outline of his cabin. Small, but made with heavy wood that could stand against the rough winters, he\u2019d thought the cabin would be the perfect place to hold the vampire.</p><p>To kill her?</p><p>His fingers clenched around the handlebars. Cade shut of the motorcycle and shoved down the kickstand. He didn\u2019t speak at first because the rage choked back any words that he wanted to speak.</p><p>\u201cThanks for getting us out of there,\u201d she said, and, hell, even her voice was sexy. Smooth and soft, with a slightly husky edge that made him think of tangled sheets and warm flesh. \u201cThain, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her. \u201cCade.\u201d</p><p>She blinked her wide, fuck-me bedroom eyes at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His enhanced vision let him see her perfectly in the dark. So he could easily read her confusion. \u201cThe name\u2019s Cade. Cade Thain.\u201d</p><p>And why was he even talking to her? She should have been dead by now.</p><p>But...</p><p>But he was rising off the bike, taking her arm and leading her toward the cabin like they were on some kind of damn date. And she came right with him. Her steps double-timed it to keep up with his, and her long, dark hair brushed his arm as they walked.</p><p>Lamb to the slaughter.</p><p>He shoved open the door. She slipped right over the threshold, never even hesitating. Just blindly walking in. Trusting him.</p><p>That trust pissed him off.</p><p>Slamming the door behind him, Cade pounced. In less than a second\u2019s time, he had her body pinned to the nearest wall. He had his hands on her\u2014damn, she\u2019s soft\u2014and his fangs were ready to rip and tear.</p><p>Only...he wasn\u2019t ripping anything.</p><p>She gazed up at him. The light from the hallway spilled onto them, and he saw the faint ring of gold that circled her pupils. That gold around her eyes was one sign that marked her as a vampire pureblood.</p><p>He caught her left hand. Yanked it up.</p><p>\u201cCade!\u201d Allison yelped. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The mark was there. A blood-red rose, nestled in her palm. A real particular birthmark.</p><p>Pureblood.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not human,\u201d he told her. Unfortunate\u2014for her.</p><p>Her eyes widened even more. \u201cUh, yes, I am.\u201d She jerked against his hold. He just lifted a brow and kept right on holding her.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you to that bar tonight?\u201d Cade asked her, but he already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cThe same witch you sent you.\u201d Allison huffed out a breath. \u201cM-my friend, Elsa. She told me you would be there\u2014that you\u2019d guide me to safety and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He started laughing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any clue, do you?\u201d No wonder the witch had been so certain.</p><p>Allison stared up at him, the long tangle of her hair sliding over her shoulders. Her skin was pale\u2014so pale, just like that of most vamps, but her body was warm. She was small and curved just the way he normally liked women to be\u2014with pert breasts, flaring hips, and an ass that could make a man beg.</p><p>And her face...beautiful. Not that he\u2019d had a whole lot of beauty in his life, but he knew it when he saw it.</p><p>He saw it then in the high sweep of her cheekbones. The soft slide of her nose. The heavy lashes that covered her eyes\u2014and in the delicate chin that angled up in the air.</p><p>Allison Gray was a beautiful woman.</p><p>A beautiful, soon-to-be dead woman.</p><p>Hell. He could feel Allison\u2019s heart racing against him. She was afraid again. That should have been a good thing.</p><p>Why did her fear piss him off? It angered him just as much as her blind trust. The scent of her growing fear seemed to burn his nose.</p><p>\u201cVampires are chasing me,\u201d she told him. He\u2019d pushed her hands back against the wooden wall. \u201cThat guy in the alley\u2014he\u2019s been after me for months.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Cade bet he had.</p><p>\u201cThey want me dead.\u201d</p><p>Undead.</p><p>\u201cElsa said you\u2019d help me.\u201d Her lips trembled. Wide, full lips. Flushed dark red. Plump. Those lips were so close to his.</p><p>The beast within began to snarl. \u201cShe lied.\u201d Blunt. Brutal.</p><p>Best to go ahead and tell her. Best for her to know...</p><p>Her tongue swiped out and licked a slick trail over her bottom lip. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>Take. The beast inside roared. Cade brought his mouth closer to hers. What would it hurt? Just one little taste...</p><p>Her eyes were so very blue as they stared up at his. Not cold like the witch\u2019s had been, but filled with a tangle of emotion.</p><p>Her lashes began to lower.</p><p>His lips pressed lightly over hers. Allison didn\u2019t fight. Didn\u2019t try to turn her head away.</p><p>Her breath whispered out, and he pulled that soft gasp into his own lungs, taking her taste with that breath.</p><p>Sweet.</p><p>He\u2019d take more.</p><p>He kissed her again. Harder. Deeper. Her lips parted and...and she let him in. His tongue thrust past her lips and into the warm cavern of her mouth. His body pushed against hers, so close he could feel the tight tips of her nipples and the wild beat of her heart.</p><p>Innocence and sin. One woman shouldn\u2019t taste like both.</p><p>She did.</p><p>Allison met him, kissing him with a wild, hot need as a moan built in her throat. Kissing him...because the woman thought she was safe with him.</p><p>That he was some promised protector.</p><p>His claws began to stretch.</p><p>He let his fangs rake over her lower lip.</p><p>Allison froze in his arms.</p><p>Time for her to understand exactly what was happening. Cade lifted his head. Gazed into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not here to keep you safe.\u201d His words were growled, the snarl of a beast.</p><p>Her gaze slid from his, searching the darkness of the cabin that waited to the left, then to the right.</p><p>\u201cNo one followed us out here.\u201d She\u2019d come so willingly. She could have screamed back at that bar. Asked for help. Begged for help.</p><p>Maybe Griggs would have fought for her.</p><p>Perhaps some other dumb asshole would have played white knight.</p><p>Slowly, he released her wrists, but he didn\u2019t step back. \u201cThere\u2019s no one to hear you scream out here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Allison flinched. \u201cWh-why would I scream?\u201d</p><p>He brought up his hand and let his claws slide down her cheek. She needed to stop seeing him as some kind of damn hero and see him for what he really was.</p><p>\u201cYour Elsa didn\u2019t send you to me for protection.\u201d He paused. Watched because he knew the horror would come. \u201cShe paid me to kill you.\u201d</p><p>And since Allison looked so incredibly delicate, so innocent and human, he wasn\u2019t expecting the blade of her knife to shove into his chest.</p><p>He glanced down, stunned, and realized that when they\u2019d been in that alley, she\u2019d stopped to retrieve her weapon. He\u2019d been fighting the vamp, and she\u2014</p><p>His blood dripped down his chest, and Allison shoved him back with very un-human strength. He flew back and crashed into the opposite wall. She gazed at him with desperate eyes, stunned, scared, then she rushed for the door.</p><p>The screen door slammed behind her as she fled into the night.</p><p>Taking his time, Cade rose to his feet. The knife had missed his heart by a good three inches. And it wasn\u2019t even silver.</p><p>Amateur hour.</p><p>He yanked out the blade. Stared at the bloody metal, then broke it with his tightened fist.</p><p>She was running from him now. Running fast into that dark night. Pity. She wouldn\u2019t realize just how much he enjoyed the hunt.</p><p>The beast always liked to chase prey.</p><p>Cade let the change sweep over him, brutal, hard, as his bones popped and broke, reshaped and elongated. Fur sprang along his skin, and when he opened his mouth to cry out to her, a howl filled the night.</p><p>Time to hunt.</p><p>When Allison heard the long, angry howl, she glanced back even though all her instincts screamed...Keep going. Hurry.</p><p>Her savior was her executioner. Allison stumbled away, plunging for the thick shelter of the trees. If she\u2019d known how to hot-wire the motorcycle she would have jumped on it and fled, but, dammit, she didn\u2019t have that skill set. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her side heaved as she raced through the woods. Her legs burned, but she pushed herself as fast as she could go. There was no safe place for her anymore. No one to trust. Even Elsa had sold her out.</p><p>Elsa...the woman who\u2019d come to Allison when she\u2019d stood, crying, over her parents graves in that cold cemetery. Elsa had promised friendship.</p><p>But tried to give death.</p> <p>Lying witch.</p><p>Another howl shook the night and she whipped around, following that sound.</p><p>Oh, hell. A big, black beast of a wolf charged after her. Too big, freaking huge. And he was running too swiftly.</p><p>She lurched to the right, tripped over a fallen log, and hurtled down the hill, spinning again and again and slamming into the earth with each painful turn.</p><p>When her body finally stopped hurtling, she was face-down on the ground. Every part of her hurt and...</p> <p>\u201cAllison.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked up. Elsa stood there. Lying, scheming Elsa. Smiling.</p><p>\u201cGuess the werewolf has already started his fun...\u201d</p><p>Werewolf. Then she heard it\u2014the thunder of the wolf\u2019s approach as he raced down after her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to rip you apart.\u201d Elsa stood near two twisted, gnarled trees. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait to watch.\u201d</p><p>Allison made it to her feet. Nothing felt too broken. Maybe. But she was trapped between a witch and a wolf. A freaking werewolf. She\u2019d heard plenty of stories about the werewolves. Dangerous, more animals than men. And she had to fight one of those beasts? Without a weapon? \u201cYou were supposed to help me!\u201d Screw this. She wasn\u2019t standing around to\u2014</p> <p>Elsa lunged at her. Grabbed her and held on tight. Elsa\u2019s nails sliced into Allison\u2019s arms. \u201cYou think you\u2019ll take my power? My life? You won\u2019t,\u201d she gritted, spittle flying. \u201cYou won\u2019t take a damn thing from me.\u201d Her nails dug deeper. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take everything that you are.\u201d</p><p>The wolf snarled, and Allison actually felt the hot stir of his breath behind her.</p><p>Elsa twisted her around and shoved Allison back toward the wolf. \u201cRip the vamp\u2019s throat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a vampire!\u201d Couldn\u2019t the chick see that?</p><p>And could the wolf even understand her now?</p><p>Her breath heaved as she stared at him\u2014at green eyes she\u2019d never be able to forget. No wonder Cade\u2019s teeth had looked so sharp. His teeth, his claws...</p><p>All the better to freaking kill me with.</p><p>\u201cRip her apart!\u201d Elsa shouted the words with feverish excitement. \u201cRip. Her. Apart.\u201d</p> <p>Allison didn\u2019t move.</p><p>The wolf stalked closer. She\u2019d stabbed him. Shoved him\u2014and the guy had hurtled pretty far when she\u2019d hit him back at the cabin. Maybe she could hold him off. Hold them both off, just long enough to\u2014</p><p>The wolf leapt forward.</p><p>Allison screamed. She couldn\u2019t help it. She wasn\u2019t brave and super kick ass, and she didn\u2019t want to die, she didn\u2019t want\u2014</p><p>The wolf pushed her behind his body and faced off against the witch. He\u2019d shoved her back with his powerful paws, and Allison found herself on the ground again.</p><p>The wolf was so big that she could barely see around him, and she rose quickly to her knees in order to get a better view.</p><p>The witch wasn\u2019t smiling any longer. \u201cWhat in the hell are you doing?\u201d Elsa screeched.</p><p>The wolf glanced back at Allison. His green eyes\u2014glowing, so wild\u2014seemed to see right through her.</p><p>Bones began to snap then. To break, to crunch. The sounds were horrific, and Allison wanted to turn away, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Watch him. Her legs trembled as she stood.</p><p>Fur melted from the wolf\u2019s body. Golden flesh and toned muscles appeared. Naked male. Powerful. Primal.</p><p>He rose to his feet, still making sure to keep his body between her and the witch.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a vampire yet.\u201d His voice was rougher, harder than before.</p><p>Allison bit her lip to keep from speaking. He knew about her infection?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fucking matter!\u201d Elsa snapped back at him. \u201cKill her!\u201d</p><p>Two against one. Bad odds. Especially when one of those two was a werewolf.</p><p>Her mouth had gone desert dry. Her nails dug into her palms, and her body locked as she waited for Cade\u2019s next move.</p><p>He spared her a glittering glance over his shoulder. Please. She didn\u2019t speak the word, but she sure thought it and knew the plea had to be reflected in her eyes. Don\u2019t kill me.</p><p>Did his head incline? Did she imagine it?</p><p>\u201cKill her!\u201d Elsa yelled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cade\u2019s response. Low but fierce.</p><p>And Allison didn\u2019t know who was more shocked.</p><p>The wind began to whip around them in heavy bursts that caught Allison\u2019s hair and lifted it into the air.</p><p>\u201cI paid you!\u201d Elsa thundered at him. \u201cWe had a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou paid me to kill a vampire.\u201d The guy was naked and still damn dangerous. \u201cRight now, she\u2019s just a lost human.\u201d</p><p>She was a scared-as-hell human who had a bit of hope stirring in her chest.</p><p>When she craned her neck, Allison caught sight of the red-faced witch. \u201cShe\u2019ll change!\u201d Elsa\u2019s hands were fisted on her hips. \u201cJust a few more days, and she\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see about killing her,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>And that simply, her hope faded.</p><p>Elsa lunged forward, coming at Allison with a scream. But Cade caught her and tossed her back. \u201cYou\u2019re not touching her,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Allison shivered at the threat lacing those words.</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t do it\u2014\u201d Elsa began.</p><p>Now Cade was the one to laugh. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill her. If you could\u2019ve done the job, you never would have come crawling to me.\u201d</p><p>Uh, why couldn\u2019t the witch kill her?</p><p>\u201cSo get the fuck out of here, witch, and I damn well better not see you again.\u201d He lifted his hand, and claws had broken through his fingertips. \u201cIf I do, you may just be the one to die.\u201d</p><p>Allison backed up a step and a stick snapped beneath her feet. But the wolf and the witch didn\u2019t glance her way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this,\u201d Elsa promised.</p><p>Cade just shrugged again, clearly not worried. What did it take to worry a werewolf? Not threats from a witch, obviously...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll turn on you. The minute the hunger strikes her, she\u2019ll feed on you...just like the others.\u201d A heavy pause. \u201cBut maybe you like that. Maybe you like just being fucking food for the vamps!\u201d</p><p>Elsa yanked away from him, chest heaving. \u201cYou\u2019ve made the wrong enemy.\u201d Her blond hair rose in the thrashing wind. \u201cSoon enough, you\u2019ll both die.\u201d</p><p>The wind whipped in an even wilder frenzy. Allison struggled to stand and\u2014</p><p>And Cade had her. He pulled her tight against his chest as the wind seemed to scream and rake her flesh. He held her close, his warm body a solid anchor against the fury.</p><p>Then, in the next instant, there was only\u2014</p><p>Silence.</p><p>His fingers curled around her chin and forced her head up. Allison stared into his eyes, not knowing what to say. Because the werewolf she was looking at just might be her savior...or he could be her worst nightmare.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...not going to kill me?\u201d Allison asked softly from her position in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Cade buttoned the jeans he\u2019d donned and headed toward her. Her scent pulled him in\u2014no one should smell like that.</p><p>Good enough to fucking eat.</p><p>Her gaze darted to his face, then dropped to his chest. Her lips parted when she saw his scars.</p><p>He\u2019d be willing to bet she didn\u2019t have a single scar on that soft, silken body.</p><p>She glanced away, too fast, and his jaw locked. The woman had better start getting used to the way he looked. If she wanted to keep living, he was her only shot at survival.</p><p>Why? What the hell am I doing?</p><p>Helping her hadn\u2019t been the plan...had it?</p><p>She looked at him again, locking those fuck-me blue eyes on his.</p><p>The wolf within started to growl.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making that sound?\u201d</p><p>So maybe the man was growling, too. Vamps weren\u2019t the only ones who liked to use their teeth. Right then, he was real tempted to bite.</p><p>He could start on her shoulder. That delicate spot where neck and shoulder met. He could mark her and\u2014</p><p>\u201cS-stop staring at me like that.\u201d She hunched her shoulders and pulled up her blanket. \u201cEither you\u2019re gonna kill me or you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Those weren\u2019t the only choices he had. What about fucking? Where did that fall on her little to-do-list?</p><p>\u201cI can leave, you know. Go out that door, and you won\u2019t ever have to see me again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get it. Cade lunged forward, grabbed her arms, and lifted her up against him. The blanket fell to the floor. Her lips parted as she sucked in a startled breath. \u201cWithout me,\u201d he told her flatly, \u201cyou are dead. You\u2019ve been marked for death by a witch.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes caught his\u2014trapped him. Fuck. A woman\u2019s eyes shouldn\u2019t make a guy feel like she was stealing his soul with just a glance.</p><p>He forced his hands to ease their too tight grip on her. \u201cSince I didn\u2019t kill you, you can bet that she\u2019ll just send someone else to finish the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause vamps aren\u2019t exactly loved, sweetheart. Humans and supernaturals, hell, we all want to stake them.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and her hair brushed over his arms. \u201cI-I got infected and\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that, he laughed and stepped back, freeing her. \u201cIs that what you think happened?\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded quickly. \u201cWhen I was a kid...vampires killed my parents. They tried to kill me\u2014when they bit me, th-they must have infected me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Had Elsa told her this BS?</p><p>\u201cIf we can just find me a cure...\u201d Allison continued, voice desperate, \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. Whatever\u2019s happening...it can stop. It stopped for years. Nothing happened to me until just a few weeks ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>She had no clue. \u201cYou\u2019re not infected.\u201d The vamps who\u2019d attacked her had no doubt realized the truth about Allison with one bite. They would have tasted the power in her blood. \u201cYou\u2019re a pureblood.\u201d</p><p>Allison blinked. \u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA human who is born to the call of blood. You don\u2019t have to get a blood exchange in order to change. You\u2019re one of the rare few who will change on your own.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at him again. Right. Why believe what he had to say? Figured. He exhaled on a rough sigh. \u201cThat family of yours that died, I\u2019m betting they weren\u2019t your real family, were they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sure as hell were!\u201d</p><p>Ah, now she was showing some bite.</p><p>He cocked his head as he studied her. \u201cEasy. I meant, they weren\u2019t your blood family, right?\u201d No way two humans could have created her. That wasn\u2019t the way purebloods were made.</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \u201cI don\u2019t have any clue who my birth parents were, okay? All I know is they dumped me on the steps of a hospital and never looked back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo leave a pureblood behind, they probably couldn\u2019t look back.\u201d</p><p>A furrow appeared between her brows. No clue. He tried to explain by saying, \u201cPurebloods are rare. Only newly turned vamps can have kids, and they don\u2019t just toss \u2018em out.\u201d No matter what else you could say about the vamps, they protected their own. \u201cYour parents...\u201d</p><p>She watched him with troubled, lost eyes, not speaking.</p><p>Cade exhaled. \u201cI\u2019m guessing they were being hunted, and if they never came back for you, that means...\u201d</p><p>They died.</p><p>Her lashes lowered, and he knew she understood. Her throat worked as she swallowed, and, still not looking back at him, she said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t be...\u201d</p><p>Deal with it. Life sucks, sweetheart. It\u2019s a lesson we all learn. \u201cYou are. In just a few days, you\u2019ll be kissing your human life good-bye.\u201d Then what was he supposed to do? Stake her? Cut off that pretty head?</p><p>No.</p><p>Her cheeks grew even paler.</p><p>But it was best that she go ahead and understand this now. An infection? Not for her. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna change. By the time the full moon rises, you\u2019ll be a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can stop it! Elsa said there was a cure, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no stopping it for you. Elsa just set you up to die.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at his words. Right. The truth could hurt, huh? Better to shatter all her illusions now. \u201cThere\u2019s no cure. There\u2019s not a damn thing you can do to stop the change.\u201d</p><p>Her body trembled.</p><p>\u201cYou will be a vampire.\u201d His hand lifted, and traced the thick scar that circled his neck. A scar that he\u2019d received when he\u2019d been too young to readily pull forth the full wolf within. \u201cAnd then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d Allison whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll go for the throat of any asshole dumb enough to get near you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you...hate vampires.\u201d Her eyes had fallen to the hand that slid across his scar.</p><p>He stared at her, caught by her words. \u201cYeah, I fucking do.\u201d Fury broke beneath the words. He hated those parasites and wanted them all in the ground\u2014so why was he standing there, talking to her, wanting her?</p><p>Offering to protect her?</p><p>Cade spun away. \u201cStay the night. You\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d He\u2019d know if anyone tried to sneak onto his land.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her whisper followed him.</p><p>Cade glanced back. She\u2019d wrapped her arms around her stomach. She stared after him, looking lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d he growled.

Allison knew it was a nightmare, but she still couldn\u2019t wake up. Her parents were dead around her, their blood staining the white carpet a dark red. Her neck hurt, and she could feel the wetness sliding down her skin.</p><p>Her blood.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing you again...\u201d The vampire told her, smiling with a flash of his blood-stained teeth. \u201cGrow up for us, get strong...we\u2019ll be seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>Because she was one of them. Just like them. She\u2019d kill, torture, listen to her prey scream\u2014</p><p>\u201cWake up, Allison.\u201d Hands were wrapped around her arms, shaking her not-so-gently. \u201cDammit, wake up!\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes flew open, and she found Cade crouched over her. She almost screamed again.</p><p>Just in time, she managed to stop herself. \u201cI\u2014is something wrong?\u201d Her heart thudded in her chest and her voice came out far too husky.</p><p>She was in the bed. His bed. He\u2019d taken the couch and offered his room to her.</p><p>A nice gesture for a killer.</p><p>\u201cYou were screaming.\u201d</p><p>And now she was awake, in bed, mostly naked, with a bare-chested werewolf crouching over her. \u201cBad dream,\u201d she managed.</p> <p>Cade grunted. Was that supposed to be a sympathy sound? He stared to pull away.</p><p>She grabbed his hand.</p><p>They both froze then. Suddenly, the air seemed very, very thick. And he seemed even...bigger than before.</p><p>\u201cYou want to let me go,\u201d he said the words softly, but she heard the order in them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him go. \u201cYou\u2019re not the hard-ass you want me to believe you are.\u201d Hard-ass killers didn\u2019t comfort you when you had a nightmare. Hard-ass killers didn\u2019t give you their beds. They didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>One second. That was all it took. He had her flat on her back as his body crushed hers into the mattress. His lips were on hers, not soft and gentle\u2014wild, hard, rough.</p><p>He didn\u2019t kiss like a new lover. He kissed like a man taking what he wanted.</p><p>Me.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t pull away. His hold was too strong. But\u2014</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to pull away. Allison let her lips part even more, and she kissed him back, loving the hot surge that heated her veins. She\u2019d been alone and afraid for so long and now\u2014I want him.</p><p>His mouth jerked away from hers. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. Tasted him. Wild. \u201cKissing you?\u201d Sure, she might not be the most experienced chick in the world but she did have some skills.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Uh, shouldn\u2019t that be\u2014</p><p>\u201cDo you like to play with fire? I want you...\u201d His voice had roughened, deepened so that it sounded like the rumble from a beast, \u201cand werewolves aren\u2019t exactly known for their control.\u201d</p><p>Her hand rose and traced one of the twisting scars that crossed his chest.</p><p>Cade\u2019s muscles stiffened at her touch. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d His words broke off as his head jerked to the right. She saw the slight flaring of his nostrils as he scented the air.</p><p>\u201cCade?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her. Just stared toward the dark window. \u201cCompany.\u201d</p><p>Cade leapt out of the bed and raced for the door. Allison grabbed for her clothes and yanked them on as she stumbled after him.</p><p>Then she heard the growl of motors approaching. At least two. Oh, crap, this wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>She grabbed Cade\u2019s arm. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>He spun to face her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo trucks. Seven dumbass humans. I can smell \u2018em.\u201d He inhaled and offered a grim smile. \u201cAnd those humans are about to get an ass beating.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he did know.</p><p>Cade stalked outside. He was still bare-chested, and the guy didn\u2019t even look for a weapon to take with him. She didn\u2019t know much about werewolves, but no way were they indestructible.</p><p>Allison rushed after him, yanking down her shirt. The trucks had just braked to a halt, and dirt danced in the air around them.</p><p>Cade stopped on the small porch, braced his legs apart and kept his arms loose at his sides. \u201cGriggs!\u201d He called out. \u201cYou dumb bastard, you don\u2019t want to get in this battle.\u201d</p><p>Griggs? The guy from Blood Bath? Like she\u2019d be forgetting him anytime soon.</p><p>The truck door opened, and sure enough, Griggs poked his shaved head out. \u201cFor enough money, I\u2019d gut my own mother.\u201d</p><p>Lovely.</p><p>The men climbed out of the trucks. Cade had been right about their \u201ccompany\u201d after all.</p><p>\u201cThe money\u2019s real good,\u201d Griggs continued as he began to edge toward them. Oh, damn, was that a wooden stake in his hand? \u201cToo good to pass up. Not my fault if you went all pussy weak.\u201d</p><p>A quick glance showed her that Cade\u2019s claws were coming out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Griggs demanded. \u201cDid you decide to spend some time screwing the target? I mean, she\u2019s hot, but not worth the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cade lunged forward, and when he moved, in that instant, Allison saw the flash of metal. A gun. The jerkoff sidling up behind Griggs had a gun that he was aiming at Cade.</p><p>Had Cade even seen the weapon?</p><p>She screamed a warning and leapt toward Cade. Leapt\u2014and moved faster than she\u2019d ever moved in her life. Faster than a human could ever move. Her body slammed into his, and she knocked Cade out of the way even as she felt a fierce burn lance her skin.</p><p>She hit the ground, stunned, and realized that her side was still burning. Allison glanced down and in the growing dawn light, she saw the blood seeping through her shirt.</p><p>\u201cFucking wrong move,\u201d Cade snarled.</p><p>Her head lifted, and she saw him charge for the gunman. One twist, and he\u2019d broken the man\u2019s wrist. Cade grabbed the gun, and fired two quick shots at the two men coming from the second truck. They fell, screaming.</p><p>I know the feeling, assholes. Allison pushed her hand against the wound as she tried to stop the flow of blood.</p><p>Griggs just kept standing there with the stake clutched in his fist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool,\u201d Cade snarled the words at Griggs. He tossed the shooter against a tree. The guy moaned and fell to the ground. \u201cYou come out here, and you think a bullet\u2019s gonna stop me?\u201d</p><p>Griggs backed up a few steps.</p><p>Cade stalked after him. \u201cBecause you know about the supernaturals, you think that makes you some kind of bad ass slaying machine?\u201d</p><p>Allison managed to get to her feet. She only swayed a little, and the blood was slowing, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>She blinked, and Cade had Griggs pinned against the truck. All of the men Griggs had brought with him were on the ground, moaning in pain.</p><p>Cade\u2019s fingers, no, his claws, were at Griggs\u2019s throat. \u201cCome after me again,\u201d Cade warned, \u201cyou\u2019re dead. So much as look at Allison wrong...and you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Allison swallowed. He was protecting her again. If he didn\u2019t watch it, she\u2019d definitely start to think he had a soft spot hidden beneath those claws and fur.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rip you open,\u201d Cade continued, voice grim, \u201cand cut your heart right out of your chest while you scream and beg for me to stop.\u201d</p><p>Maybe not such a soft spot.</p><p>\u201cNot get the fuck out of here,\u201d he ordered. \u201cAnd make sure every hunter in the area knows...stay away from what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Wait\u2014hold up\u2014did she qualify as his?</p><p>Cade stepped back from Griggs. Griggs hauled ass for his truck and his men, wounded, bleeding\u2014their blood smelled sweet\u2014limped after him.</p><p>The trucks roared away, fish-tailing it through the woods.</p><p>Slowly, Cade turned to face her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand and saw the blood on her fingertips. \u201cBecause you couldn\u2019t die for me.\u201d</p><p>He stalked toward her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Well, that seemed harsh. She\u2019d saved his butt. Didn\u2019t that count for anything in his mind?</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cWolves like the scent of blood.\u201d</p><p>So did vampires.</p><p>He was almost upon her now, and she could see the sharp edge of his canines. \u201cIt usually makes us want to attack,\u201d he said in that lethal voice of his.</p><p>Allison barely managed to swallow the lump in her throat as she looked up at him. Don\u2019t attack. Down, wolf. Down.</p><p>He\u2019d said his control wasn\u2019t that good. She sure didn\u2019t want him losing control right then.</p><p>His hands flew out and grabbed the edge of her t-shirt. He yanked the bloody fabric, ripping it. His breath hissed out. Or was that hers?</p><p>\u201cThe bullet\u2019s still in you.\u201d</p><p>Her knees almost buckled at that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still in you...\u201d His green gaze measured her, and he said, \u201cand you\u2019re on your feet.\u201d</p><p>So she was. \u201cI wanted to...help you.\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her for a moment. His gaze searched hers. For what, she didn\u2019t know. Then he shook his head. \u201cLet me help you now.\u201d And he picked her up, lifting her easily into his arms.</p><p>Maybe it was stupid, but she felt...safe...in those strong arms.</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna hurt,\u201d he warned her as he carried her back inside the cabin. \u201cBut you can\u2019t heal until that bullet comes out.\u201d</p><p>Her head rested against his shoulder. It seemed natural to put her head against him. To let her body soften against the hard strength of his chest.</p><p>She took a deep breath and tried to ignore the pain lancing up her side. \u201cYou said...blood usually makes you want to attack.\u201d Please, no attacks for the next, oh, hour or so. Not until she was back to better fighting form.</p><p>He slammed the door behind them and headed for the bedroom.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t letting this one go. \u201cWh-what does my blood make you want to do?\u201d</p><p>Cade lowered her onto the bed. He ripped away the rest of her shirt, leaving her clad in her black bra. His fingers slid up her side, a gentle touch that she hadn\u2019t expected. A caress? That soft touch was almost enough to make Allison forget her question. Almost.</p><p>But having a werewolf so close to her when she was weak and bleeding...Focus. \u201cCade?\u201d Allison breathed his name. What if the scent was too strong? What if his beast took control?</p><p>He looked up at her, and his green eyes were glowing with the power of the wolf.</p><p>Chill bumps rose on her arms.</p><p>\u201cYour blood...the scent...\u201d His jaw clenched, and he gritted, \u201cIt makes me want to kill.\u201d</p><p>Not good.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me want to tear apart those bastards\u2014to make damn sure that they can\u2019t ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted but Allison realized she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cNow scream if you have to,\u201d and his sharpened claws hovered over her wound, \u201cbecause this is gonna hurt like a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>The sound pierced right through him. The wolf howled inside of Cade, but his fingers were rock steady as he drove his claws into her wound.</p><p>His left hand pressed against her stomach, holding her in place on the bed, while his right hand dug into the torn flesh.</p><p>Tears leaked from the corners of her eyes, but after that first scream, she didn\u2019t make a sound. He glanced at her, only for a moment, and saw that Allison was biting her bottom lip to hold back her cries.</p><p>Should have killed them.</p><p>Why the hell hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Because you didn\u2019t want her to think you were a monster.</p><p>He found the bullet. Held tight to it and felt the burn on his flesh. Smoke rose from his fingertips and drifted from her body.</p><p>\u201cC-Cade?\u201d Her voice was soft and scared. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>He pulled out the bullet. The flesh on his fingers was bright red and already blistering. He tossed the bullet onto the nightstand. \u201cThey used silver.\u201d</p><p>Should have killed them.</p><p>Those bastards hadn\u2019t just been after Allison. Elsa had sent the humans to take him out.</p><p>Allison\u2019s wound began to close, right before his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt feels...strange,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTingling...\u201d</p><p>Because the flesh was mending. She was so close to the change now, so close to becoming fully vampire, that her body had already prepared for the shift.</p><p>Vamps could heal from nearly any wound. Because they were such fast healers, they were often damn hard to kill.</p><p>There were only three ways to kill a vampire\u2014fire, beheading, or a stake to the heart.</p><p>No wonder Elsa hadn\u2019t come after Allison on her own. The witch literally wasn\u2019t strong enough to kill her.</p><p>But I am. A werewolf\u2019s claws were the perfect weapon to behead a vamp.</p><p>He realized that his fingers were caressing her stomach. Sliding lightly over the flesh. His gaze lifted, met hers.</p><p>Want her.</p><p>\u201cYou...protected me.\u201d Who\u2019d ever done that before? And why the hell had she done it? He\u2019d told her that he\u2019d been sent to kill her, and the woman had still gone ahead and take a bullet for him.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Allison stared back at him.</p><p>Fuck. He rose. Left the room.</p><p>\u201cCade?\u201d Allison called after him. He liked it when she said his name. Liked it when she touched him. When her scent surrounded him. \u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d she said, the words quiet, but he heard them perfectly.</p><p>His chest ached. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He went back into the room with a wet cloth held in his hands. She was sitting up now, and her breasts pushed against the cups of her bra. Damn fine breasts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cade\u2019s cock shoved against the front of his jeans, but he yanked back the lust.</p><p>For now.</p><p>Carefully, he put the wet cloth over her side and washed the blood off her skin. Creamy, smooth skin. The wound was all but gone. Vamps and their amped up healing powers. She\u2019d have no scar to bear, not like him.</p> <p>Scars covered far too much of him.</p><p>He glanced up and found Allison staring at the scar that sliced down his cheek and curled under his jaw. Cade\u2019s back teeth clenched.</p><p>Then she lifted her hand and touched the rough skin. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Sympathy. Pity. He didn\u2019t want either from her. He tossed the cloth unto the nightstand. It covered the bullet. \u201cNothing I couldn\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to drop her hand. She didn\u2019t. Just kept right on touching him, and the lust that he\u2019d tried to hold back grew stronger with every second that passed.</p> <p>Her heady scent filled his nose. Her body was so close, waiting for him. And she was touching him. Stroking his cheek. Staring up at him with those big, blue eyes.</p><p>She knew how dangerous he was. The lady should be hauling ass away from him.</p><p>Not\u2014</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Her words were husky, whispered, and they slid right over his flesh better than any silken stroke.</p><p>Fine. Not like it was some deep, dark secret. His story had been talked about in bars. Whispered in the woods. \u201cWhen I was fourteen, vamps attacked my pack.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stilled on his cheek. Her eyes didn\u2019t look away from his.</p> <p>\u201cI was too young to shift, but too damn big to be seen as anything other than a threat that they had to eliminate.\u201d He\u2019d always been big. But being big didn\u2019t matter when you were up against a vampire\u2019s enhanced strength.</p><p>\u201cBefore they got around to that eliminating...\u201d He exhaled and remembered the scent of burning flesh. \u201cThey thought it would be fun to torture me.\u201d</p><p>He saw the delicate movement of her throat as she swallowed. \u201cYour face.\u201d</p><p>Cade couldn\u2019t help it. He laughed at that. Then he rose and made sure the light fell on his body. There would be no shadows to hide him any longer. He hadn\u2019t taken the time to put his shirt back on before heading out to face Griggs and his gang. No shirt to cover him. No darkness to cloak the old wounds. \u201cSweetheart, my face was just the start.\u201d</p><p>He turned around, real slow, making sure she had time to see all the marks that twisted his flesh.</p><p>Nothing nice or neat about him. The vamps had used silver knifes to peel away his skin. Then they\u2019d used liquid silver to burn his muscles. To burn and burn until agony had been all he\u2019d known.</p><p>He kept his back to her and stared straight ahead at the wall. The vampires had been laughing as he screamed.</p><p>\u201cBut I stopped them,\u201d he said, still remembering. Still seeing. \u201cI got out of the chains.\u201d Out of the silver that had held his wrists so tightly. \u201cAt the first light of dawn, when they were weak and I was strong, I got out, and I killed every one of those fucking bloodsuckers.\u201d With the claws that had finally sprang from his fingers. The pain, the fury\u2014something had brought on the change in him. The wolf had burst to the surface that blood-soaked day, and his claws had ripped into his prey.</p> <p>\u201cBut it was too late for the others in my pack,\u201d he said. Far too late. \u201cEveryone else was dead.\u201d Tossed aside. Broken.</p><p>He\u2019d never joined another pack. What was the point? To grow close to them, to care, only to wind up one day watching them all die in another attack?</p><p>He didn\u2019t need anyone else. Didn\u2019t want anyone else. It was far better to be alone.</p><p>When Cade felt the light touch on his back, he stiffened. Not fingers on his skin\u2014the touch was too soft. That was\u2014</p><p>Allison was kissing his back. Kissing the marks left by torture almost twenty years ago.</p><p>He spun around and caught her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look afraid. She should. The wolf was far too close to breaking free. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked him, staring into his eyes and he found he couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cYou took care of me...why can\u2019t I take care of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want your damn pity!\u201d His words weren\u2019t loud. Lethally soft.</p><p>\u201cPity isn\u2019t what I want to give you.\u201d Then she pulled from his hold, far too easily.</p><p>Barely human now. The vampire transformation was so close. Did she realize it?</p><p>Allison straightened her shoulders, and then she reached behind her back. He heard a soft snick and her bra slipped to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s happening to me.\u201d</p><p>Shit, were those tears in her eyes?</p><p>\u201cI can feel the change. I mean, I just instantly healed from a freaking bullet wound. I know, okay? I know what I\u2019m becoming.\u201d</p><p>Some would say that she was becoming a monster.</p><p>Just like him.</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m becoming, but I don\u2019t know what will happen to me when\u2014\u201d She broke off and shook her head. Her breasts pointed up toward him, the nipples tight and hard and a pretty pink.</p><p>Want to taste.</p><p>His cock was so hard that it hurt. He wanted in her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow. I just care about right now.\u201d Her hands dropped to the front of her jeans. They were undone. He\u2019d undone them in his frenzy to repair her wound. \u201cRight now, I want you.\u201d</p><p>That was all he needed to hear. Before she could say anything else, before he could think of a reason why this was wrong, Cade had her flat on the bed. His body trapped hers, and his mouth tasted one sweet breast. And it was sweet. Sweet and tight and perfect in his mouth.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Her hands slid over his back. He didn\u2019t tense when she touched his scars. Didn\u2019t try to pull her hands away from the marks he\u2019d always carry.</p><p>He just sucked her breast harder. Lapped at her nipple. One, then the other. His hands shoved down her jeans and yanked her panties away.</p><p>She wanted him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how the hell he\u2019d gotten that miracle, but he wasn\u2019t about to turn her away.</p><p>In that moment, there wasn\u2019t a single force on earth that would have made him leave her.</p><p>\u201cYou want him dead, witch?\u201d Griggs swiped the blood from his nose as he glared at Elsa. \u201cKill him your own damn self. We\u2019re not goin\u2019 back. Not facin\u2019 that fuckin\u2019 freak again.\u201d</p><p>Elsa glared at him and his worthless bunch of humans. These were supposed to be hunters? More like whipped puppies. \u201cOne man,\u201d she snapped. Her hands flattened on the table. Her mirror, the scrying mirror she\u2019d used since her eighteenth birthday, gleamed upon the table\u2019s surface. \u201cYou let one man defeat all of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a man.\u201d Griggs spat blood on the floor. \u201cWerewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolves can die.\u201d Everyone and everything could die.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your own.\u201d Griggs turned away.</p><p>Her hands fisted. \u201cI\u2019ll double the money!\u201d She was running out of time...and options. Vampires were closing in. They were already in the city. It wouldn\u2019t be much longer before they found Allison.</p><p>Griggs hesitated. Greedy bastard. Sometimes, humans could be so predictable. Elsa started to smile.</p><p>\u201cThat guard dog she\u2019s got...\u201d Griggs glanced back over his shoulder and shook his head. \u201cIf we go back, he\u2019ll kill us all.\u201d</p><p>She could almost smell his fear. Rancid.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your fucking own.\u201d He stormed out, taking his men with him. Their thudding footsteps blended with the wild racing of her heart.</p><p>No, no, this couldn\u2019t be happening. Not to her.</p><p>Elsa grabbed her knife. One quick slice over her arm and she had blood dropping onto her mirror. With her index finger, she slid the blood over the mirror\u2019s surface as she chanted.</p><p>The image came to her, not slow and blurry, but fast and crisp.</p><p>Her future hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>The full moon hung in the air. Allison stood over her, with her vampire teeth barred. Allison\u2019s eyes were wild, and blood dripped down her chin.</p><p>Elsa stared at the image. No change. Allison would still kill her in just a few days time. When she changed, when she became fully vampire, Allison would come after her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you first,\u201d Elsa whispered. That\u2019s why she\u2019d first sought out Allison. Because of the death vision. She would change that vision.</p><p>She had to.</p><p>Elsa wasn\u2019t planning on dying for some vampire bitch. Allison would be the one to die. She\u2019d be the one to bleed and beg and scream and die.</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Elsa said as she reached for the knife again.</p><p>She just had to find a way to hit the vampire\u2019s weakness. Everyone had a weakness, even a pureblood vampire.</p><p>You\u2019re the one who\u2019ll die.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Allison\u2019s breath heaved out as she stared up at Cade. His arms were on either side of her body, his hands pushing down into the mattress as he caged her in place.</p><p>Lust and stark need etched hard lines onto his face, and his broad shoulders seemed to block out the light around them.</p><p>She was naked beneath him. Naked...and she could see the sharp edge of his teeth.</p><p>And the glow of the beast that lit his eyes.</p><p>Maybe she should have been afraid then.</p><p>But her head lifted and she met him in a hot, open-mouthed kiss. Her tongue slipped inside his mouth and tasted him. The werewolf\u2019s power wasn\u2019t scaring her.</p><p>It was turning her on.</p><p>Her hand fisted in his hair as she pulled him closer. Allison had enjoyed a handful of lovers in her life. The first few had been fumbling, the others more skilled.</p><p>Yet right then, she couldn\u2019t remember any of their names. Couldn\u2019t pull up their faces.</p><p>Only Cade.</p><p>She sucked on his lower lip. Heard his growl and felt her body tense in anticipation.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to be some gentle ride. No sweet release.</p><p>Good. She wanted fire and passion. Wild pleasure.</p><p>Him.</p><p>Her lips slipped from his, and Allison kissed her way down his neck. His pulse raced beneath her lips, thudding in time with his heartbeat.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>She licked him. Bit lightly.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Allison turned her head away, squeezing her eyes shut as she fought the dark impulse to drink from him. That wasn\u2019t what she wanted. She wanted\u2014</p><p>The bed shifted as he moved, sliding down her body. His fingers were rough, strong, as he pushed her thighs apart. Then those fingers were sliding up, stroking right over the core of her need, and a gasp broke from Allison\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d his growl.</p><p>Slowly, her eyes opened and her head turned toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see...\u201d His fingers pushed inside her. Stretched her. Thrust and made her want more. \u201cWhen you look at me?\u201d</p><p>She saw the man she wanted.</p><p>\u201cMonster?\u201d His fingers withdrew. Thrust deeper. Her hips lifted helplessly against him as she arched off the bed. \u201cOr man?\u201d</p><p>Allison licked her lips. \u201cMan.\u201d But what did he see? When he looked at her what\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd I see the most fucking beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He pulled his hand back. Yanked open his jeans and positioned his cock at the entrance of her body. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>He made her feel that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m safe,\u201d he told her, voice rough and deep as he fought to hold his desire in check, and his gaze seemed to burn even brighter. \u201cWerewolves can\u2019t carry any diseases. Neither can vamps.\u201d</p><p>She already knew that, just as she knew pregnancy wasn\u2019t a risk for her, not then. Could a vampire and a werewolf even have a baby together?</p><p>Cade waited at the entrance of her body. She felt the broad shaft of his cock and she wanted him inside but...</p><p>\u201cNo fear,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Allison shook her head. She didn\u2019t fear him. Right then, she just wanted him. \u201cNow, Cade. Now.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf smiled and drove into her. He filled her, so full and thick, and Allison realized that she\u2019d forgotten to breathe. He stilled for a moment, letting her adjust, and when she tightened around him, wanting more, Cade withdrew\u2014then thrust in again, harder.</p><p>Her nails dug into his shoulders. She wanted hard. Wild. Him.</p><p>Each slide of his flesh sent need twisting through her. Her sex was so sensitive, stretched, eager.</p><p>Pleasure beckoned just out of reach.</p><p>The bed squeaked in time with their rhythm. Thrust. Withdraw. Thrust. Stronger each time. Deeper. Wilder.</p><p>Allison laughed. It just felt good. He felt good. Her nails dug deeper. Her legs wrapped around him, pulling him closer.</p><p>Cade\u2019s mouth was on her neck. No, not her neck, but right at the curve of her shoulder. She could feel the edge of his teeth.</p><p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t the only one who liked to bite.</p><p>And...and she liked the feel of his teeth. Allison tilted her head back and pushed harder against him.</p><p>Harder.</p><p>The climax hit her, slamming right through her body so that her breath choked out and pleasure rocked her. Not gentle. Not easy. So fierce that the room dimmed. Aftershocks trembled through her sex as ripples of release tightened her around him.</p><p>And Cade came. She felt the hot release inside of her even as his teeth nipped at her shoulder. He shuddered and his hands held her so tight.</p><p>As if he\u2019d never let go.</p><p>His heartbeat raced. She could feel it against her. Drumming far faster than hers ever could. He was so warm around her. Warm and strong and solid.</p><p>In his arms, she was safe. Nothing could hurt her. No one.</p><p>Not while she was in his arms.</p><p>He pressed a soft kiss to her shoulder and lifted his body as he stared down at her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want the moment to end. Not yet. Allison didn\u2019t want to talk. Didn\u2019t want to worry about what or who would be coming for them next. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right then, she just wanted to pretend that the rest of the world didn\u2019t matter. Just a man and woman\u2014that\u2019s all they were.</p><p>No monsters.</p><p>No darkness.</p> <p>Just a man.</p><p>She pressed a kiss to his chest.</p><p>And a woman.</p><p>Cade began to thrust again.</p><p>She was gone. Cade knew he was alone even before his eyes opened. The bed felt cold. Allison\u2019s scent was weak, barely hanging in the air.</p> <p>She was gone.</p><p>Growling, he jerked up in bed. The woman never should have been able to give him the slip. If he hadn\u2019t spent half the day screwing her until he fell into an exhausted sleep, she damn well wouldn\u2019t have gotten away.</p><p>He leapt from the bed. Didn\u2019t she know how dangerous it was out there?</p><p>She needed him.</p><p>And he...fuck it, he wasn\u2019t letting her get away from him. He grabbed his jeans, yanked them on, and followed the faint trail of her scent in the air. Roses.</p><p>He threw open the screen door, and it banged against the side of the cabin. She hadn\u2019t taken the motorcycle. That was something. But then, he\u2019d taken the liberty of hiding the keys.</p> <p>His head turned slowly, and he stared at the thick line of trees. At the mountains that waited.</p><p>She\u2019d gone off alone. Fuck.</p><p>Didn\u2019t she realize? There was no place that she could go\u2014no place that he wouldn\u2019t follow.</p><p>He\u2019d had one taste, and he wasn\u2019t about to let his little pureblood go.</p><p>Elsa stood in the clearing, smiling. Her mirror had shown her just what she needed to see\u2014Allison, running. Allison, scared and desperate.</p><p>The fool didn\u2019t fully understand what was happening to her body. She didn\u2019t know about vampire weaknesses.</p><p>She was about to find out. And a vampire running in the day...she might as well be human. Elsa could take out a human any day of the week. She\u2019d been wrong to think that Allison was too powerful for her to handle alone. She could destroy the pureblood vamp. She would.</p><p>Elsa lifted her arms and called forth her magic. The spell of fire was always the first mastered by her kind. The first, and the most powerful.</p> <p>The flames began to spread to the trees around her. The fire leapt from branch to branch, jumping through the forest. Soon, the fire would sweep out into a giant circle that would surround the fleeing vamp-to-be.</p><p>Surround Allison and trap her. The fire would close in. Slowly. Slowly.</p><p>The wolf had done his job after all. He\u2019d lured Allison from the protection of the city. Got her into the wilderness where she was helpless. And soon...</p><p>Soon the fire would take her.</p><p>Elsa would make sure she stayed close enough to hear the bitch\u2019s screams.</p><p>The scent of smoke reached her, thick, cloying, and Allison froze. Her heart thudded wildly in her chest, pounding hard enough to shake her.</p><p>She turned slowly. The smoke...it was coming from the right. Allison could see the dark streak of gray in the sky. A forest fire? Hell, that couldn\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>Flames crackled. But that crackling came from behind her, to the left.</p><p>Her gaze jerked toward the sound.</p><p>More smoke. More fire. And that blaze looked like it was racing right toward her.</p><p>No...no...</p><p>\u201cAllison!\u201d The roar was her name. A roar loud enough to push across the crackling fire. \u201cAllison!\u201d</p><p>Cade was coming for her.</p><p>She spun around, seeing only smoke and fire now. So much. Too thick. She began to cough. This...wasn\u2019t right. The afternoon had been fine moments before. Clear. Calm. She\u2019d been the one running wild and\u2014</p><p>\u201cAllison!\u201d</p><p>She choked, but managed to cry out... \u201cCade!\u201d And, oh, damn, was that fire racing toward her?</p><p>She jumped back, barely avoiding a wild surge of heat. The fire was so close now. It seemed to be heading right for her.</p><p>Because it was. Understanding was like ice in her veins.</p><p>Freaking witch.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anywhere to run. The flames were all around her. No, not just around her.</p><p>Allison screamed when fire licked its way up her arms. She dropped to the ground, rolling and slapping at the flames. But more flames just came, burning her, burning...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>She was still screaming so she barely heard the words. He had to tell her three times, then Allison managed to glance up.</p><p>Cade was there, pulling her against his chest. And it hurt. She hurt. Deep blisters covered her skin, and the smell of burnt flesh\u2014her flesh\u2014had her stomach rolling.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he told her as he rose, tucking her body close against his. The movement hurt, but she locked her teeth to hold back the cry.</p><p>A wall of fire blocked them. There was nowhere to go. No\u2014</p><p>He bent his head over hers. Curved his body so that he was covering her, and he leapt right through the flames.</p><p>Allison heard the rush of the fire\u2014a wild whoosh of sound\u2014and the burning breath of the flames blew over her body.</p><p>Then they both hit the ground. They fell in a tangle of limbs, spinning, rolling, falling down a hill. Faster, faster.</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel the bumps. Didn\u2019t feel the bruises. But when they fell into the too-chilled water of a lake, oh, sweet hell, yes, she felt that.</p><p>And she just sank beneath that cold water. Her eyes wanted to sag closed. Why was that so wrong? She\u2019d rest a few moments in the sweet cold, then everything would be fine.</p><p>Something grabbed her. Her eyes flew open. Through the murky water, she could just make out Cade\u2019s form. He looked furious, his eyes glowing. His hands wrapped around her shoulders, and he pulled her toward him. A powerful kick from his legs sent them shooting toward the surface. Allison couldn\u2019t get her own legs to move and was grateful for her wolf\u2019s strength.</p><p>And it was only when they broke the surface and when his gasps for breath filled her ears that Allison realized...</p><p>I\u2019m not breathing.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck no.</p><p>Allison\u2019s eyes were wide open. Staring straight at him, but the woman wasn\u2019t seeing him. She wasn\u2019t breathing. Her body was ice cold.</p><p>A shudder shook his frame as Cade lowered her to the ground. \u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d he muttered as he pushed back her wet hair and ran his fingers over her face. \u201cBreathe for me.\u201d</p><p>Blisters and deep burns covered her forearms and hands. Her legs had fallen victim to the fire\u2014he\u2019d seen the wounds.</p><p>So much pain.</p><p>Too much.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t breathing.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting her go like this. Not like this.</p><p>He put his mouth to hers. Damn she was cold. Her lips were like ice against his.</p><p>Cade blew into her mouth. Take my breath, sweetheart. Take it.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He gave her his breath again. Come on, Allison. Don\u2019t leave me.</p><p>He pushed air into her mouth once more.</p><p>And she jerked beneath him. His head lifted and he stared down at her, desperate, wild.</p><p>She\u2019d coughed up water and seemed to be breathing now. Her eyes actually saw him. But she was still so icy. So pale.</p><p>And hurting so much.</p><p>His canines had stretched when he\u2019d first caught the scent of smoke. The wolf within had known that danger stalked Allison. His claws had come out, his teeth had prepared to rip and tear\u2014he\u2019d been ready to do anything in order to protect her.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>He lifted his hand and slashed his wrist with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cC-Cade?\u201d Her voice was a broken whisper. \u201cWhy...don\u2019t hurt...\u201d</p><p>He put his wrist to her mouth. \u201cDrink.\u201d Because if she didn\u2019t, he could still lose her.</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cN-no.\u201d Her body shook, trembling hard, and he knew shock when he saw it.</p><p>Fire was a particular bitch for vampires. They burned far faster than humans. Faster than any of the other paranormals.</p><p>But you knew that, didn\u2019t you, Elsa? He had to deal with that witch. Payback.</p><p>After he made sure Allison wasn\u2019t checking out on him. \u201cTake it,\u201d he ordered, staring into her eyes. The gold was almost gone now, never a good sign with a pureblood vamp. It meant her body was too depleted.</p><p>But she turned her head away. \u201cI...can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to be...\u201d</p><p>A vampire.</p><p>Screw it. \u201cNo changing what we are.\u201d He knew the scent of his blood had to be driving her crazy. He\u2019d seen her nostrils flare. Oh, yeah, she liked that scent. \u201cSo either drink or die.\u201d</p><p>Her head slowly turned back toward him. He could see the fear in her gaze. And the desperation.</p><p>He could also see that just beneath her too-pale lips, her fangs were growing.</p><p>With every second that passed, Allison lost her mortal self. Before his eyes, she was becoming more.</p><p>Vampires are the enemy. That had been his line for years. Parasites. Good only for killing.</p><p>Slowly, her mouth pressed against his wrist.</p><p>The only good vamp...</p><p>She didn\u2019t look like a parasite.</p><p>Is a staked vampire.</p><p>Her tongue slipped out and licked the blood. Her eyes were open, on his. At the first taste of his blood, he heard the sharp inhale of her breath.</p><p>She likes it.</p><p>She licked up another drop of blood.</p><p>Her eyes were still on his.</p><p>But...</p><p>A tear streaked down her cheek. Not a blood tear, and usually those were the only tears a vampire could shed. Allison still shed human tears as she took his blood.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he whispered because she hadn\u2019t taken enough blood to heal her wounds. Not even close.</p><p>Her mouth pressed harder against him and when he felt the scrape of her teeth, Cade expected the memories to slam into him. Another bite, another time.</p><p>Torture.</p><p>Screams.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>But...but he only saw her. Saw the gold come back into her eyes. Saw the wounds begin to fade from her body. He didn\u2019t feel like prey.</p><p>Her mouth on him\u2014damn, it felt good.</p><p>No pain. A pleasure he\u2019d never expected to feel from a vampire\u2019s bite.</p><p>Fuck. He was getting turned on while a vampire fed from him.</p><p>Her teeth sank into his wrist. She sucked harder and damn if his cock didn\u2019t swell even more.</p><p>The rush of pleasure had his breath panting out. This wasn\u2019t just about saving her any longer. Now he was the one who wanted more.</p><p>Cade hadn\u2019t gotten enough of Allison when he\u2019d had her in that bed beneath him. Maybe he\u2019d never get enough.</p><p>His hand tunneled in her hair. Not to force her away from his wrist, but to hold her against him. To make her take more.</p><p>When she licked him again, it was like a shot of pleasure right to his cock.</p><p>Want.</p><p>But not there. He forced his head to lift, and he gazed at the smoke billowing above them. That witch was out there, she could come at them anytime, she could\u2014</p><p>\u201cCade.\u201d Allison\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t weak now. Her glanced back at her. She\u2019d pushed against him, let go of his wrist, but she stared at him with hunger in her eyes.</p><p>Not hunger for blood.</p><p>Lust.</p><p>For vampires, those two needs could intertwine so easily. That was why some vamps and their fancy-ass vamp councils had started to spread the PR in the paranormal world about their kind not taking directly from living prey.</p><p>Like he bought that bullshit.</p><p>Her tongue swiped over her lips. Dark red lips. The burns were already gone from her body. The woman was gonna make one dangerously powerful vampire.</p><p>No, not make. She already was powerful.</p><p>Her hand rose. Touched his lips. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>And he wanted to be buried in her as deep as his cock could go.</p><p>But first... \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d Because he could hear sirens coming. Like anyone could ignore a blaze this size. The humans would rush in and fight the flames. Their trucks were already so close that his ears picked up the hard growl of the approaching engines.</p><p>If he let Allison stay there, the witch could try again with her fire and fury. The humans could get caught in the cross-fire.</p><p>He gazed down at Allison. Her dark hair was wet around her, and her clothes clung tightly to her body. A body he\u2019d learned so well with his hands and mouth.</p><p>A body he\u2019d know again.</p><p>\u201cCome on...\u201d He pulled Allison to her feet. Watched her carefully. After her first feeding, he wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Her standing there, looking increasingly lost...that wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>He pulled her close. \u201cI\u2019ve got a back-up motorcycle stashed close by. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d His lips pressed a quick kiss to her temple.</p><p>And he froze.</p><p>Shit. Shit. What was happening to him? How could he care so much about what might happen to a vampire? About how she might be feeling for fuck\u2019s sake?</p><p>His back teeth clenched.</p><p>Screw it. He kept a tight grip on her arm and raced for the hidden motorcycle. He jumped on the bike, and she climbed on behind him, sliding close and putting those never-ending legs of hers alongside his. When the engine roared to life, they leapt forward, driving fast and hard through the woods. With every minute that passed, Cade realized just how dangerous Allison truly was to him.</p><p>Dangerous...because she could make him care.</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>Something was wrong with her. Very, very wrong.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the drinking blood bit. Oh, hell, she\u2019d actually done that. The blood should have revolted her.</p><p>Instead...</p><p>It had tasted better than any champagne she\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Cade\u2019s blood had been so good, and it had made her hungry.</p><p>For him.</p><p>She ached. Her nipples hurt, wanting his touch so badly, and with every vibration of that motorcycle...</p><p>Cade.</p><p>Allison wanted to scream with the frustrated need building so wildly inside of her. This wasn\u2019t normal. This wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>And her fangs hadn\u2019t gone away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her fangs were out and her fingernails had sharpened up like mini-claws.</p><p>Cade parked the motorcycle in front of what looked like your average no-tell-motel. She followed him quickly to the front desk, wondering about the fierce looks he kept sending her.</p><p>Did he realize that she was barely keeping it together? That she was seriously considering throwing the guy down on the ground and jumping him?</p> <p>What is wrong with me?</p><p>She\u2019d never been like this.</p><p>The balding guy behind the counter didn\u2019t even give them a second glance. So what if she was still wet and her clothes were mostly burned? He just scooped up Cade\u2019s money and tossed them a key. About thirty seconds later, they were entering room number 16, and Allison was trying hard to hold onto her control.</p><p>The door clicked shut behind them.</p><p>Want.</p> <p>The whisper in her mind didn\u2019t even seem to be her own. It felt too strong. Too dark.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>The floor creaked as Cade stalked closer. \u201cIt\u2019s who you\u2019re gonna be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The word was a snarl, but this was wrong. Her claws, her teeth\u2014she could hurt him. If he touched her, Allison\u2019s control would shatter.</p><p>Can\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>But she had to get herself under control. Had to quench the fire that was building\u2014</p> <p>Her eyes flew open. Without glancing at Cade, Allison lunged across the room. She rushed into the miniscule bathroom and yanked on the shower\u2019s cold water. That was what she needed. A good, cold shower and everything would be fine again. She\u2019d cool down. Pretend she was back to normal and everything would be fine.</p><p>Her burnt clothes hit the ground. Naked, she stepped into the shower. The water hit her, hard and stinging and\u2014</p><p>Cade\u2019s hands wrapped around her shoulders. He turned her around as that pounding water slid over her flesh.</p><p>He\u2019d shed his clothes and he stood before her, naked. He stepped into the shower.</p><p>Fighting herself, she backed up. Allison could feel her control splintering and she knew, right then, she knew that she was becoming someone else.</p><p>Something else.</p><p>In an instant, she grabbed Cade and pushed him back against the rough tiled wall. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She barely managed to speak. \u201cI can hurt you.\u201d Her words were close to an animal\u2019s growl.</p><p>But her werewolf laughed. \u201cAh, sweetheart, trust me on this...I can handle you.\u201d</p> <p>He broke her hold. Took her mouth in a kiss that made her sex clench and her knees tremble and suddenly she was the one with her back pressed against that tile.</p><p>He\u2019d reversed their positions so fast she barely had time to blink. Her back was against the tile. He\u2019d lifted her up effortlessly, and he held her in his rock-hard embrace.</p><p>His mouth was on her throat. Licking her, sucking her flesh.</p><p>His cock pushed at the entrance of her body.</p><p>In.</p><p>His teeth scored her flesh and she shuddered in hungry arousal. \u201cCade!\u201d</p><p>The water pounded down on them. He drove into her. She gasped as he filled her, stretching her body, only to withdraw seconds later and thrust in deeper, harder than before.</p><p>Again and again.</p><p>Her legs wrapped around his hips. Her hands slid over his slick flesh. The water didn\u2019t seem so cold anymore. Not when he was burning hot against her.</p><p>Allison\u2019s teeth began to burn, stretching and sharpening in her mouth. She wanted to bite him. To taste that delicious blood once more.</p><p>She clamped her lips together and arched her hips against him.</p><p>No, no she could be just a woman. She could\u2014</p><p>He pulled back a bit, kept her pinned. Then took her breast in his mouth. Her nipples were so sensitive that the rough lick of his tongue had her moaning.</p><p>Her nails raked over his skin. He growled, and she caught the scent of blood.</p><p>Her eyes widened in horror when Allison realized that she\u2019d scratched open his skin.</p><p>Cade\u2019s head lifted. His thrusts stilled as his cock filled her. Her sex clamped around him, sensitive, eager for the pleasure that would come. His gaze held hers, and she wondered if he\u2019d pull away.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he told her, voice deep, dark, and rumbling, \u201cbite me.\u201d A dare.</p><p>Then he withdrew...drove deep.</p><p>She bit him. On his neck this time. Hesitant at first because she didn\u2019t really know what the hell she was doing, but her sharpened canines figured it out fast. They sank right through flesh and his blood slid onto her tongue.</p><p>She came at that first taste, her body shuddering with the blasts of pleasure that had her holding him as tightly as she could.</p><p>But Cade wasn\u2019t done with her. Not yet. He kept thrusting. Stronger, wilder, and the feel of his cock sliding in and out of her sex had pleasure sweeping through her again.</p><p>Allison licked gently over the small wound she\u2019d made on his neck. Shame lurked inside of her, but she wouldn\u2019t feel it, not then. Then she only wanted the pleasure and him.</p><p>Her gaze met Cade\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s lips parted. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>He carried her out of the shower. Not withdrawing from her, but filling her as he strode back to the bed. They fell on the mattress, both soaking wet, and rolled in a tangle of limbs. Cade rose above her, and there was no mistaking the hungry lust burning in his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who likes to bite.\u201d</p><p>Her own eyes widened even as she reached for him.</p><p>His mouth closed over her flesh, right there, where the curve of her shoulder met her neck. She didn\u2019t know what she expected but\u2014</p><p>His teeth pressed into her flesh, and the Allison that she was becoming\u2014the woman who tasted blood and climaxed\u2014her breath whispered out in anticipation.</p><p>Cade bit her. Not to drink, not like she\u2019d done before with him. This seemed...different. More of a marking.</p><p>Claiming?</p><p>Then she stopped worrying about bites and differences and just enjoyed the feel of his cock within her.</p><p>This time, when she came, he was right with her. Growling out his pleasure and holding her even tighter than she\u2019d held him.</p><p>In that one moment, she didn\u2019t care about what she was becoming.</p><p>She didn\u2019t really give a damn about anything else but him.</p><p>Elsa stared into her dark mirror. It wasn\u2019t showing her anything now. No past. No present. Nothing.</p><p>Her hand slammed into the glass surface. It cracked beneath her palm, tiny, spider-wed like cracks that rippled across the surface.</p><p>Allison wasn\u2019t dead. Because of that asshole wolf. He\u2019d given her shelter. He\u2019d protect her. Gotten her ass out of the fire.</p><p>He should have been the one to kill Allison. Not to keep her alive. What use was an assassin if he couldn\u2019t fucking kill anyone?</p><p>She lifted her hand, not caring about the drops of blood that flew from the scratches on her palm. All the supernaturals in the area knew just what Cade Thain was. They knew how much he hated vampires.</p><p>But, now, unless she missed her guess, he was fucking one. Why else would he keep Allison alive?</p><p>Why else?</p><p>A loud crash sounded behind her. Elsa didn\u2019t move. She just kept staring into her broken mirror. Footsteps pounded up the staircase</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>So the vampire had finally found her home. He must be mighty pissed if he\u2019d come out hunting in the daytime. He could have waited. Dusk was only an hour away.</p><p>Elsa didn\u2019t answer him. She didn\u2019t want to look away from her mirror. She didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>A snarl hung in the air, and, in the next moment, she hung in the air, held up by the vampire\u2019s grip on her throat. The big, blond vampire shook her like she was a rag doll and if he hadn\u2019t been choking her, Elsa would have laughed right in his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Elsa knew this vampire. Charles Crawford. A vamp who\u2019d been walking the earth for over two hundred years.</p><p>A vamp who\u2019d been tracking Allison for weeks.</p><p>He knew what she was. Vampires could always sense when a pureblood turning was at hand. And Allison had been right there in the city with the guy just nights before. No wonder he\u2019d almost caught her in that alley.</p><p>Would have caught her, if Cade hadn\u2019t plunged his claws into Crawford\u2019s throat. Yes, her mirror had shown her that truth, too late. It hadn\u2019t been Allison\u2019s blood dripping from that alley\u2019s walls the first night. Cade had attacked Crawford.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>Crawford\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>His hold eased, just enough for her to speak. \u201cN-not me.\u201d Her smile widened even more. \u201cWerewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard? He still has her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna...kill her.\u201d And the perfect plan hit her. \u201cUnless...\u201d Her breath heaved out as she studied the vamp. Maybe he could get the job done for her.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be fitting?</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d he snapped. Poor vampire. With the werewolf hiding Allison in the woods, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to catch her scent anymore.</p><p>And he\u2019d be wanting to find the lost pureblood very badly. Purebloods were the favored in the vamp clans.</p><p>Elsa tried to appear careless as she said, \u201cHe\u2019ll kill her...Unless you can kill him first.\u201d</p><p>Now that bit had Crawford stepping back. \u201cTell me where the wolf is, and he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Elsa rubbed her throat and glanced back at her broken mirror. She saw nothing, because there was nothing left to see.</p><p>The end was coming.</p><p>It won\u2019t be my end. It won\u2019t. Crawford could take out the werewolf, and she would find a way to kill the pureblood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she told the vampire. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to wait long.\u201d Not long at all. \u201cWhen night falls, he\u2019ll come here. To you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need her mirror to know that. Cade wouldn\u2019t wait for her to attack again. She\u2019d studied him. Learned his habits before she approached her would-be killer. No, he wouldn\u2019t sit back and wait for another attack. He\u2019d come after her.</p><p>And find a vampire waiting to kill him.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Vampires tore into her flesh. They cut her with gleaming silver blades, and they licked her blood from the edges of their knives. They laughed when she screamed.</p><p>And they tortured her even more.</p><p>They chained her and poured liquid silver onto her back, just so they could hear her screams.</p><p>And Allison did scream. Over and over as her flesh burned away.</p><p>She looked up, staring straight at the bastards who loved her pain, and something broke inside of her. Broke, even as the chains holding her arms broke free, and she lunged forward with a strength born of fury.One swipe, and she cut the head off the nearest vampire. She drove her claws into the throat of another. And as they fell, this time, she was the one who laughed.</p><p>\u201cAllison!\u201d Hard hands grabbed her, shook her.</p><p>Her eyes flew open, and Allison found herself out of that dank pit. The peeling walls of the hotel room surrounded her. She was on the bed. With Cade.</p><p>The man seemed to always be saving her from nightmares. But then, it wasn\u2019t like she was the sweet dream type.</p><p>Always nightmares.</p><p>Sweat covered her, and she could still smell the scent of her own burning flesh.</p><p>Only, it hadn\u2019t been her flesh that burned. Not really. Her trembling fingers lifted and touched the rough scars that marked Cade\u2019s face.</p><p>His pupils widened when she touched him. His hold on her gentled, but he didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>Why not? Her hand fell away. How could he stand to have her near him? Those other vampires had tortured him for hours, days, and they\u2019d drank his blood.</p><p>Just like she had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her stark whisper.</p><p>Cade frowned down at her but there wasn\u2019t surprise on his face. Just a kind of angry understanding. \u201cThe blood,\u201d he said. \u201cFuck, how did I forget that? Vamps don\u2019t just take blood, they take memories, too.\u201d</p><p>Allison flinched. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d What? What was she supposed to say? That she hadn\u2019t meant to steal his memories? That she hadn\u2019t meant to drink his blood?</p><p>She had meant to do it.</p><p>Allison realized she was still naked. It hadn\u2019t mattered before, not when she\u2019d wanted the press of his flesh against her more than she\u2019d wanted anything else. But at that moment, she felt...lost.</p><p>She pulled free of him and yanked the sheet up to cover her breasts. Taking a breath, she asked the question that she feared, \u201cAm I even human any longer?\u201d She didn\u2019t feel weak. In fact, her body seemed incredibly strong right then. No blisters, no wounds. Only healed flesh.</p><p>Her heart was still beating. She still breathed. But she\u2019d taken blood. Grown fangs. Her own version of claws.</p><p>\u201cYou were never human.\u201d</p><p>His words hurt as much as a slap would have.</p><p>Allison jumped from the bed, dragging the sheet with her.</p><p>\u201cYou were born a vampire, it just took a little while for the DNA to kick-in.\u201d His voice followed her, cold, no emotion. There\u2019d been plenty of heat in the daytime hours. But with night, all of that seemed to have vanished. \u201cIt usually takes about twenty-five years of life, maybe a few years more, before the vamp side takes over for a pureblood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She needed to learn all that she could. No more denying. No more hiding.</p><p>Deal with this.</p><p>\u201cBecause the vamp genes freeze the body at its peak. They keep you strong and young, forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever...\u201d Or as long as she kept drinking blood. As long as she didn\u2019t lose her head or get staked.</p><p>Or die in a fire set by a sadistic witch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep breathing,\u201d he told her, and she glanced back to see him pulling up his jeans. Sexy. \u201cYour heart won\u2019t stop. That only happens to the turned humans, and only for a little while. You were born this way...you\u2019ll stay this way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt something wet on her cheek. Allison swiped the back of her hand over her face, and when she looked down, blood stained her fingers.</p><p>Humans didn\u2019t cry tears of blood.</p><p>\u201cWh-what about you?\u201d She hated to ask, but she had bitten him, and he\u2019d bitten her. What if she\u2019d...changed him?</p> <p>What if he turned into the one thing he hated more than anything else?</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you become...like me? Because I swear, I never meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, and some of the tension eased from his face. \u201cI won\u2019t turn into a vampire, no matter how many times I\u2019m bitten.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders sagged.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way for my kind. We can\u2019t change but...\u201d Now he rubbed his chin. \u201cI have heard a story about another werewolf down in Florida...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat story?\u201d</p><p>He buttoned and zipped up his jeans. \u201cSeemed he married a pureblood vampire and by drinking her blood, the guy made himself even stronger.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat kicked up. Last night, she\u2019d been only thinking about him and pleasure. But just what had Cade been planning? \u201cIs that why you bit me?\u201d Anger began to simmer in her gut.</p><p>Where the hell were her clothes?</p><p>Oh, yeah, right. Pretty much burned to bits. So she\u2019d keep having this awkward conversation wrapped in a sheet.</p> <p>He stalked toward her. Didn\u2019t touch her. Just came close enough that she could feel the hot warmth of his flesh. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to get a power boost last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Crap. She sounded way too hopeful. She could play this semi-cool. \u201cThen what were you doing?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cClaiming you.\u201d</p><p>Um...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking care of this witch,\u201d he told her, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make sure that she never comes after you again, and then...\u201d His hand lifted. Brushed over her cheek. \u201cThen you and I\u2014we\u2019re gonna work this thing out between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis thing?\u201d The guy didn\u2019t exactly have a golden way with words.</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her lips. An open-mouthed-I-want-more kiss. \u201cYou want me. I\u2019m fucking burning alive with need for you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, better. Her lips curled. A girl liked to hear some occasional sweet\u2014or hot\u2014things from the guy who\u2019d fought his way past her defenses.</p> <p>And into her heart?</p><p>Don\u2019t go there. Not now. Focus.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s take her out,\u201d Allison said and this time, she was the one to kiss him. Her kiss lasted longer. \u201cBecause I\u2019m tired of looking over my shoulder.\u201d She wanted to look ahead, instead.</p><p>To a future? A few days ago, Allison would never have thought that possible. But now...</p><p>What if she could have a future, with Cade?</p><p>That was sure as hell something worth fighting for.</p><p>But first...Allison caught the hand that he\u2019d put to her cheek. She entwined her fingers with his. Stared deeply into his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t ever let another vampire hurt you.\u201d She needed to say this. To make him understand.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t like the others. No matter what happened, she wouldn\u2019t become like them.</p><p>And they\u2019d damn well never attack him with silver again on her watch.</p><p>\u201cSo tough.\u201d His smile had her heart jumping in her chest. \u201cI think I\u2019m rubbing off on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you are.\u201d Or maybe the vamp in her was just developing her own killer instincts.</p><p>Kill to protect what was hers? Yes, she would. Because she was definitely starting to think of Cade as hers.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find me some clothes,\u201d Allison said. There had to be some kind of store around there somewhere, right? \u201cThen we\u2019ll hunt the bitch.\u201d And part of her nightmare would end.</p><p>Then she could deal with what was becoming, had become.</p><p>A monster who wasn\u2019t afraid to kill.</p><p>Tracking the witch wasn\u2019t hard. Once they made it back to town, Cade made short work of finding Elsa\u2019s scent trail. Actually, finding her scent was a little too easy. Elsa should have covered her tracks better.</p><p>He stared up at the old Victorian house near the edge of town. Lights glowed through the windows, firing out through the stained glass on the second floor.</p><p>He\u2019d followed the scent of ash and power all the way back to this place. Elsa waited inside. But the witch wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>The scent of blood was far too strong.</p><p>Vampires.</p><p>His wolf pushed to break free.</p><p>Allison\u2019s hand pressed against his shoulder. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look away from the house. He\u2019d wanted Allison with him because he\u2019d been afraid Elsa would trick them and attack again. Leaving Allison behind to be a sitting duck hadn\u2019t been his fucking plan.</p><p>But leading her straight into a nest of vampires wasn\u2019t an option, either.</p><p>He inhaled, catching all the scents and said, \u201cThere are four vamps in there with her.\u201d The scent of those vamps was so strong that it nearly overpowered everything else.</p><p>He caught the ragged sigh of her breath.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart, they won\u2019t be a problem for long.\u201d Not once he ripped their heads right off their bodies.</p><p>Her nails dug through his shirt and into his flesh. \u201cYou can\u2019t take them all on.\u201d</p><p>The wolf was clawing to the surface now, determined to be free. \u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let go. Her hold just tightened more. \u201cI don\u2019t want you dying for me!\u201d</p><p>He could think of worse things to die for but... \u201cI won\u2019t be dying tonight.\u201d No matter what Elsa had planned, \u201cAnd neither will you.\u201d Then, because he had to taste her, just once more, Cade pulled her close. His lips took hers in a hot, deep kiss, and he knew he\u2019d carry her taste with him when he faced the enemies who waited.</p><p>The only good vamp is a staked vamp.</p><p>Not his motto anymore. But those bastards who\u2019d sided with Elsa? They were begging for death.</p><p>He pushed Allison back. The change took him then, hard, brutal, as bones broke and reshaped. He fell to the ground, body contorting, and fur burst along his flesh.</p><p>At fourteen, his first change had been a burning agony. Now, he hardly felt the pain at all.</p><p>In moments, a wolf stalked the ground, heading toward the house. Allison stayed behind him, following close. He could go in quiet, try to surprise the vamps or\u2014</p><p>Or he could just tear them apart.</p><p>Cade leapt for the door. His powerful claws slammed into the wood and sent the door crashing inward. Before it had even slammed to the floor, Cade jumped away and swiped out at the vamps who rushed toward him.</p><p>One slash across the chest to the dark-haired jerk who attacked with fangs barred. Even as the guy screamed and stumbled back, Cade drove his claws into the chest of the vampire on the right. The red-head\u2019s eyes widened as the claws jerked inside of him, and the scent of the vampire\u2019s fear filled Cade\u2019s nose.</p><p>Kill. Destroy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt the girl!\u201d The vampire\u2019s bellow seemed to shake the whole house. Cade dropped his prey and saw that a big, blond vampire was rushing down the stairs, with another vamp right on his tail.</p><p>Their fangs were out, bloodlust glowing in their eyes but\u2014</p><p>A gunshot thundered and a bullet thudded into his flesh. From the red-hot burn, Cade knew he\u2019d taken a silver hit. His head jerked toward the top of the stairs. Elsa smiled at him even as she lifted her weapon once more.</p><p>Now he knew where Griggs had picked up his silver bullet ammo. Figured.</p><p>Allison screamed even as Cade\u2019s wolf form tore up the stairs. He slashed out and knocked the vampires out of his way. But those vamps, they weren\u2019t going down easy. The blond shoved a knife into Cade\u2019s back.</p><p>More fucking silver.</p><p>His body burned.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Allison\u2019s shout. \u201cGet away from him!\u201d</p><p>He felt the vampire jump in surprise. That shift of focus, that second\u2019s hesitation was all that Cade needed. His head twisted, and he sank his fangs into the vampire\u2019s neck.</p><p>Another bullet thudded into him. Elsa\u2019s laughter grated in his ears.</p><p>Won\u2019t stop. Kill.</p><p>Then Allison was there. She punched at the vampires. Swiped with her own claws. \u201cLet him go!\u201d</p><p>The vampires didn\u2019t fight her. They fell back\u2014one actually fell off the stairs, and Cade raced toward the witch. She was still smiling, still holding up her gun\u2014</p><p>\u201cCade, no!\u201d Allison\u2019s steps pounded after him.</p><p>The witch\u2019s finger tightened around the trigger.</p><p>His hind legs shoved down, then pushed him high into the air as he launched toward her. The bullet fired, scraped right by his left-ear, and he slammed into the witch.</p><p>His claws sank into her flesh.</p><p>She didn\u2019t scream. Just kept laughing.</p><p>\u201cCade, watch out!\u201d Allison\u2019s yell.</p><p>But the warning came too late. He\u2019d been too focused on the witch. On the vampires. Their scents had been so strong that he hadn\u2019t noticed\u2014</p><p>A knife plunged into his back. The pain had a howl of fury and agony breaking from him. He rolled, swiping with his claws, and Griggs\u2014fucking bastard Griggs\u2014fell to the ground, dead.</p><p>But Cade fell, too. He couldn\u2019t get up. His legs had gone numb, and the shift swept over him again in an uncontrolled rush.</p><p>Too much silver. Too much blood.</p><p>He tried to find Allison. Saw her being held by the blond vampire. She was struggling in his arms and red tears leaked down her cheeks.</p><p>She thinks I\u2019m dying.</p><p>Maybe he was.</p><p>He still couldn\u2019t get up.</p><p>Griggs would never get up.</p><p>\u201cGreedy bastard...for the right money, Griggs would always do anything.\u201d Elsa, dripping blood, eased down beside Cade. She had a mirror cradled in her hands, a cracked, blackened mirror. \u201cI knew he\u2019d come back...he just wanted you to be weak enough first. Likes to attack when...his prey is weak.\u201d</p><p>Too bad for the bastard...Griggs hadn\u2019t waited long enough. Cade had made sure that prick went to hell first.</p><p>\u201cGet away from him!\u201d Allison yelled.</p><p>Elsa didn\u2019t look her way. She leaned closer to Cade. He still couldn\u2019t move. That fucking knife lodged right in the middle of his back. Griggs had driven it in deep, all the way to the bone, and when Cade had spun to kill the human\u2014</p><p>I just drove it in deeper. When his back had hit the floor, the hilt had broken off, and the silver blade was lodged deep within him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think would happen?\u201d Elsa whispered as she clutched her mirror. \u201cThat you\u2019d save her? That you\u2019d get to keep her?\u201d</p><p>Forever. He\u2019d wanted a chance, a shot at\u2014</p><p>\u201cShe would\u2019ve stayed young for centuries, and you would have wasted away.\u201d She held up the mirror to him. \u201cSee what would have been\u2014see it!\u201d</p><p>Cade stared into the mirror. He saw the future that had waited for him and bellowed in maddened fury.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>That bitch wasn\u2019t killing Cade. Allison jerked, twisted like a snake, and drove her claws\u2014not nearly as fierce as Cade\u2019s\u2014into the blond vampire\u2019s stomach.</p><p>He barely grunted. His eyes, too blue and bright, glittered down at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Screw that. Like she believed a word he said.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she pulled back her fist and slammed it right into his chest.</p><p>She heard something break. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t her hand.</p><p>The vamp\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cPureblood,\u201d he whispered as he fell back a step.</p><p>That step was all she needed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t killing Cade!\u201d She\u2019d promised that vampires wouldn\u2019t hurt him again, and now he was up there, not moving.</p><p>Dying?</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cCade!\u201d She spun away and jumped up half the stairs.</p><p>But the blond vampire moved faster than her. He blocked her path in an instant. \u201cI\u2019m like you. Born to the blood, I can help you...show you...\u201d</p><p>The witch was next to Cade. Her werewolf was shouting, but his body wasn\u2019t moving. Dammit. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to show me anything! I don\u2019t want anything\u2014just Cade!\u201d</p><p>Surprise slackened the vampire\u2019s face. \u201cHe was...hurting you...holding you captive...\u201d</p><p>She slammed her body into his. The vampire crashed into the wooden railing. \u201cHe was keeping me safe.\u201d The wood began to splinter. \u201cFrom all the murdering vamps who wanted me dead.\u201d</p><p>The wood gave way.</p><p>The vampire didn\u2019t try to fight the fall. He just plummeted to the hard floor below.</p><p>Allison grabbed a chunk of broken wood from the stairs. She rushed up toward Cade and the witch. \u201cGet your ass away from him!\u201d</p><p>Elsa turned around, her eyes were wide, and, oh, yeah, Allison saw the fear flash in her gaze. \u201cYou want to take me out so badly?\u201d Allison snarled. \u201cThen here\u2019s your chance!\u201d</p><p>But Elsa backed away. She dropped a mirror, and the heavy chunks of glass shattered at her feet.</p><p>\u201cBetter save him...\u201d Elsa told her as she edged back. \u201cWith that silver lodged in his spine, he could be dead in seconds.\u201d</p><p>Allison froze, the wood gripped tightly in her hand.</p><p>Elsa was still backing away. Going for another weapon? Preparing for another spell attack?</p><p>\u201cUnless he doesn\u2019t really matter to you...\u201d Elsa threw out, taunting her. \u201cUnless you want to watch him die.\u201d</p><p>Cade was trying to crawl toward the witch. His legs weren\u2019t working\u2014because of the silver in his spine.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t leave her wolf helpless.</p><p>Never.</p><p>Allison rushed to his side. The wood dropped from her hands as she reached for his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought so...\u201d The witch\u2019s nearly purring voice said. \u201cI knew your weakness.\u201d</p><p>A rush of wind filled that second-story room. Allison caught the sharp edge of the silver and ignored the pain when it sliced her flesh. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered to Cade. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re going to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>The wind rushed harder, beating on her like hands, and a wooden stake burst through her chest.</p> <p>Allison didn\u2019t let go of that broken knife. She glanced down and saw the bloody edges of the wood. The same wood she\u2019d brought up to use as her weapon.</p><p>That rushing wind, it had been Elsa, using one of her spells...she\u2019d moved faster than Allison could see. The witch had come up behind her and\u2014</p><p>\u201cGot your heart, bitch,\u201d Elsa told her.</p><p>Allison yanked out the silver blade. She heard Cade\u2019s fast inhale. He\u2019ll be okay now. \u201cNo...\u201d She managed to tell the witch even as every breath sent pain pulsing through her chest. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The makeshift stake had gone from her back all the way through the front of her chest, but the witch had shitty aim. She\u2019d missed Allison\u2019s heart.</p> <p>Allison rose to her feet, swayed, but managed to stay upright.</p><p>Elsa scrambled back. \u201cNo, no!\u201d</p><p>A stained glass window waited behind her, one designed to show the beauty of a blooming red rose. But with the moonlight spilling through that glass, it appeared as if the witch were surrounded by blood.</p><p>She would be, soon enough.</p><p>Allison stalked slowly toward her. Every move hurt, but she wasn\u2019t giving up. Wasn\u2019t stopping. Her hands, already bloody, caught the edge of that stake. Slowly, inch by inch, she pulled it out. Then she held her weapon gripped tightly in her fist.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Allison asked because she had to know. \u201cWhy did you... come after me?\u201d Her fangs were fully extended, and she wanted to tear Elsa\u2019s throat wide open. I\u2019ve become the monster...and I don\u2019t give a damn. Not then. Then, she wanted the strength that being a vampire gave her. \u201cI never...never would have...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were going to kill me!\u201d Elsa screamed, backing away even more. Her elbows bumped into the big, stained glass window. \u201cI saw it!\u201d</p><p>Allison shook her head. That small move had the room spinning. Blood soaked her clothes.</p><p>\u201cI tried to change it...\u201d Elsa glanced around the room with bright, almost feverish eyes. \u201cI have to change it.\u201d Then she glanced over her shoulder, back through the stained glass, and the witch started to laugh. \u201cThe moon\u2019s not full...it\u2019s not time yet! You can\u2019t kill me!\u201d</p><p>Watch me. Full moon or no full moon, Elsa was dying. Allison wasn\u2019t gonna give the witch another chance to attack.</p><p>Behind her, Allison heard bones snapping and popping. Cade. Shifting. Healing. Her breath eased out slowly. He\u2019ll be all right.</p><p>Elsa wouldn\u2019t be. \u201cI am going to kill you,\u201d Allison told her quietly, hands fisting. \u201cYou won\u2019t get out of this house alive tonight.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t give Elsa a chance to come at her again or to come at Cade.</p><p>\u201cI had to save myself!\u201d Elsa\u2019s face flushed bright red as they faced off. \u201cThe mirror\u2014I saw what you\u2019d do! I saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>Screw the mirror. \u201cYou made this happen. You started it all. But I\u2019ll end it.\u201d Then, using every bit of strength that she had left\u2014which wasn\u2019t a hell of a lot\u2014Allison jumped forward, diving right for Elsa. She shoved the stake at Elsa\u2019s chest. \u201cMy turn.\u201d The stake sank into Elsa\u2019s flesh. Then Allison grabbed the witch, and she shoved her back into that stained glass window as hard as she could.</p> <p>The glass shattered, raining down to the ground, and as Elsa fell, Allison yanked her hands back.</p><p>But the witch didn\u2019t let her go. Elsa\u2019s hands had clamped around her, and Allison was too weak then to break free. She\u2019d used her last bit of strength in the attack and\u2014</p><p>Elsa pulled her through that broken glass. The shards sliced into Allison\u2019s skin. They fell, glass covering them, surrounding them, and the wind whipped past Allison\u2019s body.</p><p>Then they hit the ground.</p><p>When Allison went through that window, Cade leapt after her. He\u2019d just shifted back to human form, and he rushed for the window as quickly as he could, bellowing her name.</p><p>Not fast enough.</p><p>So when the witch pulled her through, Cade followed them right down to the ground below. Their bodies hit the earth with a sickening thud, and he leapt down just behind them, his knees barely buckling when he landed on his feet.</p><p>Glass littered the ground. Blood stained the earth. \u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>She was face-down, half on top of the witch. His heart froze in his chest. He stepped closer. \u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>At his voice, her head rose slightly, and his heart started to race in his chest. He could see the blood on her cheek. The scratches. She pushed up slowly as she stared down at the still form of Elsa.</p><p>The witch hadn\u2019t survived the fall. Maybe it was the stake in her chest that had killed her. Or the twisted angle of her neck. Either way, Elsa wouldn\u2019t be hurting them or anyone else ever again.</p><p>He reached for Allison and lifted her gently into his arms. He noticed that, hell, yes, dammit, his hands were shaking. Fear. \u201cDon\u2019t ever fucking do that to me again.\u201d He\u2019d seen the stake go into her chest. Had thought for one lost, desperate moment that she\u2019d been dying.</p><p>Won\u2019t lose her.</p><p>He pulled her closer. Held her tight. He\u2019d seen what waited in the mirror. What the future held for him and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWerewolf.\u201d</p><p>And the fucking vampires were back. Could no one just leave them the hell alone?</p><p>Snarling, Cade pushed Allison behind him. He\u2019d deal with these jackasses and then get her some place safe. Warm.</p><p>Then he\u2019d make love to her all night long. Until he forgot what it was like to fear that death could steal her from him while he was helpless to do anything but just watch her die.</p><p>One leap forward, and Cade had his claws at the big, blond vampire\u2019s throat. Cade knew the lead asshole when he saw him. \u201cReady to lose that head?\u201d One swipe, just one, and he\u2019d be rid of the bastard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here...\u201d The vampire didn\u2019t seem particularly afraid. Obviously a dumbass. \u201cTo hurt her...or you.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>\u201cElsa said...\u201d The vampire swallowed and Cade sliced his throat, a small, warning slice. More would come. \u201cShe said you were the threat...that you were sent to kill Allison.\u201d</p><p>Plans had fucking changed. Everything had changed for him from that first moment in the alley, when he\u2019d looked into bright blue eyes and realized that he still had part of his soul left.</p><p>A soul and a heart. He should have killed her, but Cade had only come alive when he met her.</p><p>Allison slid her small hand over his shoulder. Cade forced himself to take a breath. The urge to strike was so strong that he trembled but...</p><p>But the vampire wasn\u2019t making any move to attack.</p><p>\u201cYou got your Intel wrong,\u201d Cade snapped. Okay, fuck, he had been hired to kill Allison, but that plan had changed day one. He\u2019d become the man who\u2019d stand between her and any threat that might be out there.</p><p>Kill her? Hell, no. He wouldn\u2019t even so much as bruise her skin. Right then, all he wanted to do was take her away, give her his blood, let her heal\u2014</p><p>Then make love to her until he stopped being afraid that she\u2019d slip away from him.</p><p>Death, you can\u2019t have her. So fuck off.</p><p>\u201cNo one takes her from me,\u201d he said, the words a vow. He hadn\u2019t found her just to lose her. Wouldn\u2019t happen. If he had to behead this vamp to prove it...</p><p>He was ready to slice.</p><p>\u201cI mean her no harm.\u201d Blood dripped down the vampire\u2019s throat. \u201cI thought...that night in the alley, I thought you were the threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t,\u201d Allison said as her fingers pressed against Cade\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Her voice was weak. She needs blood. His blood. But as much as he wanted to turn and scoop her into his arms, he didn\u2019t move. Not yet.</p><p>Cade kept his hold on his prey.</p><p>The only good vamp...</p><p>\u201cI have no quarrel with you, werewolf,\u201d the vampire told him. The guy\u2019s cronies had come outside, but they stood just in front of the house, wisely deciding not to interrupt right then.</p><p>Smart. They might keep their heads.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d the guy went on. \u201cAnd I know what you did to that nest in Oregon who made the mistake of fucking with your pack.\u201d</p><p>The rage built within Cade.</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t killed them,\u201d he added, \u201cthen my team would have. We don\u2019t tolerate rogue groups, and we\u2019re sure as hell don\u2019t make a habit of torturing children.\u201d</p><p>The guy looked sincere.</p><p>But vampires could lie.</p><p>As easily as witches. Werewolves.</p><p>Humans.</p><p>All were good. Bad. None were perfect.</p><p>Allison stroked Cade\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou might know us, but who the hell are you?\u201d She wanted to know.</p><p>Cade risked a glance her way. Bruised, bloody...so beautiful. The dumbass vampire probably thought so, too.</p><p>\u201cCharles Crawford. I\u2019m on the Northwestern Vampire Council.\u201d</p><p>Big deal. Vamps and their councils. He knew all about them. The councils were supposed to keep the vamps in check. Stop them from killing humans.</p><p>Keep \u2018em on a leash.</p><p>From what he\u2019d seen, those fancy councils did jack and shit.</p><p>Crawford glanced at Allison. \u201cI was sent to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you arrived a bit late to the party, buddy,\u201d Cade drawled. \u201cVery late.\u201d</p><p>Crawford\u2019s jaw clenched. After a moment he said, \u201cI vow that I won\u2019t hurt her,\u201d the vampire said, \u201cor you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d like to see the fool try.</p><p>\u201cTruce?\u201d The vampire asked.</p><p>Oh, that grated and\u2014</p><p>Allison swayed beside him. Cade lunged for her and caught Allison just before she would have fallen. Her skin was ice cold.</p><p>Her eyes were closing.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart, don\u2019t you even think of leaving me.\u201d He held her gently, like the fucking precious thing that she was. He cradled her head and pushed her toward his throat. \u201cDrink, Allison.\u201d Take everything you need.</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t letting her go.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>A gasp came from a few of the assembled vamps when Cade offered his neck to her. Yeah, he got it\u2014werewolves didn\u2019t usually offer themselves up as food to a vamp. He sure as hell wouldn\u2019t to anyone but her.</p><p>He felt the press of her small fangs against his skin, a quick slice that was too fast for pain, then a surge of pleasure hit him as she began to gently suck on his neck.</p><p>He held her tighter and lifted her easily in his arms. As she drank from him, he faced the vampires.</p><p>Crawford watched him with blood still dripping down his own neck. Mild curiosity lit the vampire\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo...it\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d And he was hers. Forever.</p><p>Crawford inclined his head. \u201cDo you know...\u201d He seemed to hesitated, but then he asked bluntly, \u201cHave you taken her blood?\u201d</p><p>Same old song and dance. \u201cWe both know werewolves can\u2019t become vampires, so don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not about to turn.\u201d He tensed when Allison\u2019s tongue licked over his skin. What he wouldn\u2019t give to be alone with her then.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t turn...\u201d Now Crawford\u2019s eyes had narrowed. Filled with speculation. \u201cYou\u2019ll just become...more.\u201d</p><p>He already knew that. He\u2019d seen his future in the mirror.</p><p>Allison\u2019s tongue swiped over his neck once more. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou can put me down now.\u201d</p><p>He rather liked her where she was.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another vampire and werewolf pairing, down South.\u201d Crawford motioned to his men, and the others began to walk away, back into the darkness that surrounded the old home. \u201cHe\u2019s become more, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d Allison asked, voice stronger.</p><p>\u201cYour blood will make him stronger,\u201d Crawford told her. \u201cAs long as he has you, he\u2019ll always be stronger, faster...\u201d</p><p>Immortal.</p><p>Cade had seen all of this in the mirror. Elsa had thought that he\u2019d see his death. That he\u2019d see his body withering away over time while Allison stayed young forever.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen that. He\u2019d seen them. Laughing. Loving.</p><p>His life didn\u2019t have to be a walking nightmare. With her, it could be more.</p><p>With her, he was already more.</p><p>But even if his power had faded, even if they\u2019d only been offered a few years, he would have taken those years.</p><p>Taken them and counted himself damn lucky.</p><p>\u201cMaybe our kind can help each other...\u201d Crawford murmured with a slight nod of his head. \u201cMaybe.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cI\u2019ll send a team to...clean up this area.\u201d</p><p>Nice code for body clean-up.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you two should ever need me, I\u2019ll be close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too close,\u201d Cade warned him, the power of the wolf rolling in his voice. \u201cI\u2019d hate to behead you...on accident.\u201d</p><p>The vampire nodded at the warning, but his eyes were on Allison when he said, \u201cDespite what you may think, we\u2019re not all evil. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>Cade\u2019s back teeth clenched.</p><p>Crawford laughed. \u201cI said help, wolf, not screw. I\u2019m really not that eager to feel your claws at my throat again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cade lowered his head close to Allison\u2019s cheek. The scent of roses filled his nostrils and soothed the beast within.</p><p>Before her, he would never have stood there, talking to the male vampire. Slashing and fighting? Hell, yes.</p><p>But now...</p><p>Crawford backed away.</p> <p>Perhaps there could be more between vampires and werewolves. Maybe it didn\u2019t have to just be about centuries of fury and rage and pain.</p><p>Allison looked up at him.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, it could be about something so much better.</p><p>Allison gazed into Cade\u2019s eyes as he thrust deep into her. A moan slipped from her even as her hands flattened on his chest.</p><p>She was above him, both her knees digging into the mattress on either side of his body.</p> <p>She\u2019d healed. They\u2019d survived.</p><p>No more running. No more fear.</p><p>Just...</p><p>His cock slid along her sensitive flesh.</p><p>Pleasure.</p><p>His hands were on her hips. Holding her tight. Lifting her up, down, and she moved with him. Not too fast. Not too hard.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t like the times before. The wild fury was gone.</p><p>Oh, the lust was still there, burning as hot as before but...</p><p>Allison leaned forward and kissed him. Her lips, open, eager, feathered over his. Her tongue pushed into his mouth.</p><p>He growled, and she knew that he liked her taste, but he didn\u2019t thrust harder. Just kept up that perfect driving pace. Smooth, slow, so deep.</p><p>When the climax hit her, the release sent a wave of pleasure rolling through her whole body. Cade came with her, surging deep into her core.</p><p>And he held her close.</p><p>Just as she held him.</p><p>Her head lowered to his chest. Her ear pressed against him, and his heart raced so quickly, almost shaking her with its strength.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His heartbeat jumped. Then he stiffened. \u201cWhat?\u201d His hands caught her shoulders, and he lifted her up. \u201cYou\u2019re...going with the vampires? Allison, you don\u2019t have to, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. The flash of pure panic in his eyes made her feel braver. \u201cI meant that we didn\u2019t have to worry about Elsa anymore.\u201d Though the witch\u2019s final moments would haunt her dreams\u2014nightmares\u2014for months to come. Dammit, Elsa should never have looked into that mirror. There were some things that folks weren\u2019t meant to know.</p><p>If Elsa had never glanced in that mirror, would the witch have ever come after her? Would their paths have ever even crossed?</p><p>Or, just by looking into that dark glass, had Elsa started the whole chain of events that had led to her own death?</p><p>Don\u2019t think about her. Not now.</p><p>Allison\u2019s fingers trailed over Cade\u2019s muscled chest. He was still inside her, growing bigger and stronger by the moment, and this\u2014he\u2014was what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI know...things won\u2019t be easy.\u201d She\u2019d managed to take his blood without a problem, but the thought of drinking from anyone else had her shuddering. Adjusting to vamp life wouldn\u2019t be a quick, over-night process.</p><p>No more real food? No chocolate? No drinks?</p><p>Only blood.</p><p>Her breath sighed out. \u201cMaybe being with me, the way I am now,\u201d not human, not anymore, \u201cthat might not be what you want.\u201d No kids. No white picket fence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exactly what I want.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that sounded so good. Her lips started to curl. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the only man I want.\u201d Through blood and death, darkness and fire\u2014just him.</p><p>His hand lifted and threaded through her dark hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it as slow as you want. We\u2019ve got nothing but time.\u201d</p><p>Not death.</p><p>She nodded and for the first time in weeks, her heart felt lighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe and give your nights filled with pleasure,\u201d he told her, his eyes beginning to show the light of the wolf. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll stay by your side as long as you want me.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019d stay with her forever because she\u2019d always want her wolf.</p><p>Want him. Need him. Love him?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>But could he love a vampire? She was afraid to ask. Allison didn\u2019t want\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhen I look at you,\u201d Cade told her, \u201cI see every fucking dream I\u2019ve ever had. You make me want to be better, for you.\u201d</p><p>She lost her breath.</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m far from perfect, we both know that. And you could damn well do better\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was no one better. Stronger.</p><p>\u201cBut let me show you that I can love you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart broke a little then.</p><p>\u201cI can be the man you need.\u201d</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cYou already are.\u201d Maybe he wasn\u2019t perfect. She didn\u2019t want perfect. She wasn\u2019t perfect. Far from it.</p><p>Perfect was boring.</p><p>Instead of some pristine prince charming, she\u2019d much rather have her big, bad wolf.</p><p>They\u2019d make their own happy ending, one that would last forever.</p><p>Forever with blood, monsters, and more than a bit of hot sex.</p><p>What vampire could ask for more?</p><p>Allison smiled and bent to kiss her wolf again.</p><p>Forever. </p> </body></html>"]
