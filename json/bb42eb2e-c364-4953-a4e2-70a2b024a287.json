And, more than once, I\u2019d stopped here at the curbside, sharing a lingering kiss, reluctant to let what we\u2019d experienced the night before come to an end.</p> <p>I\u2019d been so in love. Stupidly, foolishly in love. And it had all been a lie. Not on my part, but his.</p><p>Jak Talbott\u2014the werewolf I thought I\u2019d spend the rest of my life with\u2014had wanted nothing more than a good story. And he\u2019d got that, mixing lies with reality so deftly it was hard to pick them apart. Mom had sued both him and the paper over the story, but in the end had settled out of court rather than have her name\u2014and possibly mine\u2014dragged endlessly through the gossip mags while the court case was ongoing. But mud tends to stick, even if it isn\u2019t true, and she lost several lucrative TV spots because of it. Not that that had particularly worried her. She\u2019d been more concerned about the effect of Jak\u2019s actions on me.</p><p>And my reaction had been fairly intense. Even now, two years later, I avoided anything resembling a deep or lasting relationship, preferring the fun but emotionally sterile liaison with my Aedh lover, Lucian.</p><p>Meeting Jak Talbott again was the last thing I ever wanted to do.</p><p>I crossed my arms and rubbed them lightly. The midday sun held plenty of warmth, but it didn\u2019t chase the chill away from my flesh.</p> <p>We do what we have to do\u2014we track these people down by whatever means necessary.</p><p>Fine words, but did I have the courage to actually follow them through? After standing here in front of this building for the last five minutes, I wasn\u2019t so sure that I did.</p><p>I glanced at my watch and saw it was a few minutes past twelve. If I was going to run, I\u2019d better do it now...</p><p>Awareness tingled across my senses and I looked up the steps to the building\u2019s entrance\u2014straight into the intense black gaze of Jak Talbott.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this, I thought, as all the old pain and hurt rose, threatening to drown me all over again. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>But even as that thought crossed my mind, the inherently stubborn part of my nature rose, as well. I straightened my spine. Clenched my fists. I could do this. I needed to do this. Not only for the sake of my heart and any future relationships I might have, but also because saving the world from the hordes of hell might well depend on what happened here with Jak.</p> <p>I watched him walk toward me, his strides long and lithe, graceful in an almost feline sort of way. He wasn\u2019t a classically handsome man, but his rough-hewn features were easy on the eyes and his body was well toned without being too muscular. His hair, like his skin, was a rich black, although these days there seemed to be a fair amount of silver glinting through the shaggy thickness of it.</p><p>He stopped several feet in front of me, his gaze briefly skimming me before resting on the fists clenched at my sides.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not going to aim those at me, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already had one good story out of my family,\u201d I said, amazed that my voice actually sounded civil. \u201cI\u2019m not about to give you another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The black depths of his eyes were wary, watchful. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee.\u201d Although, in all honesty, several large bottles of alcohol\u2014the stronger, the better\u2014would probably have been more suitable right then. I might have the constitution of a werewolf, which meant it was damnably hard for me to get drunk, but several bottles would at least soften the haunting sense of loss.</p><p>Jak raised an eyebrow, but waved a hand toward the small caf\u00e9 not far up the road. \u201cThey make fairly good coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>I strode forward, the heels of my sandals clicking on the concrete, a tattoo of sound as fast as my heart. He walked beside me, his familiar woodsmoke scent washing over me, raising memories of lazy evenings spent in front of the old log fire in his house, our bodies entwined...</p><p>Damn it, he used you, I reminded myself fiercely. Remember that, and only that.</p><p>The automatic fly-screen door swished open as we neared the caf\u00e9. Inside was shadowed, the air a mix of rich coffee, fried food, and sweaty humanity. The air-conditioning obviously wasn\u2019t doing a great job at this end of the room.</p><p>I wove through the tables, heading for one near the back, close to the overhead vent. The rush of cold air had goose bumps racing across my bare arms, but at least it was free of the more unpleasant smells in the space.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jak said, pulling out a chair and sitting down opposite me, \u201cwhat is this all about?\u201d</p><p>Instead of immediately answering, I asked, \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d</p><p>His smile held a wry edge. \u201cForgotten already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a few years, Jak. People and tastes change.\u201d And I wish my tastes had changed. Wished I could honestly say I no longer found him so damnably attractive.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t changed. Not when it comes to coffee, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Meaning he\u2019d changed in other ways? Somehow I doubted it. I punched in an order of coffee and cake for us both and swiped my credit card through the slot to pay for it. Then I faced him again. \u201cI want a favor.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. \u201cI would have thought I\u2019d be the last person on earth you\u2019d ask a favor of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d I snapped, then mentally clawed back the escaping anger. \u201cBut you\u2019re the only reporter I know, and you happen to specialize in paranormal and occult news and investigations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He studied me for several moments, his gaze still wary. As if he\u2019d been the injured party in the whole sordid mess. \u201cAnd what do I get in return for granting this favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA story that could blow anything else you\u2019ve written out of the water.\u201d</p><p>Excitement flared briefly in his dark eyes before he managed to control it. But I\u2019d expected nothing less. For a man like Jak, the story was all.</p><p>\u201cDoes this favor involve doing anything illegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d I paused, but couldn\u2019t help adding, \u201cAlthough we both know that wouldn\u2019t exactly faze you.\u201d</p><p>Amusement teased his lips and an ache stuttered through my heart. Not over him. Not by a long shot. Or rather, not over the memory of what we\u2019d once shared. Even the hurt of his deception couldn\u2019t erase all that had once been good. And that sucked.</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know the childhood your mother presented to the world was a lie,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI had sworn statements that proved it, and your mother never did refute them.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a somewhat bitter smile. \u201cThe people who mattered knew the truth about my mother\u2019s past. No one else needed to. Not then, not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the public she was defrauding?\u201d</p><p>A waitress approached with our coffees and cakes. I gave her a smile of thanks and waited until she left before saying, \u201cMy mother\u2019s psychic powers were real, and they helped a lot of people. Shame you didn\u2019t do a story about that rather than besmirching her name.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his coffee. \u201cI don\u2019t do good-news stories. I prefer the dark and dirty underbelly of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly why I\u2019m here.\u201d I wrapped my hands around my coffee and hoped like hell I was making the right decision to confide in him. But even if I wasn\u2019t, I still had to chance it. It wasn\u2019t like I had a whole lot of options right now. \u201cHow much do you know about witchcraft and ley lines?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI know some people think the lines and their intersections resonate with a special psychic or mystical energy, but the jury is out as to whether there\u2019s any truth to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you they\u2019re not only more powerful than you could ever imagine, but there\u2019s a major ley-line intersection here in Melbourne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to say, so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a consortium has used extreme force in an effort to gain control of the area around that intersection.\u201d</p><p>His gaze searched mine for a moment. \u201cWhy say \u2018has used\u2019 rather than \u2018is using\u2019? No one is interested in old news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not old news if only two of the three men have been captured. The Directorate are pushing resources behind the hunt for the third man, but so far they have been unable to locate him. The man is a ghost, existing only on paper.\u201d</p><p>Of course, the Directorate\u2014or Directorate of Other Races, as they were officially known\u2014also had bigger problems on their hands. They were, after all, responsible for going after all non-humans who crossed the line and killed.</p><p>He studied me for a moment, one finger tapping the table lightly. A sure sign I\u2019d snagged his interest. \u201cFor the Directorate to be pushing all resources behind such a hunt, these men had to have done something pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey raised a soul stealer and set it after the relatives or friends of anyone who wouldn\u2019t sell them the properties that surrounded the intersection. One of those who died was a little girl.\u201d A little girl whose soul would never move on, never be reborn. Hers was a life lost to the world forever.</p><p>\u201cYou always were a sucker when it came to children.\u201d His voice hinted at the warmth of old. \u201cIs that what this is about? Revenge for a little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth the thing responsible for the little girl\u2019s death and the witch who raised it have been dealt with.\u201d And both of them were dead, sent to the fiery realms of hell itself\u2014although who actually knew if hell was fiery. \u201cThis is about finding the third member of that consortium.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his coffee for several moments, his expression giving little away. But I knew from past experience that behind the neutral expression there was a clever mind going at full tilt, chewing over information, working out possible angles. \u201cWhy does this consortium controlling the intersection worry you so much? You\u2019re not a witch. You aren\u2019t even as psychically powerful as your mother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have different gifts than my mom had, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less powerful.\u201d Although admittedly, being able to walk the gray fields\u2014the unseen lands that divide this world from the next\u2014talk to souls, and see the reapers who guided the souls on to the next life weren\u2019t exactly the most usable psychic gifts in a normal, everyday life. But my life of late was as far from normal and everyday as you could get.</p><p>And those were far from the only gifts I had.</p><p>Jak raised an eyebrow. \u201cMeaning you can use the ley lines?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t even see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why is it so important to you that the consortium be stopped?\u201d</p><p>I picked up a spoon and scooped up some chocolate cake. It was a little dry, but I needed the sugary energy right then. The air-conditioning might be blasting every other scent away, but it didn\u2019t seem to be doing a whole lot to erase his. And every intake of breath had the past stirring within me.</p><p>\u201cThese people attacked friends of mine. I want to find them.\u201d</p><p>His gaze scanned mine again and a smile tugged at his lips. \u201cThe truth, but not the whole truth.\u201d</p> <p>I acknowledged that with a slight nod. \u201cBut the whole truth is a little out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a reporter who investigates all things paranormal and occult, remember?\u201d Sarcasm edged his voice. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at just how \u2018out there\u2019 I\u2019m willing to go.\u201d</p><p>I was betting even he wouldn\u2019t believe the real truth\u2014that the intersection might well be tied up in a desperate scramble by at least four different parties to find the keys that would unlock the portals of heaven and hell. That one of those keys not only had been recently found, but had been used to open the first of the portals that protected our world from the hordes of hell.</p><p>I\u2019d held that key in my hand. Held it, and lost it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want that to happen with the next two keys, and that meant finding out as much as we could about all the players involved in this race. Which meant digging up as much information about John Nadler\u2014the consortium\u2019s elusive third man\u2014as we could get.</p><p>But computers could go only so far. Sometimes the only way to find out anything useful was to hit the streets. But the sort of people who would hold the information we needed weren\u2019t likely to talk to someone like me, even if I could find them. They would talk to Jak, though. They always had. He had a talent for putting you at ease.</p> <p>Or at least he did when he wasn\u2019t sitting opposite the woman whose heart he\u2019d shattered.</p><p>\u201cAn intersection as powerful as this one,\u201d I said, \u201ccan be used to manipulate time, reality, or fate. If someone succeeds in controlling such an intersection, he could wreak havoc on the very fabric of our world.\u201d</p><p>He briefly looked surprised. \u201cThe intersection is really that powerful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I guess finding the third man is something of a priority.\u201d He leaned forward a little. \u201cBut why are you involved? And why come to me? Why not just leave it all to the Directorate? It seems to be more their line of business than yours or mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d leave it to the Directorate if I could, but that\u2019s not an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeading me to the next obvious question\u2014why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m being blackmailed into the hunt.\u201d Which was the truth\u2014it just didn\u2019t actually apply to the intersection.</p> <p>Amusement flirted briefly with his mouth and something deep inside me twisted. It was a stupid and illogical response, and it made me want to scream at my inability to just forget what might have been.</p><p>\u201cDid someone dig up some more dirty laundry on you or your family?\u201d he said.</p><p>His article had been more than dirty laundry\u2014he\u2019d accused her of lying about her past. Which she had, but not for the reasons he\u2019d suggested. There were no nefarious crimes or shady dealings, just her creation in a madman\u2019s laboratory\u2014a fact that she kept well guarded, and for good reason. Her extraordinary abilities had caused many to treat her as a freak\u2014it would have been far worse if they\u2019d learned the true nature of her birth. \u201cNo, they didn\u2019t. They\u2019re threatening my friends.\u201d</p><p>That the man behind the threats was both an Aedh\u2014who were creatures of light and shadows, an energy so fierce that their mere presence burned the very air around them\u2014and my father was something I wasn\u2019t about to explain.</p><p>Jak frowned. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, involving the Directorate seems even more logical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are involved, but their investigation is going nowhere and they can\u2019t protect my friends forever.\u201d They weren\u2019t even trying, in fact, simply because they didn\u2019t know about the threats. There was no point in telling them when they could never, ever protect us from the force that was my father.</p><p>\u201cSo why do you think I\u2019ll succeed where the Directorate are failing?\u201d Jak asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you not only have a knack for getting people to talk to you, but you seem able to uncover those who would rather remain hidden.\u201d</p><p>The half smile appeared again. \u201cThat was almost a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cNothing more, nothing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He finished his coffee, then leaned back in his chair again. \u201cHow do you expect me to find someone the Directorate\u2014with all its resources\u2014cannot? They have some of the strongest telepaths in Melbourne in their employ. What could I get that they can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re tackling the situation from a criminal angle. I have people tackling it from a computer angle. What we need is someone on the street.\u201d I paused, and my smile held only the slightest trace of bitterness. \u201cAnd we both know just how much you love digging the dirt in the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should do that more often,\u201d he said. \u201cIt suits you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a heartbeat, totally confused. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile.\u201d</p><p>Something twisted inside again. Old pain, old love, churning together, one fighting the other. Bastard, I thought. It was hard enough fighting the memories without him muddying the water by throwing compliments.</p><p>\u201cI may want your help, Jak, but I don\u2019t want anything else from you. I don\u2019t like the way you treat your lovers.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt was only a comment, not a flirtation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, keep such comments to yourself. I don\u2019t need them. I just need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I can\u2019t give if I don\u2019t actually have a starting point\u2014other than the name of a man no one can find.\u201d</p><p>I reached into my purse and pulled out my phone. \u201cYou still have the same number?\u201d When he nodded, I attached a file and sent it to him. His phone beeped from the depths of his pockets. \u201cThat\u2019s all the information we have, on both the consortium and the three men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the people they were threatening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso there.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cIf you talk to Fay and Steven Kingston\u2014the parents of the little girl\u2014don\u2019t mention the soul stealer. They don\u2019t know the truth about their daughter\u2019s death. They don\u2019t know that the threats and Hanna\u2019s death are connected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>His gaze seemed to intensify, as if he were trying to get inside my head. Which he had no chance of doing, thanks to the super-strong nano microcells that had been inserted into my earlobe and heel. Nanowires\u2014the predecessor of the microcells\u2014were powered by body heat, but for the wires to be active, both ends had to be connected so that a circuit was formed. Microcells were also powered by body heat, but they were contradictory forces that didn\u2019t need a physical connection. Once fully activated, the push-pull of their interaction provided a shield that was ten times stronger than any wire yet created.</p><p>With them in place, no one was getting inside my head. Well, almost no one. The reaper who\u2019d been assigned by the powers above him\u2014powers he refused to name\u2014to follow me around seemed to have no problem accessing my thoughts, and neither did Lucian, although at least Lucian was hit-and-miss.</p><p>The one test the microcells hadn\u2019t yet passed was Madeline Hunter, who was not only one of the strongest vampire telepaths around and the woman in charge of the Directorate, but also\u2014technically\u2014my boss. Which wasn\u2019t a situation I was happy about, but then, that\u2019s what I got for agreeing to work for the high vampire council.</p><p>Of course, working for them and actually helping them find the keys\u2014which they wanted not only so they could maintain power, but also so they could use hell itself as some sort of prison\u2014were two entirely different things. But it was a precarious balancing act, simply because half of the high council thought it would be better to kill me than use me. All that stood between me and them was Hunter herself. Which meant that, like it or not, I would do what I had to do to keep her happy.</p><p>Jak blinked, suggesting that he\u2019d given up attempting to squirrel into my thoughts. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you tell them the truth about their daughter\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was bad enough that their little girl died. They didn\u2019t need to know that it wasn\u2019t just her flesh that had passed.\u201d I eyed him warily. \u201cAnd if you tell them, I shall beat you to a pulp.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. The sound shivered down my spine, warm and tingly. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten a little aggressive since we parted. Hope it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t give yourself any credit, Jak. I\u2019ve had far worse traumas in my life than you using me to get a story on my mother.\u201d</p><p>And given that she\u2019d been torn apart by an unknown assailant, that was the understatement of the year, to say the least.</p><p>Jak didn\u2019t say the obvious\u2014Sorry about your mother\u2019s death\u2014and I was glad. I might just have given in to the temptation to hit him if he had.</p><p>\u201cSo, I track down any and all information about this consortium and the man no one else can find\u2014then what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou give me progress reports, and you let me see everything you have before you print said story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince this story looms so large on the Directorate\u2019s radar, will I actually be allowed to print it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t stop it if they don\u2019t know about it,\u201d I said. \u201cAll you need to do is keep your head down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s going to be easy given what I\u2019m investigating.\u201d His gaze moved down again, narrowing slightly when it came to rest on my left arm. \u201cInteresting tat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said dismissively, not even glancing down at the wingless lilac dragon that twined its way up my arm from my fingertips. I certainly wasn\u2019t about to explain that it wasn\u2019t actually a tattoo, but something far more deadly\u2014a Du\u0161an, a spirit guardian that came to life on the gray fields to protect me. \u201cHave we got a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Let me dig around a little, just to see if there really is a worthwhile story in all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t take too long to decide, because we haven\u2019t got a whole lot of time left.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, finished his coffee in one long gulp, then rose. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know, one way or another, by tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>He walked out. I tried to resist the urge to watch, but my gaze still flicked that way. The man sure could move nicely... Something fluttered at the outer reaches of my vision. It was almost ghostlike, a wisp of silver that was quickly shredded by the sunlight streaming in through the window. I frowned, scanning the front of the shop, intuition tingling. Whatever it was, it didn\u2019t reappear.</p><p>Jak left the caf\u00e9 and the door whooshed shut behind him. I sighed in relief and ordered a second cup of coffee. My damn hands were shaking so bad it took several attempts to swipe the credit card through.</p><p>\u201cYou should not have met him if his presence affects you so.\u201d</p><p>The words came out of the emptiness behind Jak\u2019s chair even as the heat of Azriel\u2019s presence caressed my skin. Reapers, like the Aedh, were beings of energy rather than true flesh and blood, but they could attain that form if they wished to.</p><p>Which was how I\u2019d come about. My father had spent one night in flesh form with my mother and, in the process, had given life to me\u2014a half-breed mix of werewolf and Aedh who was lucky enough to get most of the best bits of each and few of the downsides.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that said we had to do everything possible to stop the remaining portals from being opened. No matter what I might think or feel about Jak, he is good at digging up forgotten information.\u201d I stabbed my spoon into my cake for another bite. \u201cIf it\u2019s out there to be found, he\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p> <p>Azriel formed substance on the other side of the table and sat down in Jak\u2019s recently vacated chair. While reapers were basically shape-shifters, able to take on any form that would comfort the dying on their final journey, they did possess one \u201ctrue\u201d shape. Usually I just saw whatever form they used to claim the soul they were meant to escort, but for some weird reason, I always saw Azriel\u2019s real form rather than the shape he decided to take on. Even he had no idea why this happened\u2014or if he did, he wasn\u2019t telling me.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t exactly a bad thing, because his real form was rather stunning. His face was chiseled, almost classical in its beauty and yet possessing the hard edge of a man who\u2019d won more than his fair share of battles. He was shirtless, his skin a warm, suntanned brown and his abs well defined. The worn leather strap that held his sword in place seemed to emphasize the width of his shoulders, just as the dark jeans that clung to his legs hinted at the lean strength of them. A stylized black tat that resembled the left half of a wing swept around his ribs from underneath his arm, the tips brushing across the left side of his neck.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t a tat. It too was a Du\u0161an\u2014a darker, more stylized brother to the one that now resided on my left arm.</p><p>Azriel\u2019s gaze met mine, and his blue eyes\u2014one as vivid and as bright as a sapphire, the other the color of a storm-held sea\u2014hinted at sympathy.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have just asked him all this on the phone?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cJak\u2019s the sort of person who prefers face-to-face meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of his gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I gave the waitress another smile of thanks as she delivered my second cup of coffee. She didn\u2019t even blink at the half-naked, sword-carrying man sitting opposite me.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. The same ability that allowed reapers to see what form a soul would most likely accept in their guide allowed Azriel to take on an outer skin that would raise no eyebrows, no matter where he was. The waitress probably saw him as just another man in a suit.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he said, \u201cshe still thinks Jak sits at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad he isn\u2019t,\u201d I muttered around a mouthful of cake.</p><p>\u201cOdd words, since your thoughts suggest otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you have previously noted, human thoughts are not always rational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are not human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd right now, I\u2019m not exactly rational.\u201d I finished the last of my cake, then pushed the plate away and reached for Jak\u2019s. Never let it be said that I let chocolate cake go to waste, even if it wasn\u2019t the best I\u2019d ever tasted. \u201cSo, what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cUntil your father contacts us with details of the next key\u2019s location, we are basically at a standstill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if he wasn\u2019t the one who stole the first key from us, maybe he won\u2019t.\u201d And if he wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d stolen it, I was more than happy for him to remain far, far away. If only because I\u2019d seen him angry\u2014and, despite the fact that I\u2019m part werewolf, it had taken days for the bruises to fade. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll consider us too great a risk to use us again.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you honestly believe that?\u201d</p><p>He knew I didn\u2019t. He could read every thought, after all. I threw the spoon onto the plate, but it bounced and clattered over the edge of the table. Azriel caught it casually in one hand and gave it back to me.</p><p>\u201cFinish the cake,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou need the sustenance.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at him. \u201cStop mothering me. Besides, cake isn\u2019t sustenance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is impossible for me to mother you when I am male,\u201d he replied evenly, but there was a hint of humor glinting in the depths of his eyes, and, as usual, it did strange things to my pulse rate\u2014which only emphasized just how irrational I really was. He added, \u201cAnd is not chocolate one of the five essential food groups?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cYou, reaper, need to stop believing everything you read in my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>He merely raised an eyebrow. \u201cIf it is not essential, why do you have it so often?\u201d</p><p>I studied him for a moment, wondering if he was still teasing me or not. \u201cBecause it\u2019s like love and sex\u2014it\u2019s just something a woman has to have.\u201d I paused, but couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cWhat about you? Is there anything in your life that you\u2019d consider essential?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdis,\u201d he said immediately.</p><p>\u201cValdis is your sword.\u201d A demon-forged sword with a whole lot of power and a voice and mind of her own, granted, but still a sword. I had a similar one sitting at my back, but Amaya was shadow-wreathed, and no one would ever see her\u2014not until her black blade pierced their flesh, anyway. \u201cSwords don\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it would be duty,\u201d he said.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad statement about the reaper community that duty is considered a far higher priority than love and laughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is natural our priorities are different considering our beings are completely different in design.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cAren\u2019t you even curious as to why we humans consider love, sex, and chocolate so vital to our existence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhich does not preclude the possibility that I have experienced at least one of those options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about the reaper version of love and sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was I,\u201d he said, amusement teasing his lips.</p><p>I stared at him for several seconds, completely dumbstruck. No, he surely couldn\u2019t mean...</p><p>He\u2019d shown no interest in eating in the time I\u2019d known him, so I had to think chocolate was out. And it was hard to imagine him falling in love with a human, given his often harsh opinions of humanity as a whole. But that left only sex and I really couldn\u2019t imagine...</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cIf I can find death in this form, why would you think me incapable of finding other emotions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath isn\u2019t an emotion. Neither is sex.\u201d I said this in total disbelief. I was still trying to get my head around the fact that Azriel had had sex. In human form.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, death is a time of great sadness. And does not sex bring joy and completeness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, for us. You\u2019re not us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can you believe it possible for the Aedh to enjoy the benefits of flesh, but not a reaper?\u201d</p><p>The Aedh he was referring to was Lucian. Despite all the help Lucian had given to us recently, Azriel both disliked and distrusted him, to the point where he refused to call him by name\u2014even if he was in the same room with him.</p><p>\u201cI believe it because I\u2019ve seen the joy Lucian gets out of sex. Besides, reapers are soul guides and it seems to me that you all treat that role with great respect and utmost devotion. I would have thought fraternizing with us would be banned.\u201d Hell, there seemed to be rules forbidding almost everything else in the reaper world.</p><p>\u201cAh, but it is,\u201d he said, and there was an almost bitter twist in his brief smile.</p><p>I blinked. \u201cOkay, now you\u2019re just confusing me.\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a few moments, his gaze more intense than usual, as if he were judging me. Which was odd, because he was connected to my chi and probably knew me better than I knew myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou remember I mentioned the friend that died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was sent to retrieve a soul, but found a trap instead. Ten more reapers found their deaths before I tracked down the person responsible.\u201d Azriel paused, and regret touched the air. But over what it had cost him, I thought, not what he\u2019d done. \u201cI was not a dark angel\u2014not a Mijai\u2014at the time, but I did what I had to do to uncover the killer.\u201d</p> <p>Which was what he\u2019d advised me to do not so long ago, and the only reason I\u2019d come here to see Jak today. \u201cAnd doing what you had to do involved sex with a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Seducing the killer\u2019s former mistress was the only way I could uncover his location.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have simply read her mind, or even waited until he came to see her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, she was his former mistress. Apparently he\u2019d stopped seeing her just before the killings began. And though it is extremely rare, there are minds reapers cannot read\u2014that is why you sometimes see the classic gray shroud form of reaper.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cViolence was out\u2014I would not desecrate my position as a soul guide that badly\u2014so my only option was seduction. It took two weeks to gain her trust and get the information. That time was... enlightening.\u201d</p><p>I bet. \u201cSo you became a Mijai because you seduced a woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd scattered the soul of my friend\u2019s killer to the four winds, never to be reborn.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit... He really had got his vengeance. \u201cHow the hell are you even still alive?\u201d</p><p>I might not know a whole lot about the reaper world, but I did know that sort of action was out of bounds unless it was ordered by whoever was in charge of the Mijai. Or dark angels, as they sometimes called themselves.</p><p>\u201cIt was a close decision,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd I am still paying for my actions, even as a Mijai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your becoming a Mijai, and then being assigned to follow me, is part of that punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>No wonder he\u2019d been so hostile at the beginning of all this. \u201cSo when this assignment is over, will you be forgiven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. My sin was great. My penance will be a long one.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him for a moment, suspecting there was more to his punishment than what he was admitting. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t care, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care that I will never again be a guide. Beyond that, no.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d avenged his friend. And to think I\u2019d once thought this reaper wasn\u2019t capable of emotion.</p><p>I lifted my cup, then paused, the coffee washing warmth across my lips. There was another odd glimmer in the shadows behind Azriel. It definitely wasn\u2019t smoke from the deep fryers or anything like that, because it was stationary under the vents. Steam would have been sucked out.</p><p>What? His voice slipped into my mind as smoothly as dark silk.</p><p>I think we have company.</p> <p>Where? He didn\u2019t move, but blue fire began to flicker across Valdis\u2019s sharp edges, a sure sign that sword and master were ready for action.</p><p>It\u2019s behind you.</p><p>His eyes narrowed a little, and power slithered through the air. His, not that of whatever it was behind him. It is neither a ghost nor a day walker\u2014although there is one in the room.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. Day walker?</p><p>The spirit of one who has left his living body to roam this world.</p><p>Ah. An astral traveler. So what about those shimmers of silver I keep seeing?</p><p>Those, he said, his mind voice flat, are Ania.</p><p>I had no idea what that was\u2014other than that it wasn\u2019t of this world\u2014but right now there was a more important question. Why didn\u2019t you sense them before I did?</p><p>He hesitated. My concentration was wholly on you rather than on our surrounds. It is a mistake I shall endeavor not to repeat.</p><p>Considering all the mistakes I\u2019d made over the past few weeks, I could hardly grumble at his one brief lapse in concentration\u2014and it was oddly gratifying that I was the cause of it. I frowned at the shimmer still standing in the shadows behind him. What is an Ania?</p><p>The ancient Greeks gave them the name\u2014it means, literally, the female personification of trouble.</p><p>Which doesn\u2019t exactly tell me what they are. Or why they\u2019d be here in this caf\u00e9, closing in on us.</p><p>Ania are demons. They can be summoned to perform a number of tasks, including harassment, assault, and murder. He paused. It is unusual to see them in great numbers. They are normally solitary beings.</p><p>Two is hardly what I\u2019d term great numbers. And given the size of the shimmers I\u2019d seen, as demons went, they seemed to be on the small side.</p><p>There are at least six here, and size is not an indicator of dangerousness when it comes to demons, he chided softly. Ania are rarely seen outside the dark realm. They are hard to summon and harder to control.</p><p>So they\u2019re not the type of demon that breaks through the portals of their own accord?</p><p>No. His expression was grim as it met mine. Whoever summoned them has been able to do so simply because the strength of the portals has been weakened.</p><p>Because there were now only two portals protecting us from the hordes of hell rather than three. And that was entirely my fault.</p><p>Losing the first key is a blame that lies on us both.</p><p>Considering he\u2019d been busy protecting me, and all I\u2019d had to do was hold on to the key, that wasn\u2019t exactly true. But it was pointless getting into an argument over it\u2014no amount of arguing or remorse was going to change what had happened. So the Ania are here to kill us?</p><p>If killing was their intent, they would have attacked immediately.</p><p>Then what the hell do they want?</p><p>That I cannot say until they actually act. He hesitated. But Amaya and Valdis are well equipped to handle Ania.</p><p>That I knew. Valdis practically glowed with the blue of her fire and Amaya\u2019s hissing rolled across the edges of my mind, filled with eagerness and the need to rent and tear.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the swords I was worried about. Or Azriel. It was me. I\u2019d proven woefully inadequate when it came to protecting myself against the more dangerous elements that kept coming at us.</p><p>You are alive, Risa. Given what we have been through, that in itself speaks volumes about your ability to survive.</p><p>Surviving and fighting were two entirely different things. So what do we do?</p><p>We attack.</p><p>I glanced around. There were at least half a dozen people eating and drinking in the caf\u00e9, not to mention the five staff members. Not with all these people in here, we won\u2019t.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. Power slid through the air and, as one, everyone got up and walked out.</p><p>I blinked. I guess that solved one problem.</p><p>But it caused an even bigger one.</p><p>Because the minute the people left, the Ania attacked.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>I scrambled out of my seat and pressed back against the caf\u00e9\u2019s rear wall as I drew Amaya. Lilac fire fell from her blade, spilling across the floor in a ribbon. It was almost as if she was marking a line in the sand.</p><p>The Ania crossed it.</p><p>I swept my sword from left to right. She hissed and spat, the sound becoming oddly satisfied as her sharp point tore through one of the approaching wisps. The Ania moaned\u2014a sound abruptly cut off as her fragments were swept up in Amaya\u2019s trailing fire and burned to a crisp.</p><p>Two more Ania came at me. I swept the sword around again. This time they ducked, but as the blade whooshed over their heads, they lunged forward, one seizing my sword arm, the other my legs. Their ethereal fingers sank into my skin like talons, drawing blood.</p><p>I tried to shake the thing from my arm, but even as I did, the one on my legs heaved, and suddenly I was on my butt and being dragged forward. Toward what, I had no idea, but the sensation of power suddenly surged and the air near the caf\u00e9\u2019s door started to waver oddly.</p><p>Fingers began clawing at my hand\u2014a third Ania trying to break my grip on Amaya. The sword hissed furiously, her black blade ablaze and spitting fire all around us, setting the wooden furniture alight. The flames leapt upward with unnatural speed, filling the room with smoke and setting off the alarms. Sprinklers came on, soaking me in an instant, but they failed to quench the thirst of the fire.</p><p>As the flames crawled along the roof, I threw myself sideways, rolling in an effort to squish the Ania clinging to me. Their ghostly forms briefly scattered, and I quickly switched the sword from my bloodied right hand to my left and stabbed sideways across my body. The sharp edge of the blade ran across my belly, becoming ethereal where demon-forged steel met my flesh, leaving me unharmed as she slid deep into the wispy heart of an Ania. Purple fire wrapped around the creature, capturing it, drawing it back into the sword. Feeding on it.</p><p>Chills crept down my spine, but I had no time to think about a sword that fed on fellow demons. The Ania had latched onto my legs again and were dragging me forward. This time I knew what they were trying to do. The surge of power I\u2019d sensed before had been a doorway forming. A dark and decidedly creepy-looking door to god knew where.</p><p>I dragged in a breath that was all smoke and swung Amaya again, her lilac fire like a comet\u2019s tail as she bit through the air. The Ania dropped my legs and scattered, then suddenly Azriel was standing in front of me, Valdis screaming her fury as she sliced through the two retreating Ania. They exploded and a second later the doorway was gone, sucked back into whatever realm it had come from.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet. Flames were crawling down the walls, consuming everything in their path. The whole place was alight, and yet there was no heat, just smoke. Lots and lots of smoke.</p><p>I sheathed a still-hissing Amaya. She felt heavier on my back, as if the weight of the Ania she\u2019d consumed had somehow increased the mass of her steel. I shivered at the thought, then grabbed my bag from underneath the table and slung it over my shoulder.</p><p>Azriel clasped my elbow, his blue eyes as fierce as the fire that swarmed Valdis\u2019s side. \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the fire? Can you stop it?\u201d The words came out wheezy. The fire might not hold any heat, but the smoke was thick and it clung to the back of my throat, making it hard to breathe, let alone talk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe fire is not mine, so no, I cannot.\u201d His grip slipped down to my fingers, his palm warm against mine as he tugged me toward the rear exit. The smoke was so bad I could barely even see the emergency exit sign.</p><p>\u201cMeaning I can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>He pushed the doorway open. Beyond lay a small lane bathed in sunshine, but the sudden rush of fresh air seemed to send my lungs into a spasm and for the next few minutes I could do nothing but cough.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a drink?\u201d Azriel asked.</p><p>I shook my head and made a motion back toward the caf\u00e9. Smoke was funneling out of the open door and the purple flames were licking at the frame. It was almost as if they were following us.</p><p>\u201cAmaya is their source,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cThey follow where she leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do I put it out? And why didn\u2019t the caf\u00e9 at Werribee mansion\u201d\u2014which was where we\u2019d found, and lost, the first of the keys\u2014\u201cgo up like this when Amaya set that alight last week?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause her lust was fully sated and the flames could gain no hold. I suspect that\u2019s not the case now.\u201d</p><p>She was still hissing away merrily, so he was right in his presumption. \u201cThen how do I calm her?\u201d</p><p>He tugged me forward again, taking us farther down the lane, away from the front of the caf\u00e9 and the approaching fire engines. \u201cEvery sword is different. What works for one will not work for the other.\u201d</p><p>Which was a fat lot of help. I frowned, and tried sending calming thoughts her way. Her hissing only increased, and it felt oddly like she was telling me to get fucked. It would be just my luck to get a sword with attitude.</p><p>So I did the next best thing\u2014I mentally promised her plenty of blood in the near future. She made several hissy, grumbling-type sounds, then quietened. A glance over my shoulder revealed that the flames were similarly calming.</p><p>Now all I had to do was hope I could keep the promise.</p> <p>\u201cGiven that this attack was probably little more than a first foray,\u201d Azriel said grimly, \u201cI have no doubt that you will.\u201d</p><p>We came out on Southbank Promenade and turned toward the underground parking at the arts center. He finally released his grip on my hand, but the warmth of his touch lingered.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell would be sending Ania against us?\u201d I glanced around to see if anyone was watching, then hitched up my dress and squeezed as much water from it as I could.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t sent against us,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cThey were sent to retrieve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d I smoothed the dress back down, but it continued to drip.</p><p>Azriel acknowledged my point with a slight nod. He hadn\u2019t put Valdis away yet, and the sword still glowed with angry-looking blue fire. I very much suspected it was a reaction to his emotions rather than any sense of lurking danger.</p><p>\u201cIt could be your father, it could be the Raziq, it could even be whoever stole the first key.\u201d He shrugged and finally sheathed Valdis.</p><p>\u201cMy father has so far preferred to do his own dirty work, and the Raziq have always sent their Razan.\u201d Razan were basically the long-lived human slaves of the Raziq, the secret group of Aedh priests who were apparently dedicated to finding a way to permanently close the portals between this world and the next. And, in the process, possibly destroy us all.</p> <p>After all, if no souls could move on, then no souls could be reborn. And if there was no soul, then there could be no spark of life. The thought of babies being little more than lumps of meat, without inner life or any sort of hope, made me shudder.</p><p>It was the Raziq who had developed the keys, but my father had arranged for them to be stolen before the Raziq could put their plan into action\u2014but whatever he\u2019d intended had also gone awry, because the people who\u2019d stolen the keys had died before they could tell anyone the exact location of them.</p><p>Why, exactly, my father had the keys stolen when he showed as little consideration for humanity as the Raziq did was something I\u2019d yet to figure out. Especially when he kept saying he wanted me to find and destroy the keys, and yet had gotten dangerously annoyed when I\u2019d suggested that leaving the damn things hidden was probably safer for everyone.</p><p>\u201cI did mind-read one of the Ania during the attack,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cThe creature did not know who summoned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did those things find us? You said the Raziq probably wouldn\u2019t be able to locate me once I was away from either my apartment or the caf\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not be the Raziq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just forget the who for the moment.\u201d Annoyance edged my voice. \u201cHow did the Ania find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ania work along the lines of bloodhounds, only they are visual rather than scent hounds. Show them a picture and they will scour the earth until they find that person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could someone show them a picture of me without becoming visible themselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it is the Raziq, then they have Razan. The only time the Raziq ever acquire flesh to do a task is when they cannot use the Razan to interact with this world\u2014such as the time of conceiving. And even then, it is only the shortage of Aedh females that drives some of them into the arms of humanity.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was one thing I wasn\u2019t going to complain about, considering it had given me life. \u201cAnd if it wasn\u2019t the Raziq?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhoever stole the key from us and opened the first portal would be clever enough to conceal their identity from any low-level demons they\u2019d summoned.\u201d</p><p>I pushed open the side door into the parking lot and walked down the stairs. My footsteps echoed in the concrete void, but Azriel was as silent as a ghost.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do, given that they\u2019ll probably hit us again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe attempt subterfuge.\u201d He paused, suddenly appearing just ahead of me to hold open the fourth-floor door. \u201cHow long can you hold a change?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. While I was part werewolf, I couldn\u2019t actually attain a wolf shape. In fact, the moon held no sway over me at all, and I was neither afflicted by the moon heat\u2014although I did have a healthy sexual appetite\u2014nor forced to change shape on the night of the full moon.</p><p>However, Mom hadn\u2019t been just an ordinary werewolf. She\u2019d been a helki werewolf, and one refined in the labs of a madman. Helkis were face-shifters. They could literally alter the shape of their face, hair, and eyes\u2014although, oddly, the eyes were the most difficult to keep altered over long periods of time. I\u2019d inherited that ability from her, but it wasn\u2019t something I used very often, so it took a whole lot more out of me than it had Mom.</p><p>\u201cThat depends on just how much of a change we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He stopped the door from slamming shut with his fingertips, then fell in step beside me. The heat of him washed over me, warm and comforting. \u201cThe Ania are somewhat rigid bloodhounds. Show them an image and that is precisely what they search for. I would think a simple change of hair color would suffice for now.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. I actually loved my coloring. Silvery hair and lilac eyes were a startling\u2014and somewhat rare\u2014combination, and I liked the attention they sometimes gave me.</p><p>\u201cBlack hair and lilac eyes would be no less startling,\u201d he commented. \u201cAnd as your skin is not pale, it would look very suitable on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuitable?\u201d I said, amused. \u201cGod, Azriel, surely even you can come up with a better compliment than that.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at me. \u201cWhy is \u2018suitable\u2019 not an adequate compliment?\u201d</p><p>I studied him for a moment, not sure if he was teasing me or not. \u201cBecause I guess it sounds so... average.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you are obviously not.\u201d His expression was still totally serious and yet, if he\u2019d had an affair with a human woman, he surely couldn\u2019t be as obtuse about human\u2014or non-human\u2014vanity as he was making out. \u201cSo, would the word \u2018stunning\u2019 be considered more appropriate?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Why was I even bothering to fish for compliments from him? \u201cThis conversation is insane. Let\u2019s just forget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish. You have not, however, answered my original question.\u201d</p><p>It took me a couple of seconds to actually remember his original question. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually held either a full or a partial change for any great length of time. I could probably hold a hair color change for three or four days if it\u2019s continuous, but it\u2019ll wear me out physically. If I simply revert back to my natural color once I\u2019m home, it might be a little more sustainable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no cameras in this immediate area, and no one nearby. And it is infinitely better to be safe than sorry.\u201d</p><p>I nodded a little reluctantly. Face-shifting wasn\u2019t as easy as shifting into an alternate form. From what I\u2019d been told, donning your wolf form\u2014or whatever other form of animal you might be\u2014involved little more than reaching into that place inside where the beast roamed and releasing the shackles that bound her. Face-shifting was a little more complicated. Not only did you have to fully imagine all the minute details of the face you wanted to copy, but you had to hold it firm in your thoughts while the magic swirled around and through your body. Easier said than done when the magic was designed to sweep away sensation and thought.</p><p>Of course, I was only changing my hair color, but given how little I face-shifted, even that wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.</p><p>I flexed my fingers, then closed my eyes and pictured my own face\u2014from the lilac of my eyes, the slight up tilt of my nose, and my defined cheekbones, to the fullness of my lips. But instead of shoulder-length silver hair, I imagined it black and with a pixie cut. A black so rich that it shone dark purple in the sunlight.</p><p>Then, freezing that image in my mind, I reached for the magic. It exploded around me, thick and fierce, as if it had been contained for far too long. It swept through me like a gale, making my muscles tremble and the image waver. I frowned, holding it fiercely against the storm of power. The energy began to pulsate, burn, and change me. My skin rippled without altering, but my hair suddenly felt shorter and somehow finer. As the magic faded, I staggered a little, my knees suddenly weak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Azriel caught my arm and steadied me. \u201cDoes it always affect you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s usually worse.\u201d I shrugged, locked my knees in place, then gently pulled away from the strength of his touch. \u201cI\u2019m told it gets easier with use, but I just don\u2019t use it often enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it will become easier as the weeks pass?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d I eyed him for a moment. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019ll need to hold it that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil we know who is behind the attack\u2014and why\u2014then, yes, I think it very likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous.\u201d Not. I ran a hand through my hair\u2014my now short hair. It was an almost surreal sensation, but one I\u2019d have to get used to on a semipermanent basis, apparently. \u201cWill changing my hair work if I\u2019m still riding the same bike and working in the same place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, the Ania are precise hunters. A motorbike is not a unique object, and it could be anyone under the helmet. Sending them after a particular facial image is far safer.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut we\u2019ll know soon enough.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cHopefully, Jak will come up with something interesting tomorrow, because I really don\u2019t want to be sitting around waiting for either my father to contact me or to be attacked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have little other choice.\u201d Frustration briefly edged his voice. \u201cWhere do you go now? To the caf\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m not scheduled until tonight. I thought I\u2019d go see how Tao is faring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still lives.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cBeing in a semi-coma and living a fully functioning life are two very different things.\u201d</p><p>And right now, Tao was still doing the former rather than the latter. He could swallow food and water, but there was little response to stimuli, and no sense that he was aware of our presence. No one knew when\u2014or if\u2014he was ever going to come out of it. Even the witches at the Brindle\u2014the place that was now the home of all witch knowledge, ancient or new\u2014could find no mention of anyone ever consuming a fire elemental before Tao had done precisely that\u2014and there was no spell or potion to reverse what had been done. We were all playing the waiting game and hoping like hell that he\u2019d come back to us.</p><p>\u201cThe witches do not appreciate my presence in their sacred place, so I shall meet you there but will wait outside.\u201d He winked out of existence, but wasn\u2019t entirely gone, because he added, \u201cThe black hair is truly stunning, but your natural color is more beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Then the heat of his presence faded completely, leaving me grinning like an idiot. An obviously insane idiot, because Azriel and I were about as viable as Lucian and I when it came to anything resembling a relationship. But at least I could enjoy sex with Lucian.</p><p>Of course, Azriel had explored the intimate delights of flesh, but that didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d actually enjoyed it. The term \u201cenlightening\u201d could have meant anything.</p><p>And I really, really needed to steer well away from this line of thinking. Azriel\u2019s presence might not burn the air, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t somewhere nearby and following every wayward thought.</p><p>I reached into my purse and retrieved the keys to my motorbike. She sat alone in the designated bike parking area, her sleek silver body gleaming brightly in the shadowy confines of the lot. The Ducati was one of the first things I\u2019d bought when our caf\u00e9 finally started making a profit, and even though her hydrogen engine was more than a little outdated these days, she was still a joy to ride.</p><p>I pulled out my helmet, leather jacket and pants, and Kevlar boots from the seat storage, then deposited my purse. Once I\u2019d donned my bike gear, I climbed onto the Ducati and started her up. Unlike regular motorbikes, hydrogen bikes run relatively silent, with only the lit-up light-screen dashboard and the slight vibration running through the frame to tell you they\u2019ve started. In fact, when they were first developed, our nanny-inclined government had forced manufacturers to add a fake engine noise so that pedestrians could hear them coming. These days, that rule was pretty much defunct, as pedestrians had far greater worries\u2014namely the air blades, which were basically jet-powered skateboards. Those things really were dangerous\u2014a fact I knew because I\u2019d tried them recently. Not only had I almost decapitated Lucian, but I\u2019d spent more time on the ground than I had on the damn blade.</p><p>I drove out of the parking lot and headed back into the city. The traffic was light, so it didn\u2019t take me too long to get there. I swung onto Lansdowne Street, then into Treasury Place. The Brindle was a white, four-story building that had once been a part of the Old Treasury complex. It looked innocuous until you neared it\u2014that was when the tingling caress of energy burned across your skin. This place was protected by a veil of power, and it didn\u2019t suffer fools\u2014or evil\u2014gladly.</p><p>I stopped in the parking bays along the edge of a park that had once held the premier\u2019s office. After I\u2019d stripped off the leathers and retrieved my purse, I locked the bike and helmet in place and headed into the Brindle. I climbed the steps and walked through the huge wood and wrought-iron doors into the shadowy interior. Even though I came here at least a couple of times a week, a sense of awe still struck me. This place\u2014these halls\u2014was almost as old as Melbourne itself, but it was so immersed in power that mini comets of energy shot through the air at any sort of movement.</p><p>The foyer wasn\u2019t exactly inviting, but the rich gold of the painted brickwork added a warmth that the somewhat austere entrance lacked. I walked on, my footsteps echoing in the stillness and little explosions of fire following in my wake. A woman appeared out of one of the rooms farther down the hall, then stopped, her hands clasped together in front of her tunic-clad body.</p> <p>Her gaze rose to my hair, but all she said was, \u201cIt is good to see you again, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Margo.\u201d I stopped and made the expected tithe at the discreetly placed urn near the reception room\u2019s entrance. For normal dealings with the witches of the Brindle, it wasn\u2019t required, but Tao\u2019s situation was far from normal, and they\u2019d been throwing a whole lot of resources behind the effort to make him whole again.</p><p>I hated to think just what it was going to end up costing Ilianna. Tithes or not, it was only thanks to her\u2014and the promises she\u2019d made to the Brindle that she wouldn\u2019t tell me about\u2014that the witches had agreed to take him in.</p><p>The only thing she had said about the promises she\u2019d made to get him treated scared the hell out of me. He saved my life at the cost of changing his very being. I can do no less for him.</p><p>This whole key mess was changing the very fabric of our lives, and there was virtually nothing any of us could do to stop it. I\u2019d asked them both many a time to walk away, but they wouldn\u2019t. And while part of me was relieved, mostly I was just scared. For Ilianna and Tao, for what the ultimate cost to them might be.</p><p>They were my childhood friends, my best friends, and we not only shared a home, but owned and ran a caf\u00e9 together. I didn\u2019t want to lose either of them.</p><p>I followed Margo down to the far end of the hall and through a small, ornately carved door. The hall beyond was smaller, its walls a soothing green. The air was a riot of indefinable scents that had my nose twitching even though it wasn\u2019t exactly unpleasant. We passed several rooms, including the one Tao had been in a few days ago.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been moved?\u201d I asked, as we continued on. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElementals need a heat source to survive. We suspect the shadowed room could have been the reason for his failure to improve.\u201d</p><p>Tao was a werewolf rather than an elemental, but it was possible that consuming the elemental had changed his physiology enough that the lack of sunlight would affect him. \u201cSo the new room is sunnier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She stopped at a doorway near the far end of the hall and motioned me to enter.</p><p>I took a deep breath, fearing what I might find, then stepped inside the small, sunlit room. Tao lay on a bed in the middle of the room, his lower body covered by a sheet\u2014more for modesty, I suspected, than any real need for a cover. Even from here I could feel the heat radiating off him.</p><p>Ilianna sat in a chair beside the bed and did something of a double take as I entered. Dark smudges dulled her green eyes and her normally lustrous blond mane hung limp and lifeless.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou really need to go home and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Soon.\u201d She half shrugged, but the worried look in her eyes said \u201csoon\u201d wasn\u2019t going to be anytime in the near future. It also suggested that nothing I could do or say would move her, and I couldn\u2019t use force in a place like this. The building\u2014or the magic that guarded it\u2014would not appreciate it.</p><p>Not that that would stop me from trying if it came down to it. The last thing I wanted was her falling sick, as well.</p><p>She scanned me from head to toe. \u201cThe new hairdo is startling, but I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s something a little more than the need for a change behind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone sent demon bloodhounds after us. Azriel thinks this will throw them off the track for the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>He usually was. Annoyingly so. \u201cHow is Tao today?\u201d He actually looked a little better. His face\u2014although covered in a wiry brown beard that was growing thicker by the day\u2014had lost some of its gauntness, and his breathing was less labored.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing okay,\u201d she replied, touching his hand lightly. \u201cWe actually managed to get a decent amount of gruel into him today and he kept it down.\u201d</p><p>The so-called gruel they were feeding him was a revolting mess of herbs, vitamins, protein, and carbs, designed to bolster his body and strength. Up until recently he hadn\u2019t been able to keep much of it down and I can\u2019t say that I was entirely surprised. If there was any spark of consciousness inside him, he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have been happy about being force-fed the smelly muck.</p><p>But at least he did have some basic motor capabilities. If he\u2019d required intravenous feeding, then he would have landed in hospital. The Brindle witches weren\u2019t legally allowed to perform that sort of procedure, even if some of them knew more about the body and medicines than many fully trained professionals. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHas there been any sign of consciousness returning?\u201d It was a rather inane question, because if there had been, Ilianna would have been straight on the phone to let me know.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBut his muscle responses seem to be improving, so that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the heat?\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze swept down his length. \u201cHis core temperature has come down a little and he\u2019s not sweating as much, but he\u2019s still radiating massive amounts of heat.\u201d</p><p>No surprise given that he\u2019d consumed a creature that was little more than a furnace on legs. That he\u2019d done it to save Ilianna only made her feelings of guilt an even heavier cross to bear. I pulled up another chair and sat down. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go get something to eat? I\u2019ll sit here with him until you return.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlianna,\u201d I said, gently but firmly, \u201cTao would be the first person to tell you off for running yourself into the ground for him. Besides, he\u2019s going to need lots of care when he wakes up, and you know I suck at providing any sort of long-term sympathy or patience when it comes to tending to the sick.\u201d</p><p>A smile briefly lifted the tiredness from her eyes. \u201cYour bedside manner is robust, to say the least.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is why you don\u2019t want to get sick, either, because then you\u2019ll be at my not-so-tender mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs threats go, that\u2019s one of the best, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlianna, please, just go.\u201d</p><p>She studied me dubiously for a moment, then sighed and grabbed her purse from beside the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be as quick as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time and get something decent to eat. I\u2019ll ring you if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, obviously about to argue, then nodded. \u201cJust make sure you do ring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will, I will. Now go.\u201d</p><p>She went. I reached out for Tao\u2019s hand, wincing a little at the heat of his fingers. How it wasn\u2019t actually killing him I had no idea.</p><p>I spent the next hour simply talking to him\u2014updating him on the restaurant and everything that was going on with the keys and our search for the mysterious third man behind the consortium. Maybe he heard, maybe he didn\u2019t, but in the end that really wasn\u2019t important. He was in there somewhere, and I just wanted him to hear my voice and know that we were near, waiting for him.</p><p>Ilianna returned just after two o\u2019clock. She looked flushed and happy, and I very much suspected she\u2019d gone home to see Mirri, her partner. Her apartment was only fifteen minutes away, if that.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d I asked, amusement teasing my lips.</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d she said, dumping her purse beside her chair before sitting. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you forced me to go eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you actually did remember to eat,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019m going to tell Mirri off.\u201d</p><p>She briefly looked startled, then chuckled softly. \u201cI should have known a little afternoon delight would not escape the attention of a werewolf.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot when you\u2019re wearing such a satisfied smile. How\u2019s Mirri doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She made a face. \u201cBut she\u2019s on nights all this week.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI thought there was some rule against giving mares too many night shifts?\u201d Apparently because mares\u2014which, like their animal counterparts, was what female horse-shifters were called\u2014coped worse than most shifters when it came to nights. Something to do with their being more day balanced than night\u2014whatever the hell that meant. Certainly Ilianna coped well enough with night shifts at the caf\u00e9, but then I guess she never did more than two nights in a row, since we rationed them out among the three of us. Or had, until Tao\u2019s incident with the fire elemental. These days, it was mostly me, with trusted staff filling in for both Ilianna and Tao.</p><p>\u201cThere is, but with the ongoing strike, they\u2019re running on skeleton staff to cover essential areas, and Mirri\u2019s number came up.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s only for five days, then she\u2019s got five off. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully the strike will end before then.\u201d The government surely couldn\u2019t keep cutting nursing numbers and expect the hospitals to keep providing the same level of care. But there again, this was the government we were talking about. I was sure none of our elected officials actually lived in the real world.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for the rest of the day?\u201d Ilianna asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working tonight, so I might just go home and grab some sleep.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat, Lucian kept you up all night again, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp, down, in, out, and sideways,\u201d I replied with a grin.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIf you could package and sell that man\u2019s stamina, we\u2019d make a fortune.\u201d</p><p>Considering he put most werewolves to shame, we certainly would. My vid-phone rang, the sound sharp in the hushed confines of the small room. I reached into my purse and pulled it out. And my stomach sank.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just anyone calling me. It was Madeline Hunter. I was tempted to let it go to voice mail, but that would only result in pissing her off. Never a good thing to do when you were talking about one of the most powerful vampires in Australia.</p><p>I pressed the ANSWER button, and her image flashed onto the small screen. \u201cMadeline, how lovely to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it is,\u201d she said, her green eyes as cool as her voice. \u201cBut this is not a social call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine not.\u201d She shifted, revealing the panoramic view out the window behind her. Surprise rippled through me. She was ringing from her office at the Directorate, so something serious must have happened, given that I was working for the vampire council, not the Directorate. If Uncle Rhoan\u2014who was one of the Directorate\u2019s top guardians and also something of a whiz at sniffing out unusual occurrences\u2014got the slightest idea that I was, in any way, connected to Hunter or the Directorate, there\u2019d be hell to pay. I had no doubt that both he and Aunt Riley\u2014who was a consultant rather than an actual guardian these days\u2014would even go as far as threatening Hunter herself. When it came to the safety of their pack\u2014and they considered me one of theirs even if I wasn\u2019t by birth\u2014nothing and no one with any sense got in their way.</p><p>Of course, being in the employ of the vampire council was actually far worse than the Directorate ever could be. At least the Directorate was governed by rules and regulations. For all intents and purposes, the council was not. It was a shadowy organization at the best of times, and a rule unto itself at the worst.</p><p>Hunter added, \u201cA problem has come to my attention that I believe might benefit from your expertise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a Directorate investigation, why would you think you\u2019d need my help?\u201d Hell, they had witches on the payroll who\u2019d probably forgotten more than I actually knew about the gray fields.</p><p>\u201cThis will not become a full Directorate investigation, although guardians have performed discreet preliminary inquiries.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like I had a choice about getting involved, but still, curiosity stirred. \u201cWhy restrict the Directorate like that? Does it involve the council again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it does involve a certain aspect of the vampire world that we have no wish to make more generally known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo vamps have secret lives? Who\u2019d have guessed that?\u201d I said, a tad more sarcastically than was wise.</p><p>Anger flashed across her expression, and something within me chilled. Don\u2019t poke the bear, I reminded myself fiercely. Not if you want to avoid being executed by the high council.</p><p>\u201cVampires are hardly alone in keeping secrets,\u201d she said, her voice crisp, holding little of the fire I\u2019d seen only a heartbeat ago. That I\u2019d even seen it suggested that whatever the problem was, it was big. Or at the very least, annoying. \u201cAnd you would do well to remember that, considering how well your mother kept her own secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s secrets were little more than an unorthodox birth and upbringing, and it\u2019d be of little use to anyone now to reveal it.\u201d As Jak would say, she was old news. \u201cSpeaking of my mother, just what is happening with the hunt for her killer? You did promise to put full resources behind the investigation if I helped you and the council.\u201d</p><p>She paused, considering me for a moment, reminding me very much of a cat studying its prey and wondering whether to eat it or play with it. \u201cThe hunt is currently at a standstill.\u201d</p><p>That much I\u2019d gathered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there are no leads. Whoever killed your mother did so without leaving any sort of trace evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven her battered state\u2014\u201d I paused, swallowing heavily as I tried to ignore the memories that rose. \u201cHow could the killer have left no evidence whatsoever? Even if he was wearing a full DNA containment suit, there must have at least been footprint smudges.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been too much of her blood, too much of her flesh and body parts, splattered around. No killer, no matter how careful, should have been able to get out of that kitchen without leaving some trace of himself. Unless he could fly. But even then, there should have been DNA evidence of a shape-shift\u2014even if it was only feather fluff lost in the change.</p><p>\u201cThe Directorate is at a loss to explain it, and neither they nor the Cazadors have had any luck uncovering anyone who might have wanted your mother dead.\u201d</p><p>So she had kept her word and thrown the resources of the council behind the hunt. She\u2019d ordered a Cazador\u2014who were basically the vampire council\u2019s leashed killers\u2014to look into it. It was actually more than I\u2019d thought she would do, even though she had made the promise.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re looking for a ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr an Aedh.\u201d</p><p>Her words hit like ice, chilling me to the bone. An Aedh could get in and out unseen, and they certainly had the capability to tear a body apart without leaving any trace of themselves behind. Hell, I could do it if I wanted to. It was the nastier side of my Aedh heritage, one I\u2019d been reluctantly taught by Quinn, Riley\u2019s vampire lover and a man who\u2019d once trained to be an Aedh priest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut why would an Aedh want to tear my mom apart like that?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d said it out loud until Hunter answered. \u201cFor information, perhaps. Maybe they thought she had knowledge of the keys.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cMom didn\u2019t know much about the gray fields and, despite spending a night with an Aedh, she knew even less about them. Killing her for information about either makes no sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut neither does your mother\u2019s death. It was brutal and deliberate, as if it were some kind of message.\u201d</p><p>A message no one could understand. I rubbed my eyes for a moment, then said, \u201cWhat is the problem you want me to investigate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA number of murders have occurred, and the only link we can find, besides the manner of their death, is Dark Earth, a vampire establishment in Brunswick.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I knew Brunswick fairly well since Tao, Ilianna, and I had lived there for a few years during our university years, and I certainly couldn\u2019t recall a place called Dark Earth. \u201cI gather it\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, old,\u201d she said crisply. \u201cBut it\u2019s one that only vampires know about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, an underground club.\u201d There\u2019d been talk about such clubs existing over the years, but no evidence had ever been uncovered and the vamps certainly weren\u2019t forthcoming with any information.</p><p>\u201cFiguratively and physically,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIf it sat at street level, humanity would be aware of its existence and that could be dangerous for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Which only made me wonder what the hell went on in the place\u2014although I had a bad feeling that I was going to get a firsthand answer to that one.</p><p>\u201cIn the last week,\u201d she continued, \u201cthere have been five deaths. All were low-level vampires, as Dark Earth caters to a particular type of clientele.\u201d</p><p>A type she clearly wasn\u2019t going to tell me about right now\u2014and that only made me more nervous about going to the damn club. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why you want me to investigate rather than the Directorate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Directorate is brilliant at what it does, but it is too large an organization to guarantee the utter discretion this investigation requires.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, I\u2019m to shut my mouth about what I find and report only to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes without saying.\u201d She paused, and her expression intensified. Trepidation shivered down my spine. \u201cAnd if you breathe a word of this to that reporter you talked to this morning, he will discover a whole lot more about the dark edges of this world than he might wish to.\u201d</p><p>The chill got deeper. \u201cHow do you know I talked to a reporter this morning?\u201d</p><p>Her sudden smile was anything but pleasant. \u201cI did warn you that we intended to keep track of your every move.\u201d</p><p>But how? Cazadors were vampires, and no vampire, no matter how old, could stand the sun between noon and one o\u2019clock. Although some\u2014like Uncle Quinn and Hunter herself\u2014could walk around at any other time, thanks to their age.</p><p>And if a Cazador had been following me, why hadn\u2019t I sensed it? At the very least, I should have been able to smell his presence, even in the human-drenched confines of the caf\u00e9.</p><p>Unless... Could the dream walker Azriel had mentioned have been a Cazador? There were Cazadors capable of astral travel\u2014Hunter herself had told me that. And an astral-traveling vampire would not be restricted by the noonday sun, because it was only their flesh that burned. Their spirit\u2014soul\u2014did not.</p><p>Shit. We were going to have to be very careful about what we said when that traveler was near. Especially if we wanted to ensure that the keys didn\u2019t fall into the council\u2019s hands.</p> <p>\u201cIf you know anything about my history with the reporter I talked to, then you\u2019ll realize I wouldn\u2019t want to tell him anything I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Her smile lightened. The same could not be said for the look in her eyes. \u201cYes, he did gain himself something of a reputation after the rather nice story he did on your mother. I must admit to some surprise that you\u2019d even meet with him again.\u201d</p><p>To call it a \u201cnice story\u201d was something of a misnomer, given that it had become a staple for gossip mags for several weeks. \u201cIf you know about the meeting, then you\u2019ll undoubtedly know the reasons behind it. Can we get back to the reason for this call?\u201d</p><p>She did so. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned, we can find no real connection between the victims besides the club and the manner of their deaths, no apparent motive for the murders, and no trace evidence to suggest who or what might be behind them.\u201d</p><p>A chill ran through me as images of Mom\u2019s murder ran through my mind again. My mouth dry, I asked, \u201cAnd just how were they killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were eaten.\u201d</p><p>Eaten? Good lord, I did not want to go after something that would eat vampire flesh. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a vampire sitting around letting someone munch on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t. Whatever this thing is, it scratched them first. We found traces of venom in the wounds and further analysis revealed that it contained powerful inhibitors.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBut vampires don\u2019t actually need to breathe.\u201d It was more an instinctive reflex left over from the time before they\u2019d been turned. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never heard of a poison capable of killing a vamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe venom wasn\u2019t what killed them,\u201d she replied, neatly skirting the issue of poisons and vampires. Which to me suggested there were poisons capable of doing just that. \u201cThe inhibitor prevented reaction, and the killer simply ate them.\u201d</p><p>While they were alive? Oh god, this was getting worse and worse. \u201cIf it scratched them, surely there was some DNA evidence left in the wounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone, other than the venom, which we have not been able to trace to any source so far.\u201d</p><p>I released a somewhat shaky breath. \u201cThis really does sound more like Directorate business than anything I could help with.\u201d</p><p>She gave me that face. The one that said I\u2019d better do what she wanted or die. And yet I don\u2019t think her muscles even twitched\u2014it was more an odd sort of darkness that crept into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe believe this creature\u2014whatever it is\u2014might have come through when the first gate was opened. The timing is suspicious.\u201d</p><p>I shoved away the useless surge of guilt. There was nothing I could do now except get to the other two keys and prevent them from being used. Because if they were, then it really would be hell on earth.</p><p>\u201cSo where are the bodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first four victims have already undergone their final deaths via sunlight, as was their wish. The fifth, however, still lies in state at his home.\u201d</p><p>Meaning vampires made wills, like the rest of us did? That was something I hadn\u2019t realized, but I guess it did make sense. Even vampires didn\u2019t live forever\u2014though I guess they could, if they were lucky enough. Or unlucky enough, as the case might be. \u201cWhen was he murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was found an hour ago.\u201d She paused, studying me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if the thing that killed him did come from hell, then it might have left behind some sort of resonance that we could use to track it down.\u201d According to Azriel, most demons and whatnot that broke through the hell portal left such a trail. I added, \u201cBut it would dissipate with time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll need to get there ASAP. But I would advise you to go to Dark Earth immediately and talk to the manager, Brett Marshall.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t a very vampire-sounding name, but then, the newer vamps tended to have regular monikers. \u201cWhy so urgent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he is a friend, and I wish you to talk to him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d There had to be another explanation, because I wasn\u2019t buying the first one at all. From what I\u2019d seen, Hunter wasn\u2019t the type to have friends. And even if I was totally wrong, she didn\u2019t seem the type who did favors for them. She was more of a \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me\u201d type of vampire.</p><p>\u201cAnd because,\u201d she said, \u201cDark Earth is no place for a non-vampire to be after dark.\u201d</p><p>Fear quickstepped into my veins. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning,\u201d she said softly, \u201cthat even the presence of your dark angel could not guarantee that you\u2019d walk out of that club alive.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The sick sensation of fear settled deep in my stomach. \u201cSo how is going to this club in the daylight any safer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bar will be almost empty, and Brett is powerful enough to control the few who are there. He has guaranteed your safety this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Which didn\u2019t mean I would be safe. Not if the place was as dangerous as Hunter was making it out to be. \u201cWhat about viewing the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you his name and address. He lived alone, so you can choose your own time to go there. He will lie in state until his maker arrives to officiate his final death in a few days.\u201d</p><p>Makers officiated the final deaths? That was something I hadn\u2019t known. \u201cHave autopsies been done on all five victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what remained, yes. Results will be slow to come, though, as we need to keep this private.\u201d</p><p>Which suggested the autopsy was being done in-house via high council resources rather than through the Directorate. \u201cAnd what, exactly, do you expect me to find at this bar?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged\u2014an oddly elegant movement. \u201cTalk to Brett. Look around the bar. You may see or sense something that the Cazadors\u2014who don\u2019t have your psychic skills or your knowledge when it comes to the gray fields\u2014wouldn\u2019t be capable of.\u201d</p><p>Given that they had Cazadors capable of astral travel, I actually doubted they\u2019d have any less knowledge of the gray fields than I did. Although I guess astral travelers were restricted to this plane and weren\u2019t able to travel on the fields themselves. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call once I\u2019ve gone there.\u201d And gotten out alive.</p><p>\u201cBe sure that you do.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of my tongue to retort that it really didn\u2019t matter if I did or not because she\u2019d get the report from the Cazador who\u2019d been assigned to follow me around anyway. But I resisted the urge. Right now, it was better if Hunter didn\u2019t know I knew about my follower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I signed off without bothering to say good-bye and shoved my phone back into my purse.</p><p>\u201cThere goes your afternoon nap,\u201d Ilianna commented darkly. She\u2019d expressed her opinion about my working for Hunter more than once, but had finally stopped harassing me about it. She knew, like I did, that there was no real choice given that half the council currently wanted me dead.</p><p>I grimaced and stood. \u201cYeah. But there\u2019s not a lot I can do about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. And I haven\u2019t got holy water or even a stake in my purse to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that like they\u2019re everyday items one finds in a purse,\u201d I said wryly.</p><p>She snorted softly. \u201cGiven the way Hunter is dragging you further and further into her web, they should be. At least then when the spider calls to the fly, the fly will be better armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlianna\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up a hand, stopping me. \u201cI know, I know. But the fact remains, you want revenge more than you want out of any deal with Hunter.\u201d</p> <p>Well, that was certainly true. \u201cIf this whole key business blows up in our faces, we might yet need Hunter and her Cazadors on our side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this whole key business blows up in our faces, we\u2019re all going to be ass-deep in demons and fighting for our lives. I think Hunter and her council cronies will be too busy saving their own skins to worry about the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>That was also probably more true than not. And Hunter was an unreliable ally. She may have convinced the council to give her more time to prove my worth, but that didn\u2019t mean she\u2014or they\u2014couldn\u2019t change their minds. And considering that they\u2019d already thrown one test at me, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was yet another one.</p><p>I sighed and rubbed my tired eyes wearily. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged for Sara to come in and do your shift at the caf\u00e9. I want you to go home tonight and get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cSara couldn\u2019t pour a decent drink to save her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019ll be pouring drinks and she\u2019ll be tending tables.\u201d I raised a hand against her objections and added, \u201cNo more arguments. Just go home and rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Which meant she would. In this place, you didn\u2019t break promises made. \u201cI\u2019ll see you sometime tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. I dropped a kiss on Tao\u2019s fiery cheek, then left. The day seemed even hotter after the cool darkness of the Brindle. I squinted up at the sky, looking for the storms they\u2019d been predicting for later this afternoon but seeing only endless blue. This was Melbourne, though; weather could\u2014and often did\u2014change in a blink of an eye.</p><p>As I neared my bike, Azriel appeared. \u201cI do not like the sound of this bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d I unlocked the Ducati, then pulled on my leathers. And immediately began to sweat. Having to wear heavy protection on a hot day was one of the few bad points of bike riding\u2014although it was better than falling off and skinning my body down to bone on the tarmac. \u201cWhich is why I wouldn\u2019t mind you appearing as something fearsome.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI would think a reaper is fearsome enough, even for a vampire.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cI guess that depends on what you expect death to look like. If they envision him as a scantily clad, nubile young woman, I rather suspect that\u2019s not going to be much of a deterrent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not female, so I can hardly give them the visage of a young woman.\u201d</p> <p>Amusement ran through his words and a smile tugged at my lips. \u201cSo they\u2019ll see the scythe-bearing shroud instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And that is often scarier than anything I could draw from their minds.\u201d</p><p>Having seen such reapers myself, I could certainly attest to that. Even knowing that they weren\u2019t coming for me didn\u2019t erase the tendrils of fear. That vision of death was too locked into literature and film to produce anything else.</p><p>I checked my phone and discovered that Hunter had followed through with her promise and sent me the address\u2014not that I\u2019d expected anything else. Dark Earth was located on Barkley Street, either near or in the Barkley Square shopping center. It didn\u2019t seem an ideal area for an underground vampire bar, but maybe that was the whole point.</p><p>I shoved the phone away and met Azriel\u2019s gaze. \u201cShall I meet you there?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared. I climbed onto the bike, fired her up, and zoomed out of the parking lot. The traffic was heavier than before, the roads filled with people undoubtedly escaping the office to enjoy the afternoon sunshine, so it took me a little longer to get across to Brunswick, even though it wasn\u2019t that far away.</p><p>Once I\u2019d parked and secured the bike, I walked down Barkley Street. According to Hunter\u2019s instructions, the entrance to Dark Earth was located between Coles and the Kmart loading bay, in a small shopping-trolley collection nook.</p><p>I found the nook easily enough, but there sure as hell wasn\u2019t any entrance.</p><p>Azriel appeared behind me, his heat fiercer than the day itself, but a whole lot more welcome. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be evident given that the vampires have no desire for humanity to know its existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogic is not what I need right now.\u201d I ran my hand over the sunbaked apricot-colored concrete wall. It was rough and grimy under my hands, and there were vague stains lower down that smelled faintly of urine.</p><p>\u201cThen may I suggest that you press what looks to be a piece of chewing gum on the upper part of the left rear wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I studied the gum a little distastefully, then stepped forward and did as he bid.</p><p>Nothing happened. Not immediately, anyway. I stepped back and frowned at the wall. As I did so, there was a faint crackle. \u201cAnd you would be Risa Jones, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d a deep, somewhat dry voice said. \u201cHunter is nothing if not efficient with her people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hardly her people,\u201d I retorted, my gaze searching the top of the wall for some sign of the camera that had to be there, with little success. Whoever had installed them had done a damn fine job.</p><p>\u201cIf you work for her,\u201d the voice said, \u201cthen you\u2019re hers. There is no escaping her web once she has spun it around you.\u201d</p><p>A comment that echoed Ilianna\u2019s fears, and not something I wanted to hear. \u201cLook, I\u2019m here to see Brett Marshall. If you\u2019re him, let me in. If not, tell him I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, we are an impatient one, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sooner I check this place out, the quicker we may be able to track down the killer.\u201d And the sooner I could get away from it. I might not have been inside yet, but Hunter\u2019s words loomed large in the back of my mind. I did not want to be here any longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cThen by all means, come in.\u201d</p><p>As he said the words, the wall gently slid to one side, revealing a long, steep staircase that led down into darkness. Trepidation flicked through me and I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI will lead if you\u2019d like,\u201d Azriel said softly.</p><p>I frowned as I glanced over my shoulder and met his gaze. \u201cYou can see in that ink?\u201d</p><p>He withdrew Valdis. Her fire flickered across the dull concrete walls and danced through the darkness. \u201cI will sense more than see if anyone nears.\u201d</p><p>I stepped to one side and waved him through. No one could ever accuse me of letting valor get the better of sanity\u2014at least not when it came to stepping into dark vampire pits.</p><p>He moved into the stairwell, his steps barely audible on the concrete. I followed, keeping close, my fingers itching with the need to reach out and touch him\u2014to keep a physical connection between us as the door silently closed and the shadows pressed close.</p><p>The walk down seemed to take forever, but in reality it was only a few minutes before the stairs gave way to a long corridor. The air here was cool and musty, and surprisingly free of the scent of vampire. Black tiles lined the walls and the floor was covered by a dark red rubber matting that swallowed all sound.</p><p>Valdis\u2019s bright flame lifted the darkness, revealing the doorway at the far end of the corridor. It was metal and extremely solid. Not something that would be broken down in any great hurry.</p><p>I glanced behind me, wondering if our astral-traveling Cazador was still following us.</p><p>No, Azriel said. He awaits on the street.</p><p>Wonder why?</p><p>Azriel shrugged. Maybe Hunter fears that one of the vampires in this place will sense him and give warning.</p><p>Maybe. And it was good to know that we weren\u2019t going to be shadowed absolutely everywhere.</p><p>The door opened as we approached. The room beyond was small and somewhat intimate in its feel. While the black and red theme continued here, electric wall sconces gave the room a muted warmth and the combination of blackwood furniture and well-padded sofas lent it a feeling of casual elegance. A small desk hugged the right side rear of the room, and behind it sat a woman. Like the room itself, she was black, from the tips of her hair to the leather pumps that were evident underneath the desk.</p><p>\u201cBrett Marshall waits for you in the main room, Ms. Jones,\u201d she said in a smoky sort of voice. \u201cPlease go in.\u201d</p><p>Two doors\u2014which I hadn\u2019t actually noticed until that point\u2014slid silently open at her words, revealing a larger, darker room. The air that wafted out was filled with the aromas of vampire, blood, and hunger. A shiver ran through me as Amaya\u2019s hissing began to filter across the back of my thoughts.</p><p>I glanced at Azriel. How many people are there?</p><p>A dozen vampires, and at least twenty humans. Distaste ran through his thoughts. They are thralls, and yet not.</p><p>I frowned as I walked warily into the darkened room, wondering how someone could be a thrall and yet not. But the question went unanswered. Either Azriel didn\u2019t know or he wasn\u2019t saying.</p><p>The former, he said, voice full of censure. You really need to start trusting me more, Risa.</p><p>I do trust you\u2014to watch my back and keep me alive. What I don\u2019t trust is that you\u2019re ever going to be completely honest with me.</p><p>I have never been dishonest with you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. But you never tell me everything you know, either.</p><p>Sometimes it is better that way.</p><p>And that is why I trust you to keep me safe but not to keep me informed.</p> <p>A shadow loomed in front of us, forming into a long stick of vampire. He had carrot red hair and the eyebrows and beard to match, and his eyes were a merry blue. He smelled faintly of lilac and soap, which was a damn sight more than could be said about the other vampires in the room. It seemed they were upholding Aunt Riley\u2019s pet peeve about certain sections of the vampire community\u2014or the great unwashed, as she tended to call them. They were usually younger in vampire years, although\u2014again according to Aunt Riley\u2014there were a few guardians who apparently had an aversion to cleanliness, too.</p><p>\u201cRisa Jones,\u201d the vampire said, stopping in front of us and holding out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Brett Marshall. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to say the same,\u201d I replied, noticing that his flesh was cool and his grip without real strength. Maybe Hunter hadn\u2019t told him that I was half werewolf, so he was adjusting the handshake accordingly. I had certainly expected someone capable of curtailing any wayward actions of the better part of a dozen vampires to hold more physical strength than what he\u2019d just shown. Maybe Hunter had meant something other than physical strength. \u201cBut that would be a total lie.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. It was a pleasant sound, but sat oddly against the tense, almost needy atmosphere in the room. \u201cI would have questioned your sanity if you\u2019d said anything else.\u201d His gaze flicked over my shoulder. \u201cI see you have brought along a rather impressive guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Azriel,\u201d I said, \u201cand can you blame me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly not. Please, follow me.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked down some steps. The darkness seemed even deeper here, a blanket that was lifted only by the flickering of Valdis\u2019s fire. It was hard to see anything, but I could smell booze and blood under the stink of vampire. Another shiver ran down my spine and my pulse rate jumped a little\u2014never a good thing in a room filled with needy vampires.</p><p>I followed Marshall across the room. Tables and chairs gradually became visible as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, but the vampires remained curiously out of sight. They had to be shadowing, because the scent that surrounded us indicated that some of them were quite close.</p><p>Marshall opened a door at the far end of the room, and faint amber light fanned out across the nearby shadows, briefly lifting them. To the right of the door stood a vampire who was little more than skin and bones. His face was gaunt\u2014sunken-cheeked and pop-eyed\u2014and he reminded me very much of someone on the edge of starvation. But given the underlying aroma of blood in the room, that surely could not be the case.</p><p>I stepped into the room and looked around. Like the foyer, it was comfortably furnished, with an office set up at one end and a sofa and chairs at the other. A percolator burbled away in one corner, the rich aroma thankfully overwhelming the smells coming in from the larger room.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Marshall said, \u201chelp yourself to coffee.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced at the percolator, but\u2014mindful of my somewhat uneasy stomach\u2014opted not to take him up on his offer. I perched on the edge of one of the chairs instead. Azriel stopped behind me, the heat of his presence swirling around me, a blanket I wanted to wrap close to chase away the increasing sense of trepidation. And I wasn\u2019t sure whether it was this place, Hunter\u2019s warning, or something I sensed but had yet to uncover.</p><p>Marshall walked past us and took a seat on the sofa opposite us, one arm stretched across the back of it. If he was worried about the deaths linked to his club, he wasn\u2019t showing it.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me,\u201d he said pleasantly, \u201cwhy you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI have more experience roaming the gray fields, so Hunter thinks I may spot something the Cazadors would miss.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd did Hunter give you the nanowire you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t felt him attempting to read my mind, but then, with the best telepaths, you didn\u2019t. \u201cNo. That\u2019s something I thought might be handy considering who I\u2019m often dealing with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not one I\u2019ve come across before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not actually on the market yet.\u201d I\u2019d gotten it from Tao\u2019s cousin, Stane, who had some very well-placed fingers in the black-market pie. \u201cI haven\u2019t come here to discuss nano implants. Hunter tells me the five victims were all regulars of your club.\u201d</p> <p>He crossed his legs and plucked at lint on his pants\u2014a gesture that reminded me oddly of Hunter. \u201cThey were. Although Jack Mayberry was a recent inductee.\u201d</p><p>I wondered which victim Mayberry was. Hunter hadn\u2019t exactly been forthcoming with their names. \u201cInductee?\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a moment, then said, \u201cWhat has Hunter told you about this club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that it caters to a particular type of clientele, and that it would be extremely dangerous for me to be here after dark.\u201d</p><p>He half smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s typical that she would send you here expecting results without fully explaining the true purpose of the club.\u201d</p><p>That sense of unease grew. In the back of my mind, Amaya\u2019s hissing increased, a dark and edgy sound filled with a sense of expectation. She wanted to fight, to rent and tear, and though she really didn\u2019t care who or what, her anger seemed to be centering on Marshall. A chill ran through me\u2014not because of the longing in her song, but because I was beginning to understand it.</p><p>I leaned back in the chair and crossed my legs, trying to appear relaxed. The faint lines of amusement crinkling the corners of Marshall\u2019s eyes suggested I wasn\u2019t succeeding. \u201cShe probably expected you to fill me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d He paused, as if considering his words carefully. \u201cWhat do you know of blood whores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual stuff\u2014that it\u2019s a term for a human who is addicted to the pleasures of a vampire\u2019s bite.\u201d</p><p>It was apparently such a problem when I was young that it was treated the same as any other addictive substance. The government introduced strict new laws geared toward controlling the number and type of establishments catering to blood whores, ran a series of media campaigns advising consumers of the dangers, and set up recovery programs. Whores still existed, just as junkies still existed, but the problem was at nowhere near the plague proportions that it had once threatened to become. Or so the media and the government would have us believe. Personally, I wasn\u2019t so convinced\u2014especially after walking into this place and smelling humans.</p><p>Marshall nodded and said, \u201cWhat few people know about the blood whores is that they are not only addicted but addictive.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, not sure what he meant. He obviously sensed this, because he grimaced and then continued. \u201cWhores who are constantly fed from remain in an almost continuous state of ecstasy. It gives their blood a\u201d\u2014he paused, obviously searching for the right words\u2014\u201cricher, heavier flavor. And that, in turn, can become very addictive to those who were of that nature before they were turned.\u201d</p><p>The chill in my stomach grew. \u201cSo clubs like this cater to the needs of the blood whore\u2013addicted vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do. We have to. If an addicted vamp is without a food source for too long, he can become extremely dangerous. And that, I\u2019m afraid, would be bad news for humanity.\u201d</p><p>And for vampires in general if humanity got wind of it. Vampires might have been a part of society for a long time now, but there were still pockets of humanity who viewed them with great suspicion. Knowing it was possible for vamps to become addicted\u2014and violent if that addiction wasn\u2019t fed\u2014would only fan the flames of that suspicion and make it spread.</p><p>\u201cI would have thought it\u2019d be illegal for clubs like this to use what are basically drugged-up humans as a constant food source.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt is. But where there is a need, a way will always be found. The whores are here willingly. They are well fed, in well-maintained, generous-sized accommodations, and on rotation, so that they are never overdosed on sensation.\u201d</p><p>But also never allowed to experience life outside these walls, by the sound of it. I wondered where in the hell the families of the whores were. Or had they simply given up, knowing that the addiction was so strong it was something they could never cure?</p><p>\u201cSo, slaves,\u201d I muttered, not quite able to keep the distaste out of my voice.</p><p>He shrugged again. \u201cThey are not slaves, because slaves, by definition, are owned, and have no right to freedom or property.\u201d</p><p>But they were slaves to their addiction\u2014an addiction that the vampires were readily fueling in order to cater to their own addicted. It was an almost incestuous relationship, one addiction feeding the other, a wheel in constant motion that no one could escape.</p><p>You are not here to judge, Azriel reminded me softly. And the sooner you question him about the dead, the sooner we can be gone from this place.</p><p>Good point. \u201cCould one of the blood whores be a connection point between the men who died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We thought of that possibility\u2014that perhaps someone close to a whore might be taking a bit of retaliatory action\u2014but the five men had different tastes when it came to their preferred source.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cAnd there was no obvious connection between the men themselves?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNone that we could uncover.\u201d</p><p>Which meant I was totally out of ideas. Some investigator I was. I hesitated, then asked, \u201cWhere do the feeds happen? Out in the main bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Watching another vampire feed can be an erotic experience, especially for one of the addicted. We keep the feedings in one-on-one soundproofed rooms. There is less chance of a frenzy being created that way.\u201d</p><p>And that, I thought with a chill, was his first real lie. There was too much desperation\u2014and the scent of blood was too strong\u2014in this place for the feedings to be entirely separated.</p><p>\u201cWhere are these rooms?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDownstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the whores\u2019 living quarters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso downstairs, but on a separate level.\u201d</p> <p>Living underground, never to see the light of day or breathe fresh air. It was a hell of a high price to pay for ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cCan we see the feeding rooms? And talk to a couple of the whores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But they have already been interviewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Hunter sent me here to do it all again.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAnd if one values life, one does not go against Hunter\u2019s orders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>He rose and headed for the door. I followed, Azriel at my back. As we headed left across the club floor, I noted that the scent of vampire and need seemed thicker than before. I edged a little closer to Marshall and said, \u201cWhat time does this place start getting busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually not until the sun sets. Most of our clients are lower-rung vampires and, as such, cannot handle much sunlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are there more vampires in here now than before?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. His expression was curious. Wary. \u201cAnd how can you tell that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolves tend to have sensitive noses.\u201d</p> <p>He said \u201cAh\u201d in a way that suggested he hadn\u2019t known I was part wolf. Which was unusual, because vamps usually had no trouble differentiating between a human and a were. But then, I was only half were, so maybe that was screwing with his internal radar. Especially if he didn\u2019t have a great deal to do with werewolves in the first place.</p><p>He went through another door\u2014one that led into a small foyer containing two elevators\u2014before he answered the actual question. \u201cThe feeding rooms are flushed out after every session. The vampires within return to the bar when this happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlushed out?\u201d</p><p>He punched the DOWN button. \u201cCleaned and fumigated. If you are a wolf, you would have smelled the state of some of our customers. We may cater to the less fortunate among the vampire ranks, but that does not mean we can let our standards slip.\u201d</p><p>And I was betting that the flushing had little to do with disease and pest control, and more to do with literal flushing. As in, the feedings often got a little more messy than what he was admitting.</p><p>The elevator doors opened with a soft ping, revealing a dark wood interior and minimal light. It was only thanks to the fact that Azriel remained steadfastly at my back that I walked inside it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you down to the whores\u2019 quarters first. By the time you\u2019ve finished there, the cleanup will be done and you can look through the feeding rooms.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, although I wasn\u2019t looking forward to either prospect. The doors closed and the elevator ground into action. As I watched the numbers tick slowly down, I asked, \u201cHow many whores are there currently living here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe keep a stock of about twenty in the rooms at all times.\u201d</p><p>Stock. It was a word that suggested the whores were little more than cattle to these vampires. My anger swirled. No wonder Hunter wanted this kept hushed up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought that would be a sufficient number for a club this size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. We rotate them every couple of days. We have about one hundred whores in all.\u201d</p><p>That was a hell of a lot of whores, especially when this was not the only club catering to addicted vampires. Surely it wasn\u2019t possible for that many whores to go missing and absolutely no one notice? \u201cSo where do you send them once they\u2019ve finished their shifts here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as the elevator came to a bouncing stop on level six and the doors opened. The smell of humanity and hopelessness was so strong, my stomach began to churn.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re taken to the recovery wards.\u201d</p><p>The color scheme in the hall was back to the black and red of the entrance, although the matting underfoot was thicker, and oddly spongy. I half expected water to come oozing out of it every time I took a step. Or something worse.</p><p>I crossed my arms and shoved my imagination back into its box. \u201cI take it the recovery rooms are not in this building?\u201d</p><p>Marshall glanced over his shoulder again. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that I can\u2019t smell a great mass of humans.\u201d And the fact that Azriel had sensed only twenty of them.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Marshall said. Obviously I was guessing a whole lot more than he\u2019d wanted me to. \u201cNo, they are not. But they can be accessed from various levels here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccessed how?\u201d</p><p>He stopped at a gated doorway and punched in a code. \u201cVia tunnels. As I said earlier, we have no wish for humanity at large to know about the existence of these clubs.\u201d</p><p>The doorway opened, revealing another long corridor. Doors lined either side, the spacing between each suggesting the rooms weren\u2019t all that large. Maybe prison-cell size, if that. And I wouldn\u2019t have called that well-maintained, generous accommodations.</p><p>He stopped at the first doorway and said, \u201cHow about we start here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we don\u2019t,\u201d I said, not trusting that Marshall hadn\u2019t prepared the whore within to be questioned before we\u2019d arrived. I pointed to one of the doors farther down on the opposite side. \u201cLet\u2019s try that one instead.\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in his eyes. Annoyance, or something darker. Either way, it again reminded me of Hunter. I half wondered if there was more of a connection between them than just being friends. \u201cIt does not matter which\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it won\u2019t matter if I prefer the person behind door number seven.\u201d</p><p>He studied me for several seconds, his face impassive even though the air suddenly seemed filled with tension. Enough so that Valdis\u2019s fire began casting fiery blue shadows across the dark walls again. Then he shrugged and walked over to the indicated door, punching in several numbers.</p><p>As the door swished open, he turned to face me again. \u201cI suppose you\u2019d like me to remain outside, also?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually, I would.\u201d I hesitated, nostrils flaring, smelling soap, woman, and need. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda.\u201d</p><p>No last name. But then, that was to be expected given that these people were being treated as little more than cattle. I guess they had to be thankful that they got a name rather than just a number.</p><p>I stepped into the room. The walls, floor, and bedding were all a soft green\u2014a color that was renowned for enhancing the feeling of tranquillity and calm. The only splashes of color came in the form of a white bedside table and a bookcase filled with old books. There was no TV, no radio\u2014in fact, nothing that would give this woman access to what was happening in the world beyond her cell.</p><p>As the door swished shut behind us, my gaze met Amanda\u2019s. She was a generously built woman with thick brown hair, ruddy cheeks, and several chins. Marshall might not be giving his whores access to the outside world, but he obviously provided a bountiful table\u2014which I guess made sense, considering how often the whores were fed from.</p><p>She was clothed in a checked cotton dress and lying on the bed, a book in one hand and a Coke sitting on the bedside table. Her eyes\u2014which were an odd shade of green-gray\u2014showed little in the way of interest.</p><p>\u201cAmanda?\u201d I spoke softly, though I wasn\u2019t sure why. Marshall might not be able to hear me, but I had no doubt he was monitoring our every move, even if I couldn\u2019t see any cameras. \u201cI\u2019m Risa Jones. I need to ask you a few questions.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, just returned her attention to her book. Obviously it was more interesting than I was. I glanced at it briefly. A romance\u2014one I\u2019d read and enjoyed.</p><p>I walked across the room\u2014it took only three steps\u2014and squatted beside the bed. \u201cHow long have you been here, Amanda?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and continued reading.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever experienced any problems when you feed the vampires? Or witnessed such events?\u201d</p><p>This time she didn\u2019t even bother shrugging. Maybe I should have questioned the whore Marshall had been pointing me toward. Maybe he\u2019d simply picked a more talkative one.</p><p>I made a frustrated sound and glanced at Azriel as he squatted beside me. \u201cWell, this was a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me try,\u201d he said, and lightly touched two fingers to Amanda\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Her face went slack. Azriel closed his eyes and, for several minutes, there was little noise other than the sound of both my and Amanda\u2019s breathing.</p><p>Then Azriel opened his eyes again. She cannot answer you, he said, his mind voice grim. Because she does not know.</p><p>How can she not know the answer to such basic questions? I asked, confused. I mean, even if Marshall has placed some sort of restriction on her ability to speak about her experiences here, it\u2019d be right there in her memories, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>It should be, but it\u2019s not.</p><p>My gaze went to Amanda. So her memories have been cleansed?</p><p>Recent memories, yes. The touch is deft, but it was nevertheless there. It has Marshall\u2019s taint.</p><p>His use of the word \u201ctaint\u201d suggested he had no liking for Marshall, even if he showed no hint of it in any other way. What about her past? Has that been erased, as well?</p><p>He frowned, glancing at her. Valdis flickered with an odd purple-red fire. I wondered if it was anger or distaste.</p><p>Anger, Azriel said, and the woman\u2019s past has not been erased. It simply does not exist.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. How can her past not have been erased if she has no memory of it?</p><p>That I do not know. He rose and held out a hand. But you will get no answers from her, because she has none.</p><p>I placed my hand in his and let him pull me upright. He didn\u2019t release me immediately and I can\u2019t say I was upset about that. Something strange goes on here.</p><p>Which was definitely an understatement. Do you think it\u2019s worth attempting to talk to any of the others?</p><p>He shrugged. We could try. I suspect the result would be the same.</p><p>So did I. Still, we had to try, if only to tell Hunter that we had. I pulled my hand from his, but curled my fingers to retain the heat of his touch a little bit longer as I walked across to the door and knocked on it. It opened immediately. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Marshall said, \u201cfind out anything useful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew we wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I paused. \u201cHow long have you been erasing their memories? And why are you doing it?\u201d</p><p>Again that oddly familiar darkness stirred in his eyes. \u201cIt is not common practice.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAlthough most of our current stock have experienced it at one time or another. I\u2019m afraid it is easier to treat physical wounds than mental ones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you simply erase the memory of the physical trauma and push them back into the feeding pen?\u201d I kept the anger out of my voice, but only barely.</p><p>Azriel rested his hand in the middle of my back. Energy flowed from it, somehow calming me.</p><p>\u201cThese people are junkies. They will do anything\u2014agree to anything\u2014in order to get their next fix. What we do, we do with consent.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t believing that. Not after what I\u2019d seen in the room behind us. How could anyone who had no real idea what was going on from one hour to the next consent to anything? I glanced down the hall. \u201cCan we talk to the person in the room second from the end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want,\u201d Marshall said.</p> <p>Meaning we wouldn\u2019t find anything different. And we didn\u2019t. Like Amanda, the thickset man in room eighteen\u2014who, oddly, possessed the same green-gray eyes as Amanda but otherwise looked nothing like her\u2014had no immediate or past memories. Although he did have a games console rather than books.</p><p>Marshall glanced at his watch as we came back out. \u201cThe feeding rooms will be available if you\u2019d like to view them now.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, although I seriously doubted we\u2019d find anything of interest there, either. We headed back to the elevators and up two levels. As the doors opened, the scent of antiseptic hit and my stomach began to churn again.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I said, blocking my nostrils with my hand but not really succeeding in blocking the smell. It clung to the back of my throat and burned into my lungs. \u201cHow bad do things get here that you have to wash the rooms down so completely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not that bad,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cYou just have an overly sensitive nose.\u201d</p><p>That might be true, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that the smell was hideously strong. He stepped out of the elevator and motioned to the long corridor before us. It was basically the same size and length as the one below, although the red and black color scheme had been replaced by basic metal walls, ceiling, and floors. Easier to wash down, I guessed.</p> <p>\u201cAll the rooms are the same size and shape,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to inspect them all, or would you rather have a random viewing?\u201d</p><p>I studied the closed metal doors ahead. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what I was hoping to find, and I was more than a little convinced that I\u2019d actually find nothing. But my sense of trepidation was increasing, and I knew from long experience that generally meant my psychic radar had picked something up. Whether there actually was something here that would help our quest, or what I sensed was nothing more than extreme distaste over what happened here, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure. Yet.</p><p>I glanced at Marshall. \u201cRight now, I just need to walk down the corridor and get a feel for the place.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, but waved a hand to indicate I should go right ahead. With Azriel as my shadow, I walked slowly down the center of the hall, my footsteps echoing across the silence as I studied the rooms on either side. My senses\u2014psychic and not\u2014were on high alert, trying to find something\u2014anything\u2014out of the ordinary. Or rather, out of the ordinary for a place that catered to whore-addicted vampires.</p><p>There is much pain and sorrow in this place, Azriel commented as we passed the third set of doors. And much anger.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine that being so addicted to pleasure that you\u2019d allow yourself to be treated like cattle would be a happy situation to find yourself in, I replied.</p><p>The whores have no memories, past or present, he said softly. What I sense does not come from the living who serve in these rooms.</p><p>We walked by the fourth set of doors, and something teased the edges of my awareness. It was a sensation of something not quite right. Something that existed in this world and yet not.</p> <p>I frowned, my gaze searching the doorways ahead before settling on one that was set slightly apart from the others. Whatever it was, it was coming from there.</p><p>I stopped and half turned to look back at Marshall. \u201cWhat\u2019s that room down at the end? The one that\u2019s separated from the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust another feeding room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it not in line with the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bigger, that\u2019s all.\u201d He shrugged, like it wasn\u2019t important, but I had an odd sense that it was.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it bigger?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and I knew that if I\u2019d been closer, I would have seen that flash of darkness in his eyes again. \u201cSometimes our clients prefer joint feedings.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI thought you said that vampires watching each other feed can get dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him as the realization of what was happening in that room sank in. That\u2019s why the antiseptic was so strong. They were cleaning, all right, only it wasn\u2019t for the dirt, blood, and bugs that might come off their clients. It was the bloody remnants of humanity they were washing away.</p><p>I turned my back on him, my fists clenched against the sudden rise of anger. I hated what this place was doing to people. Hated that I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Because of Hunter, because of the threat she represented\u2014not just to me but to all those I cared for. And even to those I didn\u2019t, like Jak.</p><p>Azriel touched my back again, but this time the surge of warmth failed to calm. I took a deep breath that did just as little, then walked toward that room.</p><p>The closer I got, the more my skin crawled.</p><p>I reached out and gripped the handle. The metal felt cold under my touch. Cold and somehow otherworldly.</p><p>There are ghosts within, Azriel said. Many, many ghosts.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts. I never had been. Until now. I licked my lips and pushed the door open.</p><p>It hit me. Not the ghosts themselves, but rather their anger. The force of it was so strong it thrust me back into Azriel. He grabbed my waist, holding me upright as I battled to breathe against the sheer force of emotion that was battering us.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t ordinary anger. It was murderous.</p><p>These ghosts were angry enough to kill.</p><p>And maybe even had.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I muttered, staring into the room with wide eyes. The ghosts were filmy wisps, but there were so many of them that their presence made the room appear fog-bound. \u201cCan you feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are not pleased about something,\u201d Azriel agreed. His body was pressed against mine, an oddly comforting sensation.</p><p>\u201cThat is an understatement,\u201d I muttered, knowing I should move and yet reluctant to do so. He didn\u2019t seem inclined to move, either. \u201cCan ghosts actually muster the energy to kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. As many as there are here, they would never hold enough power to take one life, let alone five. Besides, the victims were poisoned and then eaten. That is not the behavior of ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts?\u201d Marshall said, suddenly appearing beside us. He\u2019d moved so silently I hadn\u2019t even heard his approach.</p><p>I nodded toward the room. \u201cThere\u2019s at least twenty in there, which suggests to me you\u2019ve been understating what actually goes on in this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t understated anything. The joint feedings are dangerous. I told you that.\u201d He peered into the room. \u201cI can\u2019t see any ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not psychic, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I somewhat reluctantly pulled away from the comfort of Azriel\u2019s support. \u201cDid any of our victims use this room?\u201d</p><p>His gaze met mine. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Which meant this room\u2014and these ghosts\u2014was the connection. But why the depth of anger? I frowned at the swirling, ethereal mass. If I wanted answers, I really had no other option but to go in there and try to talk to them.</p><p>Whether they\u2019d be willing to talk to me was another matter entirely. I wasn\u2019t my mother, and talking to the souls of those who\u2019d refused\u2014or been unable\u2014to move on from this world wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d ever tried before. My strength lay in talking to the souls of those who still lived but were close to the next world\u2014the sick, the dying, the comatose.</p><p>Although Tao\u2019s soul had remained elusive to even me.</p><p>I flexed my fingers, suddenly aware of Amaya\u2019s hissing again. Her energy swarmed down my spine, pinpricks of power that tickled and burned. She wanted in that room. Maybe demons weren\u2019t the only thing she liked to eat.</p><p>I shivered, though I wasn\u2019t sure whether the cause was my sword\u2019s apparently insatiable hunger or the waves of emotion continuing to roll out of the feeding room. I glanced Marshall\u2019s way again. \u201cI want a list of everyone who died in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it for me, or do it for Hunter. Your choice.\u201d And we both knew Hunter wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, so there really wasn\u2019t any choice in the matter. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the dead in here are the connection, but it\u2019s a possibility we need to follow.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, though his expression suggested he was far from happy. Not that I really gave a damn about that. I took a deep, steadying breath, then stepped into the room. The energy of the ghosts crawled across my skin and the air felt like molasses with the intensity of their anger. Amaya\u2019s hissing intensified, and the sound met the fury of the ghosts head-on and countered it. Enough that I could breathe a little more easily, anyway.</p><p>I studied the vaporous forms flitting around me. I could see them, feel them, and if I concentrated hard enough, I could hear them. But it was a very distant thunder, unclear but nevertheless threatening.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeking revenge?\u201d I asked them.</p><p>The rhythm of their murmuring neither increased nor decreased. Either they couldn\u2019t hear me or they were simply ignoring me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frowned, but tried again. \u201cAre you responsible for the deaths of five addicted vampires?\u201d</p><p>Still nothing in the way of any discernible response. Frustrated, I glanced at Azriel, but he merely shrugged. \u201cAs I have said before, I am neither able nor allowed to communicate with the lost ones.\u201d</p><p>Which left us with little more than we\u2019d already had. I glanced around the metal emptiness of the room, trying not to visualize how they\u2019d all died, then spun on my heel and walked out. To say Amaya was unhappy with this was another one of those understatements. And her pissed-off hissing was giving me a damn headache.</p> <p>As the door slammed shut behind me and the sound echoed down the long hall, I said to Marshall, \u201cI suggest you stop using that room. It wouldn\u2019t be wise to introduce any more anger into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned such deaths,\u201d he said. My instinct said it was another lie. \u201cBut even if I had, what the hell do any of us have to fear from ghosts? They\u2019re not likely to be the cause of our current troubles, given that they have no flesh, let alone teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may not be responsible,\u201d Azriel said, before I could reply, \u201cbut the depth of their anger and grief is certainly enough to attract other entities.\u201d</p><p>As Marshall\u2019s gaze swept Azriel, it narrowed a little. Trying to read him, I thought, and knew he\u2019d have more luck trying to read the metal walls around us. After a moment, he must have realized this himself, for he said, \u201cWhat other sorts of entities might we be talking about? Demons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is always possible, given what is going on elsewhere,\u201d Azriel replied. \u201cBut we should not limit our search to just demons. There are spirits more than capable of this type of kill. Wendigos and Rakshasa would be two of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRakshasa? I\u2019ve never heard of them,\u201d Marshall said.</p><p>Neither had I, but I wasn\u2019t about to mention that.</p><p>Azriel glanced at me, amusement briefly creasing the corners of his eyes. \u201cRakshasa are unrighteous spirits\u2014always female\u2014able to take on various physical forms. Like Wendigos, they are malevolent and cannibalistic, and their fingernails are venomous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, both of those certainly fit what\u2019s happened to our victims.\u201d I crossed my arms and tried to ignore the rising sense of dread. I really, really didn\u2019t want to face a spirit that could take on human form and eat me, but I had a growing suspicion that such a confrontation lay in my future. \u201cHow do we go about catching and killing this thing, whatever it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has found the perfect hunting ground in this place,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cIt will be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not exactly a place I can hang around very easily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn flesh form, no,\u201d Azriel agreed. \u201cBut you have other options.\u201d</p><p>Options I wasn\u2019t going to discuss with Marshall earwigging. I glanced at my watch and grimaced. It was nearly four. I had to be at the caf\u00e9 in two hours\u2014so much for my relaxing afternoon. \u201cWe need to check out the home of the last vamp who died before I have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning I can open the feeding rooms now?\u201d Marshall asked.</p><p>I studied him distastefully, wondering why nature had paired an uncaring heart with such a merry countenance. But I guess that could be said about a lot of successful businessmen, and that\u2019s all Marshall was. And the people who had died were nothing more than stock. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, my voice barely civil. \u201cJust not this one.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look pleased, but I guessed if he feared Hunter enough, he\u2019d obey. And if not, he\u2019d open the room again once I left, and bugger the consequences.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>He motioned us toward the elevator. It bounced us up to the lower ground floor and we stepped once more into the stinking morass of needy vampires.</p><p>I crossed my arms and followed Marshall through the darkness. The flickering light of the two swords cast eerie shadows across the gaunt faces of the nearest vampires, and it was all I could do to keep walking at a steady pace.</p> <p>It was a huge relief to reenter the little foyer and watch the double doors close securely behind us.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in contact if we need anything else,\u201d I said, clasping Marshall\u2019s offered hand. This time his grip was much stronger. \u201cWhat was the name of the last victim, by the way?\u201d</p><p>Hunter may have sent me his name and address, but it never hurt to double-check. She liked her games.</p><p>Marshall seemed amused, and I suspected its cause was Hunter\u2019s aversion to information giving. Obviously, he was well acquainted with it. \u201cJake Green. What about the ghosts?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Hunter. She\u2019ll probably know someone who can disperse them for you.\u201d</p><p>Which wouldn\u2019t solve anything if he just kept on creating more of them, but that really wasn\u2019t my problem right now.</p><p>Although it might be in the future.</p><p>Azriel touched a hand lightly to my back, guiding me out the front door and into the black and red hall. Valdis gave me enough light to see by, although her flames still held a tinge of red. Thankfully, Amaya had calmed somewhat, though I think it was going to take hospital-strength painkillers to get rid of the headache she\u2019d given me. To be fair, though, that could just as much have been caused by the situation we\u2019d been in as by her song.</p><p>\u201cWhere to next?\u201d Azriel asked, as he began climbing the steps.</p><p>The street-level door opened as we approached and the sudden rush of sunlight had me blinking back tears. \u201cAccording to Hunter, Jake Green lived about five minutes away, on Little Miller Street. Flat one-twelve. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d I looked around, wondering where the Cazador was.</p><p>\u201cHe awaits near your motorbike,\u201d Azriel said and winked out of existence.</p><p>I grimaced and made my way back to my bike. It was tempting to look around to see if I could pinpoint our shadow\u2019s position, but that might only give the game away. He might be invisible, but I doubted he was dumb. I climbed onto my bike and rode across to Little Miller Street.</p><p>It turned out Green\u2019s flat wasn\u2019t actually a flat, but an old redbrick warehouse that had been turned into accommodations for the homeless. I studied the building for a moment, then turned the bike around and parked farther down the street, near another\u2014cleaner\u2014factory. Maybe I was doing the homeless a great injustice, but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry when it came to my bike. Azriel was waiting out in the front. I opened the somewhat grubby-looking door and stepped into the carpeted foyer. Inside were two people; the woman behind the desk was tall, thin, and blond, and she looked somewhat harassed. The man standing in front of the desk was older, grimier, and smelled of dirt, urine, and booze. And he didn\u2019t sound happy\u2014although it was hard to say since he wasn\u2019t actually speaking English.</p><p>The woman\u2019s gaze landed on us. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose either of you speak German, do you? I only know a couple of phrases.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, but Azriel stepped forward and touched the man on the shoulder. He said something in the same guttural tones that the man was using, got a reply, then turned to the woman. \u201cHis name is Hans Klein and he is seeking accommodation for the night. He has fourteen dollars.\u201d</p><p>As Azriel said this, Hans dumped his money on the counter. It was grubbier than he was. The blonde didn\u2019t bat an eyelid\u2014she was obviously used to it. \u201cCould you explain that he has to fill out these forms? Can he write?\u201d</p><p>Azriel asked, then nodded and said, \u201cWe are here to view room one-twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake Green\u2019s room?\u201d Her gaze came to me. \u201cAre you Risa Jones? If you are, we were told to expect you.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, Hunter had been in contact with her. Either that, or she was psychic. I showed her my driver\u2019s license and, once she\u2019d checked it, she put a key on the desk. \u201cUp the stairs, second to last door on the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I swept up the key and headed for the stairs. The hall above was basic but clean, and I suspected the same would apply to the rooms themselves. But to the homeless, basic was probably like five-star to us. I glanced at Azriel. \u201cHow come you know German?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReapers do not only collect English-speaking souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but isn\u2019t it against the rules for reapers to communicate with the souls they collect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no rule against it, but generally most souls have no desire to speak. However, there are always one or two who like to talk.\u201d His amusement crinkled the corners of his eyes. \u201cYou would be one of them, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I talk too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never suggest anything like that,\u201d he said, the gravity in his voice belied by the twinkle in his eyes, \u201ceven if it is true.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, though the sound died on my lips as the smell of death began to invade the air. I stopped in front of room one-twelve, staring at the police tape that barred our entrance. Even though I wasn\u2019t squeamish, I really didn\u2019t want to go in there. I\u2019d been in the presence of death far too much today.</p><p>\u201cI can view it alone, if you prefer,\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThe Directorate sets up mobile recording units at crime scenes. Hunter will know if I don\u2019t go in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is not a Directorate investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot officially, but that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t follow protocol when it comes to keeping a record of everything\u2014and everyone\u2014that goes in or out of that room.\u201d Even if no one else ever saw the recordings.</p><p>I opened the door, then ducked under the tape. A soft whirring greeted my appearance, and I looked up to see the black, oval-shaped recording device hovering about a foot or so above our heads. I gave it a cheery wave, showed it my driver\u2019s license, then turned my attention to the room.</p><p>And I really wished I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>The room itself was basic\u2014a bed, a dresser, an old TV, and a small bathroom that contained all the necessary facilities\u2014shower, basin, and toilet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the walls were smeared with dried blood, and there were recent stains on the brown carpet\u2014stains that hinted at human body parts. One was in the shape of a leg, another a foot, then part of an arm, and god knows what else. Thankfully, all the bits had been gathered up and, from the smell, now lay under plastic sheeting on the bed. Oddly enough, I couldn\u2019t smell putrefaction, just death and aged meat. Maybe vampires didn\u2019t rot like the rest of us when they died.</p><p>What I couldn\u2019t sense was Green\u2019s ghost. Maybe this death had been ordained, which meant a reaper had been here at the time of his death to guide his soul onward. I glanced at Azriel and he nodded in confirmation.</p><p>\u201cAnd unfortunately, too much time has lapsed since his death for there to be any lingering sense of the creature who caused it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it is a spirit rather than a demon, would you still have been able to sense it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019d been early enough, yes.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was something of a relief, if only because it meant that if this thing decided to attack us, he\u2019d sense its approach before it actually got to us. My gaze fell on the black plastic mound and my stomach turned. As much as I didn\u2019t want to look at the remnants of Jake Green, I knew that I had to. Because of Hunter, and because I needed to see if there was anything that might give us a clue as to what had done this. Hunter may have had guardians in here and might already know the answer to that particular question\u2014especially if this was just another test to prove my worth\u2014but that only meant it was more important than ever that I do whatever I needed to do to see an end to this case.</p><p>I stepped closer and tried not to breathe too deeply. Jake Green might not be rotting, but he was still dead, and that was never a pleasant thing, not even at the best of times. I reached back for Amaya and carefully slid her point under the nearest edge of plastic. She spat yellow sparks that suggested her distaste was as great as mine, but thankfully she didn\u2019t set anything alight.</p><p>I folded back the plastic. Jake Green was little more than a mound of parts. One leg, several arm parts, bits of bone and torso and trailing innards, and finally, his head. Thankfully, that was facing away from me. I had no desire to move around to check it out.</p> <p>\u201cGod,\u201d I muttered, revulsion giving my voice a harsher edge. \u201cThis thing didn\u2019t just eat him. It tore him apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe state of the body does suggest there was a feeding frenzy.\u201d Azriel moved around me to squat in front of the head. \u201cWhich is not the usual modus operandi for a Wendigo.\u201d</p><p>I sheathed Amaya, then rubbed my arms, trying to chase away the gathering chill. \u201cWhat about a Rakshasa?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI do not know enough about them to confirm or deny the probability. But given the anger of the ghosts, it is always possible that the creature who did this is merely echoing how the whores all died in that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they did die in a vampire feeding frenzy?\u201d</p><p>His gaze met mine. \u201cYou know they did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I suspected they did. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you often say to me, only by a matter of degrees.\u201d He reached out and pressed his fingers on either side of the severed head.</p><p>\u201cOh god,\u201d I said, the revulsion curling through me suddenly getting stronger. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to try to capture his last memories, are you?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, one eyebrow raised. \u201cYou have seen me do this before. Why the distaste now?\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand at the remnants. \u201cBecause of this\u2014the way he died. I really don\u2019t want to see it in all its gory detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do not look.\u201d His gaze flicked past me, and I knew without looking that he was studying the recording device that hovered just above my right shoulder. He added silently, I do this for you\u2014to help solve this case quickly so that we can get back to more urgent matters\u2014rather than possessing any real interest in knowing the details of this death.</p><p>The problem is, the more urgent matter is at a standstill until my father contacts me or Jak comes up with something.</p><p>Which does not alter the need to get this task over with just in case either event happens.</p> <p>I acknowledged the truth of this with a half shrug, and he returned his attention to Green\u2019s head. Valdis\u2019s sides began to run with blue fire as Azriel closed his eyes. Energy surged, sharp and almost bitter in the small room, and in the space between Azriel\u2019s hands pictures began to flow\u2014flickering images that didn\u2019t move quite fast enough to blur\u2014meaning the gist of his death, all the blood and gore and body bits flying, was there to see in living color.</p><p>I bit my lip, swallowing heavily against the bile that rose in my throat. When the images finally died, I sighed in silent relief. Azriel removed his hands but didn\u2019t immediately get up. He bowed his head for a moment and spoke, the words musical and oddly captivating. Saying a prayer for the soul that had already moved on.</p><p>Finally, he rose. \u201cIt is definitely a Rakshasa, and that really is not good news.\u201d</p><p>Considering the way fate had been treating us of late, it wasn\u2019t like I was expecting good news. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as shape-shifters, they are notoriously hard to track down and even more difficult to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous.\u201d Not. What about Valdis and Amaya? I added silently, not wanting Hunter to know about the swords.</p><p>In theory, demons and spirits are of a similar nature, he said. If the swords can destroy one, they should be able to destroy the other.</p><p>But you\u2019ve never had reason to test it?</p><p>Spirits are of this world, and therefore generally not the concern of Mijai.</p><p>What if they venture onto the fields between the worlds?</p><p>Then maybe. But they rarely do and, even then, it is only ever onto the paene.</p><p>Which was the shadowy divide between this world and the next. \u201cSo is there anything that kills them for sure?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cMost dark spirits are dispelled by sunlight, which is why they hunt by night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning we have to capture the fucking thing before we can kill it? How the hell are we going to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite ash and silver hold dangerous energies to the spirit kind. It might be possible to cage the Rakshasa with either until the morning comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m part were. I can\u2019t handle silver without it burning me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite ash, then.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. It\u2019d be my luck that white ash would do jack squat and I\u2019d be left wishing I had silver. I studied the body for a moment, then frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t get. I can understand the Rakshasa going after the vampires who caused the deaths of those in the large feeding room, but why now? These deaths have been happening for years.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that because I do not know enough about the Rakshasa. But it is possible the anger and need for revenge were not strong enough to be a serious draw to dark energies until now.\u201d</p><p>An unsettling thought stirred. I studied him for a moment, then said, \u201cSo does that mean you and I could be serious draws for darker energies? I mean, you\u2019ve tasted revenge, and I\u2019m currently chasing it.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cDarker energies, no. Darker fates, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>Trepidation tripped through me. \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning, my fate was decided the moment I was assigned this task. Yours, however, is not so clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought your becoming a Mijai was the end result of your revenge. Are you suggesting there\u2019s more to it?\u201d</p><p>Again he hesitated. \u201cI will never be as I was, thanks to my actions on this plane.\u201d</p><p>For some odd reason, I had the feeling he was talking about a future action rather than a past one, but his expression\u2014or lack of it\u2014told me I wasn\u2019t about to get any more information out of him.</p><p>\u201cThen why is my fate so unclear? And does it mean I might or might not be punished, even if I do get my revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I do not always have the answers you need. This is one of those times, simply because there are still too many variables.\u201d</p><p>And that, I thought, might not have been a lie, but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth, either. He knew far more than he was letting on when it came to my fate.</p><p>Something flickered in his eyes\u2014surprise or acknowledgment; I wasn\u2019t sure which. It was frustrating, to say the least, but it was also pointless to challenge him. He\u2019d tell me more when he was ready, not before.</p><p>I sighed and glanced at my watch. If I didn\u2019t leave soon, I\u2019d be late for work. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else we can do here.\u201d</p><p>I said it more for the benefit of the hovering crime scene recorder than Azriel, but he nodded anyway. \u201cYou go to work now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I studied him for a moment. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I will use the time to research the Rakshasa.\u201d</p><p>And leave me unguarded? Interesting, given the attack only this morning.</p><p>I do not\u2014would not\u2014leave you unguarded. I will simply request help with this matter. He walked around the bed and touched a hand to my elbow, lightly guiding me to the door. This distrust of yours grows old, Risa.</p><p>I guess it would, but I just couldn\u2019t help it. We both knew that no matter what he said or did, in the end, his mission was the only thing that mattered. Right now, that mission and I were intimately connected, but if something happened to alter that situation, then I\u2019d more than likely find myself unguarded and alone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything to that, even though he would have heard the thought as clearly as if I\u2019d said it out loud. Maybe, despite all his declarations, he knew it to be the ultimate truth.</p><p>I returned the key, then headed back down the street to my bike. The ride to work cleared my head a little, as did getting lost in the mad rush of food and alcohol service that the next eight hours at the caf\u00e9 brought. Business was still booming, and if it continued at this rate, we were going to have lines of people waiting to get in that rivaled anything the Blue Moon\u2014which was only several doors up the road\u2014had. Which was amazing, considering the Blue Moon was one of the most popular wolf clubs in Melbourne, and we were only one of many caf\u00e9s catering to the hungry hordes that spilled over from it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The night went by fast, and once the next shift had rolled in and the changeover was completed, I counted the takings, then ran upstairs to have a shower, washing the grime of the shift and the lingering smell of ghostly deaths\u2014a smell that was in my mind rather than on my skin\u2014away.</p><p>It was nearly four by the time I got home and I barely had the energy to even strip. I was fast asleep almost as soon as my head hit the pillow.</p><p>The play of fingertips across my bare back stirred me hours later. I murmured sleepily, not ready to wake yet. The gentle caress paused, as if waiting for sleep to claim me again. Dream, I thought wistfully. Only the dream smelled of lemongrass, suede, and musky, powerful male. I smiled. Lucian.</p> <p>The play of fingertips began again, sweeping slowly down my spine, the movements teasing, erotic. I became aware of his weight resting gently on my legs, of the heat of desire that swam all around me. The force of it burned my skin.</p><p>His big hands briefly cupped my butt and pressed my cheeks together. He kissed each one, the touch so light I barely felt it, yet it sent a tremor that was all anticipation shooting through my core. His touch moved on, down to my thighs, then slowly between them, until his fingers slid through waking slickness and found my clit.</p><p>A moan escaped and he chuckled softly. \u201cIt seems my plan to take you when you sleep isn\u2019t quite going as I\u2019d envisioned.\u201d</p><p>He continued to stroke me, sending little shudders of pleasure skating through me, making it difficult to think, let alone talk. I licked my lips and croaked, \u201cAnd what fun is there to be had in loving an unresponsive body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, none at all.\u201d He pressed two of his fingers into me, sliding them in and out. I shuddered and raised my butt a little, allowing him greater access. He chuckled again, but his movements remained deliberate and painstakingly slow. \u201cThe fun comes with wakefulness, in feeling your surprise when\u2014a heartbeat before your orgasm hits you\u2014you realize that I\u2019ve been fucking you senseless.\u201d</p> <p>His words had my pulse racing. God, I wanted that. All of that. Now. \u201cI\u2019m a wolf,\u201d I said, my voice becoming more than a little breathless as those shudders of pleasure got ever stronger. \u201cI\u2019m always going to wake way before either of those moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve sadly discovered. It does not, however, alter my plan.\u201d</p><p>And of that, I was glad. \u201cTrouble is, all I\u2019m feeling is finger fucking. When does the real action start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cAlways impatient.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he pulled my hips upward into doggie position and slowly thrust into me. I moaned as my body clenched around him, wanting his heat deeper, wanting him to go faster. He did neither, keeping the rhythm of his movements slow and steady, even though I could feel the tremble of desire that rode him where our flesh connected.</p><p>Then, with a suddenness that made me growl in frustration, that connection was gone. He chuckled again. \u201cPatience, little wolf, patience.\u201d</p> <p>He shifted his position, then flipped me over onto my back. Before I could even squawk a protest, his body was pressed against my length and his lips were claiming mine. And this was no ordinary kiss\u2014the kiss of an Aedh is like no other. It\u2019s designed to enthrall, to not only captivate but sweep aside all objections and allow the Aedh to bed and impregnate the woman of his choice. Aedh usually did this only when they were nearing the end of their life span, and with human females only when they could find no female Aedh to mate with. Their lovemaking never actually lived up to the power and magic of their kiss, but it was still pretty damn fine.</p><p>Of course, Lucian was no ordinary Aedh. Not only had his wings been ripped off as punishment for murder\u2014he\u2019d taken revenge against the man who\u2019d killed his half sister\u2014but he\u2019d been confined to human form for many, many centuries. In that time, he\u2019d come to appreciate some of the finer aspects of holding human form, and making love was definitely one of them. To say he had an insatiable need to indulge in the pastime without impregnating his partner was something of an understatement.</p><p>Just as saying he was kissing me senseless was something of an understatement. He kissed me until my head spun and desire became a burn that would surely consume me if it wasn\u2019t quenched. Then he released me and moved down my neck, the butterfly kisses he trailed along my skin making me tremble and groan. He kissed both breasts, then closed his mouth over one, alternating between sucking and swirling his tongue around the edge of the areola as he pinched and squeezed the other. My fingers clenched the bedsheets, and it was all I could do not to scream against the force of the sensations crashing through me.</p><p>As the shudders of pleasure assaulting my body threatened to become a quake, he continued his journey downward, kissing my stomach and belly button.</p><p>Then he reached my lower lips and began to slowly trace the edges, tantalizing me with possibilities. My breath hitched as his tongue passed briefly over my clit, but he moved on quickly. Too quickly. I moaned, and he laughed softly, his breath a teasing coolness that felt almost as good as his tongue\u2019s caress.</p><p>He explored further, each thrust of his tongue delving deeper. It was an intimate yet gentle assault that left me delirious with pleasure, and I was torn between wanting it to go on and on yet not sure I could actually stand such torture for too much longer.</p><p>Then his tongue swirled around my clit again. I screamed as my body bucked and my orgasm crashed through me with a suddenness and intensity that left me trembling but still wanting more. Of him. All of him.</p><p>I grabbed his arms and swiftly switched our positions, straddling him quickly and thrusting him deep inside.</p> <p>His hands moved to either side of my hips, holding me steady and still. \u201cWolves,\u201d he said, the disappointment in his expression somewhat destroyed by the mirth so evident in his powerful, jade green eyes. \u201cNo stamina whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I said, more than a little amused. \u201cI somehow doubt you\u2019d last long under a similar assault of pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. You forget I\u2019ve had centuries to practice restraint and delay pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I raised a somewhat mocking eyebrow. \u201cShall we test that theory out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll thoroughly enjoy such an experiment, but do be prepared to fail, my dear.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy watching you beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell will freeze over before that happens.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and began to rock back and forth, riding him gently, enjoying the feel of his flesh so deep inside and the sensations that flowed from such an intimate and basic connection. Slowly but surely our movements became stronger and his thrusts more urgent, but as the point of no return approached, I withdrew, coming down on all fours, straddling him as I claimed his lips and kissed him long and hard. A dangerous play, given just what his kiss could do to me, but right then, the need to prove he could be made as delirious and needy by our lovemaking as I was just that little bit stronger.</p><p>When that sense of urgency finally eased, I repeated the process, riding him until desire and the need for release began throbbing through his flesh and mine. Once more I retreated, and this time he groaned, just as I\u2019d groaned. But that was still a long, long way from begging.</p><p>So I began an exploration of his body, kissing and tasting his chest, his abs, his stomach, taking my time but moving ever so slowly downward. When I took him in my mouth, he shuddered and tangled his hand in my hair, gently encouraging me to continue. I swirled my tongue around the tip of his cock, then down the length of his shaft, tasting myself on him as I licked and teased, never lingering in one place for very long. It wasn\u2019t long before his breathing became harsh again and that gentle pressure on my head became more and more insistent, encouraging me without words to take him fully.</p><p>I did, and he moaned again, his body thrusting instinctively upward, his cock filling my mouth completely. I sucked him, teased him, played with him, until his shaft was throbbing with the need for release and the salty taste of come was thick and strong and threatening to explode.</p><p>Once again, I retreated. He shuddered, then laughed, his voice hoarse as he said, \u201cNo retreat, no surrender, and certainly no begging. That\u2019s the motto I\u2019ve lived by and I see no reason to change that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I murmured, as I moved back up his body to repeat the whole process again.</p><p>By the third time around I think we were both close to breaking point. I was drenched in sweat and aching so fiercely I was half convinced Tao wasn\u2019t the only one who had a fire elemental burning inside of him. God, if one of us didn\u2019t give in soon, we\u2019d both expire.</p><p>As the taste of him grew ever saltier, I once again withdrew, but this time he growled \u201cenough\u201d\u2014the sound almost animal in its intensity\u2014and flipped our positions, kneeling between my legs as he dragged me forward and up. Holding me steady, he drove into me, and it was no gentle mating. It was all animal, all desperate need. He pumped furiously, his cock driving so deep it felt as if he was trying to spear himself right through every inch of me. And I was right there with him in that desperation, meeting him thrust for thrust, needing, aching, for release.</p><p>It came in an explosion that was unlike anything else we\u2019d shared so far, so deep and intense I actually blacked out for several seconds. When I regained my senses, he was lying along my length, taking most of his weight on his arms and his body still in mine. The Aedh, despite the intensity that had just consumed us, was not finished yet.</p><p>But I think I was.</p><p>I raised my head a little and kissed his lips. \u201cYou begged.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and wiped the sweaty strands of hair out of my eyes. \u201cI growled \u2018enough.\u2019 That\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly by a matter of degree. I win. You lose.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cActually, I rather think I won even if I did technically lose.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled softly, and let my gaze run over the planes of his face, half wondering how nature could be so cruel as to give such perfection so little real emotions. I could have happily settled down with Lucian if he\u2019d been anything other than an Aedh, with no want or need for anything beyond fulfilling the desires of his body. \u201cSo what are you doing here at this hour of the morning? And how did you even get in?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not only did we have one of the best security systems installed in our converted warehouse home, but Ilianna had finally figured out the magic used in the wards\u2014which were basically stones that could repel magic, spirits, or evil, depending on the spell infused within them\u2014that my father had left behind the last time he\u2019d talked to me, and she\u2019d used that magic to install wards of her own around our home. Which meant no Aedh\u2014or even reaper\u2014could get in. And I knew for sure Azriel couldn\u2019t, because he\u2019d apparently tried more than once\u2014and it was something of a blessing given this morning\u2019s session. The thought of his witnessing such a wanton display had embarrassment stirring in me, although I wasn\u2019t entirely sure why. I was wolf\u2014or part wolf\u2014and lovemaking in full view of others wasn\u2019t exactly a new experience to me.</p><p>Lucian nuzzled the side of my neck. \u201cIlianna let me in as she went out, and I thought it was pretty obvious what I\u2019m doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought you said you had several important meetings to attend today and that I wouldn\u2019t see you until later tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d My tone was sarcastic. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still feeling that something.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cWhat can I say? Your body drives me insane.\u201d</p><p>And his avoidance of questions was driving me insane. \u201cSeriously, I saw your schedule. You had meetings starting at eight thirty, then rolling right through until almost seven tonight. They can\u2019t all have canceled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou snooped through my appointments calendar?\u201d He nipped my earlobe just a little harder than necessary and I flinched. But even so, my treacherous hormones began to stir and hum. \u201cThat\u2019s not polite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither is reading my mind during sex,\u201d I replied testily, as his teeth caught my lobe again and gently gnawed it. A shiver that was half expectation, half apprehension rolled through me. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t seem to stop you from doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, who the hell is Jak?\u201d</p><p>I growled low in my throat and thrust him off me. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>I swung my legs off the bed and stalked across to my rather opulent bathroom. Every bedroom had its own and, like all the other rooms in this place, the bathrooms were huge, each one containing a massive spa bath, a double walk-in shower, a toilet, and a big hand basin. In mine, the oversized white wall tiles contrasted sharply against the heated black slate under my feet, and the lighting was warm and muted. Thankfully, Lucian didn\u2019t immediately follow me in. There were some things a girl liked privacy for, and peeing was definitely one of them.</p><p>He said, \u201cAnd yet your actions just now would suggest otherwise.\u201d</p><p>The toilet flushed as I padded over to the shower. When I stepped in, the water automatically came on at just the right temperature. I might not flaunt the fact that I was insanely rich, but there were definite benefits to being so, and one of those was being able to afford a system designed to ensure that you never had to battle with water temperature again.</p> <p>\u201cMy actions,\u201d I snapped back, \u201care related to annoyance at you rather than any need not to talk about Jak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me who he is.\u201d</p><p>I swung around and watched him enter the bathroom. He walked like a cat. A big, golden, beautiful cat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start answering questions when you do.\u201d</p><p>He walked into the shower cubicle and the second showerhead came on, covering him in water. The beads glistened in the warm light as they rolled almost reverently down his muscular body.</p><p>I held my ground and he stopped in front of me, his arms coming to either side of mine, effectively penning me. \u201cI told you, I had several cancellations.\u201d</p><p>I pushed my hands between us and tried to shove him away. I might as well have tried to knock down a skyscraper. I might be part wolf, and might therefore be a whole lot stronger than an average female, but he wasn\u2019t human, either. And he was bigger and stronger in almost every way imaginable.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, you\u2019re lying. I know it; you know it.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze swept mine, though what he was searching for I couldn\u2019t say. After a moment he grunted, and if I hadn\u2019t known better, I\u2019d have sworn it was an almost frustrated sound.</p><p>\u201cMy eight thirty meeting finished earlier than expected, and my ten o\u2019clock had to cancel because his wife went into labor. Satisfied?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I couldn\u2019t. I tasted no lie in his words and yet I had an odd feeling it wasn\u2019t exactly the truth. And while I did trust Lucian, there was that growing niggle in the back of my mind that kept suggesting he wasn\u2019t being honest with me, that he\u2019d never been entirely honest with me. Oh, his much-stated desire to seek revenge on those who\u2019d ripped his wings from his flesh was real enough\u2014and understandable, given that the process also robbed him of his ability to take Aedh form\u2014but I wasn\u2019t so sure that anything else was.</p><p>Of course, that niggle might also be nothing more than Azriel\u2019s distrust worming its way into my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d he added, a touch of impatience coloring his voice.</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cWhy should I have to tell you? Why don\u2019t you just pluck the answer from my thoughts like you usually do?\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat and pressed against me, pinning me hard against the cool white tiles. The water that streamed down on us did little to ease the heat and awareness that surged between us.</p><p>\u201cOnce I might have. Now, that is not so much an option.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, my gaze searching his, seeing frustration mingling with growing arousal. He wasn\u2019t lying\u2014not about this. Curiosity mingled with relief. \u201cWhy not? You\u2019ve had no trouble before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He pressed one knee between my legs. I tried to shove him back again, but with as little success as before.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected the reaper might have had something to do with it, but this has not got his imprint.\u201d</p><p>Alarm stirred. Reading my mind was one thing, but if Azriel was also altering the direction of my thoughts... \u201cMeaning you\u2019ve felt him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sometimes felt his echo. He reads your mind far more than you think, Risa.\u201d</p><p>The alarm abated. I was well aware of just how often he was reading me. It was the thought of him actually doing more that had me worried. But even as that thought crossed my mind, I swiped it away. Azriel wouldn\u2019t do that. He was a man\u2014a being\u2014of more integrity than that. Lucian, on the other hand, was an entirely different matter.</p><p>He nudged my knees farther apart, obviously preparing to claim me more intimately. I ducked under his arms and retreated, but I was nowhere near fast enough. He grabbed my hands, pinning them behind my back as he pressed me belly first against the wall.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lucian, this has gone far enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me who Jak is,\u201d he murmured, his words little more than a heated breeze near my left ear.</p><p>I shivered, torn between desire and growing anger. \u201cWhy do you need to know? It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re jealous or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, it was nothing more than curiosity.\u201d He shifted his grip so that both of my hands were held in one of his, then he pulled me back just enough to slip his free hand between the wall and me. He cupped my breasts, pinching and rolling my nipples, playing me like a master played his favorite instrument\u2014with ease and assurance. He added, \u201cNow, however, it is something of a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet another one you won\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have no doubt that I\u2019ll win this one,\u201d he said softly. He continued to knead and press and tease my flesh, until I was trembling to the tune of his fingers and beginning to hunger for a whole lot more. It was frustrating\u2014truly frustrating\u2014that I just couldn\u2019t seem to say no to this man and actually mean it. It was almost as if he\u2019d become an addiction. \u201cWhen I mentioned a moment ago that I wasn\u2019t able to read your thoughts as much as I used to, I did leave a little information out of the equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a surprise,\u201d I muttered, my body still quivering under the delicious assault.</p><p>He chuckled softly and once again gently prized my legs apart with his knee. Then he claimed me from behind, his cock thick and hard and oh-so-heated as it thrust up into me. I made a sound that was a confused mix of annoyed growl and moan of pleasure. He chuckled again, his lips brushing my ear before he whispered, \u201cI can read you when I fuck you. And right now, I intend to fuck you so completely that protecting the elusive Jak\u2019s identity will be the very last thing on your mind.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what he did. Until the water went cold and the shower automatically shut down, until my body was trembling with exhaustion and the repeated waves of orgasm. Until, I guess, he\u2019d finally mined the information from my mind. Only then did he allow himself to come, and finally end the ordeal.</p><p>For several minutes neither of us moved. His hands were still wrapped around mine, and my legs were so wobbly that his grip was the only thing keeping me upright.</p><p>He released me, then blew out a breath, the breeze of it whispering past my cheek. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, and for the first time there was weariness in his voice. The legendary Aedh stamina had finally hit a wall. \u201cJak is an ex-lover you met up with yesterday morning.\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019d had the energy I would have pushed him away from me. As it was, it was all I could do to turn around and glare at him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in town and wanted to catch up. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept mine, as if he was trying to work out whether I was telling the truth or not. And that surely meant he hadn\u2019t dragged all the information about Jak out of my mind during the marathon session. Though whether the relief that followed this realization stemmed from Azriel\u2019s distrust or my own lingering sense that something wasn\u2019t quite right, I couldn\u2019t honestly say.</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t be meeting him again?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might. I might not.\u201d I hesitated, then added in a more biting tone, \u201cWhich right now is exactly what I\u2019m thinking when it comes to seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cAs if you could give up what we share so easily. Do not fool yourself, Risa. Roughhouse or not, you enjoyed every inch of what we did here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but that isn\u2019t the point.\u201d I ran my fingers through my sweaty, matted hair, then added, \u201cJust go. I don\u2019t want to see you, I don\u2019t want to smell you, and I certainly don\u2019t want to feel you. Not now, and not in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd just how am I to get out, given the wards and the security system you have installed in this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll let you out.\u201d</p><p>I slipped past him and walked naked to the front door, waiting impatiently as he unhurriedly dressed and sauntered out.</p><p>He stopped in the doorway, his expression still amused. \u201cI give this anger two nights, at the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another bet you\u2019ll lose,\u201d I snapped back, and slammed the door on his retreating butt.</p> <p>But as I stalked back into my bathroom to see if the water had reheated enough to grab a quick shower, I had a sneaking suspicion that lasting even one day without feeling his touch was going to be a whole lot harder than I might wish.</p><p>Jak called as I was preparing my breakfast. I slid the huge pile of eggs and bacon onto the plate, then grabbed my coffee and walked over to the dining table. After pressing the vid-button, I propped the phone up against the vase of roses in the middle of the table, and sat down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just eating breakfast?\u201d Jak said, by way of greeting as his dark features popped onto the phone\u2019s screen. \u201cIt\u2019s four in the afternoon\u2014it\u2019s closer to dinner than breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked late at the caf\u00e9 last night.\u201d And I\u2019d fallen back into bed after my second shower, catching another three hours of much-needed sleep.</p><p>\u201cSo why not prepare dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I felt like bacon and eggs.\u201d I dove into my meal as I spoke. Jak had seen the best and worst of me during our time together, and I saw no reason for politeness now. \u201cI gather you\u2019re not phoning to discuss my breakfast times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou gathered right.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and saw that laughter crinkled the corners of his ebony eyes. And I was reminded of the times we\u2019d shared similar late-afternoon breakfasts, of the fun, and the loving that had followed.</p><p>I tore my gaze away from the screen and tried to concentrate on eating. Those times were gone. Remembering them would do nothing more than remind me just how empty my current love life was. Sex\u2014no matter how fantastic\u2014could never replace the intimacy of a real relationship. Not long term. And ultimately, that was what I really wanted.</p><p>Of course, that was exactly what I wasn\u2019t going to get from Lucian, or even Azriel. Although I guess Azriel did appear to have the capacity for emotions, which made him one step up the ladder from Lucian, but still not a great option. Hell, as much as part of me still hungered for what Jak and I had shared, he wasn\u2019t Mr. Long Term, either, no matter what I might have thought or how much I\u2019d loved him when we\u2019d been an item. He was married to his work, and everything and everyone else came second to that.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d he chided softly, \u201cyou know I don\u2019t like talking over the phone. One never knows just who is listening in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to see you\u2019re still paranoid about people stealing your scoops,\u201d I said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d like to know when that has ever happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it happened several months ago. You remember that piece the Age ran on the rat gangs running the old sewers?\u201d</p> <p>I scooped up several pieces of bacon and munched on them contemplatively, then eventually said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cNice to see you\u2019re still keeping up with world events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t get enough spare time these days to waste it reading newspapers.\u201d Especially since he was often featured in my favorite one.</p><p>\u201cWell, take it from me, that scoop was mine\u2014and the bastard only got it half right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I doubt the half-right bit would have annoyed you too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you really need to get over this whole resentment thing and move on.\u201d</p><p>I did my best to ignore the ache that washed through me at his use of the endearment. \u201cI have. I\u2019m just having a little trouble resisting the urge to needle. Where do you want to meet, and when?\u201d</p><p>He shifted position, and I recognized the lighthouse print behind him. He was home rather than at work. \u201cLook, this story you\u2019ve handed me is a little tricky given not only the Directorate\u2019s involvement but a definite unwillingness on the street to discuss the buy-up. I think it would be better if we appear to meet accidentally rather than on purpose. Might be safer for us both.\u201d</p><p>Alarm swam through me. \u201cMeaning you\u2019ve been threatened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words, but I got the distinct impression it might be better to leave this one alone.\u201d He laughed, and his face came alive. \u201cWhich of course only stirred my curiosity all the more.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. He hadn\u2019t changed, not one little bit. \u201cSo where do you want to meet? And don\u2019t say the Blue Moon because I don\u2019t go there anymore, and I\u2019m certainly not dancing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Risa, that\u2019s such a shame.\u201d His voice was almost wistful. \u201cWe were so good together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were being the correct phrase there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d He shrugged lightly. \u201cWhat about Chrome? Do you and that gang of yours still hang out there?\u201d</p><p>Chrome was a trendy bar in Brunswick that Ilianna, Tao, and I had all but lived in as university students. The booze was cheap, the atmosphere fantastic, and on a Friday night, it was still the only place in that area to be seen. \u201cYeah, once or twice a month, just for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Shall we say seven?\u201d</p><p>Seven would still leave me time to see Tao. \u201cOkay. Save me a barstool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d He hesitated, then added softly, \u201cI love the new hair color. Makes your eyes stand out more.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he disconnected. I swore softly and wished that he\u2014and the past\u2014would just leave me alone. Which was a stupid desire, since I was the one responsible for bringing him back into my life. The past was always going to come as accompanying baggage.</p><p>I finished my breakfast, then went back into my bedroom, swapping my dress for a summer top and jeans. Although the jeans I found myself reaching for were the Kevlar-infused ones, and that had me wondering if my sometimes unreliable clairvoyance ability sensed a bike fall in the near future. I hoped not\u2014I didn\u2019t want the Ducati damaged.</p><p>It was close to five by the time I locked up and headed down the side steps to the garage. Azriel was waiting near my bike, his expression as remote as I\u2019d ever seen it. Not happy about something, that was for sure.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he asked, his voice as neutral as his expression.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow as I plucked my helmet free of its stand. \u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t been following every single thought I\u2019ve had since I woke up?\u201d</p><p>Yellow fire flicked up Valdis\u2019s side, although Azriel\u2019s expression remained stony. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible when Ilianna\u2019s wards are powered up. She has placed far more restrictions than your father did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that something I\u2019m supposed to know when you\u2019ve never bothered to tell me before now?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the sarcasm in my voice and simply said, \u201cI take it Jak called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I sat astride my bike and half wondered if he was annoyed because Lucian was allowed into the warehouse and he wasn\u2019t. \u201cHe refuses to discuss anything on the phone, so I\u2019m meeting him at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going to see Tao first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I eyed him for a moment, wondering again why he\u2019d reverted back to the stiff and unyielding Azriel I\u2019d first met. It couldn\u2019t just be annoyance over Lucian, surely. I added silently, Is our watcher still near?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Which meant I\u2019d better act like I\u2019d been investigating the case rather than sleeping and fucking. \u201cDid you manage to scope out any information about the Rakshasa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. I\u2019m told the best way to kill them is to smash the heart of their dark god, which is usually to be found in a sacred urn within their lair. This will make the Rakshasa stay in flesh, and render them easier to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir lair?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cApparently they are found in packs of six or more.\u201d</p><p>Fabulous. Not. \u201cIf there\u2019s six or more of them, I can\u2019t say I fancy the idea of tracking them back to their lair. Surely there\u2019s another way to kill them...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can trap it when it\u2019s about to consume its next victim, then white ash, silver, or even sunlight might destroy it.\u201d</p><p>Might. Not a good word choice. \u201cWhat about the others in the lair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is usually only one hunter per pack. Take out the hunter, and you probably destroy the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means we need to be there when it selects its next victim, then track it home if the trap doesn\u2019t work.\u201d I stared at him as dread settled into the pit of my stomach. \u201cAnd that means keeping watch at Dark Earth. That\u2019s not something I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do not.\u201d But remember, you do this because you fear Hunter and her council. He paused, then added, with a little more emphasis than was needed, How do you think she would react if you backed out of this investigation now?</p><p>Badly. And with much venom. I sighed. \u201cDark Earth is not a place I want to go near again\u2014especially at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>And he would protect me as much as he could. I knew that. But I also knew he was just one against a possible frenzy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do not have to be there in the flesh.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBut you warned me against taking Aedh form too much because it might attract the wrong sort of attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might, but if you do not want to physically wait at Dark Earth, then we are left with Aedh form or watching from the gray fields.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the gray fields we\u2019d at least have the Du\u0161an to guard us.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBut the Raziq prowl there. There is a greater chance of discovery if we step onto the fields for any great length of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe risk that no matter what we do,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAny idea how long it might be before the Rakshasa feeds again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe five victims have all died within a week. From what I have been told, their feeding cycle lasts a month, and then they will go into hibernation again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpirits hibernate? That\u2019s a new one.\u201d</p> <p>He ignored my comment. \u201cAfter the initial frenzy, the hunter will space her kills more evenly. We may have a couple of days before the agony and fury of the lost ones call to her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to be hanging around that club night after night waiting for a spirit that may or may not appear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI am attempting to get more information. It might also be helpful if we had greater details about the time and date of the deaths. There might be a pattern we could use.\u201d</p><p>If there was a pattern, surely Hunter and the Directorate would have seen it. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Hunter to send the information to me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOnce we get that, we can decide the best way to proceed.\u201d</p><p>The best way to proceed\u2014or rather, the sanest way to proceed\u2014would be to run a mile in the other direction. I mean, a flesh-eating, shape-changing spirit with poisonous talons wasn\u2019t exactly something anyone with an iota of sense would want to tangle with. But it wasn\u2019t like I had any real choice, because right now I was stuck with two millstones hanging around my neck\u2014the agreement to help Hunter and a vampire council still debating whether or not it would be better to kill me. A wrong step might be fatal in more ways than one.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the Brindle.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother waiting for an answer. I just shoved my helmet on, fired up the bike, and raced into the street.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was peak hour and all the main roads were playing parking lots again. Frustrated, I swung into a side street and took the more roundabout but better-flowing route to the Brindle.</p><p>Only trouble was, I didn\u2019t get there.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>One moment I was cruising down the street behind a belching truck; the next I was hit side-on. The force of the impact ripped me from my bike and sent me flying toward a light pole. It happened so fast I didn\u2019t even have time to try to protect myself\u2014I just hit the pole and wrapped around it like an old bit of rubbish.</p><p>Then I slumped to the ground, battling to breathe and struggling to ignore the pain stabbing into my brain as well as the gathering tide of blackness that threatened to wash away consciousness.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let go. I just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>It was a thought that made no sense, but one that had me struggling to rise nevertheless. I made it to my knees\u2014the pain was too great to go any farther. Although getting even that far meant I hadn\u2019t broken anything major. Yay for the strength of werewolf bones, I thought fuzzily.</p> <p>Something warm and sticky gushed down the side of my cheek. I swiped at it and hit the visor instead. It was half hanging off, and swinging back and forth with my movements. I swore and wrenched it off completely. It clattered to the ground, though oddly made no sound. In fact, the whole world seemed to be silent. Or maybe I just couldn\u2019t hear through the roar that seemed to be filling my head.</p><p>I blinked and looked around. Saw my bike lying on her side, hydrogen leaking from her tanks. It looked surreal, like blood, and I hoped like hell her wound wasn\u2019t fatal.</p><p>That odd roaring got louder and I suddenly realized what it was. It was Amaya, screaming a warning, screaming for blood.</p><p>It was then that I saw them\u2014Ania. And this time, there weren\u2019t only six or so. This time, there were so many that it looked like an ethereal tower of white speeding toward me.</p><p>A hand wrapped around my arm and yanked me upright. My heart just about jumped out of my chest, even though instinct and something else\u2014something that was infinitely deeper and decidedly scarier\u2014told me it was Azriel.</p><p>Power surged as he pulled me close and wrapped his other arm around my waist. Valdis blazed at his back, as eager as Amaya to fight, but neither sword was getting its wish today. Azriel\u2019s power burned around me\u2014through me\u2014sweeping us both from flesh to energy. A second later we were on the gray fields, but they weren\u2019t the fields that I knew. My gray fields were a place of shadows, a place where things not sighted in the real world suddenly gained substance. But in Azriel\u2019s arms, the fields were vast and beautiful, filled with structures and life that were delicate and unworldly.</p><p>Then the brightness and warmth of his world was gone, replaced by a darkness that felt damp and smelled faintly of rot and excrement. The sewers, I thought dazedly. Why the hell were we in the sewers?</p><p>\u201cBecause this is the last place the Ania or the Raziq will think to look for us,\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>He shifted his grip and guided me down onto a chair. Which was a smart move, because if he\u2019d simply let go I think I would have fallen. My legs were like jelly and my whole body was shaking.</p><p>I looked around. Wherever we were, it didn\u2019t actually look like a sewer. It actually resembled a small control room of some sort, filled with computers and what looked to be some kind of projector...</p><p>Memory stirred, and I suddenly realized that this was the control room where Ike Foreman had held me and questioned me about the keys for the portals of hell\u2014although we still had no clear idea for whom he\u2019d been working. He\u2019d died in the sewer just beyond the main doorway, shot by Lucian. The image of Foreman\u2019s face\u2014and the surprise that had flitted across it a second before he died\u2014rose, and I suddenly found myself wondering why he\u2019d been so shocked. It wasn\u2019t the fact that death had found him; of that I was sure.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just be here long enough to stop this bleeding,\u201d Azriel continued, drawing me out of my thoughts. But his attention was focused on the helmet that had saved me, and after a moment he unsheathed Valdis. \u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>I tightened my fingers around the arms of the chair, suddenly fighting the urge to flee. \u201cWhat the hell are you intending to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour helmet shattered when you hit the pole, and there are several pieces embedded in your head.\u201d</p><p>Well, that would certainly explain the pain in my head and the blood on my cheek. \u201cSo just take them out and then remove the helmet. There\u2019s no need to try to cut it off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect moving the shards will cause greater bleeding. Valdis will obliterate the shards and heal the wound at the same time.\u201d He paused, and his gaze met mine. There was something unyielding in his eyes, almost as if he were drawing a line in the sand. \u201cYou said you trusted me.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips. \u201cI do, but using Valdis to dig them out seems a little like using a jackhammer to hit home a nail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdis would never harm you. She can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at that. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>His expression became closed again. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>That was a question I\u2019d answered more than once. He was connected to me on a chi level\u2014and far more strongly than he was admitting\u2014and he knew just how much I did trust him, even if the occasional doubt raised its ugly head. I motioned for him to proceed.</p><p>Valdis\u2019s fire was a strange green-gold as he brought her close. Droplets of fire splattered across my skin, hissing as they touched, yet not hurting. Warmth flushed upward from my neck and face, until even the ends of my hair felt like they were on fire. There was a brief retort, and a bitter smell\u2014which was a mix of melting fiberglass and burning carbon fiber\u2014filled the air.</p><p>Then it was gone, and with it the stabbing pain in the side of my head.</p><p>Azriel sheathed Valdis, then slowly\u2014carefully\u2014removed the helmet. The shards digging into my skull might have been eliminated, but it still hurt like shit. I blinked back tears, and gripped the chair arms so damn tightly that my fingernails tore into the leather.</p><p>\u201cYou were extremely lucky,\u201d Azriel said, and held the helmet so I could see it.</p><p>The whole left side was broken, much of it dented inward toward what was now a jagged and somewhat melted hole in the center. It was destroyed\u2014but it had undoubtedly saved my life.</p><p>My gaze rose and met Azriel\u2019s. The anger that burned in the mismatched blue depths just about snatched my breath away. \u201cThe Ania could have killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy mistake, yes, but if they\u2019d actually wanted to kill you, they could have easily done so by now. And remember, it wasn\u2019t so much an attack in the caf\u00e9 as an attempt to capture you.\u201d He tossed the helmet aside. It clattered against the old stones and rolled limply into the shadows. \u201cIt would also appear that changing your hair made little difference. They obviously know more about your habits than I presumed.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the energy to say \u201cI told you so,\u201d and simply leaned back in the chair and closed my eyes. While the pain in my head had all but gone, the rest of me felt more than a little pulverized. But I guess feeling that way was better than actually being so, and that had very nearly been the reality.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t step away from everything and go into hiding, Azriel,\u201d I said, after a moment. \u201cThat won\u2019t find the Rakshasa and it certainly won\u2019t find us the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but staying away from the things they are aware of\u2014like your bike, the caf\u00e9, and your apartment\u2014would be a good start until we figure out a way to stop these attacks.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes again. \u201cDo you really think we can stop them? I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can stop them.\u201d He said it firmly, like he was trying to convince himself as much as me. Which was an odd thought, since he generally saw these things in black-and-white\u2014will or won\u2019t. \u201cBut until we do, we should do all that we can to avoid them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop visiting Tao.

Her magic wouldn\u2019t let them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Ania couldn\u2019t, no, but the Raziq might well attempt it if these ambushes keep failing.\u201d</p><p>And the witches had already warned us that the Brindle had no defenses against the Raziq. \u201cThat\u2019s only if they are the ones behind them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. I felt their touch behind the Ania this time.\u201d</p><p>Well, fuck. I swiped angrily at the blood still dribbling down my cheek. Valdis might have healed the worst head wound when she melted the helmet shards, but there were obviously several smaller ones if the blood was anything to go by. \u201cI guess this means I\u2019m staying at the Langham again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the Langham,\u201d he cut in. \u201cYou\u2019ve stayed there before, so it would be wise not to risk it.\u201d</p> <p>I grimaced. Being hunted by minor demons wasn\u2019t half as annoying as missing out on staying at my favorite five-star hotel.</p><p>Azriel wrapped his hand around mine and gently pulled me to my feet. \u201cYou, Risa Jones,\u201d he said softly, \u201chave a strange way of looking at things.\u201d</p><p>He was standing so close that his breath teased my lips as he spoke, and his scent\u2014a scent that was man and musk and sharply electric\u2014filled every breath. And all I had to do was lean forward, just a little, and I\u2019d be kissing him. But as much as I wanted to do just that, I also feared it could forever change our relationship\u2014and maybe not in a good way. So I simply said, \u201cThis, coming from a man who can describe lovemaking only as enlightening.\u201d</p><p>How my voice came out even I had no idea, given the tumultuous push-pull being waged inside me.</p><p>\u201cIt is an apt word when one has never experienced it before.\u201d His gaze was steady on mine and he showed no inclination to release me. Maybe he simply figured I wasn\u2019t steady enough after the accident, but something inside me whispered no. Azriel knew exactly what he was doing\u2014and what it was doing to me. And that, in turn, implied intent.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Risa.\u201d He said it so softly it was little more than a whisper that ran through my mind.</p> <p>What did I want? I don\u2019t fucking know, I thought, my gaze searching his. Or rather, I did know, but I just didn\u2019t have the courage to reach for it when he was the one person who had my back no matter what I did. And right now, that was more valuable to me than whatever this was between us.</p><p>I took a deep, somewhat shuddery breath, and said, \u201cRight now, I really want a shower and fresh clothes. Then I need to meet Jak.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for several heartbeats\u2014which wasn\u2019t that long given just how fast my heart was beating\u2014then he inclined his head slightly. Conceding to what lay unspoken rather than what had been said.</p><p>\u201cWhat hotel?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m known for my five-star tastes, so we\u2019re probably better off going to someplace like the BreakFree on Little Bourke Street.\u201d</p><p>The words were barely out of my mouth when his power surged around us, sweeping us quickly through the gray fields before re-forming us inside a bathroom. Two women were standing at the washbasins, but neither paid any attention to us. He was obviously taking care of that, too.</p><p>He released me and stepped back, and something deep inside mourned the loss of his closeness. \u201cI thought you might like to wash the blood away before you check in.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the mirror and saw the blood streaking my face and matting one side of my hair. I grimaced, turned on the taps, and ducked my head under the water, rinsing my hair, then scrubbing my face and neck. As the two women walked out, I hit the dryer button, flicked the nozzle upward, and finger-dried my hair\u2014wincing several times in the process as my fingertips caught the smaller cuts on my head. At least short dark hair had its good points\u2014it didn\u2019t take long to dry, and you couldn\u2019t see the blood that was still weeping from the other wounds.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to do me a favor?\u201d I said, as I turned around. He merely raised an eyebrow, so I added, \u201cI have a bag of spare clothes and basic toiletries sitting in my locker at the caf\u00e9. Could you go grab it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and disappeared so quickly I was tempted to think he\u2019d been looking for an excuse to distance himself. I rang my mechanic to pick up the Ducati as I walked over to the reception desk, then booked a room for a couple of nights and headed up to it. A long hot shower didn\u2019t do a whole lot to ease the aches, and if the bruises already beginning to appear were anything to go by, I was going to have a rainbow adorning the left side of my body come tomorrow.</p><p>My bag was waiting for me on the floor near the towels once I\u2019d finished. I frowned, wondering how he\u2019d gotten in here without my sensing him, then shrugged and got dressed.</p><p>He was standing at the room\u2019s one window, his hands clasped behind his back and Valdis burning with a muted reddish yellow fire. He didn\u2019t say anything or turn around, so I walked across to the bed, grabbed my phone out of my purse\u2014which thankfully had survived the crash relatively unscathed\u2014and rang Ilianna.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d she said. \u201cI was getting worried about you.\u201d</p><p>The vid-screen wasn\u2019t showing a picture. I frowned and pressed the MODE button, figuring it might have somehow gotten switched in the accident, but it made no difference. Which meant I\u2019d be looking for a new phone in the near future\u2014just what I needed on top of everything else.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry, but it looks like I won\u2019t make it there tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling there was trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was. And I think I need to step away from things until we sort out what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI gather you\u2019re okay? What about the Ducati?\u201d</p><p>Obviously, she\u2019d had more than a feeling if she knew I\u2019d been on the Ducati when trouble hit. \u201cI\u2019m okay, but I have no idea if the same can be said about the bike, as we had to abandon her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbandon the Ducati?\u201d Her tone was one of mock horror. \u201cGood god, how will you cope?\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure. Lonny\u2019s going to pick it up for me and send me a report once he\u2019s checked out the damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take over your shift tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you feel up to it. If not, they\u2019ll just have to manage. I\u2019ll arrange for a temp to cover the rest of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head in and cover the busiest hours. And don\u2019t worry about a temp\u2014Margie has been asking for more hours, so this will make her happy.\u201d</p><p>Margie was one of our newer waitresses, but she was doing a business course and seemed to have a really sensible head on her shoulders. Ilianna had already pinned her as a potential manager, so this would be a good chance to see how she handled things.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Tao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch, much better,\u201d she said, relief briefly lifting the tiredness in her voice. \u201cThe sunnier room has done wonders to stabilize his internal temperature, and though he\u2019s not yet awake, we\u2019re getting more gruel into him and he no longer looks so gaunt.\u201d</p><p>Thank god, I thought, and briefly closed my eyes against the sting of tears. \u201cAny idea when he\u2019s likely to wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. His body still appears to be adjusting to the presence of the fire elemental. I doubt he\u2019ll wake until the merging is finished.\u201d</p><p>And until he did, we wouldn\u2019t know what the end result of that merging was. It was a very real possibility that Tao might not even know us once he woke up. It just depended which nature was stronger\u2014the werewolf or the elemental.</p><p>\u201cRing me the minute anything happens,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd in the meantime, you and Mirri be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, if we were any more cautious, we\u2019d be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. \u201cGive Tao a kiss for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give Mirri one for you, too,\u201d she said, somewhat primly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll use any excuse to kiss that girl of yours,\u201d I said, amused. \u201cSo give her two. Might as well make it worthwhile.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again, but the sound died a little too quickly. \u201cYou need to be careful, particularly tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Unease prickled across my skin. \u201cMore omens of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, or someone near you. I can\u2019t define it more than that, so just keep an eye out, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Keep in contact, Ris, or I\u2019ll be calling in the cavalry.\u201d</p><p>Meaning Aunt Riley and Uncle Rhoan\u2014two people I did not want involved right now. Mainly because they\u2019d lock me up, throw away the key, and attempt to investigate this whole mess themselves\u2014and that would only end up with them getting hurt. Because no matter how good the pair of them were, this was far beyond their experience and capabilities. Hell, it was beyond mine, but at least I could see the reapers and walk the gray fields.</p><p>I shoved the phone away and looked at the time. It was six thirty\u2014time to get moving if I was going to make my appointment with Jak.</p><p>I studied the still silent Azriel and frowned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He turned, his expression carefully neutral but his body language hinting at tension. \u201cOf course. How will you get to this caf\u00e9 without your bike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch a cab.\u201d I tilted my head slightly, continuing to watch him through slightly narrowed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve retreated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do what I am here to do. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d</p><p>Which no doubt was a direct result of what I\u2019d said. Or rather, what I hadn\u2019t said\u2014that I wanted him. Though why he wanted it voiced when our chi connection gave him all manner of insight into my thoughts and emotions, I had no idea. But I could hardly complain about his retreat when it was a result of my own. \u201cThen I\u2019ll see you at Chrome.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t see me,\u201d he countered. \u201cBut I will be there.\u201d</p><p>And with that he disappeared again. I grimaced and grabbed my purse, slinging it over my shoulder as I headed down to the lobby to catch a cab.</p><p>I arrived at Chrome a couple of minutes past seven. The place was packed even though it was Wednesday, the music pumping and the air rich with the warm scent of alcohol and humanity. I squeezed my way toward the long chrome bar that ran the length of the rough brick wall to the left of the door and found Jak perched on one of the red-cushioned stools down the far end.</p> <p>He turned as I approached, but his quick smile of greeting faded abruptly. \u201cYou look like shit,\u201d he said, catching my hand to steady me as I perched on the stool next to him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing a gallon of beer won\u2019t fix.\u201d I ignored the reminiscent side of me that wanted to enjoy his touch and gently pulled my fingers from his.</p><p>\u201cAlready done,\u201d he said, sliding a tankard my way. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell off my bike.\u201d I shrugged and took a drink.</p><p>He watched me, eyes slightly narrowed, obviously suspecting there was more to the story than what I was saying. \u201cAnd the Ducati?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlive but dented. What did you want to see me about?\u201d</p><p>His wry smile made my insides twist. God, how I just wished that part of me would get over it. But that, it seemed, was not to be.</p><p>\u201cStraight down to business, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m here, Jak.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s more bad news than good.\u201d</p><p>Of course there was. Fate wasn\u2019t likely to give me only good news now, was it? \u201cSo hit me with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you are aware, John Nadler is an extremely elusive man. He has an office in Collins Street, but is rarely ever there, and while he owns a house in Brighton, none of his neighbors can tell me the last time they saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not a ghost, because the heirs of both James Trilby and Gavin Appleby are suing the consortium for a bigger piece of the money pie, and a ghost generally can\u2019t hire lawyers or appear in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but he hasn\u2019t yet appeared in court\u2014and won\u2019t, because the case settled out of court yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cEven if the lawyer handled the settlement, surely Nadler has to appear to sign the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may have to sign the papers, but he didn\u2019t actually have to appear at the meeting to do that. Apparently Frank Logan\u2014the lawyer in question\u2014was meeting Nadler at two today to do all the official stuff, but the meet wasn\u2019t at the office.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I talked to the secretary.\u201d</p><p>And no doubt raided her mind in the process. It was the only way he\u2019d get that sort of information. I couldn\u2019t imagine someone who had Nadler as a client employing anyone who gave out confidential information, however minor.</p> <p>\u201cSo we have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly nothing.\u201d A waiter went past and filled up the nearby nut bowl. Jak snagged it and pushed it between us. \u201cWe still have the lawyer.\u201d</p><p>I scooped up some peanuts. \u201cYou\u2019ve made an appointment to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>Jak snorted. \u201cThe man charges like a wounded bull. On my salary, I can\u2019t even afford his first-appointment rates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to go talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes and no\u2014and this is where the good news comes in. He\u2019s apparently going to be at the Financial Markets Foundation for Children gala tomorrow night. I want you to get us tickets.\u201d</p><p>Go to a ball with Jak? I wasn\u2019t sure that was a good idea\u2014not when he looked so damn good in black tie. \u201cMom supported a lot of charities, but I can\u2019t recall the foundation being one of them. And I doubt I could ring up at the last moment and get tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. I\u2019ve already checked, and they\u2019re sold out.\u201d</p><p>Which was good for the foundation but not so good for us. \u201cSo what do you expect me to do? Beat someone over the head and steal their ticket?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and it lit up his entire face, making that stubbornly stupid bit of me ache. \u201cWell, as a last resort, maybe. But I figure that maybe you should try some of your mom\u2019s contacts first. Surely with all the work she did for charities, someone somewhere would owe her\u2014or her daughter\u2014a favor or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice of you to remember how many charities she supported. Shame it didn\u2019t reach the damn article.\u201d</p><p>He patted my hand lightly. \u201cNow, now, you know that\u2019s not true. I did mention it, if only in the introduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerous of you,\u201d I muttered, and once again slipped my hand from under his.</p><p>Amusement glittered in his dark eyes. He knew exactly what he was doing to me, the bastard. A thought confirmed by his next statement.</p><p>\u201cThe spark is still there, Ris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat spark is nothing more than werewolf nature,\u201d I said with determination. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not something I\u2019m about to give in to, so stop playing games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard when\u2014bruises aside\u2014you look so damn good.\u201d</p><p>I was half tempted to look down just to see how hard it was, but I resisted. That sort of action would only encourage him\u2014and was no doubt precisely why he\u2019d chosen those words. \u201cThen maybe you should have thought a little more about that story you wrote.\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head before I\u2019d even finished. \u201cWe both know I\u2019d sell my soul mate for the right story, and we certainly weren\u2019t soul mates.\u201d</p><p>And that one sentence encapsulated why I\u2014even if I could forget about the past\u2014wasn\u2019t about to revive my relationship with Jak. I didn\u2019t need another relationship with a direct line to nowhereville.</p><p>And yet, even as that thought crossed my mind, a voice deep inside was whispering, Liar.</p><p>He added, \u201cSo, do you know anyone who might be able to wrangle some tickets? Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to resort to trying to interview him outside the venue, and given that I normally report on paranormal oddities rather than galas, that might raise suspicions in the wrong quarters.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say he was out of luck, that I didn\u2019t know anyone, but then I paused. Mike\u2014the accountant who looked after the financial side of the caf\u00e9 as well as having been my mom\u2019s financial adviser and now mine\u2014had said a few days ago that if I ever needed help with anything outside of financial matters to give him a call. And while I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t actually referring to tickets to a gala fund-raiser, it was worth a shot.</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d I slipped off the barstool. \u201cWait here while I go call him.\u201d</p><p>I made my way to the front of Chrome and stood to one side of the entrance, where it was less noisy, to make the call.</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d a plummy, feminine voice said, \u201cWhat can I do you for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Beatrice,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak to Mike if he\u2019s available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment, and I\u2019ll check.\u201d</p><p>Music came on the line as she switched over, but a second later Mike\u2019s low and pleasant voice replaced the music. \u201cRisa, is there a problem? I wasn\u2019t expecting to hear from you until the next business activity statement was due.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem. I just wondered if you could do me a small favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know I will if I can. It\u2019s the least I can do in honor of your mother.\u201d</p><p>He and Mom had been lovers for more years than I could remember, although they were never seen together and seemed content to keep the relationship totally secret. So secret, in fact, that until Mike had all but confirmed it last week by his unusual offer to help me any way he could, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure their relationship wasn\u2019t a figment of my imagination.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing major, as I said. I\u2019m just looking for tickets to the FMFFC ball tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gala?\u201d he said, surprise evident in his voice. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought that sort of thing was your style. Your mother\u2019s, certainly, but not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut I have a friend who is doing a story on several people who\u2019ll be there, and he can\u2019t get tickets.\u201d</p><p>I felt bad about lying\u2014or half lying\u2014but giving him the truth might be dangerous, and I\u2019d endangered enough people as it was.</p><p>\u201cSo why is this your problem?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI owe him a favor and he\u2019s called it in.\u201d I shrugged, then remembered the vid-screen wasn\u2019t working. \u201cThis will make us even and get him off my back.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI haven\u2019t got tickets this year, but I\u2019ll ring around and see what I can do. Give me a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mike. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises,\u201d he said and hung up. I shoved my phone into my purse and went back inside.</p><p>Jak raised his eyebrows. \u201cSuccess or failure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. He\u2019s ringing around and will let me know.\u201d I reclaimed my stool, then my drink, taking several sips of the cool amber liquid.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He munched contemplatively on peanuts for a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend of mine keeping an electronic eye out on Nadler\u2019s house. He\u2019ll let me know who\u2019s coming and going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it obviously won\u2019t be Nadler if the neighbors haven\u2019t sighted him for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused again, munching on more peanuts before adding, \u201cI\u2019ve also been researching his family. Seems rather convenient to me that all his next of kin are listed as dead.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cWhy has that snagged your interest? It happens. Hell\u2014me, for example.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a wry look. \u201cBut you and your mother are somewhat special cases, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>We did. Only he didn\u2019t know just how special. Mom had been created in a madman\u2019s lab, and while I was the result of a more conventional mating, my father was about as far from conventional as you could get. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t make his lack of siblings or relations that unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was a much older man, I\u2019d agree.

He really did get turned on by this sort of intrigue\u2014and it was damnably hard not to react to it.</p><p>\u201cSo, hit me with it,\u201d I said in a wry voice. \u201cOr are you intending to drag out the suspense as punishment for me not submitting to your werewolf wiles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn, I hadn\u2019t actually thought of that\u2014\u201d</p><p>I punched his shoulder lightly and he laughed. Just for a moment, it felt like old times.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I suspect,\u201d he said, softly and rather melodramatically, \u201cis that while our John Nadler might not be a ghost, he could be the next best thing.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a deadpan look. \u201cI will resort to greater violence if you don\u2019t get on with it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, and the sound ran across my senses like a summer rain, warm and inviting. \u201cI think what we\u2019re looking for is not just a man but rather something a whole lot more. John Nadler, I suspect, is a face-shifter.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>I blinked in surprise. \u201cBut they test DNA at birth. If he wasn\u2019t human, then it would have been discovered. Mistakes like that just aren\u2019t made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelki werewolves are not the only ones capable of face-shifting,\u201d he said. \u201cI know for a fact the military has human face-shifters. Did a story on it quite a few years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut from what I\u2019ve heard, they\u2019re rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRare doesn\u2019t mean impossible. But I rather suspect that the Nadler who was born fifty-six years ago is dead, and that a face-shifter has taken over his face and his life, and that\u2019s who is now running the consortium.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I certainly knew how easy it would be to assume someone else\u2019s appearance, having done it myself. But stepping fully into their life was a whole different matter. \u201cWhat makes you suspicious? The lack-of-relatives factor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way, yes. Nadler was an only child, as was his mother. But his father had two brothers and one sister, and they provided Nadler with a total of five cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re all dead?\u201d That did raise my eyebrows. You\u2019d think at least a couple of the cousins would still be alive, considering that some of them had to be younger.</p><p>\u201cAll dead, and all within a three-year time span.\u201d</p><p>My frown deepened. \u201cSomething like that would have raised suspicions with the police or at the coroner\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if each and every one was classified as either an accident or natural causes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd were they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>At least that explained why Stane hadn\u2019t picked up on this. He didn\u2019t have Jak\u2019s naturally suspicious nature. \u201cSo if your suspicions are right, and a face-shifter was cleaning Nadler\u2019s house in preparation for a takeover, what about business partners and the like? They\u2019re often more familiar with someone than relatives are, simply because they spend more time with them.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and raised a hand, signaling to the waiter for two more beers. I finished the remnants of my first and slid the glass toward the waiter as he appeared with the second one.</p><p>\u201cAh, now this is where it gets really interesting.\u201d Jak\u2019s excitement ramped up another notch. I took several gulps of beer, but it didn\u2019t do a whole lot to quench the rising flame of desire. Damn it, I would not go there. He continued. \u201cNadler supposedly had a partial breakdown when his parents died in a car accident. He took six months off work, and when he came back, his colleagues noticed a change in him, but put it down to the recent trauma. Interestingly, he left that business two weeks later to run the newly formed consortium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA consortium with a paper trail so convoluted it\u2019s almost impossible to track down its true beginnings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He raised his glass and clicked it lightly against mine. \u201cAll roads point to the man we know as Nadler being a face-shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made a case for it,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut it\u2019s no certainty, and it\u2019s not something his lawyer can tell us. Hell, if a face-shifter has taken over Nadler\u2019s life, then there\u2019s no saying that the Nadler the lawyer sees is the one everyone else involved in his day-to-day life does. He\u2019s a face-shifter, remember.\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly. \u201cHadn\u2019t actually thought of that.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cSorry to burst your excited little bubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you haven\u2019t.\u201d His expression held altogether too much warmth and a whole lot of sexual hunger. And that, I suspected, wasn\u2019t so much about the desire that raged between us as it was about the thrill of a case that had him intrigued. Which wasn\u2019t saying he didn\u2019t want me; it was just that I wasn\u2019t the prime motivator of said hunger.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t make the desire surging through me any easier to ignore. I dropped my gaze back to my beer and took several slow, deep breaths. They helped about as much as the cold beer.</p><p>\u201cThing is,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe lawyer will at least be able to describe the Nadler he knows well enough for me to work up a sketch, and we can go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m full of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no denying you\u2019re full of something,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d call it ideas.\u201d</p><p>His soft laugh shivered across my senses enticingly. Damn, damn, damn.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d offer to show you exactly what is filling me at the moment, but I rather suspect you\u2019ll refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know it.\u201d Thankfully, my phone chose that moment to ring, cutting off any other comments he might make along those lines. It was Mike. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s bad news, seeing not much time has passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tickets will be dropped off at the office tomorrow at nine, and you can pick them up anytime after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d I gave Jak the thumbs-up. \u201cThanks heaps, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to help,\u201d he said, and hung up again.</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d Jak said as I put the phone away. \u201cWhat time do you want me to pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a chance meeting, remember? I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d Besides, he and I confined in a car was not a good idea if he was going to continue radiating desire so strongly. My brain and emotions might want to keep their distance, but my hormones remembered the good times, and they were more than willing to take the chance and dance with him again.</p><p>\u201cNot because of any ruse, but because you don\u2019t trust me,\u201d he commented, amusement crinkling the corners of his dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot one iota. You, my friend, have seduction on your mind.\u201d I finished my drink and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring your dancing shoes,\u201d he said.</p><p>I snorted in disgust, and his laughter followed me out the door. Damn him to hell, I thought, and fleetingly wished I hadn\u2019t argued with Lucian. It would have been nice to ease the ache of desire in his arms. I could always go to Franklin\u2019s, a discreet up-market wolf club I often used at times like this, but even as that thought crossed my mind, my nose was wrinkling. The club had lost some of its appeal lately\u2014mainly because Lucian had a sexual repertoire my usual partner at Franklin\u2019s had no hope of competing with.</p><p>Azriel appeared beside me as I walked up the road to the taxi stand. \u201cThe face-shifter theory is an interesting one.\u201d</p><p>His voice was still very formal, and irritation swirled. But did I really want the easygoing, warm version when desire raged so badly inside me? Yes, that insane part of me whispered. Most definitely. I ignored it and said, \u201cIt would certainly explain why no one can find Nadler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he is being so cautious with who sees him, it is also probable that he is not only keeping an eye on his lawyer\u2019s movements, but he would have ensured that the lawyer could not actually describe him.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and looked at him. \u201cMind tampering?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that implies our fake Nadler is more powerful than we\u2019d thought.\u201d And probably more dangerous, although his actions with the soul stealer gave more than enough warning about the lengths to which he was willing to go.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cI do not think it wise for Jak to accompany you to this ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019s going to remain behind. He wants this story, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but that is neither here nor there. Do you agree that it would be better for him not to appear?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYes, but if we stop him, he\u2019ll be furious.\u201d And knowing Jak as well as I did, I had no doubt he\u2019d pursue the story without us, and that, ultimately, could be even more dangerous. At least this way we had some control over his actions.</p><p>\u201cHe can be stopped and yet still think he was there,\u201d Azriel commented.</p><p>My gaze searched his for a moment\u2014although why, I have no idea, given that he was still in retreat mode. \u201cSo you\u2019ll keep him at home somehow, but feed him false memories afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t work. He\u2019s a reporter, and reporters talk. He\u2019ll discover soon enough that no one can remember seeing him there and he\u2019ll suspect I\u2019ve done something.\u201d</p><p>Azriel raised his eyebrows. \u201cBut what if\u2014as far as everyone was concerned\u2014he did appear?\u201d</p><p>Meaning he\u2019d become Jak? \u201cHow is that going to keep him safe? I mean, for all intents and purposes, everyone will think he was there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue. But remember, Ilianna warned you that more trouble could be headed your way tomorrow night, and the timing coincides with this gala. It\u2019s possible the face-shifter we know as Nadler is ready to react at the slightest hint of a problem.\u201d</p><p>A taxi pulled into the rank up ahead, and I started walking again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you could pull something like that off convincingly.\u201d</p><p>He fell in step beside me again, his hands clasped lightly behind his back and the warmth of his presence doing more damage to my breathing than Jak\u2019s excitement had. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Because he\u2019s warm and real, and you\u2019re not. Not in a flesh-and-blood sense, anyway\u2014even if he felt altogether too real right now. \u201cYou can\u2019t inhabit the personality of a person you hardly know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am as real as you, Risa,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd you\u2019d be surprised at just what I can do.\u201d</p><p>No doubt. I took a deep breath and blew it out slowly. \u201cIf you think you can be convincing, then it\u2019s worth the chance. As much as I hate what Jak did to me and my mom, I don\u2019t want to see him hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will at least keep him safe from whatever trouble Ilianna has seen coming tomorrow night.\u201d He hesitated, then added, \u201cBut it has a second benefit.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cThat being?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get to dance with you.\u201d And with that he winked out of existence again.</p><p>Goddamn you, Azriel. You can\u2019t keep running like that.</p><p>Why not? his thought came back. You do.</p><p>Which was not something I could argue with. I grabbed the cab, gave the cabbie the hotel\u2019s address, then dragged out my phone again and called Hunter.</p><p>\u201cThis is not what I would term a timely phone call,\u201d she commented, and though her voice was mild, I was suddenly glad the vid-screen was broken. \u201cYeah, sorry, but I had an accident and fell off my bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware of that fact,\u201d she said crisply. \u201cJust as I am aware that you\u2019re planning to be at the FMFFC ball tomorrow night. I do hope you were intending to include that in your report.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes and swore internally. I\u2019d forgotten all about our damn watcher. \u201cIf I\u2019d gotten the chance to make a report, I would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, of course, believe that implicitly.\u201d Her voice was dry. \u201cI have the information you requested, but with the privacy requirements of this investigation, I will not be sending it to you, electronically or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Meaning I\u2019d have to meet the bitch. Great. I rubbed my aching head wearily. \u201cWhere and when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark Earth. Half an hour.\u201d</p><p>She hung up before I could answer. I swore again, this time out loud, then leaned forward and gave the driver the new address.</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t take long to get there. Azriel appeared the minute the cab stopped, catching my hand and holding me steady as I climbed out, then just as quickly releasing me. Even so, the memory of his fingers against my skin seemed to linger, teasing imagination and desire.</p><p>Damn it, this avoidance\u2014on both our parts\u2014just couldn\u2019t go on. I might not want to confront whatever it was that was actually happening between us, but it was getting clearer and clearer that I would have to. For the sake of my sanity, if nothing else.</p><p>But not yet, that voice inside whispered. Not yet.</p> <p>It seemed my inner voice was very much a coward.</p><p>Barkley Street was a hive of activity. Half of Brunswick had apparently decided to shop here tonight, which surely meant that getting into the club via its secret entrance without anyone seeing us would be that much harder. I couldn\u2019t wrap the shadows around me like a vampire, after all, and I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to take Aedh form. Not when the Raziq were actively hunting me.</p><p>But as we neared the nook, the buzz of magic began to crawl across my skin and the shadows within seemed dense and forbidding. It was a place that repelled inspection rather than inviting it. I couldn\u2019t even see the door, although it was little more than an arm\u2019s length away.</p><p>Hunter suddenly appeared out the darkness. She looked me up and down, then said, \u201cNice to see you\u2019re prompt about some things.\u201d</p><p>Her voice gave as little away as her expression, but that still didn\u2019t stop the tremor that ran down my spine. I was entering a club that catered to vampires with a blood whore addiction, and I was doing so with one of the most powerful vampires in Australia. I was insane.</p><p>Thank god I wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Her gaze went to Azriel. \u201cYou\u2019re allowing me to see your true form. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose I hunt always see my true form,\u201d he replied evenly.</p><p>A comment that briefly made me wonder if he was, in some way, hunting me, despite his assurances to the contrary. It would certainly explain why I saw his real form when generally I only saw whatever form the reapers took on.</p><p>Hunter raised dark eyebrows, amusement glowing in her green eyes but not actually altering her otherwise remote expression. \u201cAre you suggesting my mortal soul is in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you do not possess cannot be in danger.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. It was a rich, warm sound that nevertheless sent another round of chills down my spine. \u201cI like you, reaper. Very much.\u201d</p><p>With that, she turned and walked back into the nook, becoming one with the shadows. I hesitated, glancing up and down the street to see if anyone was paying any attention. No one was\u2014unfortunately. As Azriel\u2019s fingers touched my spine and urged me forward, I took a deep breath and followed the bitch inside.</p><p>The dual fire of the swords peeled back the darkness and provided glimpses of Hunter ahead. Amaya was hissing again, the sound a constant static in the background of my mind. She didn\u2019t like this place any more than I did.</p><p>The heavy door at the end of the corridor swung open as we approached\u2014Hunter and Azriel silently, me with more of a clatter\u2014and Brett Marshall himself appeared to greet us. Or rather, to greet Hunter.</p><p>\u201cMistress,\u201d he said softly, kneeling before her, head bowed. \u201cAll is ready.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. Mistress? Was Marshall one of Hunter\u2019s fledglings? It would certainly explain their similar mannerisms. And why he\u2019d been trusted to run an establishment like this.</p><p>Then the rest of his words registered. All is ready? What the hell did that mean?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know, and I suddenly had a bad feeling that I didn\u2019t want to find out.</p><p>Hunter touched Marshall\u2019s head lightly as she swept past him, and he shuddered in what almost looked like orgasmic pleasure. Then he was up and following her, not even bothering to look at us. In the scheme of things, I guess we were not that important.</p><p>The woman at the desk looked almost identical to the woman who\u2019d been there earlier. Only her shoes were different\u2014red instead of black. I wondered if they were twins, or whether Marshall simply preferred a certain look.</p><p>The next set of doors opened and the stink of vampire, booze, and lust hit like a hammer, snatching my breath and sending me stumbling. Azriel caught me again, his grip gentle yet strong, filled with a heat that leapt from his skin to mine. It chased away the fear, chased away the aches, and this time I didn\u2019t immediately pull away from the sensation. I very much suspected I\u2019d need that inflow of strength if I was going to make it through the hours ahead.</p><p>We moved deeper into the club, heading not toward Marshall\u2019s office but rather toward the elevators. The blue and purple fire of the swords pierced the shadows, briefly illuminating the gaunt faces and haunted, glowing eyes of the vampires closest to us. Hunger was rife in the room, so thick I could have carved it with a knife. I edged a little closer to Azriel and wondered why Hunter had chosen this place, of all damn places, to meet. She was the one who\u2019d warned it would be dangerous for me to be here at night, and yet here she was, risking the life of someone she supposedly valued.</p><p>It is merely another form of warning, Azriel said.</p><p>I glanced at him. Of what? Behave, or you\u2019ll be vampire meat?</p><p>Yes. His gaze met mine. She does not like your offhand manner in dealing with her.</p><p>I snorted softly. She can read my thoughts\u2014she has to know I\u2019m scared shitless by her, and that my manner is nothing more than false bravado.</p><p>She can read some thoughts, but not all. He half shrugged. She has been alive a very long time. It becomes very easy for the old ones not only to lose humanity, but to expect certain levels of deference.</p><p>Subservience, you mean.</p><p>If she expected subservience, you would be dead.</p><p>I half smiled\u2014an expression that quickly died as I followed Hunter and Marshall into the elevator. Being stuck in a small metal box with those two and going down into the bowels of what had become little more than an abattoir was not my idea of a good time. But if I edged any closer to Azriel, I\u2019d be crawling into his pockets. What did you mean, some thoughts, not all?</p><p>Just that.</p><p>So the nano cells are working? I knew they were, but I still needed reassurance\u2014at least when it came to Hunter.</p><p>Yes. She is only picking up minor bits and pieces.</p><p>My gaze searched his for a moment. How the hell do you know this? I mean, Hunter\u2019s no slouch when it comes to telepathy, and I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d have easy access into her mind.</p><p>I\u2019m a reaper. The human\u2014and non-human\u2014mind is open to us in all its chaotic glory.</p><p>So what can you tell me about Marshall\u2019s comment?</p><p>We go to meet others.</p><p>The elevator doors opened, revealing the basic metal corridor of the feeding rooms. Others? I asked silently, then glanced at Hunter. \u201cWhy the hell are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to see this room of ghosts,\u201d she said, as she stepped out of the elevator. \u201cAnd it is as good a place as any to discuss what you need to know.\u201d</p><p>The others wait in that room. There are three\u2014all vampires.</p><p>I hardly expected them to be anything else, given the place we were in, but the point was, why the hell were they there?</p><p>They are there to see you. To talk to you.</p><p>Oh god, I thought with sudden clarity. It\u2019s the council. Or part of the council. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was it a trap? It couldn\u2019t be. Hunter wanted to use me; she didn\u2019t want me dead.</p><p>But Hunter wasn\u2019t the council. She didn\u2019t control it. Not yet.</p><p>I licked my lips and reluctantly trailed after her.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to that room isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d In more ways than one. And yet I couldn\u2019t retreat, couldn\u2019t run. Hunter might be striding purposefully toward the feeding room, but there was a coiled readiness in every moment. She would react\u2014fast and brutally\u2014if I ran. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re ghosts doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re incapable of understanding everything that goes on in that room. If we discuss anything there, they might just pass the information on to whatever is causing this.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at me. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. That wasn\u2019t exactly the answer I\u2019d been expecting. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a little slow, but wouldn\u2019t the ghosts passing on the information mean the killer may run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it is a Rakshasa, as your reaper suspects, then I doubt it. They are creatures drawn to the dark energies of death, despair, and revenge, and there are few places in Melbourne that hold those in great abundance. It will continue to be drawn here while it is in its feeding stage, regardless of the threat we pose.\u201d</p><p>I studied her curiously as we stopped near the doors to the bigger feeding room and the three people who waited inside. \u201cYou\u2019ve come across them before?\u201d</p> <p>She looked down her nose at me\u2014no mean feat when she was actually shorter than me. \u201cI have lived a very long time, and I\u2019ve hunted far greater nightmares than a Rakshasa.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d be right at the top of any sane person\u2019s nightmare list, I thought grimly, and saw her green eyes flash dangerously. With the way my luck had been running of late, it was no surprise she caught that particular thought.</p><p>Marshall opened the door for us. The room was the same sterile, ghost-filled place it had been before, only this time the smell of antiseptic wasn\u2019t as strong. Marshall had stopped the use of this room.</p><p>But this time the ghosts were not the only beings in the room.</p><p>All three were long, thin strips of humanity. There were two men and one woman, different in looks and nationalities, but all sharing two common traits\u2014a fierce, cold-blooded glow in their eyes and a cruel twist to their mouths.</p><p>I\u2019d thought Hunter was the most dangerous person on earth. Seemed I was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cMarshall, close the door, please,\u201d Hunter commanded. As he obeyed, she joined the three in the center of the room, then swung around to face me. If she sensed the ghosts, she had no reaction to them.</p><p>\u201cI have the list of those who have died in this room,\u201d she said without preamble. \u201cBut the Cazadors will chase that avenue. What else do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>She made no effort to introduce her companions, and they remained silent, studying me with cold intent. Chills raced up and down my spine, and Amaya hissed in useless fury. I flexed my fingers, and tried to concentrate on the business at hand. I had a bad feeling that I would find out what was going on soon enough.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you have no intention of telling me how many died in this room.\u201d I took one step closer to her and the ghosts, then stopped. The bitter, bloody anger that surged around me struck as sharply as any whip. My flesh shuddered under the impact of it, and I half wondered if my already battered body would gain yet another rainbow of bruises to add to its collection.</p><p>\u201cThat is not something you need to know.\u201d</p><p>My gaze flicked to the vampires on either side of her. The energy that poured off them felt dark and coiled. I licked my lips and said, \u201cWhat about the autopsy reports? Can I see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing in those reports that disagrees with what you already know. All five victims were torn apart and half consumed, and the poison used could not be identified.\u201d</p><p>Frustration and fear swirled through me. \u201cI wanted to see the reports so I can read them myself. If I\u2019d simply needed questions answered, I would have asked them.\u201d</p> <p>Step warily, Risa, Azriel warned. I do not think it wise to be too antagonistic toward Hunter in front of her peers.</p><p>Once again my gaze flicked across the three, and I had the sudden sensation of snakes about to strike. I shivered.</p><p>\u201cThere are no files, Risa. Every report comes to me verbally. As I\u2019ve said, I will not risk this investigation\u2014or these clubs\u2014becoming a matter of public knowledge.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms, but resisted the urge to rub the chill from them. \u201cOkay, did all five victims come from a similar social and economic background?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I waited, but she wasn\u2019t forthcoming with any further information. Which was damn annoying given that they supposedly wanted this case solved, and wanted my help to do it.</p><p>A slight smile teased her lips. The bitch might not be reading my mind, but she was certainly reading my reactions to this whole situation and enjoying them. And while she wanted my help to find the keys and\u2014to a lesser extent, it seemed\u2014to hunt down this killer, she was also very much a cat toying with a mouse it might yet decide to eat.</p><p>If the three council members didn\u2019t devour me first.</p><p>\u201cThe first two victims had high-profile jobs in the advertising industry,\u201d she drawled eventually. \u201cThe third was little more than a pen pusher in the local government\u2019s vampire affairs department. The last two were living off charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the first two victims were high profile, why did they come to a place like this? You\u2019ve inferred this is not one of your more up-market blood whore clubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBut there are some who do not wish their addiction to be known in the wider vampire community, and so they attend clubs that they would otherwise consider beneath them.\u201d</p><p>Vamps like the first two victims might not want their addiction known, but in coming to this particular club, they\u2019d served that information up to Hunter on a silver platter. And I had no doubt that she would use it to her own advantage. \u201cHow long has each of the victims been addicted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll five were long-term addictives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine \u2018long-term.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cCenturies rather than years.\u201d</p><p>That raised my eyebrows. For some reason I\u2019d been thinking blood whores were a modern phenomenon, but I guess it made sense that they\u2019d been around almost as long as vampires. After all, addictions had been alive as long as humanity\u2014it was just the substances that had changed over time.</p><p>\u201cMeaning the Rakshasa could be specifically targeting those who have caused the most suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a possibility.\u201d Her tone suggested it was one they\u2019d already thought of.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe all you have to do is tell longtime addictives to avoid the club until this thing is either caught or goes away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d she said heavily, \u201cis extremely naive thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s what you get when you expect a restaurateur to become a hunter.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes flashed again, and Amaya\u2019s hissing suddenly sharpened\u2014one bitch wanting to taste another\u2019s blood.</p><p>I shivered again, suddenly realizing I was beginning to understand the static language of my demon sword. That was almost as scary as the four people who stood so elegantly in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou are far more than just a restaurateur, Risa, and we both know it. Although your current level of questioning is more than a little disappointing.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so worried about disappointing her right now\u2014which was probably proof of my insanity\u2014but rather the three silent council members. The tightly coiled energy radiating off them seemed to be getting stronger\u2014even the ghosts were reacting to it. The moaning and wailing had sharpened to a continuous shriek that vibrated through every part of my being. Between it and Amaya, I felt like I was being torn apart by sound.</p><p>I took a deep breath and tried to ignore the assault on my senses, tried to think more like Aunt Riley. There had to be some similarities in all five murders besides this room and the manner of their deaths. If there was one thing I\u2019d gleaned over the years from hanging around two guardians, it was the fact that most killings had a particular pattern, even if it wasn\u2019t immediately evident.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, what about the times of their deaths?\u201d</p><p>Hunter paused. \u201cAll between the hours of two and three. An exact time of death could not be determined due to the extensive damage done to the bodies.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cDoes that mean you also have no idea when the inhibitor was introduced via the scratches? Or where it was applied?\u201d</p><p>Marshall said, \u201cI checked the security footage. All the victims bore scratches when they left this club, but this is not entirely unusual.\u201d</p><p>They had good cameras installed if they could pick up minor scratches. \u201cNo, but in this situation, it\u2019s definitely another link. What time did they all leave the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll five left at different times.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cSo had they been here feeding beforehand for very long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cAs has been noted, they were long-term addictives. Unfortunately, the longer the term, the greater the need.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t unusual when it came to any sort of addiction, but we weren\u2019t talking about an inanimate substance here; we were talking about human life. I couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cBut surely there comes a time when such an addiction becomes too dangerous for both the abuser and the vampire population in general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Hunter said, her expression impassive yet cold. \u201cAnd when that happens, it is dealt with appropriately.\u201d</p><p>Meaning good-bye addictive. I rubbed my arms. \u201cSo what time did they all stop using these rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll four were stopped from using the facilities just after one a.m.\u201d</p><p>And the hour between midnight and one was witching hour\u2014the hour when all things dark and dangerous came out to play.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Azriel said softly, \u201cis a possible link.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter\u2019s eyebrows rose delicately. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He regarded her steadily, and I suddenly wished I could read his thoughts. I had the distinct impression they\u2019d be very interesting right now.</p><p>He ignored her question and asked instead, \u201cWere blood whores killed in this room the nights the addicted vampires were murdered?\u201d</p> <p>Marshall glanced at Hunter and, at her nod, said, \u201cYes. In each case there were fatalities.\u201d</p><p>So much for the whores being well looked after, I thought, as anger surged. My gaze flicked to the silent three, and I felt an answering rise of emotion in them\u2014anger or hunger, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure which. But in this situation, one was as deadly as the other. I returned my attention to Hunter and fought for calm.</p><p>Azriel stepped closer, his shoulder pressing against mine. I didn\u2019t know if it was for my benefit or theirs, and I didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cThen that is the link,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hour between midnight and one is a very powerful time. When bloodshed is combined with anger and the desperation for revenge, it becomes a call few dark ones could resist. I\u2019m surprised only the Rakshasa has answered.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cSo if the bloodshed stopped, the Rakshasa would be less likely to appear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat,\u201d Hunter said immediately, \u201cis never going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even to save lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe object here is not to save the lives of people I care less than zero about, but to find this thing and stop it. As your reaper will no doubt confirm, the Rakshasa will just move on to less tasty hunting fields if we are not successful here. Such is the nature of a killer.\u201d</p><p>And the five of them would know all about that. \u201cSo what do you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and it was the smile of a predator whose prey had just stepped neatly into a trap.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t answer. The tallest of the three councillors, a thin man with dark auburn hair and muddy, empty eyes, stepped forward.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we expect\u201d\u2014his voice was like silk, smooth and sensuous\u2014\u201cis for you to be here every night from midnight to dawn to wait for this thing to appear.\u201d</p><p>Horror spread through me. Spend half the night here? Every night? With a room filled with blood-addicted vampires above me and a bloodbath around me?</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d The words were out before I\u2019d really thought about them, and that coiled sense of darkness sharpened abruptly. For several seconds I couldn\u2019t even breathe.</p><p>\u201cThe sanity of the council may be a debatable point, but it is not the question we seek to answer here,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou and your pet reaper will wait here for this thing, and then you will stop it by whatever means necessary.\u201d</p><p>I felt Azriel\u2019s move before he even made it, and pressed a hand against the flat of his stomach, stopping him. But his anger surged past me, churning the ghosts into a frenzied dance of horror.</p><p>The councillors seemed unmoved.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked bluntly. \u201cI thought the keys were the priority, not this thing. If I die here, those keys will remain out of your reach forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you do not stop this thing within the next seventy-two hours, the end result will be the same.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned, confused. \u201cWhat result?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe keys. If you do not find this killer, then the keys will slip away from our grasp regardless.\u201d</p><p>Fear slithered through the confusion. \u201cAnd, why, exactly, would you think that?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but there was nothing pleasant about it. \u201cBecause the council recently took a vote on your situation. The decision was deadlocked, three for killing, three against, three undecided.\u201d</p><p>My gaze swept them. These three. I swallowed heavily.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he said flatly, \u201cyou have precisely seventy-two hours to prove your worth as a hunter to us, or an execution order will be issued.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cTouch her, and you die,\u201d Azriel said, his voice as flat as the councillor\u2019s, but somehow far more deadly.</p><p>The councillor merely smiled. \u201cI know enough about reapers to understand that would not be a wise choice on your part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not strictly a reaper, and I am not bound by all their rules.\u201d</p><p>The councillor raised an eyebrow and looked somewhat disbelieving, but Hunter touched his hand, then said, \u201cKilling Odale will only sway opinion further against you. After all, you are apparently the one person who can find these keys\u2014and there is some belief among the council that it would be better to leave the keys lost than to have anyone else gain them.\u201d</p><p>An opinion I actually agreed with, except for the fact that in their version, it meant me dying. That bit I wasn\u2019t so keen on.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were on my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am.\u201d She shrugged lightly. \u201cI believe it would be to our benefit to keep you alive and find those keys, but votes ebb and flow, as does power. Right now\u2014thanks to the fear and uncertainty these keys have raised\u2014the tide of opinion has swung many against my belief of your usefulness. You need to prove otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Or die. Fantastic options, I had to say. \u201cThree days is hardly long enough. I mean, what if this thing doesn\u2019t front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will. It may have taken five victims within a week, but its hunger will still be great. Track it to its lair, Risa, and kill it. Prove to these three\u2014and to the council at large\u2014that I\u2019m right. Prove that you can be the asset I have said you will be.\u201d</p><p>Great. Now she was using me to cement her power. I thrust a hand through my hair. \u201cI can\u2019t stay in this room. Not while vamps are feeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Marshall?\u201d</p><p>He turned and moved to the far side of the room. A keypad sat there, looking oddly out of place in the sterile whiteness of the room. He pressed in a code, and beside him a door slid open. Beyond it was a small box-shaped room.</p><p>\u201cIt is fully shielded,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cNo vampire will sense your presence in there, no matter how strong their telepathic skills might be.\u201d</p><p>Meaning I was safe from Hunter\u2019s intrusions? Somehow I doubted that. \u201cAnd why would you have a room like that installed in a place like this?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It wasn\u2019t pleasant. \u201cBecause there are some who like to watch.\u201d</p><p>Horror crawled through me. She liked to watch. God. I licked my lips and tried to ignore the thickening sensation of fear. \u201cHow do I get out of this place once dawn rises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a door-release button within. Use that if the Rakshasa appears. Otherwise, Marshall will retrieve you.\u201d She took a step forward, the movement fluid and elegant. \u201cWatch carefully, dear Risa, and pass the tests. I really would prefer for you to remain alive for a while yet.\u201d</p><p>Her warning suggested there would be more than just one test. I glanced at the man she\u2019d identified as Odale, and saw the anticipation flicker through the dead space of his eyes. Whatever else they had in mind, it would be bloody. I swallowed heavily, shoved intuition back into its box, and said, \u201cYeah, so would I.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and swept rather regally from the room, the three councillors following silently in her wake. The dark energy of their presence seemed to linger long after they\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d Marshall said, the sudden sound of his voice making me jump. \u201cYou need to step inside. Our first customer will arrive in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Oh god. I closed my eyes for a moment, then, with Amaya spitting fire all over the place, I forced my feet forward and entered the box-room. It was even smaller than it looked, barely big enough to hold two chairs. Interestingly, there was a camera discreetly placed in one corner, and the back wall was not only padded, but had hand grips. I didn\u2019t want to know why. I really didn\u2019t\u2014but that didn\u2019t stop my imagination throwing up all sorts of sick possibilities.</p><p>The door whooshed shut and the darkness closed in. As did fear.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Azriel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fucking not,\u201d I snapped. Amaya\u2019s hissing increased, buzzing through my brain like a saw, sharp and hungry. Her fire spilled across the darkness, giving it a creepy glow. I took a deep breath and exhaled it slowly. It didn\u2019t do a whole lot to ease either her noise or the tension and dread roiling around inside me. \u201cSorry. This isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut that does not mean I cannot help you.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him for a minute, then said, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not need to be here to watch. I can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice thought, but there\u2019s one problem.\u201d I pointed at the camera. \u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones watching. And we have no idea whether it\u2019s Marshall, Hunter, or those fucking councillors behind that camera.\u201d Hell, for all I knew, they could be recording everything we said, as well.</p><p>\u201cI could find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what good would knowing do? It doesn\u2019t alter the fact that I have to stay here for the entire evening.\u201d</p><p>He fell silent, but the room beyond suddenly wasn\u2019t. The ghosts began to moan, the sound one of agitation and horror. It crawled across my skin like a rash, making me itch. Making me shiver.</p><p>Then came the sound of footsteps. Two pairs entering, one leaving. A blood whore being delivered. My stomach began to churn. I couldn\u2019t listen to this. I really couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Azriel said, and touched two fingers to my forehead lightly. \u201cSleep, Risa. I will guard this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d But the protest died on my lips. Sleep closed in and I knew no more.</p><p>I woke hours later, feeling stiff and less than refreshed. The scent of blood was heavy in the air, mingling with the stench of antiseptic. In the other room, someone whistled tunelessly, the sound grating across waking nerves.</p><p>I stretched, trying to work the kinks out of my body, and realized I was lying across the two chairs, my back against the padded wall and my coat under my head. I opened my eyes. Azriel leaned against the far wall, underneath the camera. His arms were crossed and his eyes were hooded. But a strange red-purple fire flickered along Valdis\u2019s sharp sides. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should be angry at you for knocking me out like that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut all I want to know is, can you force me to do things other than making me sleep?\u201d</p><p>His gaze met mine briefly, then pulled away. \u201cIf I could, you can be assured that I would have by now.\u201d</p><p>I could hear no lie in his words, and relief slithered through me. I pushed rather stiffly upright and said, \u201cI\u2019m gathering nothing happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlenty happened,\u201d he said, his voice harsh. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the sort of action we seek.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him sharply. \u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He flicked a hand toward the other room. \u201cWhat happens in that room is beyond an abomination. Yet there is nothing I can do about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReaper rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReaper rules,\u201d he agreed grimly. \u201cSometimes, I wish\u2014\u201d He stopped, then shrugged. \u201cBut I cannot. This perversity is one of human nature, and therefore it is something I am not able to stop.\u201d</p><p>I swung my feet off the other chair, wincing a little as stiff muscles protested the movement. \u201cWhy the anger now? Why not before, when we first discovered the truth about this room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore there were merely words and ghosts. Tonight, there was death, and a soul being set free by the brutal death of her body. Blood whores may be well aware of the risks involved in their addiction, but those who work here are not. It goes against every instinct to simply stand here and listen to that happen, Risa.\u201d</p><p>I studied him for a moment, wishing I could comfort him but not exactly sure he would welcome it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cThis atrocity was not of your doing.\u201d</p> <p>No, but I was the reason he was here to witness it. I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m gathering the Rakshasa didn\u2019t appear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But Hunter is right\u2014it is still in its feeding stage. It will appear sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Great, except I didn\u2019t have much of a later, thanks to the council threatening to kill me if I didn\u2019t catch this thing within the next seventy-two hours. And six of those hours had already slipped by. \u201cWhat will we do if it doesn\u2019t appear tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cBut the council will not kill you. I will ensure that.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cBecause you need me alive to find the keys, right?\u201d</p><p>I said it teasingly, but his only response was a flash of annoyance. He pushed away from the wall and said sharply, \u201cMarshall comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened before I was entirely sure what I\u2019d been about to say. Marshall appeared, smelling and looking a whole lot fresher than I did. \u201cI take it our Rakshasa did not make an appearance?\u201d</p> <p>He said it testily, as if it were our fault. \u201cIf it had,\u201d I retorted, standing up, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t still be fucking here.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose at my tone. \u201cMy, my, a little irritable this morning, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stiff, sore, and tired, and I just want to get out of this house of horrors before I\u2019m tempted to violence.\u201d</p><p>Amusement touched his thin lips. \u201cThat would not be wise in this place. Not if you wish to leave it alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall, you have no idea just what I\u2019m capable of. Now, can we cut this dance and just get out of here?\u201d</p><p>His gaze skimmed me before it slipped to Azriel. He might not be worried about me, but the same could not be said when it came to my reaper. He shrugged and said, \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>The smell of antiseptic was stronger out in the main room, but it wasn\u2019t fully cleaned. I tried to ignore the broken bits of humanity that still lay scattered about the floor, but I could hardly ignore the stench of blood and the horrified moaning of the ghosts. Not when I was forced to walk through them. It was a wall of misery and fierce anger, and it cloaked me like a shroud, suffocating me.</p><p>Somehow, I controlled the urge to run. Somehow, I got out of that hellhole without giving in to the desire to draw Amaya and shed some blood and body parts myself.</p><p>I glanced at my watch when we got to the street above. It was barely six, far too early to go get those tickets from Mike.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go back to the hotel and grab a shower, and then I\u2019ll need to shop for tonight.\u201d I glanced at Azriel. \u201cDo you need to visit Jak to assume his identity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His expression was back to giving little away. \u201cBut I can do that later, once you are safely back at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and dragged out my phone to call a cab. Amazingly, it arrived within a couple of minutes and in no time at all I was back at the hotel and washing the stink of death from my body.</p><p>The rest of the day went by quickly. I shopped for clothes and shoes, purchasing not only items for the gala, but enough to see me through several more days. Then I bought a new cell phone and headed to Mike\u2019s to grab the tickets. He wasn\u2019t in, so the stay wasn\u2019t long. I rang Jak on the way back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have the tickets in hand,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI did a little more research on Mr. Elusive. It appears the real Nadler was married fifteen years ago. It only lasted a couple of months, but she might be the one person who can give us some decent information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning she\u2019s still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, yes. Obviously, if we are dealing with a face-shifter, then he either didn\u2019t know about her or didn\u2019t think she was enough of a threat to his takeover of Nadler\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she may not be able to tell us much.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. \u201cAre you kidding me? You\u2019re a prime example of just how well you women can hold a grudge against a lover who has spurned you in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was holding a grudge, I wouldn\u2019t have come to you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie,\u201d he said equably. \u201cYou came to me because you needed me, and no grudge, no matter how well cherished, was going to get in your way. Simple as that.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t exactly deny that statement when it was the complete truth. So I simply said, \u201cHave you managed to track down the wife\u2019s current location?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly have,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWant to meet me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. If you\u2019ll share where \u2018there\u2019 is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d He paused, and in the background, paper rustled, meaning he was flipping through his notebook. He\u2019d never really taken to the electronic kind\u2014he\u2019d always said they were too easy to steal. Although if his rat-gang story had been stolen, then his scribbling barely legible notes in a book wasn\u2019t exactly foolproof, either. \u201cOkay, she\u2019s a waitress at Dino-Bar over on Swan Street. She works the morning shift and takes a break about one, so our timing should be perfect if we both head there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe divorce obviously didn\u2019t go well if she\u2019s forced to waitress for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was nasty, from all the reports. He got the better lawyers, and they really did a number on her.\u201d</p><p>And a bitter woman was more likely to tell tales. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in about twenty, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRighto.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. I told the taxi to wait as we drew up beside the hotel, then dashed inside to dump my purchases. Within minutes I was on my way again, heading to Swan Street.</p><p>Jak was waiting for me outside the Dino-Bar. Which was, I noted with some annoyance, a male strip club. Just what I needed when my hormones were so primed for action. Obviously, my annoyance showed in my expression, because he held up his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not a deliberate choice on my part. I had no idea it was a male strip club until I got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a general pissed-off look, not one specifically aimed at you.\u201d I studied the plain, yet oddly gaudy facade. The Dino-Bar was obviously not one of your more up-market strip clubs. \u201cAre you going to have a problem getting inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014all sexual orientations are welcome, from what I\u2019ve briefly seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get inside.\u201d</p><p>He touched my back, guiding me. Heat crawled from the epicenter of that light touch, spreading through me in wicked waves.</p><p>I swallowed heavily and did my best to ignore the sensation. The interior was dark, and smelled of humanity, booze, and arousal. The building was wider than it was long, the bar along the left wall and a high stage dominating the back. Two men in cages were gyrating to a slow, heavy beat, their movements mechanical and about as far from sexy as you could get\u2014at least to this half werewolf\u2019s eyes. But apparently I was the only one who thought that, because the crowd gathered beneath them was whistling and catcalling.</p><p>Jak guided me to the bar, ordered two beers, then put down some extra cash. \u201cWe need to speak to Jacinta Nadler.\u201d</p><p>The barman studied him for several moments, then nodded and swept up the notes. \u201cShe\u2019s on a break. I\u2019ll call her out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be at that table over there,\u201d Jak said, pointing with his chin toward the far corner.</p><p>The barman nodded and ambled over to the phone. We picked up our drinks and took them to our table. He studied me for several seconds over the rim of his glass, then said, \u201cWhy is a wolf as hot as you so damn frustrated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said heavily, \u201cis none of your damn business.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m a reporter. Puzzles are my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this one. Not any longer.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up as a woman approached our table. She was small and shapely, with ample breasts and thick blond hair. She was also almost naked\u2014paisley flowers covered her nipples, and the only other thing she wore was a glittery G-string. As Jak had said earlier, the club seemed to cater to all sexual orientations. Both sexes worked the floor, and the scantily clad females got as much attention as the males.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d she said, her voice raspy and her brown gaze jumping warily between the two of us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jak drew out his wallet and showed her his press pass.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cFucking press. Man, I\u2019ve done enough talking to you lot.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go, but I reached out and stopped her. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a story on your ex. We want to out him for the bastard he is.\u201d</p> <p>She sneered, obviously unimpressed by this bit of news. \u201cHe\u2019ll wipe the floor with you. And then he\u2019ll get his press buddies to complete the hatchet job.\u201d She eyed Jak. \u201cYou, my friend, won\u2019t even be able to get a job at McDonald\u2019s afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I doubt that\u2019ll happen,\u201d Jak said calmly. \u201cI\u2019ve got more than a few friends of my own.\u201d</p><p>She studied him for several more seconds, then drew up a chair and sat down. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>We both nodded, and she relaxed slightly. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you can tell us about your brief time with him. Who he associated with, what companies he had at the time, who his friends were, and what he really did to you and your family.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile was bitter. \u201cThat could take more time than I get for a break. And I know squat about his businesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell us what you can.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>She eyed me, distrust obvious, then shrugged and began talking. Her story proved to be more than a little harrowing\u2014she\u2019d barely been eighteen when she\u2019d met Nadler, and had been attracted to both his power and his money\u2014the same power and money that had all but destroyed her. Even Jak looked a little sickened by the end of it all.</p><p>\u201cIf you hated him so much, why not change your name?\u201d I asked curiously. It\u2019d be one of the first things I would have done had I been in her position.</p><p>Of course, if I\u2019d been in her position, I probably would have shoved a hand into his chest and ripped his black heart out.</p><p>Jacinta grimaced. \u201cBecause \u2018Nadler\u2019 is easier to say than my maiden name\u2014Gutierrez.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a man who did everything he could to ruin your life. Even if you hated your maiden name, you could have changed it to something else. Why keep his?\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in her eyes. Shame, perhaps. \u201cI kept it because it annoyed him.\u201d</p><p>There was more to it than that, I thought, studying her. \u201cMoney.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at me sharply. Jacinta Nadler, I suspected, had never been the innocent she portrayed herself to be.</p><p>\u201cHe paid you to keep it, didn\u2019t he?\u201d It was a guess, but I knew it was right.</p><p>She looked away. \u201cI deserved it after what he put me through. And if keeping his name meant I got it, what harm is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would he want you to keep it?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cWhy do you think? Men like that never like losing their possessions. At least this way, he retained the illusion of ownership.\u201d</p> <p>I wondered what other terms she\u2019d agreed to. Wondered what had happened to the money. Surely she wouldn\u2019t be working in a place like this if she still possessed it.</p><p>Jak said, \u201cWhat about Nadler personally?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, did he have any particular habits\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cAside from smacking the shit out of me, you mean?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cNot really. Although he did love polo. Used to play it every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He stopped after the accident. His horse slipped in the mud and came down on top of him. Broke his arm and gashed his ankle pretty bad. He was lucky, though\u2014the only scar he got out of it was from the ankle wound. It would probably be barely noticeable by now.\u201d</p><p>Jak smiled at me. If it was barely noticeable, our face-shifter might not have bothered with it. We finally had an identifying mark.</p><p>Now all we had to do was actually find him.</p><p>I said, \u201cHave you got any photos of him that we could borrow?\u201d</p><p>She snorted softly. \u201cI burned every single one of them. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p><p>She eyed me for a moment, then added, \u201cHe\u2019s become something of a recluse of late, but if you want photos you should track down James Blake. He took the wedding photos\u2014you never know, he might have kept them.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jak. He was already writing the name in his notebook.</p><p>\u201cThanks for your help, Jacinta. We do appreciate it.\u201d I slipped her some cash, and she palmed it with practiced ease.</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you burn the bastard good and proper.\u201d</p><p>With that, she got up and left. I finished the last of my beer, then handed Jak one of the tickets for the ball. Azriel might be intending to take his place, but I needed to keep up the pretense and not make him suspicious. \u201cWe\u2019re at the same table, so I\u2019ll meet you inside around eight.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cUntil then, I\u2019ll run a search on the names Jacinta mentioned, and try to uncover some photos of the polo accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d I said dryly as I rose.</p><p>He gave me a smile that just about blinded me. \u201cOh, the fun will happen tonight. I intend to dance your shoes off, my girl.\u201d</p><p>And \u201cdancing\u201d just happened to be a wolf euphemism for sex. I snorted softly. \u201cYou\u2019re as hopeless as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing ventured, nothing gained,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to pay the bartender on the way out.\u201d</p><p>I did, then headed back to the hotel, where I promptly undressed, crawled into bed, and went to sleep.</p><p>The awareness of being watched woke me sometime later. For several minutes I didn\u2019t stir, letting my body wake and my senses capture the warmth of that sensation. It flowed through me like a river, teasingly sensuous.</p><p>But before I could fully react to it, it disappeared. Azriel knew I was awake.</p><p>Frustration swirled, deeper and stronger than before, but again, I squashed it and simply said, \u201cDid you catch all that info at the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His voice was as distant as ever. I sighed. \u201cThoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe information will only prove worthwhile once we pin down the face-shifter inhabiting Nadler\u2019s life. Until then, it does not help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but at least it\u2019s more than what we had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you visited Jak yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He is not home yet.\u201d</p><p>I twisted around to look at him. He was standing over near the window again\u2014a favorite spot, it seemed\u2014and despite what I\u2019d sensed when waking, his back was to me. For once, Valdis was as quiet as her master.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s not home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I checked five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I studied him a few moments longer, then sighed again and climbed out of the bed. He didn\u2019t look at me, though the awareness in the air seemed to sharpen. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better go get ready.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but there was no need to, either. By the time I\u2019d showered, changed my hair color to auburn, and tweaked my facial features enough so that anyone who knew me wouldn\u2019t recognize me, then got dressed and done my makeup\u2014which included body makeup to hide some of the bruises\u2014he\u2019d left.</p><p>I grabbed my purse and ticket and went downstairs to catch a taxi. The Central Pier function center, situated behind Etihad Stadium, was little more than a gigantic shed. A long line of taxis and limos waited in front of it, each taking its turn in dropping off passengers dressed to the nines and dripping in jewelry. A thief would have a field day, I thought, though it would be a bold thief who operated where several high-ranking members of the police force were present.</p><p>I climbed out of the taxi when it was my turn. The heated evening breeze whisked around me, playing with my dress and revealing teasing glimpses of my legs. The dress was demure by my standards\u2014and positively nunlike compared to Aunt Riley\u2019s\u2014but the bruises that littered my left side and back had forced more of a cover-up than normal. Not even body makeup was adequate to hide some of them. My right leg was the one place that wasn\u2019t rainbow-colored, and the long split up the side of the shimmery dark green dress made the most of that.</p><p>I made it inside without a problem and was escorted to my table. Azriel had already arrived and, for the first time, he was fully dressed. But the dark suit emphasized rather than downplayed his lean, muscular body, and he looked fantastic.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, rising as I approached the table.</p><p>Heat colored my cheeks and I had no idea why. It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t caught errant thoughts before\u2014and generally far worse than that. \u201cWhy bother with the pretense, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am actively projecting Jak\u2019s image to all in this room. Wearing his suit lessens the depth of detail I have to transmit, and makes it easier to maintain over a longer period.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out the chair for me, his fingers brushing my spine as I sat, just as Jak\u2019s would have. A tremor ran through me. This was dangerous. Possibly more so than if it had been the real Jak.</p><p>I placed my purse on the table, then picked up the water jug and poured a drink. Wine was not a good idea. I might not get drunk on the stuff, thanks to my werewolf constitution, but enough of it could certainly dull common sense, if only for the briefest time. Right now, with Azriel looking so good, I needed all the good sense I could get.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Frank Logan yet?\u201d I hadn\u2019t seen our lawyer on the way in, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>\u201cNot as yet. But I walked around when I first arrived. He\u2019s been placed two tables across to your left, next to the man wearing the odd toupee.\u201d</p><p>I looked around and restrained a laugh. The hairpiece in question sat on the gentleman\u2019s head like a scraggly gray cat ready to pounce on the next unfortunate person to pass by.</p><p>\u201cThat cannot possibly be the height of fashion,\u201d Azriel continued blandly.</p><p>I turned back and met his gaze. Just for a moment, humor and warmth teased his lips and crinkled the corners of his mismatched blue eyes, and my breath caught somewhere in my throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If I got through this evening without giving in to temptation, it was going to be a goddamn miracle.</p><p>I gulped down some water, then said, \u201cWhat about our Cazador watcher? Is he still around?\u201d</p><p>Azriel\u2019s gaze flicked past me for a moment. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>I resisted the urge to look over my shoulder. \u201cAnd does he follow us into the hotel room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He generally waits in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally\u201d meant not always. Great. Not that there was a lot I could do about it.</p><p>I drank some more water and glanced at my watch. Time seemed to be crawling by. I wasn\u2019t sure what else to say to Azriel, so I made small talk with the woman sitting on my left, and picked at the various courses as they came and went.</p><p>Frank Logan finally made an appearance just as they started the fund-raising auction. He was a big man with dark hair, a roman nose, thin lips, and a sharp chin.</p> <p>I leaned closer to Azriel and said, \u201cCan you listen to his thoughts from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d His expression was closed, giving little away. After several minutes, he said, \u201cSomeone has placed major barriers around his mind.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBut I thought the human mind was open to you to read, and that not even vampires could block you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t. And Logan isn\u2019t a vampire.\u201d</p><p>A point I was well aware of, so I didn\u2019t bother reacting to it. \u201cSo how come his mind is blocked? Why can\u2019t you get past it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t get past it, but the existence and strength of the barriers suggest whoever is behind them is well aware of just how a reaper operates.\u201d</p> <p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cAre the blocks aimed at reapers specifically? Because that would mean someone is aware that we\u2019re targeting Logan.\u201d</p><p>His gaze came to mine. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I took a deep breath, half listening to the auctioneer chattering on about the signed, framed football jumper they were auctioning. \u201cDoes that mean we\u2019ve wasted our time tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can break the barrier, but not without one-on-one contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning we have to catch him alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be hard at a function like this.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot necessarily. Is it not human nature to want to visit the bathroom after a large intake of alcohol?\u201d</p> <p>I glanced across at Logan. He\u2019d suddenly started guzzling beer like it was water. I met Azriel\u2019s gaze again. It was as impassive as ever, but deep in those blue depths, amusement lurked. \u201cYour doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis memories may have been blocked, but his control centers have not.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cBrilliant idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have them occasionally.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re modest to boot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the truth is hardly modest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it also suggests you\u2019ve had more than a few bad ideas.\u201d</p><p>There was a flicker in his eyes that spoke of regret. \u201cNo Mijai is infallible. That is why we are dark angels.\u201d</p><p>I half wondered what infallibility he was talking about, because I very much suspected it wasn\u2019t the actions that had made him a Mijai.</p><p>The auction finished and music started up. Logan rose and\u2014looking decidedly unsteady on his feet\u2014grabbed the hand of the blonde sitting next to him and dragged her toward the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should keep close to him?\u201d I asked, half fearing the answer would be no, and yet\u2014absurdly\u2014also fearing a yes.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t looking at me, but rather Logan. \u201cIt would be more advantageous if we were close. It will be easier to prevent others from following him into the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I took a deep breath and slowly released it. \u201cCan you dance?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cIf dancing requires little more than shuffling your feet from one side to the other, as many on that floor are currently doing, then yes.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over me. Shuffling from side to side was a whole lot more survivable than the close body contact I\u2019d been half imagining.</p><p>He rose and offered me his hand. My hesitation was brief, but nevertheless there, and again that annoyance flashed in his eyes. It made me wonder what energy Valdis was emitting, but for some reason his sword wasn\u2019t visible. I wasn\u2019t even sure he was wearing it. I was wearing Amaya, but she was always shadow-wreathed and therefore invisible.</p><p>\u201cI am never without Valdis,\u201d he said, one hand against my spine as he guided me toward the floor.</p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hides her form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hides it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe does not naturally shadow, as Amaya does, but she can hide her form when I need all of my energy.\u201d</p><p>We reached the edge of the dance floor. Logan was deep in the center of the crowd, so Azriel\u2019s hand slipped from my spine to my fingers, the movement sensual. Delight shivered through me.</p><p>As he led the way through the crush of people, the music abruptly changed from pop to a slow waltz. I eyed his broad back suspiciously. \u201cDid you do that?\u201d</p><p>He turned around, then pulled me closer. \u201cWould I do that?\u201d</p><p>Though his expression was still its usual bland self, there was an edge in his voice that had my pulse rate skipping. Or maybe that was simply his closeness, the way his body seemed to fit so well against mine, the play of his muscles against my skin as he moved in time to the music. The gentle caress of his fingers across my back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t even look at him. If I did...</p><p>I shivered again, feeling like I was being torn apart, my mind a tumult of conflicting emotions. Desire and fear waged a fierce war inside me and I couldn\u2019t predict which one would win. Or which one I wanted to win.</p><p>The waltz went on, and the dance became more sensual. I\u2019m not entirely sure how that happened, since our actual movement and position remained unchanged. But suddenly it was as if there were no one else in the room\u2014it was just me and him and the intimacy that was building between us.</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d he said softly, \u201clook at me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. My courage had come under attack from many avenues over the past few months, but I\u2019d never expected it to fail in the face of desire. I just couldn\u2019t meet his gaze. I feared what I would see, what I would have to acknowledge.</p><p>What it would lead to.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>This time, the demand in his voice was undeniable, and I found my gaze rising almost against my will.</p><p>My breath caught somewhere in my throat.</p><p>Because there in the blue of his eyes was a desire so stark and raw it burned my very soul.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot deny this, Risa,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou cannot deny us.\u201d</p><p>Oh god, oh god, oh god...</p><p>It was a litany that tumbled unchecked through my thoughts. I couldn\u2019t think any more than that, couldn\u2019t react, my brain and body held captive not just by what I saw in his eyes, but what I felt, as well.</p><p>Because what I felt was him. His energy, his being.</p><p>Against my skin and in my mind. He burned me, inside and out, making me tremble and ache and wish for... for what? Not sex, not exactly. More a completeness.</p><p>As if that made any sense.</p><p>I licked my lips and somehow managed to croak, \u201cIt could change everything between us, Azriel\u2014and may-be not in a good way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is possible\u2014maybe even probable. But what is acknowledged might also be controlled.\u201d</p><p>It might not, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tend to agree.\u201d</p><p>That rawness still burned me, making me ache for something I couldn\u2019t even begin to describe. \u201cThen why...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, a harsh edge of determination in his tone. \u201cI have no other choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are always choices,\u201d I said, quoting his own words back at him. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t seducing me break one of those many rules Mijai have?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t immediately reply, but his hand slid sensually down my spine and came to rest on my rump. The effect was electric\u2014a firestorm that ripped through my body, making me shudder, making me ache.</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d I stopped, not entirely sure what I was about to say. Not sure that I should say anything.</p><p>\u201cThe rules are very clear,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut sometimes the gain is worth the punishment.\u201d</p><p>And with that, his lips met mine.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a kiss. Not exactly. It was flesh against flesh, true, but it was a whole lot more. It was energy and spirit and desire all tied up in one gentle motion, and it made me fly and, at the same time, made me weak.</p><p>\u201cThis will not end here,\u201d he said, so softly that his words were little more than a sigh across my lips. \u201cIt cannot end here.\u201d</p><p>I still couldn\u2019t answer. I just stared at him, seeing the determination deep in those raw depths and wondering why he\u2019d forced the issue now and not before.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer those thoughts, but I didn\u2019t really expect him to. Instead, he stepped back, breaking the spell of his closeness. Cool air washed between us, and a gasp of surprise escaped my lips.</p><p>\u201cLogan moves,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>But his fingers slipped down to mine, and once again he was leading me through the crowd. I was glad of that light contact. I don\u2019t think I could have moved of my own accord.</p><p>There were several people between Logan and us in the corridor that led to the bathrooms, but all the men did an abrupt about-face and walked away. Hopefully, I thought with a smile, their bladders would hold.</p><p>Logan pushed the bathroom door open, and five seconds later we followed. Logan was in the process of getting the old boy out, and gave me an owlish look as he hastily did himself back up.</p><p>\u201cHere now, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d His words cut off and he fell silent.</p><p>Azriel glanced at me. \u201cLock the door.\u201d</p><p>I did so, then leaned back against it and crossed my arms. Azriel touched two fingers to Logan\u2019s forehead, and closed his eyes. For several minutes nothing happened. Then someone bashed on the door behind me, the suddenness of it making me jump. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe bathroom is closed for cleaning,\u201d I yelled. \u201cGive us ten minutes, or use the bathrooms on the other side of the building.\u201d</p><p>Muttered curses followed this statement, but the footsteps moved away.</p><p>Azriel stepped back from Logan, who didn\u2019t move or respond in any way. Azriel obviously still held his mind, keeping him unseeing and unhearing. \u201cI have a description of the man Logan knows as Nadler, but I suspect it is not the right one.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cBecause we\u2019re dealing with a face-shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because Logan\u2019s memory centers show signs of recent intrusion. Whoever Nadler is, he obviously doesn\u2019t want the form Logan sees to be known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuggesting he could be tracked through it.\u201d That is, if the description we pulled from Logan\u2019s memory was the right one, and not another means of subterfuge. If it wasn\u2019t, then all of this had been a waste of time.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Azriel commented.</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, wondering if he was referring to our dance or our actions with Logan. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted an answer\u2014especially if it referred to the former rather than the latter.</p> <p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is obvious that the person behind the reworking of Logan\u2019s memories is extremely powerful. Whoever it is also has enough knowledge about reapers to set up reasonably strong blocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I asked, sensing there was such a block in place.</p><p>\u201cIt was done sometime today.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cThey definitely knew we were going after Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He said it flatly, with no emotion in his voice or his expression, but nevertheless, my hackles rose. \u201cIf you name Lucian as a possible suspect, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d What? What threat could I possibly make to someone like him?</p><p>\u201cWhoever is behind the stealing of the key has been one step ahead of us for a while. Lucian is a suspect, whether you wish to acknowledge it or not.\u201d He held up a hand, cutting off the angry reply that was on my lips. \u201cBut there are other options. Jak knew we were going after Logan. As did your accountant.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cIt could hardly be Jak, since he knows nothing about reapers, and Mike only knew I wanted the tickets to get a reporter friend in. Neither of them is a very likely suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Which left us with Lucian. He didn\u2019t say the words, but they hung between us all the same.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him since I ordered him out of the apartment, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he has formed a telepathic link with you. He may never need to talk to you again.\u201d</p><p>And that, if his tone was anything to go by, would be an extremely welcome event. \u201cOnly trouble is,\u201d I retorted, \u201cit\u2019s a link that\u2019s become somewhat faulty.\u201d</p> <p>He studied me for a moment. Logan was still and silent behind him, and I briefly wondered if he would have any memory of what we were saying.</p><p>\u201cNo, he will not,\u201d Azriel said, then added, \u201cWhy is the link faulty? The connection between an Aedh and his lover usually only becomes stronger over the course of their brief time together, not weaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s faulty,\u201d I snapped back. \u201cBut apparently he can only read me during sex. I haven\u2019t had sex with him for over twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I fucking want to. He\u2019s a fantastic lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I should and shouldn\u2019t be doing when it comes to my love life, Azriel!\u201d I exploded. \u201cBecause no matter what happens between us, we both know you\u2019ll be gone once the keys are found and this mess is all sorted out. You\u2019ll never be anything more than a blip\u2014pleasurable or otherwise\u2014on the radar of my life.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything to that. I guess there was nothing he actually could say. It was the truth, pure and basic.</p><p>He turned around and touched Logan\u2019s forehead. The older man blinked several times, then swung around to face me.</p><p>\u201c\u2014come in here,\u201d he said, his voice hinting at anger.</p><p>I blinked, then realized he was finishing the sentence he\u2019d started when we first walked in. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cWrong bathroom.\u201d</p><p>I unlocked the door and left. Azriel was two steps behind me.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I lightly rubbed my arms\u2014there was a decided chill coming from his direction.</p><p>\u201cNow we see what happens when he leaves.\u201d</p><p>I half frowned, then remembered Ilianna\u2019s warning. \u201cWhy would anyone go to the trouble of tampering with his mind if they were intending to kill him tonight?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhy would anyone fuck a man she does not entirely trust?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I could only stare at him. Then the anger rose, so swift and sharp I had to dig my nails into my clenched fists to resist the urge to smack him.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I all but hissed, \u201cdespite all that is sane, I find myself wanting you.\u201d</p><p>And with that, I stalked away from him. He didn\u2019t follow. He didn\u2019t need to. He was connected to my chi and he could find me whenever he wanted.</p><p>Still, I was grateful for the brief respite. Once I\u2019d reached my table, I grabbed the wine bottle, filled a glass, and drank it swiftly. It didn\u2019t do a whole lot for the fury boiling inside me, and I half wondered just how many bottles it would take before it did. Probably more than the bar had in stock.</p><p>After five minutes or so, Logan approached his table, looking a little green around the gills. Obviously, his enforced consumption of alcohol was not sitting well.</p><p>He picked up his jacket, said good-bye to the blonde sitting next to him, then staggered toward the exit. I picked up my purse and followed.</p><p>The air outside was cool and thick with the scent of the nearby ocean. I shivered a little as I trailed after Logan, and I wasn\u2019t completely certain whether the cause was the chill in the air or the rising tide of my trepidation. Logan was taking more steps sideways than forward, but he was still moving at a decent pace, and in no time at all he\u2019d passed from the bright protection of the venue\u2019s entrance to the deeper street shadows.</p><p>The sense that something was about to happen grew. I scanned the streets around me, seeing nothing out of place. But in this darkness, would I?</p><p>And then it happened. A shot rang out.</p><p>Logan staggered and fell to his knees, just as a second shot sliced through the night. Something hit me from behind, and I found myself on the concrete, my heart racing and a fiercely warm body covering me.</p><p>\u201cAzriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second shot was aimed at us,\u201d he said. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>His weight lifted from mine as he winked out of existence. I studied the buildings around me for a moment, then pushed to my feet. If someone was going to shoot me, then they could hit me as easily lying down as standing up.</p><p>\u201cMr. Logan?\u201d I flared my nostrils, taking in the scents of the night.</p><p>Blood ran on it, thick and fresh.</p><p>He was dead. I knew he was dead, even though I couldn\u2019t see a reaper waiting to claim his soul. Still, I had to check. I approached slowly, but stopped several feet away. Logan had twisted as he\u2019d crumpled and his dead eyes were staring at me balefully. The bullet had entered his forehead and blasted its way through his head, leaving an exit wound bigger than my fist. Blood and bone and brain matter had splattered onto all the nearby surfaces.</p><p>Someone had wanted to make very sure that even in death, Logan\u2019s mind couldn\u2019t be read\u2014which all but confirmed that someone had been aware that we\u2019d been intending to speak to him. But how? And who?</p><p>Frowning, knowing they were questions I wasn\u2019t likely to get answers to anytime soon, I took out my phone and rang the cops. I should have rung Uncle Rhoan, but I really wasn\u2019t up to answering the questions that would undoubtedly follow.</p><p>Azriel reappeared as I hung up, his fierce expression suggesting things had not gone well.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t find the shooter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. He was stationed on top of the stadium roof, but by the time I got there, he\u2019d thrown himself off it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He glanced behind us. \u201cPeople are approaching. We should leave before we are seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel, I\u2019m a witness. I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten the councillors\u2019 edict?\u201d</p><p>I had. I closed my eyes, breathed deep, then glanced at my watch. It was close to twelve. Shit. \u201cI need to change,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cI\u2019m not going to that place dressed like this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just stepped close, took me in his arms, and whisked us both out of there. But the minute we were back in the hotel room, he stepped back. It didn\u2019t stop the awareness that trembled across my skin, nor did it ease the heat of desire shimmering between us. I might be angry with him, but that didn\u2019t stop me from wanting him.</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet changed,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cOr we\u2019ll be late\u2014and I suspect that would not be wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of things that wouldn\u2019t be wise,\u201d I muttered as I headed for the bathroom. \u201cBut I suspect that\u2019s not going to stop them from happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things are destined and can never be changed,\u201d he agreed flatly. \u201cNo matter how much we might wish otherwise.\u201d</p><p>I changed quickly into my jeans and sweater. \u201cAnd here I was thinking destiny was a fluid thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestiny is fluid,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes so is death. Logan was not destined to die this night, so his soul will roam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame you won\u2019t break that particular rule and talk to his soul.\u201d I glanced in the mirror, studying the not-me image. After a moment, I imagined my face with dark golden hair and a smattering of golden freckles across my nose, then reached down for the face-shifting energy and made it happen. Then I turned and walked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Azriel\u2019s gaze swept my face, and he nodded minutely. Meaning, I guessed, that he approved. \u201cWhy would we need to talk to his soul when we already have all the information he could give us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he actually didn\u2019t give us everything, since someone had tampered with his memories. But would those blocks hold after death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cIt is not something any of us have needed to discover.\u201d</p><p>I picked up my purse and slung it over my shoulder. \u201cDo you think it would be worth trying to find out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs I said, I cannot speak to the lost ones. It\u2019s not a matter of breaking some rule. We are physically not capable of speaking to them. They are lost\u2014to rebirth, and to us.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut you could most certainly attempt it.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t the training\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut the witch Adeline Greenfield suggested you had more of your mother\u2019s talents than you thought. Was not one of her specialties talking to the lost ones?\u201d</p><p>What he called lost ones\u2014people who died before their time\u2014I called ghosts. And no matter what Adeline had said, I\u2019d certainly had no luck trying to communicate with the ghosts at the club. \u201cMom talked to souls, yes, but I never got the impression she targeted ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else could she target?\u201d He said it gently, as if he were talking to a simpleton. \u201cSouls who die at their given time move on to either the light or dark path. There is no communicating with them once they have gone through the respective portals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, how was I to know that?\u201d I grumbled. I glanced at my watch. \u201cWe\u2019d better get moving\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d barely said it when he stepped close, caught me in his arms, and whisked me through the glorious brightness that was his gray fields. We re-formed in the small dark chamber next to the feeding room. The smell of antiseptic was thick in the air, catching in my throat and making me cough. They\u2019d obviously just cleaned up after a session. I closed my eyes for a moment, grateful to have at least missed that, then turned to face the camera and held up my watch.</p><p>\u201cHere on time, as ordered,\u201d I said, though I wasn\u2019t sure if they would hear me or were even watching. I turned around and faced Azriel. \u201cYou\u2019d better go release Jak, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right in this place alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hardly alone. I have Amaya, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He still looked doubtful, however.</p> <p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Just don\u2019t forget to give Jak all the appropriate memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will get what he requires.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cWe were seen dancing, Azriel. Include that\u2014all of that.\u201d</p><p>He just gave me his inscrutable face. Which meant, I was beginning to suspect, Screw you. I\u2019ll do what I want. \u201cWe still need his help, Azriel, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head slightly, but again, I couldn\u2019t really tell whether it was agreement. \u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d he said, and disappeared again.</p><p>I plopped down on the chair, and after a few minutes of twiddling my thumbs, dug out my phone and rang Ilianna.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what fucking time it is?\u201d she mumbled by way of hello.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said cheerfully. \u201cBut I figure if I\u2019m up, you should be, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKarma will bite your ass for this,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cKarma already has,\u201d I said. \u201cTrust me, sleep and I haven\u2019t exactly been steady companions over the last couple of days. How\u2019s Tao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImproving,\u201d she said. \u201cHis core temperature continues to come down, and he\u2019s finally starting to put weight back on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he hasn\u2019t woken yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She paused, and soft steps echoed. I was being taken into the bathroom, I suspected. Guess that\u2019s what I got for waking her at an ungodly hour. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be too long before he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous. But I didn\u2019t only ring for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cOr I would have had to clip you around the ears next time I see you.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cEven with the threefold rule?\u201d</p><p>The threefold rule was a witch belief that whatever you put out into the world\u2014be it positive or negative\u2014would return to you threefold. Very few witches chanced doing the latter, and with good reason. I\u2019d seen what happened to a witch who cast evil, and it hadn\u2019t been pretty. Of course, I\u2019d played a part in her downfall, but then, she had been trying to kill me, and it was thanks to one of her creatures that Tao lay unconscious.</p><p>\u201cThat rule doesn\u2019t apply when it involves those who maliciously wake their friends in the wee hours of the morning.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, but the sound died on my lips as the ghosts in the other room began to moan. I closed my eyes briefly. God, another session was about to start. I swallowed heavily, and somehow said, \u201cListen, can you give me Adeline Greenfield\u2019s number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, worry suddenly in her tone. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she said last time I saw her that I had more of Mom\u2019s talents than I suspected\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is something I\u2019ve been saying for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d I continued, ignoring her, \u201cI need her to teach me how to contact ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can already see ghosts. It\u2019s part of the reason you hate hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see them,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut I can\u2019t communicate with them. At best, I can hear their moaning.\u201d</p><p>And the moaning in the other room was getting louder, becoming more agitated.</p><p>\u201cWhich has never bothered you before now, so why the sudden urgency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a man we need information from was killed tonight, but his soul was uncollected. I want to talk to him again, to see if he can tell us anything else. To do that, I\u2019ll probably need to step onto the astral field.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing for a moment, then, \u201cI\u2019m gathering this is Hunter\u2019s job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I wished it was. It would be a whole lot easier talking to a ghost than having to sit here and listen to the bitter cacophony coming from the other room while I waited for a monster to make an appearance. \u201cHe might be able to help us pinpoint John Nadler, the third member of the consortium that\u2019s been buying up the land around Stane\u2019s shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if this information source is now dead, then it suggests Nadler really doesn\u2019t want to be found. Step carefully, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I will.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. In the background water splattered into a sink; then came more footsteps. She\u2019d finally moved out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s Adeline\u2019s phone number.\u201d She reeled off the number, and added, \u201cBut don\u2019t you dare ring her now. She\u2019ll be asleep, like most normal people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m only this inconsiderate to my friends.\u201d I paused, then said with a grin, \u201cAnd besides, I\u2019m sure you and Mirri can find a pleasant way to pass the time until sleep arrives again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMirri\u2019s on night shift,\u201d she reminded me, \u201cso if I play with anyone, it\u2019ll be myself.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cFlying solo can be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you of that the next time you\u2019re whining about the lack of men and sex in your life.\u201d Her voice was dry. \u201cJust be careful, Ris. I\u2019m still getting some bad vibes from this whole Hunter deal.\u201d</p><p>No surprise there, since I had a council execution order hanging over my head. But I didn\u2019t say anything\u2014she was worried enough as it was. She didn\u2019t need to know the details.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cJust make sure you be careful, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, shoved the phone away, then leaned back against the wall, listening to the growing wailing and wishing it could cover up the other sounds and smells coming from the room. The scents of hunger, desire, and blood, the moans that were filled with ecstasy rather than anger, the rending of material and the smack of flesh against flesh. The vampire involved tonight was obviously into aggressive sex as well as blood taking.</p><p>Normally, sitting here listening to someone else getting sexed would have had lust surging through my veins, but in this atmosphere, it was little more than ashes from which no fire could be raised.</p><p>As the sounds in the other room began to ramp up to a climax, the howling of the ghosts became so sharp and bitter that I had to cover my ears with my hands. But even that failed to lessen the impact. It was a sound that tore through the fabric of my being, until it felt like I was unraveling.</p><p>And then something else began to creep into the atmosphere. It was an ill wind, dark and twisted, barely there at first, but gathering in strength as the feeding in the room drew closer to culmination and the howls and screams of the ghosts got stronger and louder.</p><p>And they weren\u2019t the only ones. Amaya was hissing fiercely, her fury filling my mind, her need to rent and tear so strong, I had to dig my nails into my hands to resist the urge to run out into that room and kill everyone.</p><p>Because it wasn\u2019t just ghosts, a blood whore, and a vampire out there now.</p><p>The Rakshasa had finally answered the desperation of the ghosts.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Azriel, I thought, you\u2019d better get your ass back here right now, because I am not facing this thing alone.</p><p>But I drew Amaya regardless. She slipped eagerly into my hand, the lilac fire dripping from her black edges sizzling as it splattered across the floor.</p><p>Then energy of a different kind swept around me and, a heartbeat later, Azriel appeared. Valdis was drawn, her blade running with blue electricity. The fires of the two blades filled the small room with light and, in the other room, that gathering of dark energy began to fade.</p><p>\u201cIt has sensed my arrival and retreats to the gray fields,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cQuickly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And with that, he disappeared. I swore, sat down, and closed my eyes. I didn\u2019t bother reaching for calm, didn\u2019t bother to center myself. I simply wrenched my soul free from my flesh and flung myself onto the fields. For a moment everything spun around me, a whirl of gray that had my stomach churning and my pulse rate shooting through the roof. Or maybe that was simply fear.</p><p>The Du\u0161an exploded from my arm, her lilac form quickly gaining flesh and shape, until she seemed so real that I wanted to reach out and touch her. She swirled around me, the wind of her body buffeting mine as her sharp ebony gaze scanned the fields surrounding us. I wondered if she sensed the Rakshasa, or if she was merely reacting to the knot of fear growing in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>I spun around, my gaze searching the silvery plains. But there was nothing; no one was here. Then I remembered what Azriel had said\u2014if spirits traversed the fields, it was only via the paene. I\u2019d come too far into the fields.</p> <p>I dove for the shadowy divide between the fields and the real world, and spotted it. The Rakshasa was a boiling, writhing mass of dark gray that almost merged into the mist that was this part of the fields. And it was quickly receding into the distance.</p><p>Azriel was easier to find\u2014he was a blaze of sunlight in this ghostly otherworld, a force whose very presence throbbed through my being. He was closer to the creature than I was, but nowhere near close enough.</p><p>I ran forward, Amaya gripped tightly in my right hand and the Du\u0161an\u2019s serpentine form swirling around me. Her eyes glittered fiercely as she continued to scan the fields around us\u2014searching for trouble. Searching for a threat.</p><p>I hoped like hell she didn\u2019t find it.</p><p>But even as that thought crossed my mind, trumpets echoed, the sound oddly haunting in the hush of the fields. The last time I\u2019d heard those trumpets, it had meant the Raziq were hunting me.</p> <p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>I kept my gaze on the receding forms of Azriel and the Rakshasa, trying to increase my speed and catch up, but having little success with either. I might walk the fields, but this was not my world, and it seemed that the constraints of my flesh were affecting me here. Speed had never been one of my gifts.</p><p>The haunting echo of the horns drew closer. Amaya was a fierce storm battering my thoughts, wanting to stand and fight, and frustrated that we weren\u2019t, while the Du\u0161an\u2019s movements were getting more and more agitated. My gaze swept the shadows, but I couldn\u2019t see anything or anyone.</p><p>They were out there, nevertheless. I could feel the ill wind of their presence rushing toward me.</p><p>And then, from out of nowhere, they struck.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t the Raziq. It was a writhing mass of sinuous, sluglike forms that had stalks for eyes and seemed to bleed a white substance from all over their bodies.</p> <p>They rolled out of the shadows like a gigantic bowling ball and came straight at me. The Du\u0161an screamed and dove into their midst, sending gray forms scattering as she bit and slashed. Several rolling lumps re-formed out of the main mass, the smaller ones circling me as the larger one\u2014with the Du\u0161an still in its midst\u2014continued rolling toward me. I jumped out of its path and swung Amaya. Purple fire trailed from her blade, splattering the nearest creatures as she sliced through their beings and cut them asunder. Gray muck sprayed from their bodies and the mass seemed to writhe with greater agitation. But it didn\u2019t fall apart, didn\u2019t seem to be deterred. It simply did a long looping turn and came at me again.</p><p>The Du\u0161an rose from its midst, twisted in midair, then dove again, teeth wide, chomping down on gray forms, flinging them left and right. It still didn\u2019t seem to have any effect. The writhing forms just drew closer, instantly filling the spaces created by the Du\u0161an.</p><p>A wind hit me from behind. I staggered a little, caught my balance, then swung around. One of the smaller masses had broken the circle and was coming straight at me. I swung Amaya. Her blade hit the ball of slugs and came to a shuddering halt\u2014it was as if something had gripped her hard. She screamed her fury, spitting fire that sizzled and flamed out the minute it struck the oozing sides of the slugs. I swore and pulled back with all my might. She came free with a weird sucking sound just as a second small mass of slugs swept in. I swung to face it, but it arced, avoiding the sweep of the blade. As it passed me, the white mucus that bled from its pores exploded, splattering through the air. I twisted away from it, but nowhere near fast enough. The mucus plastered my left side and instantly hardened, pinning my arm to my body and immobilizing my leg.</p><p>Glue. It was some form of fucking glue.</p><p>There was no fighting this. All the slug balls had to do was keep their distance and spit their glue at me, and I\u2019d be trussed up tighter than a turkey at Thanksgiving in no time. I had to get out of here.</p><p>Sorry, Azriel, it\u2019s too dangerous for me to stay here on the fields. I closed my eyes and flung myself back into my body. The force of it sent me toppling off the chair and onto the floor. And that\u2019s where I remained, doing nothing more than sucking in air as pain shuddered through my body and tiny men with hammers went crazy inside my head. After several heartbeats, the shifting magic crawled sluggishly over my face, my body unable to sustain the change when my energy reserves were so low.</p><p>And matters weren\u2019t being helped by Amaya\u2014she was a continuous scream echoing through the outer reaches of my thoughts, and the Du\u0161an was writhing up and down my arm, the movements somewhat disturbing and definitely furious. Neither of them, it seemed, was happy about my sudden retreat.</p><p>Not that I particularly cared. I couldn\u2019t fight if I was all glued up, and I had no intention of landing in the hands of the Raziq\u2014I had no doubt that was who\u2019d sent those things. For whatever reason, they didn\u2019t seem prepared to get their hands dirty trying to capture me, be it here or on the fields.</p> <p>I released Amaya, then tried to get up, but with both my left arm and leg out of action, it was decidedly awkward. Eventually, I skewed myself around until my back was pressed against the wall, then did a sideways sit-up. I poked the white substance warily; it had set like rock, and made an odd, almost hollow sound when I tapped it. I dug my fingernails under one end and tried to break it away from my clothes, with little success.</p><p>I reached for Amaya and pressed her point lightly against the muck gluing my leg. Her hissing dropped several octaves\u2014becoming more a grumbling sound, as if she was reluctantly obeying my unspoken need\u2014and the flames dancing down her sides ran across the mass of white. The pungent scent of burning flesh began to infuse the air. It wasn\u2019t my flesh burning but the white substance. It might look and work like glue, but it obviously wasn\u2019t.</p><p>After several more minutes, the glue had disappeared, leaving only a powdery white stain on my jeans. I repeated the process on my arm, but this time, the powdery substance had chewed through my sweater and the skin underneath had a pink sheen, almost as if it had been burned.</p><p>I pushed myself to my feet, but the room spun and I had to grab at the wall to stop myself from falling. Heat shimmered around me; then Azriel appeared, quickly catching my other arm and holding me steady.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied, swallowing bile as sweat broke out on my brow. \u201cI need to stay right here. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to throw up all over your boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese boots are part of the illusion I wear, so it would not matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t get ruined when I vomit all over them.\u201d</p><p>It was a nonsense conversation, but right then I just needed to get my mind off the pain and dizziness. Slamming my soul in and out of my body like that had not been one of my brightest decisions, and I doubted I would repeat it anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d he said equably, \u201cbut the point is, I can regenerate the boots\u2014and the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t scar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see the wound from the silver bullet I took?\u201d</p><p>My gaze swept over him, although I knew all I\u2019d see was warm, suntanned flesh. \u201cThat\u2019s a skill I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you need is to get back to the hotel and wash that powder from your arm\u2014otherwise the rash may well get worse and scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d I took another slow, deep breath, then carefully pushed away from the wall. The room only did a minor dance before it steadied.</p><p>Despite stating that I needed to take a shower, Azriel righted the chair, then sat me down. \u201cI did not catch the Rakshasa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered that.\u201d I ran a hand through my sweaty hair. \u201cAnd unfortunately, it now knows we\u2019re here waiting for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He squatted in front of me, taking my left hand in his and rubbing it gently. Up until that moment, I hadn\u2019t realized just how cold it was. \u201cBut I do not think that will stop it from coming. Its hunger is great.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it just seek out a safer hunting ground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, as I said, it is drawn by great anger and despair. There is much of those emotions in this place.\u201d</p><p>My fingertips were beginning to tingle with heat, a sharp sensation that wasn\u2019t exactly pleasant. And while part of me wondered why he didn\u2019t just flush heat and healing through me like he usually did, the sensation of his hands rubbing mine felt too good to complain. \u201cBut there are other dark clubs\u2014why wouldn\u2019t it just choose one of those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect because of the ghosts. It is their need, their anguish, that is the draw here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean the other places don\u2019t have ghosts?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThey undoubtedly do, but for whatever reason, they are not as vocal or as angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? I mean, they\u2019re all in the same situation\u2014why would these ghosts be more vocal than the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they aren\u2019t. Perhaps the Rakshasa\u2014for reasons we cannot understand\u2014simply chose this club over the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now that it knows we\u2019re here, it may hunt in the other clubs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that make Hunter a happy woman? I closed my eyes as the warm, prickly sensation began to spread through the rest of my hand, but I resisted the urge to pull it from his. I wanted to enjoy the press of his fingers just a little bit longer. \u201cDo you think we should remain here until dawn?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. The Rakshasa may be hungry, but it isn\u2019t stupid. It won\u2019t return tonight.\u201d</p><p>I sighed in relief. \u201cI\u2019m glad, because I really don\u2019t want to be here when those ghosts start up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be.\u201d He rose, pulling me upright with him, then encircling my waist with his other arm. His face was its usual inscrutable self, but there was an odd tension in his body and Valdis flowed with a muted red fire. \u201cReady?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. Energy swept around me, through me, tearing us apart and flinging us through the fields so quickly it was little more than a blur.</p><p>I gasped as we re-formed inside the hotel room. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, his hand sliding almost sensually around my waist before he stepped back. \u201cI did not want to risk being on the fields for long. Not with the Raziq\u2019s creatures still loose.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they being hunted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, but our resources are still stretched thin.\u201d He paused. \u201cGo shower, Risa.\u201d</p><p>I studied him for a moment, knowing there was more to it than that, but also knowing he wouldn\u2019t share until he was good and ready. With a half shrug of my own, I grabbed a shirt and some fresh panties and headed for the bathroom to clean up.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later I felt somewhat refreshed, and though my arm was still red from the remnants of the slug glue, it didn\u2019t look bad enough to scar. I got dressed, then finger-dried my hair, suddenly glad to be wearing my own face once more, even though I\u2019d probably have to face-shift again when we left the hotel. The Raziq might have attacked me on the gray fields, but they hadn\u2019t yet managed another attack on this plane. The subterfuge, as tiring as it was, appeared to be working.</p><p>I sighed softly, then jumped a little as my cell phone rang.</p><p>I dug it out of the pocket of my discarded jeans, and said, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must say,\u201d a familiar voice drawled, \u201cI am very disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Lucian. Damn it, he was the last person I wanted to talk to right now, even if my hormones were suddenly saying otherwise. And what was it about this man that got to me so quickly? I hadn\u2019t thought about him all fucking day, and yet the minute I heard his voice, I became a seething mass of need.</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t known otherwise, I\u2019d have said he\u2019d put some sort of spell on me\u2014except that Ilianna would have spotted anything like that.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want, Lucian?\u201d</p><p>It was tersely said, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice. His soft laugh ran across my senses as sweetly as a caress.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I want? You, on me, under me. I want to feel your supple body, want to caress your silken skin, want to lose myself in the wonder of loving you.\u201d</p><p>Each word had visions of our tangled bodies rising, and sweat prickled across my skin. I closed my eyes and sagged back against the bathroom wall. I could resist this. I could resist him.</p><p>\u201cOnly trouble is,\u201d I said, the anger in my voice aimed more at myself than at him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see or feel you. I\u2019ve already told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not be able to feel your need, but I can hear the lie in your words, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I said at least forty-eight hours and I meant it. Maybe next time you\u2019ll reconsider the roughhouse tactics and try a little more respect.\u201d</p><p>And with that, I hung up, and turned my phone off for good measure. It would piss him off even more, but I really needed to make the point.</p> <p>Although what I really needed\u2014 I stopped the thought and frowned. Because if I was honest, what I needed and what I wanted were two entirely different things. I might need Lucian\u2019s brand of loving with a fierceness that was indescribable, but the person I wanted was Azriel.</p><p>And yet, I still feared taking that step. Still feared where it would lead, and what would happen when all this was over and he left for good.</p><p>Because I had a suspicion that if I let Azriel in, he could lay waste to my emotional being far more easily than Jak ever had.</p><p>I took a deep breath and slowly released it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t risk it. I shouldn\u2019t risk it.</p><p>I closed my eyes and knew that more than likely I would risk it.</p><p>I shook my head at my own recklessness and walked into the main room. Where I stopped. Azriel was standing in his usual spot at the window, but his arms were crossed and tension rode his shoulders. Valdis was oddly silent. Neither of them was giving me any clue as to what he was feeling or thinking.</p><p>But in many ways, that was clue enough. After all, he knew precisely what I\u2019d been thinking.</p><p>\u201cJust because I can read your thoughts does not mean I always do,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you are right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>I scanned his broad back, willing him to turn around and face me. He didn\u2019t. Meaning he wasn\u2019t about to make this easy. This step, if I took it, would be my decision and my decision alone. Despite his words earlier, he wouldn\u2019t do anything further to influence me. \u201cYou have no thoughts? No desires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of both, but ideally, none of them are ones that I should act upon.\u201d</p><p>I forced my feet forward, closing the distance between us. Even though the heat radiating off him burned across my skin, making my breath catch and my pulse race, the few inches that now separated us still felt like a mile or more.</p><p>\u201cAnd realistically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRealistically, I wish to plunge Valdis\u2019s screaming heart into the Aedh\u2019s flesh and rip him asunder.\u201d</p><p>Though there was no emotion in his voice, I felt it nonetheless. It burned inside me, bright and fierce. I licked my lips, wondering why I was suddenly so attuned to him. \u201cWhy do you want to kill him?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but just for a moment, flames flickered down Valdis\u2019s side, rich and red. The color of anger. The color of desire. It stirred through the threads of my being as sweetly as a caress.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think reapers were capable of an emotion as strong as jealousy.\u201d I was standing so close to him that my breath washed across his shoulders as I spoke. His skin twitched so sharply it was almost as if I were flaying him.</p><p>\u201cIt is not jealousy,\u201d he retorted. \u201cI simply do not trust him. And I do not like the timing of that phone call, so soon after Logan was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian didn\u2019t kill Logan. You found the shooter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but who controlled the shooter? He was a Razan, Risa. Maybe he was Lucian\u2019s Razan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian hasn\u2019t got Razan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure of that? He has been on this earth for a long, long time. He may now revel in pleasure, but have no doubt he has also become proficient at lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I know it\u2019s more a guess than a certainty.\u201d I raised a hand and brushed my fingertips across the back of his neck, following the swirling tribal patterns inked into his skin. A dark fire seemed to ignite deep in the heart of them. \u201cLucian said he\u2019d been stripped of most Aedh powers\u2014how then could he possibly create human slaves and sustain them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure he can do more than what he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have proof of this? Or is it merely distrust and dislike?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t need to. I let my fingers slide down to the stylized black Du\u0161an that dominated the left half of his back. It, too, seemed to gleam with a dark fire when I touched it. But then, it was alive, even if it couldn\u2019t gain form on this plane.</p><p>\u201cThat distrust,\u201d I continued softly, \u201cisn\u2019t the only reason for your sudden need to kill Lucian, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the change?\u201d</p><p>Even as I asked the question I had my doubts that he would answer it. But once again he surprised me.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, his voice even though the air around us suddenly seemed to crackle with anger and tension\u2014the same sort of tension that rode his powerful body. \u201cHe is the reason you are standing where you are, contemplating what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you deny the desire he raised when he called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I ran my fingers back up the tribal patterns. A tremor moved through him as I touched the one that resembled a comet trailing fire. \u201cBut he is not the reason I\u2019m standing here, Azriel. He\u2019s not the one I want right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will want him in the future?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, but there was no denying the reality of the situation. I would have sex with Lucian in the future\u2014partly because I generally enjoyed being with him and partly because it was a means of self-preservation. If Jak had taught me anything, it was never to invest too much of myself in a relationship unless I was absolutely certain it was that \u201cforever\u201d one. And neither Lucian nor Azriel could be that, no matter how much I might enjoy being with Lucian or how strong the pull toward Azriel.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said eventually, and let my hand drop back to my side. \u201cI will continue seeing Lucian. But that does not mean I cannot also be with you. Werewolves are by nature\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not,\u201d he interrupted sharply, \u201cuse your werewolf heritage as an excuse. It is fear that governs your actions on this, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to call it self-preservation.\u201d I stepped back from him, though it was the last thing I wanted to do. \u201cYou said I couldn\u2019t continue to deny what is between us. Well, I\u2019m not. But I will not commit wholly to something that must end when all this is over. If you want otherwise, then I\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I do not know if I\u2014\u201d He cut the words off and took a deep breath. Then, finally, he turned around to face me. His mismatched blue eyes were turbulent and dark, but the emotions moved through them too quickly to identify. \u201cYou once wondered what it would be like to make love to a reaper. That is not something I can share with you. You are not ready for it.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, but said nothing, simply because I sensed a \u201cbut\u201d coming. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The smile that twisted his lips was a brief acknowledgment that he was still following my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said softly, lightly pressing his palm against my cheek, \u201cI can share what it is like to be with a reaper in human form. And perhaps in the end that will be less dangerous for us both.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean physically dangerous. He meant emotionally. And he was wrong on both counts. He was breaking all reaper rules, and I was risking my heart yet again\u2014how could any form of relationship between us not be considered dangerous?</p> <p>And yet, as he\u2019d noted earlier, sometimes the gain was worth the punishment\u2014or the broken heart, as I suspected might be the case for me if I wasn\u2019t very, very careful.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what form you\u2019re in, Azriel,\u201d I said, meeting his gaze steadily. \u201cI just want you. Here. Now.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid from my cheek to the back of my neck, then gently tugged me closer.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said, his words a warm caress that made my lips tingle, \u201cI guess I have no choice.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he kissed me. Gently and sweetly, as if this moment was something so very rare and precious, and he was intent on enjoying it for as long as he could.</p> <p>But it was also a whole lot more than just a kiss, because the minute our lips met, energy swept through me, until my nerve endings were more alive than they had ever been, and quivering with... with what? It wasn\u2019t desire, not really. It was more than that. Bigger than that. It was as if I stood on the edge of a precipice reaching for something far beyond my understanding.</p><p>As the kiss deepened, I wrapped my arms around his neck and pressed against him, until the only thing separating us was the thin layers of our clothing. Yet it still felt like heated flesh against heated flesh, need against need. His hand slipped down my spine, his touch light but devastating, making me tremble in a way I\u2019d never trembled before. Because it wasn\u2019t just his touch\u2014it was the press of his body against mine, the flow of energy around us, the gentle dance of awareness that seemed to ebb and flow with every breath, as if somehow more than just our physical selves was involved in this dance.</p><p>Then his lips left mine and lightly brushed my chin. I raised my face and sighed in pleasure as his kisses moved down my neck. When he reached the collar of my shirt, he pulled back slightly and undid the first button, then kissed the skin he\u2019d exposed. I closed my eyes and shuddered in delight. He moved down to the next button, slowly undoing it, pressing the shirt farther apart, then kissing the newly exposed skin.</p><p>Too slow, I thought. Far too damn slow.</p><p>I raised my hands and ran them across the muscular planes of his chest. His breath hitched; then he caught my hands and pulled them away.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said gently, though his gaze burned with determination and something else, something that made me quiver with expectation and just a tiny bit of fear, \u201cis for you. I want to explore you, worship you. Just feel, Risa. Just enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d know if I could survive that. Which was silly, and yet I couldn\u2019t ignore that niggle of fear that continued to burn within the desire.</p><p>But I\u2019d made the decision, taken the step, and I would not back out. I doubted I could have even if I\u2019d wanted to\u2014the connection between us was far too strong to ignore now.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said softly, \u201clet me give you this, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. There was nothing else I could do. Nothing else I could say.</p><p>He undid the next button, spreading the shirt wider and kissing the exposed skin. Then he repeated the process, one button at a time, down my body. I quivered every time his lips touched my flesh, until it felt like I was floating on a growing haze of desire, need, and expectation.</p><p>Finally, when all the buttons were undone, he trailed his kisses back up my body, then briefly claimed my lips as he slid the shirt from my shoulders. As it fell around my feet, he stepped back a little, his heated gaze roaming across my breasts and stomach as if he\u2019d never seen me naked before. Then, with a slight groan, he bent and captured one hard nipple in his mouth. I gasped, gripping his shoulders as he licked, and nipped, and teased, my body so assaulted with sensation that my knees felt weak. When he moved to my other breast, I whimpered, unable to stand the torture of being touched and yet not being able to touch. God, I so wanted\u2014</p><p>No. The soft word flowed into my mind, a command I could not disobey.</p><p>And he continued the sweet torture, until it was all I could do not to scream in pleasure and frustration.</p> <p>Finally, he relented, and his kisses moved back down my belly again. He ran his tongue along the edge of my panty line and it felt like he was branding me. I shivered; then my breath caught somewhere in the back of my throat as he hooked his fingers under the top elastic and drew them down my legs. Once I\u2019d stepped out of them, he tossed them to one side, then quickly rose, catching my hand and leading me to the bed.</p><p>Where, once I was lying down, he kissed me again, heated and hard, with all the desperation of a man at the edge of his tether. And the kiss... it was so much more. It was heat and desire and need, yes, but it was also a dance of beings, of souls, as if in this one moment, we were almost one, not two.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>He pulled back with a suddenness that had me gasping and, for a moment, simply stared at me. Then he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, as if he were battling for control.</p><p>Once again, he began his slow and torturous journey down my stomach, assailing me with his kisses. As my body twitched and burned, I wondered how the hell I was going to stand much more without giving in to the need to take what I wanted\u2014him. In me, loving me. Hard.</p><p>Then his tongue flicked over my clit and my breath escaped in a whoosh as delight exploded through me. I groaned, arching up against him, urging him on, wanting him to explore further, deeper. His tongue swirled around my outer lips as he gripped my hips, holding me steady as he tasted and teased, until I couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t breathe, could only feel. And I felt as if I were about to explode.</p><p>And then, as his tongue teased my clit yet again, I did explode, and I was little more than a whimpering, moaning mess as my body rocked and shook in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d he said softly, as the tremors began to ease. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes. He was straddling me, his body quivering with need, his cock thick and hard and deliciously ready. And I was ready for him. Oh so ready.</p><p>But as my gaze met his, something within me stilled. Just for a moment, everything felt perfect, everything felt right.</p><p>And that scared the hell out of me.</p><p>But as much as I wanted to look away, I couldn\u2019t. All I could do was stare into the turbulent, powerful blue depths as he slowly, carefully, entered me.</p><p>And then all I could do was groan in pleasure.</p><p>Because again, it wasn\u2019t just our flesh connecting. It was deeper than that, richer than that. Scarier than that.</p><p>Then he began to move, and there was no thought, no fear, only sensation. Within and without, as if this moment, and this man, were everything that was ever meant to be. On and on it went, until it felt as if the threads of my being were unraveling.</p><p>And then everything did unravel, and I was shuddering, shaking, and screaming in pleasure as his body stiffened against mine and his essence filled me, body and soul.</p><p>For several minutes afterward, neither of us moved. When I could finally breathe\u2014think\u2014I cleared my throat and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m kind of glad you could only make love to me as a reaper in human form.\u201d</p><p>He shifted enough to transfer his weight from me onto his elbows, and stared down at me with an odd sort of half smile. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if that\u2019s an indication of what it would be like to have sex with you in reaper form, I don\u2019t actually think I could survive it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly, then bent and kissed my lips. It was soft and gentle, but nevertheless the connection between us stirred to life, shivering through me like a curtain of silver. Part of me wanted to step through it and see what lay on the other side, but most of me simply wasn\u2019t willing to take that risk. So I just kept on kissing him. Hunger stirred between us, gathering speed and strength.</p><p>\u201cYou know what else I think?\u201d I said after a while. Then I scowled. \u201cWell, of course you do.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I was occupied with your lips, not your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cSo to stop your following every thought, I simply have to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does raise interesting possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I murmured, as I tensed myself around his erection, \u201cis certainly true.\u201d</p><p>His smile grew as he began to move inside me. \u201cAnd this thought you had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes,\u201d I said, running my fingers down his back, enjoying the reaction of his body, the slight hitching of his breath. \u201cI was thinking that the woman you used to catch your friend\u2019s killer was a very fine teacher when it came to the art of lovemaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, it was very enlightening.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cEnlightening? That really doesn\u2019t seem an adequate word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this, it isn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you call this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said softly, his gaze holding mine, burning with an intensity I didn\u2019t quite understand, \u201cis everything that matters, and I intend to enjoy every second of it while it lasts.\u201d</p><p>Just for a moment, that silver curtain parted, and I knew exactly what he was thinking\u2014that it wouldn\u2019t last beyond this day. Because he was determined to control the uncontrollable. \u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>So I didn\u2019t. I just enjoyed.</p><p>The sharp ringing of the phone woke me many hours later. I groaned and groped the bedside table blindly, but couldn\u2019t find the damn phone.</p><p>It said a lot about both my mental state and my overall tiredness that it took me several more minutes to remember I\u2019d left it in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>I opened one eye and looked at him, my vision rather bleary. He seemed disgustingly refreshed. \u201cIt\u2019s totally unfair that you look like you can go another six rounds and I feel exhausted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the benefits of being a reaper rather than a humanoid.\u201d His face was back to being its usual unreadable self, and while I\u2019d expected it, I still hated it. He held out the phone. \u201cDo you wish to answer this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the phone. \u201cJak.\u201d</p> <p>I groaned, but raised a hand, made a \u201cgive me\u201d motion, then hit the RECEIVE button and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better have a good reason for ringing me at this hour, otherwise I will have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was soft and teasing, but my hormones were too sated to react. \u201cAnd here I was thinking I was the only one who woke up with a hangover.\u201d</p><p>Hangover? I glanced at Azriel and he shrugged. I guess it was one way of getting around the whole memory problem\u2014you simply gave them a reason not to remember every little detail.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was a long night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you didn\u2019t enjoy yourself,\u201d Jak said. \u201cI\u2019m totally hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I enjoyed myself.\u201d More than he could ever imagine\u2014only he\u2019d had nothing to do with it. I glanced at Azriel as that thought crossed my mind, and caught the half smile that flirted briefly with his lips. \u201cBut I\u2019m not enjoying this conversation. What do you want, Jak?\u201d</p><p>He sighed dramatically. \u201cAnd here I was thinking that after our dance, you might be a little less business, and a little more pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you thought wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJak, the reason you\u2019re calling is...?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDamn, but it\u2019s fun baiting you. The reason I\u2019m calling is that I found James Blake, the photographer Jacinta mentioned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he\u2019s not dead, like Logan and everyone else who could identify Nadler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014although it does lend weight to the theory that our face-shifter doesn\u2019t believe his past is much of a threat to his future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes me wonder why we\u2019re even bothering to follow up on these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we gleaned one vital fact yesterday\u2014the real Nadler had a scar. Who knows what we may gain today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m breathless with anticipation.\u201d</p><p>My voice was dry and he chuckled softly. \u201cI hope you remain that way until we meet. I\u2019d love a repeat performance of last night.\u201d</p><p>I ignored his comment and looked at the clock on the bedside table. It was nearly eleven, which meant I\u2019d had a whole two hours\u2019 sleep. No wonder I felt like crap. \u201cWhere is his studio located?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s retired, so no studio. But he lives in Williamstown and he\u2019s expecting us around lunchtime.\u201d</p> <p>If he was living in Williamstown, he had to have made a lot as a photographer, because that area\u2014thanks to its proximity to both the sea and the city\u2014wasn\u2019t cheap. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hire a car, so it\u2019ll probably be at least an hour before I can get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already on my way, but I\u2019ll grab some lunch to waste some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go question him without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d he said blandly. \u201cI\u2019ve sent you the address, too. I\u2019ll be waiting in a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed Honda Accord,\u201d I finished for him. He\u2019d been driving them since he\u2019d gotten his license, and I very much doubted it had changed.</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cYeah. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>I tossed the phone back onto the bedside table, then sat up and hugged my knees close to my chest. \u201cJust what sort of memory did you give Jak, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Azriel shrugged. \u201cYou said to give him all the appropriate memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning not just the dance, but the kiss?\u201d</p><p>He eyed me. \u201cYes. That is what you wanted; is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. I mean, no.\u201d I frowned. \u201cI hadn\u2019t actually expected you to go that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say what you actually mean.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and climbed off the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re a fine one to be telling me that, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged again, and walked across to the window to resume his usual position. The intimacies of the last few hours would have seemed like a distant memory if not for the ache in my body.</p><p>I studied the muscular planes of his back\u2014planes I knew intimately now\u2014for several minutes, then said, \u201cSo, we\u2019re back to being formal, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafer for who?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, blue eyes calm. Yet there was turbulence in him\u2014I could feel it. \u201cFor you. If I am distracted, it could prove fatal\u2014to both yourself and to my quest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the quest is all-important,\u201d I snapped. Which wasn\u2019t fair, but it wasn\u2019t exactly fair of him to retreat like this, either.</p><p>Though why I was getting upset when I had been expecting it, I had no idea.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. No surprise there. I grabbed some clothes and headed into the bathroom to shower. Once I was dressed, I closed my eyes and imagined a face with freckles and brown hair, but left my eyes their natural color. The magic swirled around me with far less enthusiasm than ever before, which could only mean that I was near the end of my reserves. I needed a break from it, and I needed some decent sleep\u2014not that I regretted the lack of it last night, even if this morning\u2019s remoteness took some of the shine off it. Grimacing, I headed out of the bathroom, picked up my phone and purse, and said, \u201cI\u2019m guessing I\u2019ll meet you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn around. Didn\u2019t kiss me good-bye. I flexed my fingers, resisting the urge to smack some sense into his thick head, then swung around and headed downstairs to arrange for a rental car.</p><p>In less than twenty minutes I was on the road. There wasn\u2019t that much traffic around, so it didn\u2019t take me long to get to Williamstown. Once there, I parked the little Daihatsu on one of the side streets just down from Blake\u2019s and climbed out.</p><p>The day was hot, and the sun shining with a ferocity that had me sweating in an instant. I pulled off my light sweater and shoved it back into the car, suddenly glad I\u2019d put on a tank top underneath it. It didn\u2019t take me long to find Jak\u2014the red Honda stood out like a sore thumb on a street lined with demurely colored Mercs, Volvos, and Audis. While the relatively small size of the surrounding houses gave no hint that this wasn\u2019t one of your more run-of-the-mill neighborhoods, the lineup of cars on the street certainly did.</p><p>Jak climbed out of the Honda and gave me a decidedly leisurely once-over. His gaze, when it finally rose to meet mine, was heated and hungry. My hormones thought about doing a little quickstep, then decided it involved too much effort.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said softly, his voice a low rumble that was easy on the ears, \u201clook mighty damn fine. I do prefer your normal hair color, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only wearing blue jeans and a white tank,\u201d I said dryly, stopping several feet away from him. Even so, his hunger washed over me, warm and enticing. \u201cAnd what you prefer is not something I ever consider when I change my look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sad but true statement. But just to let you know, a tank with no bra underneath is eminently exciting to any male.\u201d</p><p>Except if he\u2019s a reaper, I thought snippily. I motioned to the white weatherboard house a few doors down from where he\u2019d parked. \u201cShall we proceed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re intent on being all business, then I guess I have no choice.\u201d He stepped back and waved me forward. \u201cWhich does not mean I cannot enjoy the view from behind. Those jeans are fetchingly tight around your ass.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and just kept on walking. The picket gate creaked as I opened it, and the garden beyond was filled with ornamental grasses and purple flax plants rather than flowers\u2014what I\u2019d call a man\u2019s garden rather than a woman\u2019s.</p><p>I walked up the steps, scanning the entrance for some sort of doorbell. There was nothing, so I rapped my knuckles on the glass door.</p><p>Only when I did, it opened slightly. And the minute it did, I smelled the blood.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cThe source of that,\u201d Jak said grimly, \u201cis more than just a paper cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I pushed the door all the way open. Several rooms ran off the long central hallway, but the door at the far end was closed. The blood scent seemed to be coming from that direction\u2014certainly there was nothing out of place in the hall itself.</p><p>\u201cShould we go in or call the cops?\u201d Jak said.</p><p>I glanced at him, eyebrow raised, and he grinned. \u201cOkay, okay, we both know I want to go in and investigate, but I thought you might prefer to call the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven that we don\u2019t know yet what we\u2019re dealing with, I think investigating is a better option.\u201d</p><p>His grin grew. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the way your mind works. And the body isn\u2019t half bad, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, blood? Possible dead body and front-page article?\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Right.\u201d He became all business in an instant.</p><p>I shook my head and stepped forward cautiously. Sunlight filtered through the open doorways on either side, crisscrossing the hall and lending the honey-colored floorboards a richness they might not otherwise have had. The first room was a living room, but there was nothing out of place in it, or in the two bedrooms that followed. Every room was as neat as a pin\u2014there weren\u2019t even dust motes dancing in the sunbeams.</p><p>But the blood scent was getting stronger the closer we got to the closed door at the far end of the hall, and tension slithered through my body.</p><p>If that scent was anything to go by, whatever awaited in the room beyond was bad. Real bad.</p><p>I licked my lips, then carefully pushed the door open with the tip of my shoe. The scene that greeted me froze me on the spot.</p><p>Because the room beyond was a kitchen that was a smaller version of my mum\u2019s.</p><p>And just like my mum, James Blake had been totally and absolutely ripped apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jak whispered, horror in his voice. \u201cThat can\u2019t possibly be\u2014\u201d</p><p>I flung out an arm to stop him from moving into the room. The gesture was automatic. My gaze had locked on the gore and blood scattered around the room, and a sick sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu crawled across my skin. Though this murder\u2014and my mom\u2019s\u2014were similar to the MO of the Rakshasa, this wasn\u2019t her work. She fed off her victims. Whoever was responsible for this simply tore their victims apart. Somehow I managed to say, \u201cIt can and it is. We need to call the Directorate.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at me sharply. \u201cWhy? This is gruesome, no doubt about it, but there\u2019s no indication it\u2019s the work of a non-human. I mean, not even a vampire could tear someone apart this completely. Some kind of power tool must have been used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. Trust me.\u201d I took a deep, shuddering breath and closed my eyes. Bad mistake, because the minute I did, I saw Mum bits, Mum\u2019s head... Bile rose and I swallowed heavily, then grabbed Jak\u2019s hand and dragged him out of there.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he said, trying to wrench himself free. \u201cRisa, there\u2019s one hell of a story in there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not one you\u2019ll ever be allowed to print,\u201d I said. I stopped in the garden and sucked in several deep breaths. It didn\u2019t do a lot to ease the churning in my stomach, but it at least cleared the scent of blood from my lungs.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a moment, frowning. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my mum died.\u201d I waved a hand toward the house. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely the way she was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d he said, his face going white. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I cut in. \u201cNo one knew outside the Directorate and me, so you have nothing to apologize for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the reason you want the Directorate called in? Because they\u2019re the ones that investigated your mom\u2019s death?\u201d</p> <p>Azriel? Are you near? I thought, then said out loud, \u201cYes. Only there were no clues and, until now, the killer hadn\u2019t resurfaced.\u201d</p><p>Azriel appeared behind Jak and lightly touched his neck. Jak froze, his eyes going suddenly blank.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Azriel asked.</p><p>\u201cMostly.\u201d I wrapped my arms around my body, and wished they were his arms, not mine. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve already been inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. As before, there is nothing to suggest who is behind this murder.\u201d</p><p>As before... I shivered, and again tried to ignore the images that rose.</p><p>\u201cNo scent or spiritual essence\u2014or whatever it is that you Mijai track by\u2014whatsoever? How in the hell is something like that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lack of scent is understandable,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cHumans have had scent-erasing soap for many years now.\u201d</p> <p>I waved a hand in acknowledgment. \u201cBut how can the killer not leave any other trace of himself behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible if one is extremely careful, and our killer obviously is.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cThen what the hell is the link between my mum\u2019s murder and this man\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is obvious.\u201d His voice was grim. \u201cYou are the connection.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cWhy would I be the link when it comes to a retired photographer I didn\u2019t even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not have known James Blake, but you were intending to question him about Nadler. You were also investigating Nadler and his consortium when your mother was killed. I doubt it is a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I paused. Pain and guilt rose like a ghost, but I pushed them back down and added, \u201cI can understand someone killing Blake to keep him quiet, but Mom didn\u2019t really know much about my investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a very strong psychic,\u201d he replied, his voice soft. \u201cYou do not know what she might or might not have known.\u201d</p><p>And now never would, I thought bleakly. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll go after Nadler\u2019s ex, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible.\u201d</p><p>I swore, dug my phone out of my purse, and said, \u201cUncle Rhoan.\u201d The psychedelic patterns ran across the screen as the auto connect sprang into action.</p><p>Then Uncle Rhoan appeared. \u201cIf you\u2019re ringing to tell me you\u2019ve discovered another dead body, I will not be happy. You know I wanted you off these investigations.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, there was a resigned weariness in his voice rather than anger. I had a suspicion that either Aunt Riley had talked to him or he\u2019d simply come to accept that I wouldn\u2019t stop sticking my nose into events. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is another body and his name is\u2014was\u2014James Blake. He was a retired photographer who happened to be the attending photographer at John Nadler\u2019s wedding. He was killed the same way as Mom.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long moment, then said, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>My attempt at a smile came out more of a grimace. \u201cQueasy as hell, but holding up. You need to get people out here, but I also need you to check on Jacinta Nadler\u2014we talked to her yesterday, and it just might have placed her in danger.\u201d</p><p>He paused, and barked out orders to whoever was in the room with him, meaning he was at the Directorate rather than at home, then said, \u201cWho\u2019s we?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cMyself and Jak Talbott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJak Talbott?\u201d His voice was incredulous. \u201cThe reporter who used his relationship with you to do that hatchet job on your mother?\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cYeah, that very one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell are you working with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m trying to track down John Nadler, and Jak\u2019s got a lot of useful street contacts.\u201d</p><p>His sigh was one of exasperation. \u201cRiley\u2019s right. You\u2019re not only pigheaded but determined to see this through no matter what you have to do, or who you have to use.\u201d</p><p>It was no surprise she\u2019d said that\u2014she knew me better than most. \u201cIf it was Riley who\u2019d been murdered,\u201d I said softly, \u201cwouldn\u2019t you react the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference is,\u201d he snapped, \u201cI\u2019m a trained guardian. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve been taught to fight by two of the best, I\u2019m not without means of protecting myself aside from that, and I have a reaper following me about who needs to keep me alive.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. Whether that meant he was finally accepting my continuing pursuit of both Nadler and my mom\u2019s murderer was anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve pinpointed your location. I\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes.\u201d He hesitated, then added, \u201cDo not go back into that house until I arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d I hung up and glanced at Azriel. \u201cNo matter what you think of Lucian, he can\u2019t have been involved in this. I haven\u2019t seen him, haven\u2019t talked to him since last night, and even if he could read my thoughts, he wouldn\u2019t have had time to get down here before Jak or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of which is true,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cThat does not, however, change my opinion that he is involved in all this somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said flatly, \u201care annoyingly pigheaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is the company I keep that makes me so.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and waved a hand at Jak. \u201cYou\u2019d better release him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wish me to update his memories to include your ringing the Directorate?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Azriel touched Jak lightly and energy swirled, whispering through me like a sweet autumn breeze.</p><p>Then he dropped his hand and met my gaze again. \u201cAnd just to be clear,\u201d he said, his voice even but a teasing light suddenly gleaming in his eyes, \u201cI am not as immune to the virtues of that top as you believe.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he disappeared again, leaving me shaking my head and smiling like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cCare to share the joke?\u201d Jak said dryly.</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cSorry, just something my uncle said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle the guardian, I gather we\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I put my phone away. \u201cTo say he was rather surprised to discover I\u2019m working with you on this is something of an understatement.\u201d</p><p>Worry crossed his face. \u201cHe didn\u2019t threaten violence, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I studied him for a moment. \u201cHas he before?\u201d</p><p>Jak cleared his throat and looked a little uncomfortable. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time when I wrote that story on your mom; the second when we broke up. He can be a very scary man, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a guardian.\u201d I said that a little too cheerfully, if Jak\u2019s darkening expression was anything to go by. \u201cBut the threats can\u2019t have been too bad. I mean, not only are you still alive, but you walked away from them intact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I swore on my mother\u2019s grave not to do another report on your mother, and to keep well away from you. The latter of which I am obviously not doing.\u201d</p><p>I patted his arm comfortingly. \u201cBecause we all know the story means more to you than the threat. And don\u2019t worry\u2014Uncle Rhoan knows I contacted you, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t be pissed,\u201d he muttered, then plopped down on the step. \u201cHow long will they be?\u201d</p><p>I sat down beside him and glanced at my watch. \u201cAbout thirteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, they arrived in eight. Or at least Uncle Rhoan did\u2014it seemed he\u2019d beaten all land speed records to get here.</p><p>He came through the gate, a crime scene kit slung over one shoulder. His gray eyes swept the two of us critically. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been inside?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cOther than the initial entry when we found the body, no.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAt least you can obey some orders.\u201d He glanced at Jak, his gaze narrowing a little. \u201cYou will not report anything you see inside. Not until we give you clearance. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Surprise flitted across Jak\u2019s face as he nodded. He\u2019d obviously been expecting to be banned from the proceedings.</p><p>Rhoan opened the kit and handed us both gloves and plastic booties. \u201cPut those on, and don\u2019t touch anything without asking.\u201d</p> <p>We both obeyed. Once Rhoan had the floating crime scene recorders up and operating, and was similarly kitted out in gloves and booties, we headed down to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cJesus, it is similar,\u201d he said, as he entered. Then he glanced over his shoulder at us. \u201cStay at the doorway, you two.\u201d</p><p>He moved deeper into the room, carefully avoiding the bits of blood and gore. James Blake\u2019s torso was only half hidden behind the island, his entrails streaming out from his ruptured body like fat sausages.</p><p>\u201cArms have been ripped off.\u201d Rhoan\u2019s gaze met mine as he added softly, \u201cHead separated.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed grimly. I\u2019d been expecting it, but the knowledge still clawed my stomach. \u201cAny idea what time he was killed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe cleanup team will give us a more accurate time, but I\u2019d say within the last half hour. The blood hasn\u2019t really begun to coagulate, and there\u2019s no sign of rigor mortis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have been,\u201d Jak said. \u201cI was parked outside for half an hour while I was waiting for Risa to arrive. No one came in or out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have seen the back door if you were parked out front,\u201d Rhoan said.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but the front door was unlatched when we got here. That\u2019s why we entered in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Rhoan glanced at me\u2014as if for confirmation\u2014then rose and walked to the end of the room. He disappeared through another doorway, but after a few minutes came back. \u201cOkay, the back door is locked and the security chain is still in place. They didn\u2019t enter that way. You two want to check the other rooms for an entry point?\u201d</p><p>I glanced briefly at Jak and, in unspoken agreement, he checked the rooms on the right, and I checked the ones on the left. Crime scene recorders floated along after each of us, making a note of everything we did. In the rooms I checked there were no windows open, no windows unlocked, and no sign of any other sort of disturbance.</p> <p>I said as much to Rhoan, as did Jak when he returned a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rhoan said, his voice grim, \u201cthat leaves us with three options\u2014he knew his killer, there\u2019s magic or some form of demon involved, or it was an Aedh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons?\u201d Jak said in an incredulous tone. \u201cAnd what the hell is an Aedh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one I\u2019ll let you field, Ris,\u201d Rhoan murmured, bending back down to examine torso remnants.</p><p>Jak\u2019s gaze came to mine expectantly. I grimaced. \u201cYou know how in many religious drawings angels are depicted as powerful and luminescent beings with wings?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re saying they\u2019re angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying they\u2019re the reason religion depicts angels as they do. They\u2019re the template. The reapers are actually the real angels\u2014they\u2019re the ones who guide the souls to heaven or hell, and they\u2019re also the warriors who protect us.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cReapers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I paused. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to see them all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he said. Then, \u201cWeren\u2019t you scared out of your mind as a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sensible person would be,\u201d Rhoan commented without looking up. \u201cBut, as we all know, sensible and Risa do not have a whole lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I said dryly, and he flashed me a grin. I glanced back at Jak. \u201cAnd no, I wasn\u2019t scared. How could I be? I\u2019ve always seen them, even if I didn\u2019t always know who or what they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould your mom see them?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, although she could see and talk to ghosts.\u201d I paused, studying him. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t believe in my mom\u2019s gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t believe the history she told everyone\u2014a history I all but debunked, as we know. I never refuted the fact she possessed some psychic skill.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cSome? You have no idea just how powerful my mom was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your skills are any indication, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d reached that conclusion without ever seeing half of my skills. Especially not my Aedh side\u2014which is why I\u2019d sidestepped mentioning it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about demons, then?\u201d he continued. \u201cCan you see them, too?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cYes. But they\u2019re not that commonplace\u2014hell is a pretty efficient prison.\u201d</p><p>At least until the keys had been created.</p><p>Jak scraped a hand across his bristly jawline. \u201cI\u2019ve learned more about this weird and wonderful world of ours in the last ten minutes than I did the last twenty-nine years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s information you will never repeat.\u201d Rhoan gave Jak his guardian expression\u2014the one that held no emotion and yet still spoke of all kinds of hell waiting for you if you dared disobey. \u201cNone of this is information we want known by the general population. We couldn\u2019t afford the panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they have a right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have the right,\u201d Rhoan interrupted, voice terse, \u201cto call in a telepath and erase your memories if you do not agree to keep this silent.\u201d</p><p>Jak glanced at me, his expression disbelieving. I could only smile grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it done. And the fact that you possess mild telepathy skills yourself won\u2019t save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this sucks.\u201d He blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cWhat about the Nadler story? Will I be allowed to print any of that, or am I wasting my time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can report it, within reason,\u201d Rhoan said. \u201cOnce the case is solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can agree to.\u201d He eyed Rhoan warily, then added, \u201cIs that deal solid, or is it more a \u2018have to check with my superiors first\u2019 arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s solid. I\u2019m second in command in the guardian division.\u201d</p><p>Jak grunted. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>A phone rang sharply into the brief silence. I jumped slightly, then reached for my phone\u2014only to discover it was Rhoan\u2019s. He answered it, and his expression got progressively grimmer.</p><p>\u201cGet another team out there,\u201d he said eventually, \u201cand tell them to report in as soon as they have prelim results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I breathed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, as he shoved his phone away. \u201cJacinta Nadler is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jak said. \u201cNadler really is clearing the remnants of the past, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a slow, deep breath. And wondered if Azriel was right\u2014that Mom\u2019s murder, and these, might be connected. But if Mom had known something about Nadler, how had Nadler known she did? As far as I knew, she\u2019d never met him.</p><p>Did that mean Azriel was also right in suspecting there was a rat in the ranks?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a thought I was willing to entertain, yet I couldn\u2019t entirely ignore it, either.</p><p>\u201cIt would appear that he is,\u201d Rhoan said. \u201cAlthough she wasn\u2019t murdered like this. It\u2019s been made to look like a home invasion\u2014she was raped, brutalized, and then her throat was cut.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. God. We\u2019d done that. We were responsible for that. If we hadn\u2019t talked to her\u2014</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d Rhoan said gently, obviously guessing the direction of my thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019ve also talked to both her and Blake. The only person to blame for these deaths is the monster behind all this.\u201d</p><p>He was right. I knew that, but it didn\u2019t make me feel any less responsible. Because they hadn\u2019t died when the Directorate had talked to them; they\u2019d died when I had talked to them. But I didn\u2019t say anything, watching as he ran a gloved finger around the bloody separation wound just below the victim\u2019s belly button. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s almost as if someone has thrust a hand into Blake\u2019s stomach and somehow ripped him apart from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAedh,\u201d I said, rubbing arms suddenly chilled. \u201cThe Aedh can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can demons,\u201d Rhoan said, standing up. \u201cLet\u2019s not discount anything or anyone until we have forensic results.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cThey should be here any minute. In the meantime, why don\u2019t we start going through Blake\u2019s belongings and see if we can find anything that relates back to Nadler. Or anything else that seems out of place.\u201d</p><p>He must have seen the surprise cross my face, because he added wryly, \u201cI have officially given up trying to keep you out of this investigation, so I might as well make use of you. And I hate paperwork of any kind, even if it is simply going through it to find clues.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cWhere do you want to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with the first bedroom, and work our way through the house from there.\u201d</p><p>Which is precisely what we did. It was a long, boring process and by the time we\u2019d gone through every room\u2014except the kitchen, which now held the cleanup team\u2014I was tired, hungry, and more than a little over it. Which was probably the whole reason Rhoan had agreed to let us help. It wasn\u2019t so much that he hated this sort of paperwork search; it was that he was hoping it would act as a deterrent and stop me from sticking my nose in any further.</p><p>There was zero chance of that happening.</p><p>I leaned my shoulder against a doorway and averted my gaze from the goings-on in the kitchen. \u201cWhat about a storage shed? Did you see one outside when you checked the back door?\u201d</p><p>Rhoan nodded. \u201cYou two can look at that while I get an update from the team. Use the side gate.\u201d</p><p>As one, Jak and I spun and headed out. \u201cPhew,\u201d Jak said, \u201cit\u2019s nice to breathe air untainted by blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed, although in all honesty, I\u2019d stopped smelling it after the first half hour.

Two small garden sheds sat in the far corner.</p><p>I opened the door of the first one and looked inside. It was all garden tools and whatnot. \u201cAny luck with that one?\u201d I asked Jak as I relocked the door.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, disappearing inside. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of plastic tubs.\u201d</p><p>I stopped just behind him. \u201cPlastic tubs containing micro disks, no less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundreds of them. We could be here for months.\u201d He flashed me a grin. \u201cNot that I\u2019d mind being stuck in a tiny room with you for that long. I reckon I could break down your resistance to my obvious charms by the end of it.\u201d</p><p>I nudged him with my elbow. \u201cYou start at that end, I\u2019ll start at this.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked to the end of the shed, pulling down the first of the tubs and quickly breaking the seal. It didn\u2019t take all that long to find disks dated the day Nadler was married\u2014all the tubs were categorized by year and month, so it was simply a matter of checking the dates of the first couple.</p> <p>\u201cFive disks for Saturday the eighteenth,\u201d Jak said, pulling them out and handing them to me. \u201cYou got somewhere we can check them? I really don\u2019t want to hand them over to the Directorate without at least seeing what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have at work.\u201d I hesitated, biting my lip. I had no doubt that Rhoan would claim these disks the minute we left the shed, but I really needed to know why Jacinta and Blake had died, and these things just might hold the answer.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s going to do us a fat lot of good when it\u2019s there and we\u2019re here,\u201d Jak said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Silently, I added, Azriel, would you mind freezing him again?</p><p>Azriel appeared behind him and did precisely that. \u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d</p><p>I dropped my purse on the shelf near Jak, then wrapped my fingers tight around the small disks. \u201cI\u2019m going to Stane\u2019s in Aedh form, and get him to do a quick copy.\u201d</p> <p>Azriel frowned. \u201cIt is dangerous to take Aedh form\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s even more dangerous to be on the gray fields at the moment. We have to take some chances if we\u2019re ever to solve this mess.\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a moment, then nodded. \u201cI will meet you at Stane\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, closed my eyes, and called to the Aedh within. The magic responded slowly, almost sluggishly, which meant that I was still pushing my limits strength-wise. I needed to eat and I needed to sleep, and I very much suspected the latter of those wasn\u2019t going to be on my agenda for a while yet.</p><p>Eventually, though, the heat and energy that was my Aedh half surged, numbing pain and dulling sensation as it invaded every muscle, every cell, breaking them down and tearing them apart, until my flesh no longer existed and I became one with the air. Until I held no substance, no form, and could not be seen or heard or felt by anyone or anything.</p><p>Except reapers and undoubtedly the Aedh, if they were close enough.</p><p>I flowed out of the shed and into the sky, zooming quickly across the city, my form buffeted by the gentle breeze beginning to stir the heated afternoon. Stane lived on West Street in Clifton Hill, in one of the two buildings not purchased by the consortium. The Phoenix club\u2014a twenty-four-hour bar that was situated several doors down from Stane\u2019s\u2014was the other. It was also the reason Stane\u2019s place was covered with graffiti and had thick grates over the windows and door. Apparently the Phoenix\u2019s patrons didn\u2019t mind engaging in a bit of drunken destruction as they made their way home.</p><p>I swept under the front door and into the small space zoned off by the containment field, then re-formed shape. But my legs were jelly and I dropped like a stone to my knees, red-hot needles jabbing into my brain and every breath feeling like it was tearing at my lungs. It was so bad this time that I couldn\u2019t even maintain the face-shift. Its energy crawled across my skin as I resumed my regular form, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. Just as there was nothing I could do about the pain, the shaking, and the sweeping bouts of dizziness and nausea other than wait until they all eased.</p> <p>The camera above the doorway buzzed into action, and a voice said, \u201cFuck, Risa, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBut give me a minute or three, and I will be. And turn off the field.\u201d</p><p>Energy flowed through my mind, a sweet caress that did little to ease the pain. A heartbeat later, Azriel appeared, the heat of his presence flowing over me, chasing the chill from my flesh.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d he asked, as he knelt beside me.</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d I took a shuddering breath. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep siphoning your strength to me, Azriel. Sooner or later it\u2019s going to turn around and bite us on the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is a rather illogical expression when you think about it.\u201d</p><p>I half laughed, but it came out a groan as the pain sharpened abruptly. \u201cGod, don\u2019t make me do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I won\u2019t let you do is take Aedh form to return,\u201d he said, his voice still soft but edged with steel. \u201cYou are at your limits now.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t even sure I could take Aedh form again. Not until I\u2019d regained some strength, anyway.</p><p>Footsteps clattered down the stairs and a second later Stane appeared. For once, he wasn\u2019t covered with dust and cobwebs, although his brown hair was still unruly and his jeans still wrinkled. But his short-sleeved white shirt had been ironed and he was actually wearing shoes rather than going about in bare feet.</p><p>\u201cLiking the new look.\u201d I pushed into a more upright position and winced as the needles in my head went into another stabbing frenzy. \u201cI\u2019m gathering you\u2019ve got a hot date?\u201d</p><p>Stane gave Azriel a nod of greeting, and knelt in front of me. \u201cActually, Mom\u2019s coming for a visit. I thought I\u2019d better clean up.\u201d</p><p>My gaze swept the downstairs area. It was small, cluttered, and smelled of dust and mold. There were shelves everywhere, all packed with boxes, old and new computer parts, and ancient-looking monitors of varying sizes.</p><p>Of course, mold and dust weren\u2019t exactly good for computers or the various other bits of electronic equipment scattered about, but I\u2019d learned a while ago that this area was little more than a ruse. The expensive items were all kept upstairs.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have bothered,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to take one look at this area and have a heart attack. Your normal state is positively pristine compared to all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she knows exactly what I\u2019m like, but she likes me to make an effort on a personal level when she\u2019s visiting.\u201d His gaze scanned me pensively. \u201cYou look as if you need Coke, painkillers, and food\u2014and not necessarily in that order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne and two would be good,\u201d I said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time for the third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I shall run ahead and get them ready.\u201d He paused, his gaze falling on the disks I still clenched in my hands. \u201cThey for me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI need them copied quickly so I can return them before they\u2019re missed.\u201d And before I was missed. Rhoan might have said he\u2019d given up resisting the inevitable, but I suspected that wasn\u2019t entirely true\u2014not when it came to my chasing down leads without his input.</p><p>Stane took the disks and gave them the once-over. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I never throw anything out. They stopped production of these disks at least ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot surprised. I just hope they\u2019re okay\u2014they\u2019ve been stored in a shed for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as the container was airtight and out of direct sunlight, they should be all right. They have a long life span.\u201d He pushed to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll see you both up there.\u201d</p><p>I watched him bound back up the stairs and wished I had half his energy.</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d Azriel commented, \u201cif you didn\u2019t push yourself so much.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a somewhat wry look. \u201cThe lack of sleep isn\u2019t entirely my fault, buddy boy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in agreement. \u201cBut I was not aware it would affect you so. Next time I shall be more cautious.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows and tried to ignore the sudden jump in my pulse rate. \u201cI thought you said there would be no next time.\u201d</p><p>He studied me, his face giving as little away as usual. \u201cIt was merely a figure of speech, not an indication of intent.\u201d</p><p>In other words, what he wanted and what he intended were two totally different things.</p><p>He rose, the movement abrupt. \u201cDo you want help to get up?\u201d</p><p>I put my hand in his and let him haul me upright. For several seconds the room did a drunken dance around me, and it was only his grip that kept me upright. Eventually, the pain and dizziness eased. I took a deep, somewhat shaky breath, and glanced down. My clothes, as usual, hadn\u2019t exactly come through the Aedh shift in one piece.</p><p>My jeans had fared the best, with only a couple of small holes dotting the calf area. The dust from the missing patches clung to the skin visible underneath, giving my leg a weird blue sheen. My tank top was rather ragged around the edges and now had ventilation across my belly button, but it was at least still wearable. The same could not be said about my panties, which were little more than annoying bits caught in unmentionable places. One of these days I was going to learn to keep a change of clothes in my purse\u2014although it wouldn\u2019t have done me any good in this instance, because my purse was back in the shed.</p><p>\u201cReady to move?\u201d Azriel asked.</p><p>I took another deep breath, then nodded and walked forward carefully. The needles in my head reacted, but not as fiercely as before, and by the time we reached the top of the stairs, I felt a little more normal. Or at least as normal as I ever got lately.</p><p>Stepping into Stane\u2019s inner sanctum was like stepping into another world\u2014a world that was clean, shiny, and filled with the latest in computer technology. In fact, Stane\u2019s system dominated the main living area and wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place on a spaceship. There was a bathroom to our immediate left, and a bedroom farther down, although I doubt he used it much\u2014he seemed to spend much of his life stationed at his bridge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grabbed one of the spare chairs near the computer and plunked down rather inelegantly. Stane came out of the kitchen area in the living room and handed me some painkillers and an open can of Coke.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I quickly downed both the pills and several large mouthfuls of fizzy soda, then swallowed a burp and added, \u201cHow long will the transfer take?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA couple of minutes. What are we looking for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese disks came from the man who photographed Nadler\u2019s wedding. We\u2019re hoping that if we have a youngish picture of Mr. Elusive, we might be able to figure out what he should look like these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever thinking.\u201d Stane pressed several buttons on the left console screen. On the right, thumbnail images flashed up. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no maybe about it. I have a program that can age any facial image fed into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d I wheeled the chair closer and indicated the thumbnails on the screen. \u201cThey from the first disk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst and second,\u201d Stane confirmed. \u201cHow are we going to know which one is Nadler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to his wife yesterday. It should be easy enough to pick her out.\u201d I leaned forward a little, scanning the images that were loaded onto the screen. \u201cNone of these is her.\u201d</p> <p>He grunted and scrolled the screen over to the next page. \u201cThese are the third and fourth disks.\u201d</p><p>The first lot of images was a continuation of the previous ones, but a buxom blonde began appearing in the latter half. \u201cThat\u2019s Jacinta Nadler,\u201d I said, pointing.</p><p>\u201cAnd a rather well-endowed lass she is,\u201d Stane said as he enlarged one of the pics. \u201cLet me guess\u2014she\u2019s a stripper or works as a topless waitress in a strip club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every woman who has large tits works in a strip club,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know, but she has the look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a look?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly reserved for those who have been in the business for a while\u2014there\u2019s a world-weariness evident in their eyes.\u201d He indicated her picture. \u201cShe\u2019s young here, but she\u2019s got it, which suggests she\u2019d been working at the game for quite a few years before she married Nadler.\u201d</p><p>I remembered the impression I\u2019d had that Jacinta Nadler had never been the innocent she made out to be\u2014even at eighteen. \u201cSo how do you know so much about strippers and their game?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cHacking into strip club security cams is an entertaining way to keep the skills up, not to mention have a bit of fun.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cWhy would a well-to-do businessman risk his reputation by marrying a stripper?\u201d</p><p>Stane laughed. \u201cAre you kidding? Look at her. I\u2019m betting Nadler was in his forties when the two of them were hitched. She\u2019s blond and big-breasted\u2014the classic type of woman men like him seem to go for when their midlife crisis happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they don\u2019t often marry them.\u201d And I\u2019d never thought to ask her how she\u2019d met Nadler, which was stupid because it might have given us another means to find him. I frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you could do a search on her, and see if you can pull up a bit of history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTax file records are probably our best bet if we want to know where she worked.\u201d</p><p>That had me raising my eyebrows. \u201cYou can get into the tax office records?\u201d</p> <p>He gave me the sort of look a teacher might bestow on a bright but inattentive student. \u201cIf I can get into the Directorate records, why would you think I couldn\u2019t get anywhere else? Trust me, the Directorate has the latest and greatest anti-hacking features.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it hasn\u2019t stopped you from accessing their system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. But it does take me longer these days.\u201d He wheeled across to the other screen and typed for several minutes.</p><p>I leaned forward and hit another of the images loading onto the screen. And there, standing beside a glowing Jacinta, was the man who had to be John Nadler.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d expected. He was tall, with thick black hair, an arrogant sort of nose, and lips that were little more than pale slashes in his thin face. His eyes were a cold, hard gray, and his body slender but wiry. He looked mean, I thought, and I wondered what the hell Jacinta had seen in him. Or was he merely a way out of a life she\u2019d hated\u2014a life she\u2019d been forced to return to after he\u2019d all but destroyed her?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stane said, wheeling back to my side of his bridge. \u201cSearch under way. It shouldn\u2019t take that long.\u201d</p><p>I indicated the picture on the screen. \u201cMeet Mr. Elusive himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf his eyes are any indication, he\u2019s not the sort of man you\u2019d want to run into on a dark night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to see his eyes to guess that,\u201d I murmured. \u201cAnyone who\u2019d set a soul stealer onto a little girl is someone with very little in the way of compassion or humanity.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, flashed the photo onto another screen, then opened it in an app and began to work on it. Within a couple of minutes, we had several different photos of just what Nadler might look like now.</p><p>\u201cThat one,\u201d Azriel said, pointing at the third image on the screen, \u201cis the Nadler Logan saw. Only he had a small scar near his left temple.\u201d</p><p>The image he pointed to was basically a more lined, silver-haired version of the younger Nadler. \u201cJacinta didn\u2019t mention a temple scar, so Nadler must have acquired that after he\u2019d divorced her.\u201d</p><p>Stane glanced at us. \u201cI gather the Logan you\u2019re talking about is Nadler\u2019s lawyer?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe was murdered last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Stane scraped a hand across his jaw. \u201cThis fucker means business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but to kill off someone so closely involved in his current business dealings could make a bit of a mess of said dealings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Logan\u2019s practice wasn\u2019t a solo one, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m betting one of the other partners knows enough to take over the reins. Our fake Nadler wouldn\u2019t risk jeopardizing his plans by having no one else up-to-date on the lay of the land, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d He studied the image for a moment, then pointed to the scar on Nadler\u2019s forehead. \u201cThat looks fairly serious. Might be worth checking to see how it was acquired.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cIf he is a face-shifter, it wouldn\u2019t matter. He can simply make it disappear when he reverts to his regular self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019re certain wounds that are impossible for any shifter to heal. Those made with silver, for instance, will always leave a scar, and sometimes the wound can be so deep that scarring is inevitable.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cYou should know that, given how many scars your Aunt Riley has.\u201d</p><p>Good point. \u201cCan you do a disk print of those for me? And send a copy of the younger and older Nadler to my phone? I\u2019ll need to give the disks to Uncle Rhoan, but I want some images to work with myself.\u201d And at least if I gave him the disk, he wouldn\u2019t be as shitty with me when he realized I\u2019d already copied them. And he would\u2014the tattered state of my clothes would be enough of a giveaway to someone who knew what I was.</p><p>Stane nodded, clicked a button, then flicked the pictures into another program on the other side of the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll run a search on all the photos and see if I can find a match on any system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to exist somewhere.\u201d He couldn\u2019t disappear off everyone\u2019s radar once he\u2019d left the office\u2014not if he wanted to maintain credibility as Nadler. And he could hardly kill off every single person who currently knew him. That would only make it easier for the Directorate to connect the dots.</p><p>Stane rose and walked across to the printer sitting on the coffee table\u2014although just why it was there rather than closer to his bridge was anyone\u2019s guess. He came back with a disk. \u201cAll possibilities are recorded on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I shoved the minute disk into my jeans pocket\u2014there was just enough fabric left to hold it in place. I finished my drink, then pushed to my feet. \u201cWe\u2019d better get back.\u201d</p><p>He gathered Blake\u2019s disks and handed them to me. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if we get any hits.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cThanks, Stane.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMy pleasure. As I keep saying, the black market is positively boring after you lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d rather have your boring life than my exciting one at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone always thinks the other person has it better,\u201d was his somewhat philosophical comment. \u201cIt\u2019s the way of humanity.\u201d</p><p>It might be the way of humanity, but in this case, he was very wrong. I glanced at Azriel. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me, nodded a good-bye to Stane, and then his energy surged, flooding through me, sweeter and sharper than before. As were the gray fields in the few brief moments between leaving Stane\u2019s and reappearing in Blake\u2019s shed.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d I grabbed Azriel\u2019s arm tightly as the shed reeled around me. I waited until everything settled, then added, \u201cWhy did the fields appear so much clearer this time?\u201d</p><p>He half shrugged. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re merely getting used to traveling with me, and therefore are more able to understand what you see.\u201d</p><p>Which was totally logical, yet not the real answer\u2014but why I was so certain about this I couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cI usually see delicate-looking structures, but this time they just seemed more solid.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cAnd there were beings\u2014or at least, wisps of them. Sort of like souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could have been souls under escort.\u201d He shrugged again and walked over to Jak. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our watcher, by the way.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around\u2014a pointless action when I\u2019d never been able to see our Cazador follower in astral form. \u201cReally?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. It would appear he loses the connection when we take alternate form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a shame I haven\u2019t the strength to take it more often.\u201d It would have been nice to be able to follow up on leads without Hunter knowing our every move.</p><p>Azriel touched Jak on the neck, and disappeared. Jak blinked; then his gaze focused on me and he said, \u201cI guess making a run for it with the disks is out of the question?\u201d</p> <p>It took me a moment to realize he was continuing the conversation we\u2019d been having before Azriel froze him. \u201cYou can try, but that will only lead to the access we\u2019ve been given to the crime site being abruptly withdrawn. Besides, Uncle Rhoan isn\u2019t only half wolf; he\u2019s half vampire, too. You wouldn\u2019t have any hope of outrunning him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we lose the information we came here to get?\u201d he said, frustration evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t. Just trust me, okay?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and then his gaze swept me. \u201cHow come your clothes are suddenly tatty? And how the hell did your hair change color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story. Let\u2019s get these back to Uncle Rhoan before he comes looking for us.\u201d</p> <p>I grabbed my purse and walked out. He was very quickly beside me. \u201cYou\u2019re avoiding the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What are you hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecrets, of course.\u201d I gave him a somewhat wry glance. \u201cSecrets I\u2019m not about to reveal to a reporter, let alone the one who besmirched my mom\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, then said slowly, \u201cNadler\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s a face-shifter, is he?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the secret. Or at least one of them. I suspect you have a whole lot more, because from what I understand of face-shifting, it doesn\u2019t destroy clothes like shifting into wolf form can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve talked to lots of face-shifters to confirm this, have you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHa. Confirmation of my guess. Where\u2019d the skill come from\u2014your mom?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who did the extensive background check on my mom. You tell me.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cPack background wasn\u2019t something I could pin down. But if she was a face-shifter, she had to be a Helki. No other pack has that skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not going to confirm or deny anything, so give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know I won\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve become something of a challenge to me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and pushed the gate open. Uncle Rhoan was just stepping around the side of the house. His gaze swept down and came to rest briefly on the disks I held before continuing on, taking in the state of my clothing. His gaze had narrowed by the time it met mine, but all he said was, \u201cAny luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese disks are the ones Blake took on the day Nadler was married.\u201d I slipped the smaller one into his hand, as well. \u201cThat last one could prove useful when it comes to looking for the current Nadler.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and pocketed the disks. \u201cWhere are you two off to now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, now we have to report our every move to you?\u201d Jak said.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to remain out of jail and on this case, yes,\u201d Rhoan said, rather mildly considering the spark of annoyance that flared in his eyes.</p><p>I touched Jak\u2019s arm, stopping him from saying anything else, and said, \u201cNadler\u2019s lawyer was murdered last night. We might go talk to his secretary, and see if it was somehow connected to Nadler, or if he was working on anything else that might have warranted his death.\u201d</p><p>Rhoan continued to eye me dubiously. He knew me well enough to understand that I was planning a whole lot more than that. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you were at that fund-raiser last night, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We found the body and called the cops, in fact.\u201d There was no sense denying it, because he could easily enough trace the call back to my phone.</p><p>\u201cAnd the murder? Did you also witness it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would have hung around if we had.\u201d</p><p>His expression was somewhat disbelieving. \u201cYou should have hung around anyway.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cI had somewhere else I had to be. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t explain why Jak didn\u2019t hang around.\u201d</p><p>Jak just shrugged. Truth be told, he was probably wondering why he hadn\u2019t hung around also.</p><p>Rhoan grunted. It wasn\u2019t a happy sound. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you not to talk to Logan\u2019s secretary, because you\u2019ll just go ahead and do it anyway. But I do expect you to keep me up-to-date with what\u2014if anything\u2014you discover. Because believe me, if I find out you\u2019re keeping stuff back, I will throw your asses in jail until this is all over. And not even my sister will get you out of it.\u201d</p><p>I knew an ultimatum when I heard one, so I simply nodded. He continued to eye me for several seconds, then stepped to one side and allowed us to pass.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jak said, once we were clear of the house and walking back to our cars, \u201cthat was intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And he was deadly serious about throwing us in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered that, so keep the man updated, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>I flashed him a grin. \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t fancy cooling your heels in jail with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. I\u2019ve been in jail once when I ignored a judge\u2019s \u2018no-print\u2019 order.\u201d He shuddered briefly. \u201cI don\u2019t care to repeat the experience\u2014even with you.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cDo you think you can use your wily press ways to uncover where the secretary lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t even a challenge for a reporter as good as me.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and leaned my butt against the side of his car while he made several phone calls. Eventually he turned and said, \u201cOkay, she lives in a town house in Doncaster\u2014you want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019ll save you driving me back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would. You and me trapped in a small car is not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me? I\u2019m mortified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA statement that would be more believable if you didn\u2019t have that smirk on your face.\u201d I pushed away from the car. \u201cJust give me the address and I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>He did. \u201cBetter not be late\u2014I just might start questioning her without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter not. I\u2019m all that\u2019s standing between you and jail, remember.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThe way things are going, you\u2019ll be the reason I\u2019m thrown in jail.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, but couldn\u2019t deny it. As I headed for my car, my phone rang. I dug it out of my purse and hit the ANSWER button. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hello,\u201d a familiar voice said. \u201cAre we over our snit yet?\u201d</p><p>I ignored the jibe. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Lucian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can think of lots of things, but I\u2019ll settle for a simple dinner date.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing simple about dinner dates with him\u2014that I knew from long experience. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the snit lingers on, so the answer is no.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cRisa, we both know that you could have stopped me anytime you wanted. You simply didn\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>That was possibly true\u2014if I\u2019d had Amaya on me and had forced him back at sword point. I doubted I\u2019d have had the strength\u2014or rather, the willpower\u2014to do it otherwise. Which, again, struck me as odd because up until now I\u2019d never been a pushover when it came to men and sex. But then, up until now I\u2019d never been involved with a full Aedh, either.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point, Lucian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I swear on bended knees not to push against your desire like that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I might forgive you,\u201d I said with a half smile. \u201cJust not today. After all, you did bet that I\u2019d only last two nights without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will hold my tongue in the future,\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cSo, what have you been up to without me? I\u2019m guessing your father hasn\u2019t been in contact with you about finding the next key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Life has been the same old, same old, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning you\u2019re at work?\u201d he inquired. \u201cAgainst the reaper\u2019s wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel doesn\u2019t run my life any more than you do,\u201d I said mildly\u2014and, hopefully, sidestepped the question of where I was.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but he does have a point when it comes to your restaurant. It\u2019s too easy for the Raziq to find you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept, as I keep telling him, they\u2019re hardly going to attack me somewhere where there\u2019s lots of people.\u201d But even as I said that, I remembered the Ania attack in the caf\u00e9 and shivered. And I had a bad feeling I\u2019d just tempted fate.</p><p>\u201cIf it proves easier for the Raziq to net you in a public space, then they will do so. For an Aedh, the end goal is all and nothing else matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is your end goal, Lucian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cWhatever it takes, whatever I have to do. But I\u2019ve never hidden that from you.\u201d</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t. But I was beginning to wonder just how big a part I was playing in his end goal. It was certainly bigger than what he was admitting, and that was making me more and more nervous.</p><p>And yet I still didn\u2019t want to walk away from him. Maybe I really was addicted to the damn man.</p><p>\u201cWell, this little piece of your revenge pie isn\u2019t ready to play nice just yet.\u201d I dug my keys out of my pocket and clicked the UNLOCK button. Lights flashed as the car opened.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that background noise isn\u2019t sounding like you\u2019re in the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the bored and horny investment adviser isn\u2019t even allowed to live vicariously through your eventful day-to-day life?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I snorted softly. \u201cGood-bye, Lucian. Talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, sooner than you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off in midsentence, tossed the phone and purse over onto the passenger seat, then climbed into the car.</p> <p>And only then realized I wasn\u2019t alone in the car.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>For a moment, fear froze me to the spot. And that\u2019s all it took for the Ania to wrap tightly around me and prevent movement. Amaya was screaming inside my head, her fury burning through my body and her flames flickering across my skin like angry fireflies.</p><p>\u201cAzriel!\u201d I screamed, physically and mentally, even as the Ania ripped me free of the seat and the car. I felt the heat of his approach. Then power exploded and there was no Azriel, no world, only darkness and an uneasy sense of movement.</p><p>It stopped with a suddenness that made my stomach lurch, and then I was dropped rather unceremoniously onto a surface that was cool and dry. Dirt, I thought, spitting it out of my mouth in between groans. I drew Amaya, then rolled onto my back. Her purple light spread across the black, parting it like glue. Rock surrounded me\u2014above and around. I was in a cavern of some sort, and there didn\u2019t seem to be either an entry or an exit point. My tomb\u2014for that\u2019s what it suddenly felt like\u2014was about four feet wide and about the same height. I could kneel, but I couldn\u2019t fully stand. But a breeze stirred sluggishly across my skin, which meant there was a link to the surface here somewhere, even if the air had a stale, somewhat old scent. And that in itself suggested not only that there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of fresh air getting down here, but also that I was deep underground.</p> <p>And if I was, it meant Azriel wouldn\u2019t find me. My being underground restricted our chi connection, and the deeper I was, the worse it became\u2014although apparently such restrictions didn\u2019t apply when reapers collected the souls of miners and others who died underground. Not that I was making any immediate plans for him to find me that way. What the Raziq planned was anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>I glanced up at the ceiling again, and this time noticed a faint, multicolored shimmer that reminded me of oil on water. I swore softly. That shimmer was a field of magic designed to prevent me from reaching for the Aedh\u2014something I\u2019d discovered the hard way the last time the Raziq trapped me underground. I guess I had to be thankful that at least this time their prison wasn\u2019t a sewer.</p><p>I sat up. As I did so, an oddly dark surge of electricity ran across my skin, making the little hairs at the back of my neck stand on end and my soul shiver away in fear.</p><p>The Aedh were near.</p><p>Fear slammed into my heart and for several seconds I struggled to breathe. I closed my eyes and battled for calm. I couldn\u2019t give in to fear\u2014not when I needed all my wits about me to survive whatever it was the Raziq had planned. Although what good mere survival would do me in this place deep underground I had no idea. It wasn\u2019t like I could run anywhere, even if I\u2019d wanted to. With that shimmer in place, my tomb had no exit point.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re there.\u201d My voice was croaky with fear but sounded oddly flat in the thick atmosphere of the little cavern.</p> <p>\u201cSheathe your weapon. It will do you no good.\u201d</p><p>The disembodied male voice held no threat, but it nevertheless sent a chill down my spine. This was the Raziq I\u2019d spoken to last time\u2014the Raziq that had invaded my brain and made it seem like every part of me was being torn apart.</p><p>I licked my lips and somehow said, \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t be worried about me holding it.\u201d</p><p>The lilac-lit shadows showed no hint of them\u2014not surprising, I suppose. It wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d shown a propensity to reveal themselves in our previous encounters.</p><p>\u201cWhy do human always have to make things difficult for themselves?\u201d he asked, almost philosophically.</p><p>I raised Amaya. The sword howled inside my head, a scream that was part anger, part frustration. Her fire spat through the thick darkness and, just for a moment, I saw him\u2014or rather, saw the shimmer of his energy, because he was little more than a pulsating mass of quicksilver. Then it disappeared and all that was left was a sensation of power\u2014power that was amplifying, growing stronger, burning my skin as it skimmed around my arms and snapped tight.</p><p>The minute it did, it felt like my arms were on fire. They burned and burned, until it felt like flesh and muscle were being peeled away layer by layer, until all that was left was bone. Bone that fissured and cracked as the flames continued to eat down. I screamed until my throat was raw and no sound came out, but somehow, through it all, I still managed to hold on to Amaya. Energy flowed from her, fueling my body, feeding my will to resist.</p><p>But the flames grew stronger, and one by one my fingers began to shatter, until there was nothing left to hold the sword. She fell to the floor, her scream an echo of my own. The power eating my flesh slithered from my arms and wrapped around her. She slid across the floor, well away from both me and the Aedh, and was suddenly silenced. It made the thick atmosphere within the tomb even more frightening and, for a moment, I feared the worst. Then I noticed firefly flickers down her bright edges. They might have silenced the spirit within the sword, but they certainly hadn\u2019t killed her.</p> <p>Relief surged, but for several minutes I could do nothing more than rock back and forth, nursing the broken remnants of my arms as tears streamed down my face. Eventually, the pain eased, and when I finally gathered the courage to look down at my hands, they were whole and unburned.</p><p>It had been an illusion. A painful, all-too-real illusion.</p><p>\u201cBastards,\u201d I said, scrubbing an arm across my tearstained face and silently rejoicing for the fact that I could do it.</p><p>\u201cWe desire your help,\u201d the disembodied voice said, \u201cand we will get it, whether you wish to cooperate with us or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can guess which end of that spectrum I\u2019m going to fall on,\u201d I said resolutely and no doubt stupidly.</p><p>But I just couldn\u2019t give these beings what they wanted, because, in the end, what they wanted was the permanent closure of the portals to heaven and hell. And that, in turn, meant no souls ever being reborn. Not only would the world become filled with the ghosts of those unable to move on, but many of the babies born would be without their assigned souls, and therefore they would be little more than lifeless flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou would be wise to reconsider your options,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be easier for you if you willingly comply.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cSince when has my welfare been a consideration in any of our dealings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t. It is merely practicality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can take your practicality and shove it where the sun don\u2019t shine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not wish to acquiesce?\u201d His energy began to build again, a maelstrom of power that rumbled like distant thunder across the outer edges of my senses.</p><p>Amaya flared brighter, her flames a furious swirl. I could\u2019ve sworn that just for a moment she moved.</p><p>I hugged my arms a little tighter. I knew what was coming. Knew, and feared it. And part of me needed to delay it for as long as I could. Maybe if I did, Azriel might find me. Save me.</p><p>A false hope was better than no hope.</p><p>I swallowed heavily and said, \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d</p><p>He paused, as if that was a question he hadn\u2019t been expecting. \u201cWe wish your help in finding your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true. You want the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is our ultimate objective, yes. To achieve it, we need Hieu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father might know the general direction of the keys, but he can\u2019t actually find them for you. Which means you need me, as well.\u201d</p><p>And that meant that no matter what they did to me, they couldn\u2019t actually kill me. It wasn\u2019t much comfort, however\u2014not given what they\u2019d already done.</p><p>\u201cYour father knows the location of the keys, so actually finding them should not present a problem for him. You are not so much of a concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ\u2014if he could find the keys himself, he would have done so by now. But only one of his flesh can find the keys and, thanks to you guys, he can no longer take on flesh. So, logically, that leaves me.\u201d</p><p>Of course, it was a statement that presumed he was actually telling the truth when it came to the keys, and I had a vague suspicion he wasn\u2019t. Not entirely, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat has been undone can be redone,\u201d the disembodied voice said evenly. \u201cThat is not a concern.\u201d</p><p>I was betting it was, because otherwise I\u2019d have been dead. \u201cYou held my father prisoner, so why didn\u2019t you force him to help you then?\u201d</p><p>A slight shimmer of energy snagged my attention, simply because it wasn\u2019t the darker energy belonging to the Raziq. I frowned, my gaze scanning the little cavern before coming to rest on Amaya.</p><p>She was definitely closer.</p><p>I had no idea how the hell she was achieving it, but I wasn\u2019t about to question it. Having her in my hand probably wouldn\u2019t make any difference to my situation, considering how the Raziq had divested me of her in the first place, but my fingers still itched to wrap around her hilt. She gave me strength and made me feel safer\u2014something I\u2019d never thought possible when Azriel had first produced her.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d the Raziq said, his voice no different and yet suddenly so filled with menace, \u201cis knowledge you do not require.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips and said, \u201cHow am I supposed to find my father when he\u2019s always been the one who\u2019s contacted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will give you a device that will notify us when you are in his presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what sort of device?\u201d Amaya was almost within reach of a sideways lunge. I shivered and resisted the temptation to move. \u201cAnd how does it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is attuned to Hieu\u2019s life force and will react when he is near. We will be notified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is smart enough to realize what the device is the minute he sees it.\u201d She was close, so close. My fingers twitched and tension began to wind through my muscles. \u201cHe\u2019ll get the hell out of there before you lot ever make an appearance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe do not agree.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t. I mean, you\u2019ve had such great success trying to track him down so far, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not so important. The keys are.\u201d</p> <p>If he wasn\u2019t so important, they wouldn\u2019t be doing their damnedest to find him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one key\u2014why can\u2019t you just make a couple more?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer immediately, but his energy surged around me, singeing the hairs on the back of my neck and making my skin crawl.</p><p>Anger. No, not just anger. Fury.</p><p>Maybe they weren\u2019t as unemotional as everyone believed\u2014at least not when it came to people thwarting their desires.</p><p>\u201cWe do not have the key for the first portal. Your father has it.\u201d</p> <p>No, he bloody well hasn\u2019t. I was pretty sure of that, if nothing else. Whoever had stolen the key was someone entrenched in magic\u2014magic that was dark, ungodly, and bitter. And while the Raziq\u2019s magic was dark, what I\u2019d felt of my father\u2019s wasn\u2019t. Not to the same degree, anyway.</p><p>But if my father or the Raziq didn\u2019t have the first key, that meant it had to have been a dark practitioner who\u2019d stolen it from under our noses\u2014and, more than likely, it was the same dark practitioner who\u2019d been buying up the land around Stane\u2019s\u2014a dark practitioner who was also a face-shifter.</p><p>As a general rule, sorcerers weren\u2019t able to walk the gray fields, but ley-line intersections were places of great power and could be used not only to manipulate time, reality, or fate, but to create rifts between this world and the next. A powerful enough sorcerer could enter the fields via the intersection and find the gates.</p><p>Which is precisely what our thief had done\u2014walked the fields, and permanently opened the first portal to hell.</p><p>Still, it must have taken a whole lot of energy...</p><p>Shit\u2014why hadn\u2019t we thought of that before? That might well provide a way of tracking down this bastard...</p> <p>I shoved the thought aside. That was an avenue I could explore later, when every little thought wasn\u2019t being listened to by the Raziq.</p><p>I flicked a sideways glance at Amaya. Almost there. \u201cSo why not make more keys? I mean, you all had a finger in the pie of the first lot, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf by saying that you mean the Raziq as a whole were involved in their creation, then yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why bother with me or my father at all? Why not just make more keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause each key was attuned to a specific portal. Unless they are unmade, more cannot be created.\u201d</p><p>So my father hadn\u2019t lied\u2014the keys could be destroyed. If nothing else came out of this little session, at least we had that.</p><p>Although destroying them would just allow the Raziq to create more\u2014which meant we were damned if we did and damned if we didn\u2019t. Personally, I\u2019d rather see the stupid things remain as they were, lost to everyone, but it seemed I was the only one who felt that way. Even Azriel thought it was far too dangerous to leave them undiscovered.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to cooperate?\u201d the Raziq added.</p> <p>I took a deep, shuddering breath. Thought about consequences. Knew I had no choice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>As I said it, I lunged for Amaya. I never got there.</p><p>The pain hit like a sledgehammer, knocking me sideways and damn near senseless in the process. I lay on the dirt in a quivering heap, battling to breathe as their dark energy tore through every part of me and my brain felt like it was on fire.</p><p>Because this wasn\u2019t just a psychic attack. It went far deeper than that. It was an attack on my body and soul, and it felt like every fiber of my being screamed in agony. Only I made no noise because the sound seemed to be stuck somewhere inside my throat.</p><p>The torture continued, on and on, until I was raw and battered and bruised. My skin ran with rivers of blood that soaked into my clothes and deep into the earth, until the bitter smell of it stung the air and burned my throat. And still it went on, until it felt like they were pulling me apart atom by atom, until there was nothing left of me but a screaming, bloody mass of separated particles.</p><p>Eventually\u2014mercifully\u2014I blacked out.</p><p>But it was a state that lasted nowhere near long enough. As I climbed backed to consciousness, the dark energy of the Raziq still burned at me. It hurt\u2014god, how it hurt\u2014yet within that energy, something fierce and bright burned, calling to me.</p><p>Amaya.</p><p>She lay underneath my hand. All I had to do was grasp her... and do what?</p><p>I had no idea. I was working on pure instinct now, totally incapable of any actual thought processes.</p><p>My fingers twitched; felt metal. Somehow, I found the strength to grasp her.</p><p>I expected fury. Expected to be hit once again by the illusionary flames that had burned her from my grip the first time. But nothing happened. The dark energy continued to flow through me, this time rebuilding rather than tearing apart. My body continued to shudder, scream, but Amaya burned brighter in my mind, her energy flowing through me, giving me strength.</p><p>The dark energy began to ease, trickling away like water down a drain, leaving me a quivering, broken wreck.</p><p>Now, an alien voice whispered through my brain.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think. I just obeyed.</p><p>I forced my eyes open. Amaya was dark and ghostly, giving no hint of the fierceness that burned within her\u2014and within me. Beyond her, I saw the shimmer that was the energy of the Raziq who\u2019d attacked me.</p><p>I drew Amaya back and threw her. It wasn\u2019t a strong throw\u2014it couldn\u2019t be, not after everything I\u2019d just been through.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Amaya flew straight and true, flaring to glorious life just as her black blade buried itself in the heart of that dark shimmer. Purple fire exploded as Amaya\u2019s flames wrapped around the Raziq\u2019s energy, capturing it, drawing it back into herself. Feeding on him.</p><p>He screamed. Screamed. As I\u2019d screamed\u2014long and hard\u2014until his voice was raw and he could scream no more. If I\u2019d had the energy I would have danced with joy.</p><p>There was another explosion, and the force of it shifted me sideways several inches. The flames and the Raziq were gone, leaving only blessed silence.</p><p>Amaya slid across the floor toward me, and almost of their own accord, my fingers wrapped around her again. She felt heavy in my hand. Sated.</p><p>Somehow I managed to sheathe her. We might have killed one Raziq, but there were plenty more where he\u2019d come from. I didn\u2019t want them forcing me to drop her again, and the fact that they hadn\u2019t seen her either in my hand or in flight made me suspect that if she was sheathed or cloaked, they couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I lay there waiting for the hammer to fall, my body on fire, every part of me aching and my clothes wet with blood and god knows what else. I stank of fear and sweat and blood and urine, and I knew it wasn\u2019t over yet. Not by a long shot.</p><p>That oily, rainbow shimmer still crawled across the roof of my tomb, so the Raziq were still here even if I was no longer capable of sensing them. Not that I would have been able to call to the Aedh even if they hadn\u2019t been present\u2014I just didn\u2019t have the strength or will.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d a new voice said, \u201cwas unexpected.\u201d</p><p>Which had to be the understatement of the century.</p><p>\u201cBut at least,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe transfer was completed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I licked dry lips. It didn\u2019t help much, because I had little in the way of saliva. \u201cTransfer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you would not agree to use the device, we placed it within you.\u201d</p><p>Well, it won\u2019t be there for fucking long, I thought resolutely. I didn\u2019t say anything, but then, I didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>\u201cIf you remove it,\u201d the Raziq said, voice still amazingly calm considering I\u2019d just killed one of them. But he was Aedh\u2014practical, unemotional, cold. As long as their objective had been achieved, I doubted they\u2019d care how many of their number I killed. \u201cYou will die.\u201d</p><p>Fear crawled inside me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it cannot be removed. It will cease functioning if you die, but I suspect you would not wish that.\u201d</p><p>He suspected right. But that didn\u2019t actually mean I had to believe him. Aedh might be cold and unemotional, but I had no doubt they weren\u2019t above lying if it suited their needs.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d the voice agreed. \u201cBut in this case, there is no need. The device was interwoven into the fabric of your heart when we re-formed you. To take it out, you must take out your heart.\u201d</p><p>Oh, fuck. Two words that really didn\u2019t seem adequate enough for the shit I was now in.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not aid us. This way, we know your location at any moment, and we will know when your father nears you.\u201d</p><p>Meaning they\u2019d have me and my father. Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>Then his words hit me. I might have fallen deeper into the shithole, but it might just have one silver lining...</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you won\u2019t be sending Ania and other assorted demons against me and my friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will know where you are at any given moment. There is no need for us to do anything else.\u201d</p><p>Which at least meant I could sleep in my own bed again. The relief that surged at that thought said a lot about the sorry state of my life at the moment.</p><p>The dark energy rose again and I cringed, hating the cowardice even as I did it. But it wasn\u2019t his energy\u2014it was Ania. They spun around me, blanketing me with their ethereal forms, whisking me into that place of black nothingness and uneasy movement.</p><p>Then, suddenly, I was back in the car.</p><p>But not for long. Arms gathered me and held me close, and the sensation of movement hit again. This time, instead of darkness there were silver buildings and insubstantial beings. Then they were gone and I was back in the hotel room, cradled against a body that was warm and strong.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. I couldn\u2019t say anything. I just wrapped my arms around Azriel\u2019s neck and held on tight. Not that he appeared to be in a hurry to release me.</p><p>His warm energy spread through me in gentle waves, chasing away the chills, healing the hurt, soothing the aches. After what felt like ages, I took a deep, shuddering breath, and said, \u201cYou have no idea how glad I am to see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, I do, because I am reading your thoughts.\u201d His voice was calm, yet there was an undercurrent within it that spoke of violence.</p><p>I opened my eyes and shifted just enough to look up at him. Even that small movement hurt, but it was more a dull ache than the frenzied needle stabbing I\u2019d been half expecting.</p><p>His eyes were dark with the fury barely hinted at in his voice. I raised a still trembling hand and ran my fingertips down his stubble-lined chin. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Azriel. They can\u2019t kill me. Not yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey unmade you. That is death itself in many ways.\u201d</p><p>I let my fingers slip down his neck and placed my palm over his heart. Its beat was strong and steady and real, and it somehow made me feel even safer than being cradled in his arms.</p><p>\u201cAt least they put me back together again,\u201d I said eventually.</p><p>\u201cBut you are not as you were. You are now tied to Raziq and it cannot be undone.\u201d</p><p>Not unless I die. Fear crawled into my stomach and I swallowed heavily. \u201cI know. But at least I can go home now, and I don\u2019t have to worry about Ilianna and Tao falling afoul of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is that.\u201d</p><p>He strode toward the bathroom. Once inside, he carefully placed me on my feet, then held me as the bathroom did a brief but dizzy dance around me.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I said, swallowing bile, \u201cI hope that doesn\u2019t happen too often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest.\u201d He gently began to strip the remnants of my clothing from my body. \u201cAnd eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But there\u2019s also Jak\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He said it softly, but his tone suggested that in this he would brook no arguments.</p> <p>\u201cAzriel, we need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated. \u201cDo not make me force you to rest, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Jak will be waiting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will visit Jak and alter his memories. You, for once, will do as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cGiven that I\u2019m in no fit state to argue, I\u2019ll obey. But don\u2019t expect such easy compliance next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, his gaze coming to mine. Humor crinkled his lips and teased the corners of his eyes. \u201cThat is one thing I never expect when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew the task was dangerous when you took it on,\u201d I said wryly. \u201cYou have no one to blame but yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he agreed. He turned on the shower taps, then slid his fingers down to my elbow. \u201cCan you manage to shower yourself, or do you wish assistance?\u201d</p> <p>At any other time I would have voted for assistance, simply because it would have led to a whole lot more. But I didn\u2019t even have the energy for anything resembling a sexual urge, let alone desire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d With my fingers pressed against the glass side of the shower, I stepped in cautiously and raised my face to the water. Its warmth ran down my body, washing away the grit, blood, and whatever else was sticky on my skin.</p><p>Azriel didn\u2019t release me immediately, his grip still on my elbow, as if he expected me to fall down at any minute. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked at him. \u201cYes. And thank you.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor knowing when to do nothing more than hold me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said softly, \u201cwill never be a problem.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and gently ran his fingers up my chin to my lips. It hurt, even though his touch was light. He dropped his hand, his fingers suddenly clenched. \u201cI will order your meal and then go take care of Jak. Call if you need me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my skin still aching from his touch. Once he\u2019d left, I simply stood there, letting the heat of the water chase the chill from my flesh and wishing it could do the same to the odd knot of coldness deep inside of me.</p><p>After what seemed like ages, I sighed and washed myself properly, then grabbed a towel and stepped out of the shower. One look in the mirror revealed the reason why Azriel\u2019s soft touch had hurt so much. Half my face was bruised, and there were similar blotches all over my body. It was as if in taking me apart so brutally, the Raziq had damaged the very fabric of me. And it made the bruises I\u2019d received when I\u2019d been knocked off my bike seem mild in comparison.</p><p>My bike... damn, in all the madness I\u2019d forgotten about her. And while a bent and busted Ducati sat pretty low on the scale of immediate problems, it was at least something that had a clear path of action.</p><p>Unlike everything else in my goddamn life at the moment.</p><p>I swung around and went in search of my phone, then remembered I\u2019d left it in the rear of the rental car. Which was unlocked, with the keys sitting inside. If it hadn\u2019t been stolen, it would be a goddamn miracle.</p><p>I scanned the room, found the hotel\u2019s phone, and rang Lonny to see what the damage was.</p><p>\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t pretty.\u201d His voice held even more of a drawl than usual, and that probably meant bad news. \u201cWe can fix her, but it\u2019s going to cost. Spare parts for that model are a bitch to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it takes. Fix her.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cFigured you\u2019d say that, so I\u2019ve already started ringing my sources. You want an estimate or shall I just go ahead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it.\u201d Money wasn\u2019t a problem, and even if it had been, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. She was the first thing I\u2019d ever purchased with my own money, and I\u2019d be damned if I let her go. Besides, she was a reminder of the sane, normal life I wanted\u2014a life that seemed to be slipping further and further away from me. \u201cThanks, Lonny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in contact if we have a problem,\u201d he said, then hung up.</p><p>I rang Ilianna next, getting an update on Tao\u2014who was still improving but not yet conscious\u2014and asking her to alter the power of her wards so that Azriel could get into our apartment.</p><p>The doorbell rang as I said good-bye to her. Figuring it was probably the meal Azriel said he\u2019d order, I shouted, \u201cHang on a minute,\u201d then quickly threw on a shirt and jeans. I grabbed some of the change I\u2019d dumped onto the bedside table the night before and walked across the room to open the door.</p><p>\u201cJust put it\u2014\u201d The words froze in my throat.</p><p>Because it wasn\u2019t just a waiter and one of those new hover trays standing outside my door. A grinning Lucian stood behind them.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d the waiter said politely.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, just put that over on the table.\u201d I stepped aside and waited until the tray and the waiter had moved past, then quickly raised a hand to stop Lucian. In a heated whisper I added, \u201cHow the hell did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply phoned hotels asking to speak to you until I found which one you were staying in.\u201d</p><p>Damn, I should have thought of that. Next time I wanted to hide from the world, I\u2019d better use a false name! \u201cBut you didn\u2019t leave a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought you\u2019d have a harder time ignoring me if I simply turned up.\u201d His gaze suddenly fixated on my face and his smile faded. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the hands of the Raziq, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, but it was pointless denying it. And I guess if he was going to help us find the remaining keys, he had to know just how much deeper the shithole had gotten. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He swore softly. \u201cHow the hell did that happen? Why didn\u2019t the reaper stop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his job to protect you.\u201d</p><p>His voice had sharpened significantly, and the waiter glanced over at us. I gave him what I hoped was a reassuring smile, then met Lucian\u2019s angry gaze and added softly, \u201cHe is. But it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fucking is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian,\u201d I cut in. \u201cEnough. I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain.\u201d He glanced down at my hand. \u201cBut I would suggest you allow me to come in first.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my hand and waved him inside. The waiter had finished setting out my meal, and approached with the tray in tow. \u201cWill that be all, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d I gave him the change as a tip, then closed the door behind him.</p><p>Lucian stood in the middle of the room, his arms crossed and his stance radiating displeasure. \u201cSo, explain.\u201d</p><p>Rather than answering immediately, I walked over to the table and lifted the lid off the various plates. Azriel had ordered steak, vegetables, and pasta, as well as several cream cakes. After a few minutes of dithering, I picked up the triple-layer chocolate cake and started eating it. The steak and veggies might be the saner choice, but I needed the immediate sugar rush.</p><p>Lucian waited. Anger rolled off him, thick and heated. The little hairs on my arms stood on end, even as my pulse rate quickened. It wasn\u2019t exactly fear, and it wasn\u2019t a more sexual reaction, but rather sat somewhere in between. Which was kind of odd, because up until now I\u2019d always reacted on a purely sexual level to his presence.</p><p>\u201cOver the last couple of days,\u201d I said eventually, as I finished the cake and licked the cream from my fingertips, \u201cthe Raziq have made several attempts to capture me using Ania. We managed to thwart most of them, but we were simply caught off guard this last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they caught you off guard, then the reaper isn\u2019t doing his job,\u201d Lucian snapped. \u201cHe is sensitive to the creatures of hell\u2014there is no known way they should have been able to sneak up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t. They were transported in magically and were just there. There was nothing Azriel could have done to prevent it.\u201d I picked up my knife and fork, then glanced at him pointedly. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything, either, so stop giving me attitude and just sit down. Having to look up at you is making my head ache.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, but pulled out one of the chairs and sat. \u201cWhat, exactly, did the Raziq do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what they said, they unmade me and attached some sort of sensor to my heart. It\u2019ll inform them when I\u2019m in my father\u2019s presence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnabling them to capture him.\u201d His voice was grim. \u201cThis is not good news for those of us wanting to keep the keys out of their hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Then I frowned and added, \u201c\u2018Those of us\u2019? That\u2019s an odd way of putting it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they said they\u2019ve done. And they definitely pulled me apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bruises are evidence enough of that.\u201d He leaned forward and placed a flat hand against my chest. It wasn\u2019t a sexual touch by any means, but my pulse still reacted to the warm press of his fingers. After a moment, he swore and sat back. \u201cThe dark energy of the tracer definitely beats within you.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t surprised, but my stomach still sank. I guess a tiny, foolish part of me had hoped the Raziq had been lying. Still, I couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am not unfamiliar with such things. I\u2019ve seen their use before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a long time ago, and doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d</p><p>In other words, mind your own business. He and Azriel were more alike than they thought. \u201cThey said it cannot be removed.\u201d</p><p>His expression was grim. \u201cIt can\u2019t. Not unless you die.\u201d</p><p>Having Lucian confirm that particular fact made me feel sick. I put the knife and fork down and pushed the dinner plate away. \u201cWhich means the minute my father appears, they\u2019ll grab us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d He thrust to his feet and began to pace, every movement reeking of frustration. \u201cWhich does not mean it cannot be stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way it can be stopped,\u201d Azriel said, appearing in the room in a sudden rush of heat and anger, \u201cis via the use of dark magic. And that is never a wise choice.\u201d</p> <p>Lucian swung around, his expression like thunder. The dislike that emanated off the pair of them made me feel like I was a red cape between two bulls.</p><p>\u201cLots of unwise choices have been made over the course of the last few weeks,\u201d Lucian spat out. \u201cBut we do what we must to reach the endgame, don\u2019t we, reaper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark magic may be a path you choose to walk, Aedh, but it is not ours.\u201d</p><p>Lucian snorted and glanced at me. \u201cIf you believe he\u2019s not willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants\u2014and remember, what he wants is the same as what the Raziq want\u2014then you are a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d I said, rubbing my aching head wearily and wishing they\u2019d both just leave me alone, \u201cwhat I believe is that neither of you is telling me the entire truth when it comes to what you really want. That said, why do you both believe dark magic can null this thing inside me? Why not regular magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the tracker isn\u2019t of this time or place,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cAnd regular magic would not combat it. Only dark magic has that chance.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBut white magic is strong enough to combat dark, so why wouldn\u2019t it work against this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause what lies inside you is very different from the magic of this world,\u201d Azriel said. He stood on the other side of the table, his arms crossed and his face unreadable. But Valdis flickered with blue-black energy and the air around him seemed to shimmer with heat. \u201cBut that does not mean we should not explore the option.\u201d</p> <p>Lucian snorted. \u201cMy wings may be clipped, reaper, but I am still Aedh. Believe me when I say that the magic of this world will not be strong enough to counter what lies within her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich does not negate the fact that we should at least try it first,\u201d Azriel snapped. \u201cDark magic has a way of staining its users.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean this thing inside me is dangerous?\u201d I asked hesitantly.</p><p>Azriel glanced at me. \u201cI do not know.\u201d Silently, he added, Has Amaya reacted to it?</p><p>I frowned. She seems no worse now when it comes to background chatter than she was before the tracer was attached.</p><p>If the tracer in your body does anything more than inform the Raziq of your father\u2019s presence, she will react to it. Until she does, you are probably safe.</p><p>It was the \u201cprobably\u201d bit of that sentence that was worrying. I glanced at Lucian again. \u201cIf anyone can counter this tracer, it\u2019ll be the witches at the Brindle.\u201d</p><p>Lucian snorted and crossed his arms. \u201cI do not have your faith in their teachings or their power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? The Brindle may not, in itself, be old, but it still contains eons of witch history and teachings. If there is any way to combat this tracer, then it\u2019ll be found there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>My annoyance flared brighter. \u201cWhy are you so damn sure that dark magic is the only way to go? You\u2019re Aedh, not Raziq. What experience have you even had with dark magics?\u201d</p><p>His smile was remote and cold. It was a reminder that underneath the \u201chumanized\u201d outer layer, a true Aedh still lay within. \u201cHow do you think the keys were made? How do you think the tracer was made? It wasn\u2019t the clean, bright power of the fields that was used, but rather the energy that lies between the dark portal itself and blood. Aedh blood.\u201d</p><p>My father had told me the keys had been made with blood, but for some reason I hadn\u2019t made the connection to that and blood magic\u2014and that\u2019s what we were talking about here.</p><p>I rubbed my temples again and said, \u201cHow do you know so much about the creation of the keys, Lucian? And how the hell would you know they\u2019re made with Aedh blood?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI was there when we found the first one, remember? I felt their darkness within it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you could feel it, why weren\u2019t you able to find the key?\u201d I was the one who\u2019d done that, not him.</p><p>\u201cYour father disguised the keys. It was only when we were close enough to touch the thing that I could feel the dark energy within it.\u201d</p><p>He lies, came Azriel\u2019s soft thought.</p><p>Why would he lie about something like that? I asked. Hell, if he\u2019d wanted the key himself, he could have taken it anytime during the ensuing attack. It wasn\u2019t like either of us could have actually stopped him\u2014we were too busy trying to survive. Or at least, I was. I hadn\u2019t even realized someone else was there\u2014someone other than the creatures who\u2019d attacked us\u2014until it was too late and the key had been taken.</p><p>You trust him too much, Risa.</p><p>And you distrust him too much. I glanced at Lucian. \u201cEven if the Brindle witches couldn\u2019t help us, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019d be wise to tempt any sort of blood magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark magic isn\u2019t always blood magic,\u201d Lucian replied. \u201cIt may be the strongest form of black magic, but it often also depends on the strength of the practitioner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rather moot point, given that none of us is, or knows, a dark practitioner,\u201d I said wearily.</p><p>And Ilianna would kill me if she discovered I was even discussing the option.</p><p>\u201cRemember, I have lived on this earth a very long time,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cI may not know or practice dark magic, but I do know how such practitioners might be found. It is not as hard as the witches of this world think.\u201d</p><p>I pushed to my feet and walked to the coffeepot. Lucian didn\u2019t move out of the way, forcing me to brush past him. The musky, powerful scent of him teased my nostrils, stirring the ashes of desire.</p><p>And again, that struck me as odd. I might be in a physically wretched state right now, but given the fierceness of our attraction up until now, I\u2019d have thought the stirring of lust would have been stronger.</p><p>I poured myself a coffee, then turned around and leaned back against the counter. \u201cIf,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cthe Brindle witches cannot find a way to mute the tracer, then we may have to resort to dark magic. But I draw the line at any sort of blood magic.\u201d</p><p>This is not a wise move, Azriel commented.</p><p>I knew that. I also knew that we might have no other choice\u2014not if we wanted to keep my father, the keys, and me out of Raziq hands.</p><p>Lucian nodded. \u201cI will see what I can find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I took a sip of coffee, then added, \u201cIn the meantime, get the hell out of here. I need to rest, and I can\u2019t do that with you two dumping animosity all over each other.\u201d</p><p>Lucian scowled. \u201cEvict the reaper, then. I cannot see why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian, go. We both know I probably won\u2019t get to rest if you stay, and right now that\u2019s what I need above anything else.\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept over me, and then he nodded. \u201cThis time I will comply.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d fucking comply next time, too. Otherwise, he and I wouldn\u2019t be seeing each other in any way. If there was one thing I couldn\u2019t abide, it was a man who ran roughshod over his partner\u2014a fact I thought he might have cottoned to after being on the outs these last couple of days.</p><p>He sent a less than pleasant glance Azriel\u2019s way, then spun and left the room. As the door slammed shut behind him, I walked back to the table and sat down. I pulled the dinner plate toward me and resolutely ate everything on it\u2014more out of the knowledge that I needed the sustenance than any real desire to actually eat.</p><p>\u201cYou should sleep,\u201d Azriel said softly. \u201cYou are running at the limits of your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I leaned back in the chair and drank some coffee. \u201cTell me honestly\u2014do you think the Brindle witches\u2019 magic is going to be strong enough to counter the Raziq\u2019s tracer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is an option we must try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cIn all honesty, I do not think it will. Aedh magic is strong, and the Raziq have traveled down a path that has twisted and darkened theirs. I doubt we reapers would be able to counter it, let alone human magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say reapers aren\u2019t particularly well versed in magic anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are soul guides first and foremost, but we were forced to at least gain some knowledge about magic and the portals when the Aedh priests all but died out.\u201d He half shrugged. \u201cBut the dark magic that beats within you is far stronger than anything we have dealt with up until now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A fact the Raziq had undoubtedly been aware of when they\u2019d shoved the tracer into me. I drank some more coffee, then said, \u201cWhat are we going to do about the Rakshasa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will find it and kill it, as the councillors require.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. He made it sound so simple, yet we both knew that was far from the case. \u201cYeah, but it knows you\u2019re hunting it now. Do you really think it will come into that room without first checking that we\u2019re not near?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we are not near, we cannot know when it arrives.\u201d</p><p>There was that. I gnawed my bottom lip for a moment, then said, \u201cThere was a camera in the room, and I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s sound, too. Maybe we could use that to our advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rakshasa will not be visible on a monitor. Nor will you hear either her or the ghosts through a microphone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but doesn\u2019t the Rakshasa scratch her victims and follow them home before devouring them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His eyes gleamed with sudden understanding. \u201cWe can watch for such an event from a distance, then arrive at the victim\u2019s house and set a trap for the Rakshasa before it arrives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe only trouble is, the victim will be a vampire, and will sense my presence before he or she gets near the door.\u201d</p><p>And given that I felt like shit and it was a state that didn\u2019t seem to be improving in any hurry, I very much doubted I\u2019d have the strength to remain in Aedh form for very long.</p><p>\u201cI will set the trap and wait for the Rakshasa,\u201d Azriel said softly. \u201cYou do not need to be near.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYes, I do. Hunter\u2014and the councillors\u2014want me to prove myself, not you. It has to be my sword and actions that kill this creature. Remember, her watcher is a witness to all that we do.\u201d I paused. \u201cOr have we permanently lost him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is downstairs. It appears he returns to our home base\u2014wherever that happens to be\u2014when we take energy form and he loses us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t alter the fact that I need to be involved in the Rakshasa\u2019s demise. I need to prove myself useful. Otherwise I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHunter does not want you dead. Not when you are still of use to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter is not the council, even if she has grand plans to become head supremo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not doubt that if Hunter wants you alive, you will remain alive, no matter what the council might threaten.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, but before I could say anything, my phone rang. For several seconds I debated whether I should answer it or not, but in the end, the need to at least know who it was won out over the need to retreat from the world and get some sleep.</p><p>One glance at the screen told me it was Jak. I hit answer and said, \u201cHey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time for small talk,\u201d Jak cut in brusquely. \u201cJust get your uncle to the secretary\u2019s place quick smart. Three men just busted their way into her house and they obviously don\u2019t intend to sit down and chat.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d I said, then added, \u201cDon\u2019t go in. Wait until we get there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRis, it\u2019s three against one woman. I can at least even the odds a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJak, you have no idea what you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get the rest of the sentence out, because the bastard hung up on me. I swore, hit my contacts list, and dialed Uncle Rhoan.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d he said, his voice resigned.</p><p>\u201cJust got a call from Jak. Apparently three men just busted their way into Logan\u2019s secretary\u2019s place. You need to get someone out there immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell is Jak there, and not you?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cLong story, but I\u2019m about to head there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRis\u2014\u201d</p><p>I knew what was coming, so I hung up. It\u2019d piss him off, but right now I was more concerned about Jak\u2019s safety than Rhoan\u2019s fury. Jak might be a werewolf\u2014and more than capable of handling himself in any normal situation\u2014but this was about as far from normal as you could get. Just because they looked like human males didn\u2019t mean they actually were.</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rest of the sentence caught in my throat as Azriel\u2019s heat and arms wrapped around me. Then we were out of there, zipping through the gray fields so fast they were little more than a blur. My feet touched solid ground a heartbeat later, and the air became thick with the sound of screaming\u2014a scream that stopped all too abruptly. The brief silence that followed was broken by the snarls of a wolf\u2014Jak.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Azriel said, immediately disappearing again.</p><p>I snorted and ran for the house. You\u2019d think he\u2019d know by now that I wasn\u2019t about to obey an order like that\u2014no matter how sensible it might be.</p><p>The snarling had come from a town house at the rear of a block of eight. More than a dozen people had gathered in the driveways of the other houses\u2014all of them peering toward the very last town house in the row\u2014but no one approached it. Which was pretty sensible, given that most of the people watching were either women with children or elderly.</p><p>I ran past them all and around the double garage that dominated the front of the town house. The front door had been forced open, with one half left swinging from a hinge that was barely holding on and the other lying in pieces on the white tiled floor. There was no sound coming from inside the town house now. Everything was ominously quiet.</p><p>Ignoring the tension that curled through my belly, and hoping like hell that Jak was okay, I drew Amaya and stepped inside cautiously. The purple fire flicking down her length was muted and halfhearted, and her hissing was little more than its usual background noise. If there was danger here, she wasn\u2019t sensing it.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t be careful.</p><p>I took several wary steps. Bits and pieces of furniture lay scattered everywhere, evidence of a fierce fight. The air was rich with both scent of blood and the musky odor of wolf, and twined within it was the fainter, more odious scent of unknown males. Human males.</p><p>But three human males\u2014no matter how strong\u2014shouldn\u2019t have been able to overwhelm a werewolf unless they\u2019d gotten the drop on him.</p><p>Or they\u2019d been armed with silver.</p><p>I walked cautiously through the living room and into the dining room. There was less mess here, an indication, perhaps, that more running than fighting had happened.</p><p>I stepped into the next room\u2014the kitchen\u2014and saw Jak. He was sitting on the floor leaning back against one of the cabinets, his eyes closed and an expression of pain etched into his face. He was nursing an arm that was bloody and torn, and his clothes were less than decent\u2014although I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a result of the shape-shifting or the fight. But he was alive, seemed relatively unhurt\u2014slashed arm and pained expression aside\u2014and relief slithered through me.</p><p>Until I looked beyond him. A gray-haired woman lay still and silent on the floor near the small table, her neck twisted at such an odd angle it could only mean it had been broken. Her eyes were open but unseeing, and an expression of terror had been forever frozen onto her face.</p><p>Jak hadn\u2019t been able to save her. I closed my eyes and cursed the killing efficiency of Nadler\u2019s men.</p><p>But at least Jak had gotten one of them\u2014and the bastard was still alive. He was lying several feet away from the woman, his legs also twisted into odd shapes. He probably would have been screaming had he been conscious, and part of me was tempted to slap him awake just so he could suffer for the death he\u2019d caused.</p><p>I resisted the impulse, though, and sheathed Amaya as I walked over to Jak. His nostrils flared; then a slight smile touched his lips\u2014indications that he knew I was close even if he didn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><p>I knelt wearily beside him. \u201cI thought I told you to stay outside and wait for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to do that when someone is being murdered.\u201d He finally opened his eyes and gave me a somewhat annoyed look. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a bastard, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were. I just didn\u2019t want you hurt.\u201d</p><p>I gently pulled away the remnants of his shirt and inspected the wounds underneath. The knife wounds were long and deep, and while some of the bleeding had been slowed by his shift back into human form, the deeper ones were still weeping.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d he said in a surprised voice. \u201cI would have thought the opposite.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a lopsided smile. \u201cIf I\u2019d wanted you hurt, I would have done it myself. Which doesn\u2019t mean,\u201d I added hastily, as his gaze warmed, \u201cthat I am, in any way, ever going to forgive you for what you wrote.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI sometimes regret what I wrote, but I\u2019m afraid it never lasts long. It was a good story, Risa, and it was the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is the only way I can ever report things.\u201d His gaze sharpened. \u201cAnd now, you\u2019d better tell me about that sword-wielding man who suddenly popped into existence and saved my ass.\u201d</p><p>I sat back on my heels and wondered why he\u2019d seen Azriel\u2019s real form.</p><p>In this case, simply because I allowed it. Generally, it is only powerful clairvoyants who see us as we are.</p><p>Which Jak isn\u2019t, so why reveal your true self?</p><p>You trust him.</p><p>Yeah, but I trust Lucian, too.</p><p>That is totally different.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so sure it was, but I glanced back at Jak. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to shift shape and heal your wounds first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the damn question, Risa,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m really not in the mood for games.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cRemember I mentioned that I could see the reapers?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a moment, then said incredulously, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me he\u2019s one of them?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAlthough technically, he\u2019s not just a reaper, but a Mijai\u2014he guards the gates to heaven and hell, and hunts down the bad things that come through them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He studied me for a moment, clearly trying to decide if I was pulling his leg or not. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I tore off my shirtsleeve and used it to bandage the worst of his wounds. \u201cDoes that mean you didn\u2019t believe me when I mentioned them before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I had no idea what to think. I mean, ghosts and demons I can accept, because there\u2019s been enough evidence of both over the years. But reapers? And winged beings that no one has ever seen except in the pages of religious books?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m an investigative reporter. We tend not to believe anything unless there\u2019s some form of proof.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cAnd when there\u2019s no proof, you make it up from half-truths or outright lies.\u201d</p> <p>His black eyes glimmered with sudden anger. \u201cI have never concocted a story. You of all people should know that.\u201d</p><p>I did. I was just being petty and baiting him\u2014not that I was about to admit it. \u201cThe secretary obviously knew enough to identify our face-shifter. It\u2019s bloody frustrating that his people got here before us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He seems to know exactly what we\u2019re up to. I mean, first Logan, then the photographer, now the secretary\u2014surely it can\u2019t be a coincidence that he\u2019s killing them in the same damn sequence that we\u2019re seeing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about someone who has shown no hesitation about sending a soul stealer against anyone who opposes his plans to buy up the area around the ley-line intersection. Who knows what other type of dark magic he has at his beck and call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic wouldn\u2019t reveal our intentions. Not from what I know of it, anyway,\u201d Jak said.</p> <p>I shrugged. I didn\u2019t know enough about magic to say whether it was possible or not, but there was definitely some force at work here\u2014even if it was human based. Jak was right\u2014the sequence of the murders very likely wasn\u2019t a coincidence.</p><p>Awareness surged across my skin, and I twisted around. Azriel appeared with two men in tow. Both of them were pale and wide-eyed with terror. Obviously, the journey through the gray fields had shocked them.</p><p>He dropped them unceremoniously on the floor. They stayed where they fell, breathing but unmoving, meaning he\u2019d restrained them in some way, even if the restraints weren\u2019t visible.</p><p>His gaze moved from me to Jak. Do you wish me to render him unconscious?</p><p>No. I\u2019ve told him about you. It\u2019s easier. Out loud I added, \u201cDid either of the men tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not men\u2014they\u2019re Razan.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked. That was something I hadn\u2019t expected. Razan belonged to the Aedh\u2014did that mean our face-shifter was either Aedh or in league with one?</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be,\u201d I said automatically, even as instinct suggested it very likely was.</p><p>\u201cHate to interrupt,\u201d Jak said dryly, \u201cbut what the hell is a Razan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, it\u2019s the long-lived human slave of an Aedh,\u201d I answered, almost absently. To Azriel, I added, \u201cAre they wearing the tattoo?\u201d</p><p>In reply, he leaned down and tore the shirt away from the back of one of his captives. Two tattoos were revealed\u2014one of a dragon with two swords crossed above it and, on the right shoulder, a ring of barbed wire.</p><p>Confusion swirled through me, and I frowned. \u201cThat barbed-wire tat is the same one the rat-shifter saw on the fellow who\u2019d paid him to deliver the note and the book from my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Jak said, exasperation in his voice, \u201cyou really need to introduce me to the seminaked, sword-bearing reaper. And second, I thought you didn\u2019t know your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know my father until recently,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd Jak, meet Azriel.\u201d</p> <p>The two men nodded at each other. Azriel said, \u201cThe fact that these men are Razan suggests your father could be in league with our fake Nadler\u2014if these men were sent here by Nadler, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else who would gain any benefit from the death of Logan, the photographer, and now his secretary, so it has to be Nadler.\u201d I paused, chewing absently on my lip. \u201cAnd it makes no sense for my father to be involved with someone like him. Even if he can no longer attain human form, he\u2019s probably more powerful than any human could ever hope to be.\u201d</p><p>Azriel nodded in agreement. \u201cEven a human involved in dark magic who has control of a ley-line intersection would not be as powerful as your father.\u201d</p><p>It should have been one hell of a scary thought, but maybe I was simply too damn tired and sore to feel any more scared than I already was. I rubbed my aching head wearily, and said, \u201cNone of this is making any sense, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not to me,\u201d Jak muttered.</p><p>I gave him a half smile, but it faded quickly at the sound of approaching steps. I almost reached for Amaya, then relaxed as a voice said, \u201cRisa, it\u2019s Harris West from the Directorate of Other Races.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the kitchen,\u201d I answered, a little surprised that Rhoan hadn\u2019t come. But then, he was head guardian these days, and I guess I couldn\u2019t always expect him to show up when I called.</p><p>But he\u2019d still sent one of the daytime division\u2019s best. While most vamps weren\u2019t able to traverse the daylight hours, other nasties could, which meant these days the Directorate had a full complement of specialized non-humans in its ranks. From what Aunt Riley had told me, I knew that Harris wasn\u2019t only a powerful werewolf; he was also an extremely strong telekinetic.</p><p>He appeared several seconds later, a tall, dark-haired man with handsome features. His eyes were the blue of the ocean, his shoulders broad, and his body lithe as a wolf. He scanned the room quickly, his gaze pausing on Azriel and briefly narrowing\u2014which made me wonder just whom he saw\u2014before finally coming to rest on me. \u201cUp to your neck in it again, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. I gather Rhoan updated you on what has been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He also suggested that I wring your scrawny neck,\u201d he said in a wry voice. \u201cBut I\u2019ll settle for an update.\u201d</p><p>I gave it to him, suddenly grateful that Rhoan hadn\u2019t shown up. Harris took statements from Jak and Azriel\u2014although Azriel merely backed up what I\u2019d already said\u2014then, as the cleanup team arrived, told us to leave.</p><p>I helped Jak rise and we walked outside. I, for one, was more than a little relieved to have gotten off so lightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Jak said, still cradling his bleeding arm.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m going home to catch some sleep. I think you need to stop that arm from bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant case-wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m all out of ideas right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about those photo disks you gave your uncle?\u201d</p><p>God, I thought irritably, he was like a rat with a tasty morsel\u2014he just wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cI have copies in the hands of a computer geek who\u2019ll contact me the minute he gets any relevant information out of them. Until he does, we\u2019re basically at a standstill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to know how you managed to get those photo disks to your friend without me or your uncle realizing it.\u201d Jak paused, his gaze moving past me. \u201cOr did your reaper friend have a hand in that? I\u2019m thinking if he can pop into existence to chase bad guys, it probably means he can transport himself around invisibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can.\u201d</p><p>The fact that I could\u2014when I was fit enough, anyway\u2014was something I kept to myself. I trusted Jak, but only to a point. If this whole scenario with Nadler didn\u2019t pan out into a decent story, I didn\u2019t want him suddenly deciding to do a follow-up piece on me.</p><p>\u201cSo until your friend comes through, we have nothing, as I said.\u201d He rubbed a somewhat bloodied hand across his bristly chin. \u201cI hate it when a story stalls. I might contact a few people and see if there\u2019s any whispers on the streets about these murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know me if you uncover anything interesting.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a wry sort of grin. \u201cI\u2019m hardly likely to do anything else, given the threat your uncle has left hanging over our heads.\u201d</p><p>If that threat prevented Jak from chasing leads without first informing me, then I couldn\u2019t be sorry about it\u2014even if I wasn\u2019t exactly intending to obey it myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ring you tomorrow if I don\u2019t hear anything before then.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, gave me a sketchy wave good-bye with his good hand, then headed off down the street, dripping blood as he went. Obviously he had no intention of shifting shape to heal himself just yet. But then, he\u2019d always been somewhat reluctant to shift shape in public\u2014mainly, I think, because he never liked to remind people he was a werewolf. Humans might have accepted non-humans as a whole, but that didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t pockets who feared all things supernatural\u2014especially at the very low levels of society, where suspicion of anything bigger and stronger tended to be entrenched. Jak might have the skill to relax people and make them talk, but that skill couldn\u2019t always override a base-level apprehension of non-humans.</p><p>I watched him walk away for several seconds, then turned to face Azriel. \u201cI need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. \u201cI believe I suggested that some time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m finally giving in to the inevitable\u2014if you\u2019ll zap me back home, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re abandoning the hotel?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI want to sleep in my own bed, seeing as the Raziq aren\u2019t such an immediate threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the things you left at the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get them later.\u201d When I was rested and able to think logically again.</p><p>\u201cThen home we shall go.\u201d</p><p>He stepped close and wrapped his arms around me once more. I rested my head against his shoulder and closed my eyes, enjoying the sensation of his physical presence as his heat and energy tore through me like a storm, sweeping me from that place to mine in a heartbeat.</p><p>As my feet touched the wooden floors of our building, I sighed in pleasure. The huge industrial fans hanging from the vaulted ceilings whirled, gently moving air that was cool and still smelled faintly of roses and lilac\u2014the scents lingering from potions Ilianna had been making earlier in the week. But there was dust on the dining table and over all the other bits and pieces scattered about, and there was an odd sense of abandonment in the way everything lay where it had last fallen. But I guess that was to be expected, since Tao was still unconscious and Ilianna was dividing her time between the Brindle and Mirri\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Azriel asked softly.</p><p>His breath tickled the top of my head and stirred a sense of well-being deep inside. Or maybe well-being wasn\u2019t the right word\u2014it was more a sense of safety. Of being right.</p><p>Which was dangerous thinking\u2014things would never be safe or right while the Aedh, the reapers, and Hunter were all such fixtures in my life.</p> <p>I pulled out of his warm embrace and took a step back. The big living room felt so much colder without the cocoon of his warmth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you are safely asleep, I will return to the fields and see what additional information I can uncover about ensnaring the Rakshasa.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI thought they were best caught in their lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but to trace this Rakshasa back to her lair, we first have to watch her dismember and eat her chosen victim. I don\u2019t think either of us could sit through that nightmare easily.\u201d</p> <p>He had that right. I hesitated, then leaned forward and dropped a kiss on his lips. \u201cNight, then.\u201d</p><p>Surprise and something deeper\u2014something that was desire and yet a whole lot more\u2014flitted across his expression before he got control of himself again. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kiss good night is something of a custom here on earth,\u201d I said, my lips still tingling with the warmth of his. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the woman who showed you the delights of human procreation never kissed you good night like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His expression gave little away, but there was a decidedly devilish twinkle in his eyes. \u201cIt is, however, a custom I could grow used to.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, but resisted the temptation to kiss him again, and backed away instead. I might be bone-weary and aching, but I had a suspicion if I did it again, the desire to rest would be overwhelmed by another sort of desire entirely.</p><p>\u201cNight, Azriel.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and winked out of existence. He was still near; I knew that because his heat swirled around me. I resolutely turned and made my way to the bedroom, stripping off clothes and letting them drop to the floor as I went. I\u2019d pick them up later, when I had more energy. I pulled back the covers, crawled underneath them, and was asleep before I could even smile in pleasure.</p><p>The sharp ringing of the telephone woke me sometime later. I opened an eye and glared blearily at the object making all the noise, but it didn\u2019t catch the hint and stop. After several more seconds of the incessant sound, I groped blindly for the handset and croaked, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you sound like crap,\u201d Stane said, all too cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel, so it\u2019s really no surprise.\u201d I rubbed my free hand across gritty eyes, then glanced at the clock. It was just after six, meaning I\u2019d had a whole five and a half hours\u2019 sleep. \u201cYou\u2019d better have a good reason for waking me, because otherwise I\u2019m going to send Azriel over there to beat you up.\u201d</p><p>Stane laughed. \u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re too much of a softie to do something like that to your friends. Besides, you need my hacking skills.\u201d</p><p>His hacking skills wouldn\u2019t be impaired by a little beating or two, I thought grumpily. \u201cStane, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA night out at the Red Iris, no expense spared.\u201d</p><p>I sat up abruptly, and bit back a groan as my head just about exploded. \u201cYou found Nadler?\u201d I said, the words little more than a hiss through gritted teeth.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve found the version currently striding around as Nadler. He has a little beach house down at Portsea. I\u2019ve just sent you the address.\u201d</p><p>Portsea being the sort of place where even the littlest of houses meant big prices. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any way you can check if he\u2019s down there?\u201d</p><p>After all, according to his neighbors, he hadn\u2019t been sighted at his Brighton home for some time, so there was no guarantee he\u2019d be in Portsea, either.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no handy-dandy traffic cameras nearby, so I had to resort to more underhanded tactics. In this case, that meant digging up his cell phone number. Which, I might add, was not an easy thing to do. Phone companies are fierce when it comes to protecting the private numbers of their customers.\u201d</p><p>But not fierce enough, obviously. Although it did have to be said that Stane was one of the best when it came to hacking.</p><p>\u201cSo, the dinner will include the finest bottle of champagne the Red Iris has,\u201d I replied dryly. \u201cJust get on with it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cOur Mr. Elusive is, according to the GPS tracker on his phone, at his Portsea house right this moment.\u201d</p><p>Finally, we\u2019d caught a break. I closed my eyes in relief. \u201cFor that, you can have two bottles of their finest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me know how it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d I hung up, then twisted around as the surge of energy told me Azriel had appeared. \u201cYou heard?\u201d</p><p>He dropped my purse and bag of clothes onto the bed\u2014obviously he\u2019d been back to the hotel room to collect them. For a reaper, he was pretty damn considerate. Sometimes, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cBut you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d I said, cutting him off before he could finish that sentence. \u201cGive it up. I\u2019m not going to be left out of this chase in any way. And if you leave without me, I\u2019ll just chase you in Aedh form.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the blankets off me, clambered out of bed, and went over to my huge walk-in wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cI know all that,\u201d he said, his tone still flat and yet oddly hitting at the annoyance that swirled like a distant storm somewhere deep inside me. \u201cBut I continue to hope you will eventually do the sensible thing. I know there is sensible in you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a grin as I pulled on some clothes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t appear all that often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d He\u2019d crossed his arms and was watching me somewhat grimly, but Valdis flickered with red-gold fire and the energy that surrounded him became more heated than usual. And it echoed through me, stronger than that distant storm and far, far more alluring.</p><p>Which was not what either of us needed right now. I resolutely ignored him and concentrated on the business of getting dressed. Once I was, I walked back to the bed to grab my phone, checked the address Stane had sent me, then shoved it and my wallet into my pockets before finally turning around to meet his gaze again.</p><p>Heat still shimmered between us, and if Valdis was any indication, he seemed no more able to control or deny it than I could.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help a slight smile. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Amusement touched his lips and warmed the edges of his eyes. \u201cI have noticed that about you.\u201d</p><p>Then his energy swept through the two of us, and as one, we surged across the incandescent fields before finding shape once more in the shadows of a two-story building.</p><p>Still far too aware of him for my own good, I stepped quickly away from his embrace, but the sharp movement had the world doing a crazy dance around me. I locked my knees against the wobble in my legs, determined not to fall. Azriel held out a hand, not quite touching me, but obviously ready to catch me. I think it was only stubbornness that kept me upright.</p><p>After a moment I said, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are in the front yard of the house across the road from Nadler\u2019s,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cThere is no one home, so there is no immediate hurry to move.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully. I looked around, trying to get my bearings. The area we\u2019d appeared in wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d expected. When Stane had said Portsea, I\u2019d been imagining the Port Phillip Bay side near the golf club and the peninsula. This looked to be the back beach area\u2014which meant the houses were a fraction cheaper and often older.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Nadler\u2019s? Is he\u2014or anyone else\u2014home?\u201d</p><p>His house wasn\u2019t much to look at\u2014in fact, it was pretty much typical of the beach houses that could be found up and down the bay. It was flat-roofed, with the ground floor being brick and the first floor weatherboard, and it featured a wide balcony that jutted out from the first floor, supported on either side by steel poles. A flat-roofed carport stood on the left side, and in it sat a Toyota Land Cruiser.</p><p>\u201cI cannot sense life inside,\u201d Azriel commented.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cSurely he couldn\u2019t have up and disappeared in the few seconds it took us to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought so,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cAnd his vehicle is still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s visiting a neighbor.\u201d I studied the houses on either side\u2014which didn\u2019t tell me a whole lot\u2014then dug my phone out and called Stane.</p><p>\u201cHey, that was quick,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t caught our man yet, so don\u2019t get excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cCan you check his location for us again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d A slight whoosh sound told me he was rolling from one desk to the other, and then he said, \u201cHe\u2019s still at the house. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Azriel\u2019s not picking up any sign of life inside the house, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just left his phone there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d But somehow, I didn\u2019t think so. Instinct was suddenly suggesting the reason was a whole lot darker than that. \u201cThanks, Stane. I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d</p><p>I shoved the phone away and met Azriel\u2019s gaze. \u201cI guess we should go in there and check it out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, caught my hand, and tugged me toward him again. We reappeared in what looked like some sort of rumpus room. It ran the width of the house and was very shadowed, thanks to the fact that all the blinds had been pulled down. A large TV and several sofas dominated one end, while on the other, there was a Ping-Pong table, and on the wall a much-used dartboard. The faint aroma of toast lingered in the air, but there was no kitchen in this room, so it was obviously drifting down from somewhere else. But there was something else underneath that scent\u2014something odd and unpleasant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frowning, I pulled away from Azriel again and somewhat cautiously stepped toward a door that led into a short corridor. My legs didn\u2019t wobble, but that one step still had a somewhat disastrous effect\u2014it set off an alarm, the sound shrill and ear-piercing.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I said, running into the corridor and hoping like hell it led to the front door. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think of the place being alarmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish to leave?\u201d Azriel said, his footsteps silent as he followed me.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I wish to turn the damn alarm off.\u201d</p><p>Immediately ahead were stairs leading upward, but the corridor made a sharp turn to the right and, as I\u2019d hoped, led to the front door. And right beside it was the alarm control box. It was very old technology, but it still featured a handprint scanner and that was something I couldn\u2019t get around. So I did the next best thing\u2014drew Amaya and shoved her sharp point into the heart of the box. The box exploded spectacularly, throwing sparks everywhere, but at least it shut the damn alarm off.</p><p>Although it still seemed to be sounding in my head.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, sheathing Amaya and looking around. I couldn\u2019t see any cameras\u2014one thing to be thankful for, I supposed\u2014and I doubted they\u2019d be hidden, given both the age of the house and the alarm. Hiding them would be more trouble than the old house was worth\u2014it was the land that was the prize with this place. \u201cWe probably have five to ten minutes to look around before either security or the police arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we had better proceed with our search.\u201d</p> <p>Azriel stepped aside and let me lead. I walked into the first bedroom, my footsteps echoing on the polished boards, the sound beating in time to the pounding in my head. The room, small but neat, contained little more than a double bed and a chest of drawers. The other three bedrooms were much the same, and the bathroom possessed a double shower and a sink. There was no sign of everyday use in any of the rooms, which meant that if our fake Nadler lived here full-time, he had to be doing so upstairs.</p><p>We went up to the next floor. And there, in the living room, discovered the source of that strange scent.</p><p>It was a body.</p><p>Nadler\u2019s body, to be precise.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, frustration heavy in my voice, \u201cthis fucks everything up.\u201d</p><p>I stopped near Nadler and stared at him grimly. He lay on the floor in front of the large, L-shaped leather sofa, and he was on his side, his knees tucked up toward his chest and his arms crossed. The pose was childlike, and there was an almost serene expression frozen onto his face\u2014as if this death was one he\u2019d welcomed. There was no blood, no apparent trauma on his body, nothing to indicate how he\u2019d died\u2014although his skin was extremely pale and looked decidedly strange. Almost like meat that had been left in a freezer for too long. My gaze drifted to his feet\u2014they were bare, and on one leg I saw the faded remnants of a scar. This was the real Nadler, if what Jacinta had told us was true\u2014in death, a face-shifter couldn\u2019t hold on to any physical alterations he might have made in life.</p> <p>Somewhat reluctantly, I stepped forward and touched him. His skin was cold\u2014almost icy\u2014and his muscles taut. It had to be rigor mortis, which meant he\u2019d been dead for at least twelve hours.</p><p>\u201cThis death is nowhere near that fresh,\u201d Azriel said, voice grim as he knelt beside Nadler.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cIf it was a lot older, he\u2019d be smelling more than he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the natural decomposition process has somehow been restricted.\u201d</p><p>Being stuck in a freezer would do that\u2014and it would also explain his icy skin and the freezer-burn look. I looked over at the open-plan kitchen. There was a refrigerator-freezer at the end of the counter, but the freezer section wasn\u2019t anywhere near large enough to hold a body\u2014even one curled up like Nadler was.</p><p>Azriel added, \u201cHis soul does not linger in this room.\u201d</p><p>Good. I\u2019d really had enough of ghosts for the moment. \u201cMeaning he died when he was meant to?\u201d</p><p>Azriel shrugged. \u201cThat is hard to say. Just because his soul isn\u2019t here doesn\u2019t mean this death was written. Souls tend to haunt the place where death found them\u2014if Nadler was not killed here, then his soul would not be here.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cCan you read the last moments of his life?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAs I said, this is not a fresh death. Memories do not linger for more than a day once the flesh is dead.\u201d</p><p>That they lingered at all was amazing. \u201cThen is there any way you can tell how long ago he was killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReapers escort souls. We do not analyze the method of their deaths.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and leaned a hip against the high back of the sofa. My muscles were still quivery, and even that minor bit of support felt good. \u201cYeah, but you hunt and kill demons who prey on humanity and destroy said souls\u2014surely that has given you some knowledge of when a death might have occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, yes. In this case, no. His body composition is not usual.\u201d</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t fully thawed, then I guess it would seem unusual. \u201cIf his death is a lot older than a day, it means he was probably already dead when both the secretary and the photographer were murdered.\u201d</p><p>Azriel glanced up at me. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cSo why would our face-shifter order them killed if he was ditching his Nadler identity anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a question I cannot answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014I\u2019m just venting.\u201d Damn it, this didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>He studied me for a second\u2014no doubt noting the way I leaned against the sofa and knowing full well why\u2014then said, \u201cThere is one possible reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He swept aside Nadler\u2019s dark hair to reveal his left temple. \u201cThere\u2019s no scar here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the version Logan knew had a scar,\u201d I said, suddenly understanding.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cAnd no doubt the one his secretary knew, as well. With them dead, there would be few left who dealt with him regularly and therefore few who could mention differences between the shape-shifter they knew as Nadler and this one, who is the real Nadler, given what Jacinta told us.\u201d</p><p>That made sense\u2014and it said a lot about my overall state that he was the one making these observations, not me. I mean, I\u2019d been around guardians all my life and over the years had learned a fair bit about the inner goings-on of the Directorate and the law. \u201cThen why kill Blake? He certainly couldn\u2019t have identified the recent version of Nadler.\u201d</p><p>Azriel shrugged. \u201cHumanity often suffers from illogical patterns of thinking.\u201d</p><p>It was a somewhat harsh observation, but sadly, more true than not. I scrubbed a hand through my hair, then glanced out the windows as the wail of sirens suddenly seemed to sharpen. \u201cWe\u2019d better get out of here. Can you take me back to Stane\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Surprise flitted briefly across his features, but once again I found myself in the cocoon of his arms as he shifted us. I have to say, it was a nice place to be.</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck,\u201d Stane said, as we appeared next to his bridge. \u201cYou guys could at least give a little warning before you do that\u2014it\u2019s enough to give someone a heart attack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not destined to die via a heart attack,\u201d Azriel said, his voice mild. \u201cSo I would not be concerned.\u201d</p><p>Stane gave him a somewhat uncertain look. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be relieved or worried by that statement.\u201d</p><p>Azriel offered nothing further, which only sharpened Stane\u2019s uncertainty. I smiled and walked into the kitchen to help myself to coffee.</p><p>\u201cOur hunt for Nadler hit a dead end. Literally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d Stane\u2019s voice was incredulous.</p><p>\u201cThe real Nadler is, yes. The fake has scarpered, it seems.\u201d I took a sip of coffee, blanched a little at its bitter taste, and threw several extra heaping teaspoons of sugar into it. It didn\u2019t help much, but I drank it anyway. I needed something to keep me upright.</p><p>\u201cWell, that puts a fucking spanner in the works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I walked back and sat down on the spare chair near his bridge.</p><p>Stane raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou have thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecidedly muddled ones at the moment.\u201d I half grinned. \u201cBut it occurred to me that whoever has been impersonating Nadler for the last ten years or so wouldn\u2019t have killed him off without a backup identity in place. He went to a whole lot of trouble to buy the buildings in this area, and I doubt he\u2019d relinquish control that easily. So there\u2019s either a fourth member of the consortium in place that we haven\u2019t yet uncovered, or Nadler\u2019s last wishes will ensure that our face-shifter still has control of all the land around here.\u201d</p><p>Stane frowned. \u201cIf there was a fourth member of the consortium, I would have uncovered him by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen our only other hope is digging up the will to see who was the main beneficiary.\u201d</p><p>He nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI can do a search through the trustees office and see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>The public trustees office was a government department that offered professional help when it came to wills, asset management, and estate management services. I sipped my coffee and thought about Nadler\u2019s body. \u201cWe do have another option. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d Stane asked, when I didn\u2019t immediately go on.</p><p>\u201cWell, when we saw Nadler\u2019s body, two things became obvious. One, he\u2019d been held in captivity for a while. He had an almost ghostly tone to his skin\u2014it was almost as if he hadn\u2019t seen any sun for a very long time. And two, I think he was frozen.\u201d</p><p>Stane blinked. \u201cFrozen?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe had a freezer-burn look about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d Stane rubbed a hand across his chin. \u201cWell, most decent-sized box freezers will hold a human body, and they could be put anywhere with power. But searching for it would be the proverbial needle in a haystack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you couldn\u2019t keep a body in a freezer just anywhere, could you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, no, but any storage facility with power would be suitable.\u201d He gave me a somewhat wry look. \u201cDo you know how many of those there are in this city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundreds, if not thousands. But we can still do a search for one under the name of Nadler, just on the off chance that we find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems unlikely he\u2019d be so stupid, but I guess it can\u2019t hurt\u2014and if we do find one, maybe I can raid the security tapes and see who has been accessing the unit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy thinking exactly.\u201d I finished the rest of the bitter coffee and stood. \u201cAs ever, let me know if you find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t forget the dinner you owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen this is all over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me if I\u2019m being a little picky, but this might not be over for months. Years, even. A wolf could starve in that time.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cSo, next week then.\u201d</p> <p>If, I added silently\u2014and somewhat grimly\u2014I was still alive in a week\u2019s time.</p><p>\u201cDate,\u201d he said.</p><p>I glanced at Azriel. He took the hint and whisked us out of there. Once we\u2019d reappeared at home, I walked into the kitchen. Stane\u2019s bitter coffee had woken me up, but I really needed something to eat if I was going to get through the rest of the evening.</p><p>I zapped a large helping of leftover lasagna in the microwave, then grabbed a fork and headed into the living room. Azriel was standing in the middle of it, his arms crossed and his pose watchful. Ever the guard, I thought, and wondered if reapers even knew how to relax.</p><p>\u201cNot in the sense that humanity does,\u201d he answered.</p><p>I dropped onto the nearest sofa. \u201cAs usual, that reply is not very informative.\u201d</p> <p>He half smiled. It sent a hum of delight swirling through me. \u201cIn very simple terms, we mingle energies and recharge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMingle energies? That sounds almost sexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no \u2018almost\u2019 about it.\u201d</p><p>So in their free time, reapers basically ran around having sex? And they called werewolves horny bastards. \u201cHow different is it from human sex?\u201d</p><p>This time the smile was full-blown and sexy, and it didn\u2019t just swirl, it stormed, leaving me breathless and aching.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as different as night from day.\u201d</p><p>A statement that did nothing to relieve the desire raging within me. I licked my lips and tried to concentrate on eating. However much my hormones might rage, now was not a good time for that sort of action. Christ, I was barely even capable of standing.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to stand to make love, my treacherous inner voice whispered.</p> <p>I studiously ignored it and continued to shovel food in until the lasagna was almost gone and I was sure I could speak with some semblance of normalcy. Not that he\u2019d be fooled\u2014there was that damn chi link, after all.</p><p>\u201cIs this mingling what you meant when you said you couldn\u2019t make love to me as a reaper, because I wasn\u2019t ready for it?\u201d</p><p>His expression closed up again. \u201cIn a sense, yes.\u201d</p><p>I sighed in frustration. Getting any sort of information out of him was like squeezing blood from a stone, but it was far worse when it came to questions about his life as a reaper.</p><p>Before I could say anything else, my phone rang, the sound sharp in the brief silence. The ringtone told me it was Hunter.</p><p>I briefly considered not answering it, but that wasn\u2019t likely to do much. The bitch would just track me down and confront me in person. At least if she was on the other end of the phone, she didn\u2019t have access to my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t ring with an update,\u201d I said without preamble, \u201cis because there isn\u2019t a whole lot to tell you. The Rakshasa sensed our presence in that room and made a run for it. Azriel wasn\u2019t able to track it back to its lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is extremely unfortunate given that the deadline clock is counting down.\u201d Hunter\u2019s voice was cool. \u201cI do not wish to lose a good resource, Risa, so I suggest you do your utmost to catch this thing.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. If she considered me a good resource, then her other resources obviously sucked big-time. My mother I was not.</p><p>\u201cTrust me\u2014I have no intention of getting dead just yet, but we do have a problem. I can\u2019t stand guard in the viewing room tonight. The Rakshasa knows we are waiting for it now, so it\u2019ll be overly cautious. We need to try something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, thinking fast\u2014not an easy task at the moment. \u201cThere are cameras installed in the ghosts\u2019 feeding room, so would I be wrong in thinking there are some who get off on watching others feed and kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She paused. \u201cThe camera feed goes down to several side rooms in the main bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of side rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sort you find in werewolf bars,\u201d she said, her voice dry. \u201cThe kind that allows participants privacy if they prefer.\u201d</p><p>The image of a blood whore\u2013addicted vampire jerking off while he watched another feed and kill made my stomach flip-flop, and I was suddenly glad I\u2019d just about finished the lasagna. \u201cSurely we could snag one of those to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if your reaper remains ready to fight. Marshall cannot remain with you for that long, and it is only his presence by your side that gets you through the bar safely.\u201d</p><p>I was betting Azriel had a whole lot more to do with that than she was giving him credit for. Every vampire might see him as something different, but reapers had a natural ability to see and take on whatever form a soul would most accept, so it was natural that they could also see what souls feared. Given the reaction of the nearby vamps, I was betting the latter was what he\u2019d been projecting.</p><p>Still, being in such close proximity to that many hungry vamps wasn\u2019t something I was keen on. \u201cThere have to be monitors elsewhere, surely. What about the security area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe security area is not situated on-site\u2014and the cameras in the feeding rooms do not transmit to the main system. We do not wish to risk anyone hacking into them.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if Stane could, then erased the thought. That would only put him in unnecessary danger, and I refused to do that any more than I already was.</p><p>\u201cBut surely someone is keeping an eye on what goes on down there. I mean, you haven\u2019t got an endless supply of whores\u2014have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Hunter\u2019s voice was cool. \u201cThat would be absurd\u2014and illegal.\u201d</p><p>My heart began to pound a little harder. It may have been absurd and illegal, but my intuition was prickling, suggesting that\u2019s exactly what they had.</p><p>An endless supply of blood whores could mean only one thing\u2014they were being created and farmed. They had to be\u2014how else could the vamps guarantee supply? And it would certainly explain the strange lack of memories in the two whores Azriel had tried to read, and their oddly identical eyes.</p><p>Fuck, this situation was getting deeper and shittier by the moment. And the worst thing was, I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I couldn\u2019t even tell anyone. We\u2019d all be dead in an instant if I did.</p><p>\u201cSurely Marshall has monitors in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does not,\u201d she replied coolly. \u201cIt is either the viewing room or one of the side rooms. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019d had a real choice, I would have gone back in time and recanted the words that had led me into this impossible situation. I\u2019d known when I\u2019d said them that it was stupid and dangerous, but I\u2019d been so desperate for revenge that I think I would have agreed to enter hell itself if it meant finding Mom\u2019s killer.</p><p>Working for Hunter, and being under threat from the vampire council, wasn\u2019t exactly hell, but it wasn\u2019t far off it, either. Especially considering that Hunter and the Cazadors were no closer to finding Mom\u2019s killer than we were.</p><p>\u201cTell Marshall we\u2019ll take one of the side rooms.\u201d We simply couldn\u2019t risk staying in the viewing room again. The Rakshasa\u2019s hunger might force her to return, but I doubted that she would simply appear like she had the last time. After all, she now knew we were here and, at the very least, would be more cautious.</p><p>\u201cThat is very brave of you,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThe council will be impressed.\u201d</p><p>And that, I suddenly realized, was the whole point of this exercise. Impressing the council, making them believe that keeping me alive was a far better option than killing me. This wasn\u2019t about the Rakshasa or the vampire killings. This was about Hunter strengthening her power base.</p><p>And I was one of the foundation stones.</p><p>I rubbed my head wearily. If I\u2019d had the energy I would have cursed long and fluently. But the truth of the matter was, I\u2019d brought this on myself by agreeing to her terms back in that forest, and now I had no option but to deal with it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck whether the council are impressed or not. I just want to find this thing so I can concentrate on the business of finding the remaining keys.\u201d</p><p>And with that I hung up. It might not have been wise, but I was way past tired and beyond caring.</p><p>\u201cThen get some sleep,\u201d Azriel suggested. \u201cI will wake you when it is time to return to the club.\u201d</p><p>My gaze rose to meet his. That thick sense of heat and desire still swirled within me, but stronger than that was the need to be held. Just held.</p><p>He took half a step forward, then stopped and clenched his fists. \u201cGo,\u201d he said, his voice holding a rough edge. \u201cRest.\u201d</p><p>I briefly closed my eyes, and half wished Lucian was here. He, at least, would have understood the need for contact and comfort that wasn\u2019t sexual\u2014although truth be known, while he might have held me, it wouldn\u2019t have been for long. He was a sexual being, and that\u2019s where it would have ended.</p><p>What I needed, I thought bitterly, was a straightforward relationship with a normal everyday man.</p><p>Someone like Jak\u2014only less work oriented and more trustworthy.</p><p>But an ordinary man was not something I was likely to find anytime soon. Nor was it wise to bring such a man into my current situation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which meant, like it or not, I was going to bed alone. I forced my feet into action and walked into the bedroom, where I stripped and climbed under the sheets. It wasn\u2019t long before sleep caught me, but it was far from peaceful. Visions haunted me\u2014blood and death and needle-sharp talons that sliced flesh to the bone.</p><p>It was only when arms wrapped around me and pulled me close to a heated body that somehow made me feel safer than I\u2019d ever felt that the dreams dissipated and I was finally able to sleep.</p><p>I followed Azriel into the bowels of Dark Earth, carefully watching where I placed each foot. It was pissing down outside, and although the hidden entrance looked solid, water seeped underneath it, making the steps slick and treacherous. The last thing I really needed right now was to break a leg.</p> <p>Mind you, if there had been the slightest chance that a broken bone or two could have saved me from the high council\u2019s edict, I might have considered the option.</p><p>We reached the long corridor and walked down to the door. It opened to reveal an impatient-looking Marshall.</p><p>He glanced at his watch when he saw us, then all but spat, \u201cWhat the hell time do you think this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s five to twelve,\u201d I said, somehow keeping my voice even, though all I really wanted to do was hit him one and then spin on my heel and walk out. I was working for Hunter, not her fucking lackey. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the same time we normally arrive, so why the carrying on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter told you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I snapped. \u201cAs usual.\u201d</p><p>Of course, I had hung up on the bitch. Maybe she\u2019d hung me out to dry information-wise because of it.</p><p>Or maybe she\u2019d never intended to tell me, especially if this was another bloody test.</p><p>Marshall\u2019s grunt didn\u2019t sound pleased. \u201cWell, the place is fucking packed tonight, which is why I wanted you here earlier. I wanted to get you into the side room before the main rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it matter? Everyone in the main bar will know I\u2019m there. They\u2019ll hear my heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but without really seeing you, they\u2019ll just presume you\u2019re one of the thralls entertaining a client. Now they\u2019ll know otherwise.\u201d He glanced at Azriel. \u201cHope your friend has come prepared to fight, because if things get nasty\u2014and I suspect they will, given the wait we have for the feeding rooms\u2014I won\u2019t be able to control it. Not with the size crowd we have.\u201d</p> <p>I stared at him for a moment, then said, with a touch of exasperation in my voice, \u201cYou can cut the act. I know the council intends to test me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want you tested, yes,\u201d he spat back. \u201cBut I\u2019m not entirely sure they want a bloodbath in this facility\u2014which is exactly what they might get by introducing fresh meat and inciting trouble at this hour of the evening.\u201d</p><p>Dread rolled through me. \u201cFresh meat?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look that hovered between annoyance and concern. \u201cWe\u2019re talking junkies here, remember? For most of them, any female in this club who isn\u2019t a vampire has two purposes\u2014to feed from or to provide sexual service. The thralls do the latter, the blood whores the former.\u201d</p><p>And if this did all end up in a bloody fight, it would just make the whole situation worse. Fresh-flowing blood and hungry vampires were never a good mix. \u201cWill you step in if things get bad?\u201d</p><p>The look he gave me was answer enough. He\u2019d been ordered not to.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he all but growled, and turned, leading the way into the main room.</p><p>The doors closed silently behind us, and the darkness felt thicker, more oppressive, than before. I walked down the steps, my gaze sweeping the room, searching for the many vampires I could smell but not see. The stench of their hunger sharpened as we moved through them, until it seemed so thick that I could reach out and touch it. Fresh meat indeed.</p> <p>I reached back and drew Amaya. She flared to life at my touch, her blade shadowed but dripping lilac rain across the floor. This time, her hissing was audible rather than just in my head. She was giving the nearby vamps a verbal warning not to come close\u2014even though that\u2019s exactly what she wanted. Her hunger and excitement ran like electricity through my mind, and I knew if I concentrated hard enough I\u2019d understand exactly what she was saying\u2014as I had when I\u2019d been the Raziq\u2019s prisoner. It might have been only one word, but it had been clear and it had helped me kill one of the bastards.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t concentrate. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t really ready to understand the language of my sword, and fear had a whole lot to do with it. I couldn\u2019t escape the notion that understanding her might somehow make me more like her and less like me.</p><p>Which might seem silly in the cold light of day, but right now, with darkness and danger all around us and her hunger beating a drum inside my brain, making me itchy to react, it seemed a very real threat.</p><p>So I clenched her hilt tight and edged a little closer to Azriel as we trailed Marshall through the darkness. Sullen, hungry faces were briefly illuminated in the fire of Amaya\u2019s brightness, then faded away, but the farther we moved into the room, the thicker and more dangerous the atmosphere became.</p><p>Azriel drew Valdis and swept her lightly from left to right. She hit nothing, but her blue fire lifted the darkness even further, and gave the gaunt figures that flirted briefly with the light a surreal glow.</p><p>A glow that spoke of hunger and need.</p><p>I shivered and hoped like hell the Rakshasa made an early appearance. I wasn\u2019t sure if the swords would keep the vampires at bay once Marshall left us.</p><p>They will not, Azriel said, because that is not what the council wish. They aim to test or kill, and they would be happy with either outcome.</p><p>Since Hunter doesn\u2019t want me dead, this test makes no sense. My gaze darted sideways as a shadow moved. A vampire bared his fangs at me, madness in his eyes. I raised Amaya and he withdrew, but there was a light in his eyes that suggested it wouldn\u2019t be for long.</p><p>As you have noted, Hunter is not the council, even if she is one of the most powerful vampires in its ranks.</p><p>So why doesn\u2019t she put that power to use and save me from idiotic situations like this? It doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Hunter plays for more than just your life. And remember, she is not constrained by human sensibilities.</p><p>But she was human once.</p><p>Near-immortality has a way of cleansing the soul of any semblance of humanity. It is rare for anyone\u2014human or otherwise\u2014to live for many centuries without time washing away all that they once were.</p><p>That\u2019s not always the case, I said, thinking of Uncle Quinn, who was only a hundred or so years younger than Hunter.</p><p>As I said, it is rare.</p><p>We continued to walk through the room. By the time we swept into a narrow corridor, sweat beaded my forehead and ran down my spine. I flexed my fingers, but it didn\u2019t do a whole lot to ease the tension thrumming through me. We may have made it out of the main room, but we were far from safe, and the ever-growing tide of hunger that trailed us only confirmed that.</p><p>The glow from the swords revealed a dozen doors leading off the corridor. Each one had a light above it, some red, some green. The sounds coming from inside the red-lit ones suggested there was some heavy-duty lovemaking going on\u2014some solo but mostly partnered, if the scents were anything to go by.</p><p>And suddenly the reason for all the thralls we\u2019d sensed earlier became obvious\u2014they might have been here to provide sex, but they were also more able to withstand harsh punishment, and healed far faster than regular humans, thanks to their blood link to the vampire who had created them. Which wasn\u2019t saying they couldn\u2019t be killed\u2014they weren\u2019t immortal, just as vamps weren\u2019t immortal\u2014but short of cutting off their heads or gutting their internals, they were capable of surviving events that would have killed them in the pre-thrall era.</p><p>Marshall stopped at the second-to-last door on the right and opened it. As he did, the light above went from green to red. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend moving out of here without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to be any safer inside than outside now, is it?\u201d I commented grimly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stood to one side to let us pass. \u201cNot given what the council desires. But I will do my best to limit the damage, both to my club and to my customers.\u201d</p><p>Meaning we could go to hell in a handbasket for all he cared. Fabulous.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d he continued, \u201cthis is the only door into this room, so if you remain here, you should be able to handle all but an insane rush.\u201d</p><p>Which he\u2019d all but implied might be in the cards. And the hunger so evident in the larger room certainly backed that up. \u201cThe council might not care either way, but I don\u2019t think Hunter will be pleased if I end up dead, and I suggest you remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have more knowledge than you ever will on just what will and won\u2019t please Hunter.\u201d His voice was dry, but there was an undercurrent that spoke of anger. Resentment, even. Which was odd if he was her creation. \u201cThe viewing screen is to the right, and the control panel to your left. Ensure that the door is locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a lock is going to stop any of the vampires out there.\u201d</p><p>He half shrugged. \u201cNo, but I would still recommend it.\u201d</p><p>Though I couldn\u2019t see the point, I locked the door as requested, then turned and looked around. The room was little more than a small white box, with no furniture other than the bed and the light screen. I walked across to the touch panel and slid a finger across the appropriate app. The TV came to life. The scene it revealed was one man viciously fucking another as he sucked the life from the poor fellow. The only sounds to be heard were the slapping of flesh against flesh and the occasional slurp.</p><p>I shivered and turned my back to the screen. I might have to listen, but I didn\u2019t have to watch. Not the whole sick performance, anyway.</p><p>Azriel still stood near to the door, Valdis held by his side. She gleamed with an ugly blue-black fire.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow in silent query, and he said, \u201cThere is much unrest outside.\u201d</p><p>I know. Fear sharpened within me. Amaya responded immediately, her noise adding to the ache in my still-tired brain. \u201cWhen do you think they\u2019ll attack?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe are not dealing with sensible vampires in this place.\u201d He paused, then added, \u201cWe\u2019re not even dealing with your kind of sensible.\u201d</p><p>The comment drew a smile, as he\u2019d no doubt intended. \u201cThen we could be in big trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it means you will have to watch the screen to see when the Rakshasa appears. I will deal with what comes.\u201d</p> <p>My gaze flicked to the light screen. The vampire was reaching his climax and the whore was intact, and alive. \u201cI will, when I have to.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. His attention obviously wasn\u2019t on me, but rather on the danger that lurked beyond the closed door.</p><p>\u201cHow many do you think they\u2019ll send at us?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThere are at least a dozen, by the feel of it.\u201d</p><p>Twelve against two weren\u2019t great odds by any stretch of the imagination, but they weren\u2019t insurmountable given that we had not only Azriel\u2019s skills but the two swords, as well. It could have been a whole lot worse. It could have been half the damn room.</p> <p>I flexed my fingers and glanced briefly at the screen. The room was being cleaned and the blood whore escorted away. \u201cI still can\u2019t see the point of testing me like this if they\u2019d rather see me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, we are not dealing with any rational mode of thinking.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe could leave. We have that option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not one we can take. However crazy this whole setup is, proving I can protect myself against a horde of crazy vamps might just be enough to save me from the council\u2019s death edict\u2014especially if the Rakshasa doesn\u2019t turn up tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prepare to fight.\u201d His gaze came to mine, the blue depths storm lit. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pleasant.\u201d</p><p>My stomach began to churn. I stepped back and raised Amaya. Her fire burned over the hilt and crawled across my skin, as sharp and as electric as the hissing in my mind. Hissing that said, Come, come, come...</p><p>I shivered, and wished I couldn\u2019t hear the beat of those words, or feel the answering echo of anticipation deep inside me. Wished the vamps that were crowding closer and closer down the hall would just leave us alone.</p> <p>But all the wishes in the world wouldn\u2019t change the reality. Not this time.</p><p>Then Azriel said the two words I\u2019d been dreading.</p><p>\u201cThey come.\u201d</p><p>And they did.</p><p>Only not just through the door, but from the ceiling itself.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>There was little warning, just a crack of sound as half the damn ceiling fell on our heads and spewed a seething mass of hissing, hungry vampires onto the floor\u2014at the exact same time the first lot hit the door and crashed it open.</p><p>Back to back, Azriel said.</p> <p>I pressed against him and ignored the plaster still falling around us, Amaya held at the ready and her die, die, die chant a scream inside my head.</p><p>Azriel entered the fray and Valdis screamed. It was a sound of defiance, a call for blood. I shivered and swung Amaya as the first of the vampires scrambled to their feet. Her fire rained through the air, the droplets hitting floor and flesh with equal deadliness, burning whatever it touched but having little impact on either. Then her sharp point met flesh, but there was no jolt, nothing to indicate I\u2019d hit anything at all. An arm plopped to the floor and blood sprayed, covering all of us. The scent of it filled the air, fueling the hunger already rampant in the room. The nearest vampires turned and attacked the injured vampire, sinking their teeth into his flesh and tearing him apart. They reminded me of dogs fighting over a bone, and again I wondered at the council\u2019s willingness to destroy their own just to test my worthiness.</p><p>But then again, they weren\u2019t exactly sacrificing the cream of vampire society here.</p><p>More vampires scrambled to their feet and came at us. I swung Amaya left and right, the movements so fast her fiery edges were little more than a blur. Blood and gore and flesh flew everywhere, the stench of it so thick that bile rose up in my throat and threatened to choke me. And still they came at us, the tide seeming to have no end and certainly no hesitation.</p><p>Claws slashed and tore, teeth gleamed. I dodged one blow, barely rocked back against another. Fingernails as sharp as steel sliced across my chin, peeling it open. I cursed, swung my sword viciously, and cut the offending talon off at the elbow. The vampire\u2019s scream was one of rage rather than pain, and I had to wonder just what sort of drugs they were all on, because this was more than just blood hunger. It had to be.</p><p>Then, with a thunderlike crack, more of the ceiling came down, bringing with it more vampires. I dodged, but not fast enough, and hit the floor with enough force to see stars and lose my grip on Amaya. The vamp on top of me knocked her farther away, and she screamed furiously, the noise cutting through the din the vampires were making. Then another weight joined the first, pressing my face into the floor, squashing my nose and making it difficult for me to breathe. I punched wildly but ineffectively, and the vamp holding my head chuckled. His breath washed over me, and even though I could barely breathe, his odor crawled into my body through my pores, leaving me with the bitter scent of rancid meat.</p><p>Then he tore into my left shoulder blade, biting deep. I yelped in pain and bucked, trying to dislodge his teeth and get both vampires off me, but they rode me like cowboys and wouldn\u2019t budge. Again the first vamp tore into me, this time my back. I choked back another cry and twisted around, throwing my elbow backward as hard as I could. The vamp riding my shoulders was too intent on sucking up the blood to register the movement, and my elbow smashed into the side of his face, caving in his cheek and throwing him off sideways. I twisted violently to one side and half dislodged the second vampire. He lunged forward, canines bared and bloody and madness in his eyes. I tried to roll away, couldn\u2019t, so I threw up a hand in a vain attempt to batter him away. Then, suddenly, Azriel was there, wrapping a fist around the vamp\u2019s neck and flinging him back hard.</p><p>He reached down and pulled me upright. There was a cut above his left eye and fury in his expression, but he wasted no energy on words, simply turned and dove back into the attack.</p><p>I lunged for Amaya, but she was already slithering toward me. I swept her up, then dove sideways as a vamp leapt over one of the fallen and came at me. I swung my sword but he checked his speed, leaned out of her way, then dove straight at me. I dropped, hitting the floor hard enough to knock the wind out, and pulled my sword onto my stomach. This time he couldn\u2019t check. The blade pierced his flesh, and his momentum drove her dark metal right through his body and out the other side.</p><p>I let him fall, then scrambled to my feet, pulled Amaya free, and swung around to face the next threat.</p><p>But it was over, and I\u2019d been proven right. The odds hadn\u2019t been insurmountable.</p><p>More than sixteen vampires lay dead or near dead in the small room, and there were at least another three or four out in the corridor if the bits I could see were any indication. Blood and gore and body parts lay everywhere, and suddenly I was shaking. But it was anger, not fear, not reaction.</p><p>Azriel stepped over the bodies and came toward me. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fucking not.\u201d My fists were clenched so tight that Amaya\u2019s hilt cut into my hand. I glanced at the ceiling, looking for the cameras I couldn\u2019t see but had no doubt were there. \u201cEnough! Do you hear me? Enough! No more fucking tests. Either use me or kill me, but stop this stupid waste of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Marshall said from the doorway. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the council expected you to win so easily.\u201d</p><p>My fury suddenly had a focus point, and I took a step forward. Azriel threw out a hand and stopped me from going any farther.</p><p>It would not be wise to kill him at this time, came his soft warning into my thoughts. This is not his doing.</p><p>I gave Azriel a somewhat dark glance, then returned my gaze to Marshall. \u201cI hope they realize this circus might well have caused us to miss the arrival of the Rakshasa\u2014and wasn\u2019t killing her our actual reason for being here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the reason you are in this club, yes,\u201d Marshall agreed, \u201cbut not the reason you are on this floor. And trust me, I am no more happy about this waste than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the fuck didn\u2019t you do something to stop it? You run the damn place.\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened. \u201cI may run it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have free rein to do as I wish. And I am beholden to the council for certain supplies.\u201d</p><p>The blood whores, I thought wearily, and scrubbed a bloody hand across my face.</p><p>Marshall added, \u201cAnd the Rakshasa would not have made an appearance as yet, simply because there has been no killing in that room.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, his words echoing through my brain. \u201cMeaning you know exactly when someone is going to be killed?\u201d</p><p>He seemed surprised by the question. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you send men and women in there to feed the vampires, knowing they\u2019re going to die?\u201d I said it flatly, without emotion, even though anger boiled through me, a silent scream of anger that reminded me of Amaya.</p><p>\u201cThe blood whores in our employ know and understand the risks\u2014and sign a document stating as much.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe do not, however, waste valuable stock. Only the older ones who are reaching the point where it is not economically feasible to keep repairing them.\u201d</p><p>Economically feasible. God, they really were treating the whores like cattle.</p><p>And that whole document-signing thing was a farce, because we weren\u2019t talking about regular blood whores here, but people who\u2019d been born and bred for this life. I very much doubted they\u2019d have any understanding at all of what they\u2019d signed.</p><p>The fury continued to build in me, and Amaya\u2019s kill chant began inside my head again. The urge to do just that was so strong that my legs quivered with the need to move. I didn\u2019t, but it was such a close-run thing that it scared the hell out of me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay in this room,\u201d I said, through gritted teeth. \u201cGive me another\u2014preferably one with a sink so I can clean up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded and stepped back, waving us into the hall. I stepped over the bodies and various body parts, noting that the few vampires who were alive were quiet, and showing little of their previous almost insane hunger. Suggesting, perhaps, that it had been ramped up for the occasion by an outside force\u2014either some sort of drug or another vampire.</p><p>Again fury swept me, but I somehow kept my sword by my side as I walked past Marshall.</p><p>\u201cTake the second door on the right,\u201d he said, his expression wary, suggesting he knew exactly what was going through my mind\u2014although I guess that wouldn\u2019t have been hard given the expression I was no doubt wearing. It certainly felt dark from my side of things.</p> <p>I walked into the indicated room. It was much the same as the first one, only this one had a small sink area, a medical kit, and a couple of towels sitting to one side of it. Obviously, he\u2019d had this room prepared for us.</p><p>I swung around as he came into the room behind us. \u201cHave we your guarantee that this is the end of the tests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be no more tests, no more disturbances in this place,\u201d he said. \u201cI guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the dead? Won\u2019t that cause problems given the highly charged atmosphere in the main bar?\u201d</p><p>His smile was cool, almost arrogant. \u201cThere will be no further trouble from any vampire in this place.\u201d</p> <p>Meaning he could have stopped the onslaught if he\u2019d so desired. Which also meant he was far more powerful than I\u2019d been suspecting. But then, if he was Hunter\u2019s creature, I shouldn\u2019t have expected anything else.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cNow, if you could turn on the TV on your way out, I\u2019d very much appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a somewhat sardonic bow, then hit the control panel to the left of the door and left. The light screen came to life; the room was being mopped out, readied for its next customers.</p><p>I took a deep breath and released it slowly. It didn\u2019t do much to ease the churning in my stomach or the anger still trembling through my muscles.</p><p>Azriel sheathed Valdis and walked toward me. \u201cHow is your back?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. It hurt like a bitch but there wasn\u2019t a whole lot I could do about it, so there was little point in complaining. And hey, in comparison to what the Raziq had done, it was hardly more than a scratch.</p> <p>He touched my bleeding chin, studying it for a moment, then motioned me to turn around. I stood my ground. \u201cYou can\u2019t heal me, Azriel. Any use of energy might just warn the Rakshasa of our presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that.\u201d Though there was little in his expression, his tone was somewhat annoyed. \u201cI merely wish to see how bad the wounds are.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced, but turned around. He sucked in a breath, and, a minute later his fingers brushed my spine, the touch light, but nevertheless filled with a heat that sparked something deep inside me.</p><p>I shivered and crossed my arms, warding myself against the reaction as much as the instinct to turn around and reach for him.</p><p>\u201cThese are deep,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m afraid they will scar.\u201d</p><p>The first of many, if I continued to work for Hunter\u2014and it\u2019s not like I had another option. And to be honest, scars were the least of my worries right now.</p><p>\u201cJust clean them up the best you can. There\u2019s a medical kit near the sink.\u201d</p><p>He walked across to the sink. It was then that I noticed the cuts up both of his arms and a nasty-looking wound that ran the length of his left thigh. It was bleeding quite badly, if the amount of blood gleaming wetly on his dark jeans was any indication.</p> <p>\u201cBlood loss does not present the same danger to me that it does to you.\u201d He wet one of the towels, then opened the medical kit and pulled out an antiseptic sealer spray.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I mean, you can find death in flesh form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but my life force is energy, not blood. I may bleed, but it does not drain me.\u201d He treated my chin, then said, \u201cTake your shirt off.\u201d</p><p>I did so, then turned my back to him, my eyes on the screen as he carefully cleaned the wounds. To say it hurt would be an understatement, but at least the pain gave me something to think about other than what was now happening on the TV. Another whore and customer had come into the room. The woman had to be in her mid-forties, with drawn features and scars littering her body\u2014evidence that suggested a long history of feeding vampires. It was a history about to come to an end. Because the vampire who followed her into the room was long, lean, and vicious-looking.</p><p>And there was death in his flat brown eyes.</p><p>I rubbed my arms and wished I could stop what was about to happen. I didn\u2019t want to watch it, either, but I forced myself to witness the unfolding brutality on the screen. She deserved acknowledgment of her death, at the very least, and I doubted the vampires would even care, much less give her any sort of funeral. After all, to them she was little more than another piece of meat. Cattle to be used and abused.</p><p>Again anger rose, but I thrust it aside and continued to watch the screen. There was nothing pleasant about this feeding, and certainly nothing that remotely resembled pleasure for the woman. The vampire battered her, fed on her, and tore at her, until her body was slick with blood and all that seemed to be holding her upright was the vampire\u2019s brutal grasp. In my head, the keening of the ghosts echoed, getting stronger and more desperate with every sickening blow.</p><p>Yet the woman said nothing. Maybe she couldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t put it past Marshall to somehow restrict the vocal capacity of those whores destined to die.</p><p>The feeding seemed to last forever, but in reality it took little more than ten minutes. The vampire ended the woman\u2019s torment by driving his teeth into her neck and ripping it open. Blood sprayed across the white walls, and the spark of life in her odd green eyes slowly died as her head lolled back and she stared up at the camera.</p><p>And in my head, the ghosts grieved and wept and raged at a world that wasn\u2019t capable of hearing.</p><p>Then it happened.</p><p>As the vampire sucked the last droplets of life from the woman, three bloody rents appeared on his back, stretching from his left shoulder to his right butt cheek. He snarled in fury and spun, but this foe was not one someone like him could see.</p><p>But the ghosts could, and they were screaming for murder, not just blood.</p><p>The Rakshasa obviously wasn\u2019t about to change the pattern of her hunt just to appease the ghosts, though, and nothing further happened. After a few minutes of somewhat confused searching, the vampire stepped over the broken body at his feet and left the room.</p><p>\u201cThe Rakshasa has also left,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cBut she waits outside for her victim.\u201d</p><p>I frowned as I pulled my shirt back on. \u201cWill she sense us leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know how sensitive the Rakshasa is to those of us who guide and guard, so I cannot answer that.\u201d</p><p>It was a risk we would have to take if we were to have any chance of killing this thing. I walked over to the panel, found the intercom, and swiped my hand across it. \u201cMarshall? You there?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer immediately, which suggested he hadn\u2019t been keeping an eye on us\u2014although that didn\u2019t mean the council wasn\u2019t. When he finally came online, his blue eyes were bright and somewhat annoyed. I wondered what we\u2019d interrupted. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the address of the vamp that\u2019s just left the ghost\u2019s room,\u201d I said without preamble. \u201cThe Rakshasa just marked him.\u201d</p><p>Marshall sucked in a breath. \u201cSo kill her.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cIf it was that easy, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>He grunted in acknowledgment of my point. \u201cJerry Harcourt was the vamp just in there. He rents a room in Lyle Place boardinghouse\u2014it\u2019s only a few minutes down the road.\u201d</p><p>Which meant we\u2019d better hurry if we wanted to set our trap. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to do anything?\u201d Marshall asked.</p><p>If he could have done anything, I very much doubted we\u2019d have been called in. But I just said, \u201cNo. Just ensure that he leaves, and we\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRighto.\u201d</p><p>As the screen returned to the image of the bloodstained room, I swung around to face Azriel. \u201cWill this work?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAs I have said before, I\u2019ve never hunted a Rakshasa. I\u2019m told they can be extremely difficult kills.\u201d</p><p>And this one was killing people who deserved to die\u2014a fact that didn\u2019t make going after her any easier. But since it was my life or hers, there was really no other choice.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better get over there and set our trap.\u201d And if the trap didn\u2019t work, then we hunted it back to its lair. I shivered, and hoped like hell it didn\u2019t come to that. Not if the Rakshasa was feeding more than just herself.</p><p>Azriel held out a hand. I placed my hand in his and let him pull me into his embrace. It felt so warm and safe that I wanted to cry. Or maybe that was just a reaction of the bitter anguish that still echoed inside my head.</p><p>His energy surged, and in an instant the room disappeared and we were zipping through the gray fields. The room we reappeared in was dark and smelled faintly of urine and booze. Obviously, vampire Jerry did not live in one of your more up-market boarding establishments.</p><p>Azriel immediately stepped away and moved to one corner of the room. He raised his hands and paced the walls, murmuring softly. The words were lyrical and easy on the ear, but there was a dark undercurrent to the energy that swirled around and through his voice, and foreboding crawled down my spine. It somehow seemed wrong for such darkness to be coming from beings who were warmth and light.</p><p>He continued walking around the room. Mist formed behind him, becoming luminous tendrils that crawled up the walls and across the ceiling, until the soft, glowing, ethereal net of silver covered every compass point as well as the floor and ceiling. When the circuit was complete, the net locked together, then faded. But the power of it remained, making the tiny hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t the Rakshasa feel the energy and run?\u201d I asked, rubbing my arms and trying to ignore my growing sense of unease. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Azriel shook his head. \u201cThe vampire, however, will sense your presence in this room, so you cannot remain here.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to bring the Rakshasa down, not you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and drew Valdis.

I bit my lip, but for once did the sensible thing\u2014if only because I really didn\u2019t have the skill, the knowledge, or the desire to actually fight a spirit creature. \u201cIs there an apartment nearby where I can wait?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then nodded. \u201cThe room across the hall has no one in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019ll wait.\u201d I half turned, then hesitated. \u201cBe careful, Azriel. Enough blood has been spilled already tonight.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, suddenly closer even though I hadn\u2019t seen him move. \u201cI have Valdis, and I am well used to dealing with dark creatures.\u201d He raised a hand and cupped my cheek. \u201cBut I appreciate the concern.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed me. It was little more than lips brushing, but it resonated through every part of my being, stirring me in ways I couldn\u2019t even begin to describe.</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said eventually, his voice tight. As if he\u2019d been as affected as I was.</p><p>I forced myself to move away, although all I really wanted to do was step into his arms and chase the promise in that kiss.</p><p>I closed the door behind me, but hesitated in the hallway, listening to the silence and drawing in the air, trying to get a feel for who or what lived in this complex. I had no idea what Azriel\u2019s net would do, but the last thing we needed was one of Jerry\u2019s neighbors deciding to run to the rescue. Though to be honest, it looked like the sort of complex where the inhabitants were more likely to help themselves than one another.</p><p>The air out here was as unpleasant as it was in Jerry\u2019s room. The aromas of booze, age, and urine were entrenched, as were the threads of unwashed humanity. If there were other non-humans in this complex, they didn\u2019t live on this floor. I couldn\u2019t hear much in the way of activity in any of the nearby rooms, either, but that could have been a result of the late hour rather than no one being home.</p><p>Which meant, hopefully, I could break into the room opposite and no one would notice. Or care. I did just that, and caught the door with my fingertips before it could crash back against the wall. I stood there for several heartbeats, my breath caught in my throat as I listened for any sign that someone had heard and intended to investigate.</p><p>No one did. I sighed in relief, then shut the door and turned to study the room. It was fresher\u2014and cleaner\u2014than Jerry\u2019s, and possessed more in the way of furniture. The room\u2019s inhabitant was obviously intent on making himself comfortable, whereas Jerry seemed only to have the basics. But then, the addicted rarely cared for anything other than their next hit.</p> <p>I double-checked the bathroom and bedroom just to ensure that no one was here, then moved back to the kitchenette and propped myself against the small table. Despite the fact that the worst of my wounds had been sealed by the antiseptic spray, blood still trickled down my back. I wondered briefly if Jerry would smell it and decide to investigate. It would mess things up if he did.</p><p>After what seemed an eternity, the creak of floorboards and heavy\u2014almost drunken\u2014steps eventually began to invade the silence. They drew closer and closer, then paused just outside the doorway. Tension crawled through me. I held my breath, waiting for the moment when our plan went to hell and Jerry either ran or came at me.</p><p>For several seconds, nothing happened. I had the image of him standing there, nostrils flaring as he drew in the scent of blood and listened to the rapid beating of a heart. Mine, to be exact.</p><p>Whether he was actually doing that I couldn\u2019t say, and after several minutes of inaction, his door creaked and he stepped inside.</p><p>I reached for Amaya, then stopped. Would the Rakshasa be able to sense her energy? I had no idea, so I left her sheathed. In this sort of situation, it was better to be safe than sorry. The decision, however, did not please my sword, and she hissed and grumbled in the back of my mind.</p><p>I padded across to the door and opened it slightly. There wasn\u2019t anything to see in the hall or anything to hear in the room opposite. But as I stood there, an ill wind began to gather. It stirred the hairs on the back of my neck, making them stand on end. I shivered, my fists clenched so tightly against the need to draw my sword that my fingernails were digging into my palms. I might have felt stronger\u2014safer\u2014when she was in my hand, but the energy that dripped off her surely wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed by a creature born to the world of spirits rather than flesh.</p><p>The wind gathered strength, filling the air with such darkness that it became harder and harder to breathe. And the desire to rush into the room opposite to see what was happening warred with the need to remain safe, but I knew I would only hinder rather than help. I had to let Azriel do what he\u2019d been trained to do.</p><p>I opened the door a little farther. No sound came from the room opposite. Jerry might have entered, but he was no longer moving around. Maybe the poison the Rakshasa had administered when she\u2019d slashed his back had taken full effect, and he simply lay there, waiting for the approach of his doom.</p> <p>And it was certainly coming.</p><p>The sense of menace in the air was so sharp it felt like a knife cutting through my soul.</p><p>Then, down at the far end of the hall, something moved.</p><p>I froze, breathing labored and Amaya screaming furiously in my head. The movement wasn\u2019t repeated. My gaze darted through the shadows, but I couldn\u2019t see the threat that every sense\u2014and my sword\u2014said was there.</p><p>And then I realized why.</p><p>The threat wasn\u2019t in the hall.</p><p>It was behind me.</p><p>I swung, but it was already far too late.</p><p>A smothering blanket of darkness fell around me, and pain exploded. Then there was nothing, simply nothing.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Waking was an exercise in agony. Every muscle, bone, and fiber ached with a fierceness that had my head spinning and my heart racing. Even my hair felt like it was on fire.</p><p>For a minute I wondered if I\u2019d somehow ended up in the hands of the Aedh again, but this pain was different from the torture they\u2019d put me through. This wasn\u2019t the pain that came from a spirit being pulled apart. Rather, it was from something more mundane\u2014like a body that had been beaten and abused to the nth degree.</p><p>But the blood that rode the air suggested I wasn\u2019t any more hurt now than when the Rakshasa had captured me. She obviously hadn\u2019t had me for dinner, and while I was naturally grateful for that, it was a fact that only ratcheted up the levels of fear. She was saving me for something, and I had a bad, bad feeling I really didn\u2019t want to know what.</p><p>As my mind crawled toward greater awareness, I realized I was lying on something cold and uneven. Stone rather than concrete. My breathing was labored, suggesting there wasn\u2019t quite enough oxygen, and the air itself tasted bitter and decayed.</p><p>There was also a strange buzzing in my head, and it seemed oddly\u2014darkly\u2014blanketing.</p><p>Frowning, I reached down inside and called to the Aedh. Power surged, but so did pain, a warning that I was still too close to my limits. I ignored it, and called to the change regardless. It surged through me, breaking down skin and muscle as it began the shift from human to Aedh. Then that strange buzzing sharpened, becoming so fierce it felt like nails were being slammed into my head, and the energy stumbled, then receded, leaving me bound by flesh rather than a being of energy.</p><p>Whatever that strange buzzing was, I couldn\u2019t change while it was near.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>I cracked open an eye. Darkness met my gaze, and it held an odd sense of heaviness, as if the weight of the world pressed down upon this place. And if that were true\u2014if we were deep underground somewhere\u2014then yet again Azriel wouldn\u2019t find me.</p><p>Which meant I was alone.</p><p>Fear swarmed, so thick that for several minutes it threatened to choke me. I might have been trained to fight by the best of them, but I\u2019d never been prepared for a situation like this.</p><p>Alone not, came the alien voice that was my sword. Am here.</p><p>The relief that hit was so strong it left me shaking. Though there was no guarantee Amaya could protect me from whatever it was that waited in this darkness, with her in my hand I at least had a chance. And no matter how small that chance might be, it was better than nothing.</p><p>I opened both eyes and looked around. Or tried to, because my head wouldn\u2019t move. In fact, nothing would move. I was all but frozen, able to breathe but little else.</p><p>Panic swelled again, but I tried to ignore it, tried to think. There had to be a way out of this\u2014had to be! I wasn\u2019t going to just lie here and allow the Rakshasa to tear me apart at her leisure. I might be frozen, but the mere fact that I was breathing suggested that either the poison in the Rakshasa\u2019s claws hadn\u2019t affected me as completely as it had her vampire victims or it was wearing off quickly.</p><p>I prayed it was the latter rather than the former. It would give me more of a chance\u2014as long as the Rakshasa didn\u2019t decide to eat me immediately now that I was awake. After all, she did seem to prefer to consume her victims when they were aware.</p><p>As my eyes began to adjust, I realized the darkness wasn\u2019t as complete as I\u2019d thought, thanks in part to the huge weights of stone that hung high above me. The stalactites gleamed with an odd, ghostly glow, and their light filtered through the surrounding ink, alluding to other outcroppings and hinting at fissures in the rock walls. Moisture gleamed and dripped, splashing onto the stony floor close to where I lay. It ran along the cracks and underneath my body, the chill of it contrasting sharply with the warmer moisture saturating my back. One of my wounds had obviously opened, even if the scent of it didn\u2019t sting the air.</p><p>But there was more than just stone and fissures here. There were shadows\u2014shadows that were as still as the stone and humanoid in shape.</p><p>My heart began to beat a whole lot faster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If those shapes were any indication, there wasn\u2019t just one Rakshasa here, but at least another five.</p><p>Panic surged anew, but I shoved it back down brutally. Panicking wouldn\u2019t achieve anything, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t get me out of here.</p><p>Something stirred to my left, and my gaze darted that way. One of the shadows peeled away from the wall and came toward me, the movement languid and oddly sensual. Which was fitting, because the woman who approached was one of the most exotic women I\u2019d ever seen. She had the stature of an Amazon, with skin like warm honey and eyes the color of a newly unfurled leaf. Her hair was a fierce red and glowed like fire. But despite her beauty, there was little in the way of humanity in her expression, and her striking eyes were as cold as any monster\u2019s.</p> <p>She stopped several feet away and gazed down at me. My heart beat so fast I could have sworn it was going to burst out of my chest, and sweat trickled down the side of my face.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, her voice holding the edge of an accent that was both foreign and somewhat grating. \u201cYou are the one who almost caught me. The one who works with the reaper.\u201d</p><p>I tried to answer, but no sound came out. My vocal cords were as frozen as the rest of me.</p><p>\u201cWhy does a human work with a soul guide? I wonder. What makes you so special?\u201d</p><p>She continued to study me, but the shadows behind her stirred, and harsh whispers rose, then fell away. I couldn\u2019t understand what was said, simply because it wasn\u2019t any language I\u2019d heard before, but the Rakshasa raised a pale eyebrow and said, \u201cPerhaps. Perhaps not.\u201d</p> <p>She knelt and ran a finger across my chin. It came away bloody, and she raised it to her mouth and licked it clean.</p><p>\u201cYour taste is sweet, but it is no different from that of any human,\u201d she mused softly. \u201cWhy, then, do the reapers run with you?\u201d</p><p>She studied me as if she expected an answer, but even if I had been able to speak, I wouldn\u2019t have. I wanted her dead, not informed.</p><p>She smiled coldly, and it made me wonder if she was following my thoughts. I had the microcell implants, but had no idea whether they\u2019d work against beings that were essentially spirit rather than flesh. They certainly didn\u2019t appear to work against either Azriel or Lucian.</p><p>She walked around to my other side, a slight frown marring her face. \u201cThere is something about you, however. Something not of this world, and powerful.\u201d</p><p>God, she was sensing Amaya.</p> <p>No see, came her response, and with it a heat so fierce it burned into my spine. She was readying herself for battle, but it wouldn\u2019t do me a whole lot of good if I couldn\u2019t actually grip her.</p><p>I frowned, and forced every ounce of energy into trying to move something\u2014anything. After a moment, my right hand twitched. Exhilaration surged. A twitch might not save me, but it was a definite sign that whatever it was that had frozen me was wearing off.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, Amaya was helping. Until her heat had surged, my muscles had been totally unresponsive. As the thought crossed my mind, Amaya\u2019s heat increased, storming through my body like wildfire. Sweat began to drip from every pore. It smelled like fear and poison.</p><p>\u201cI do not like this,\u201d the Rakshasa said, and raised her gaze to the shadows.</p><p>Again that murmur rose, the sound uneasy but vehement. The other Rakshasa wanted a kill, needed to taste flesh.</p><p>Fear threatened to choke me again. I took several deep breaths in an effort to remain calm, and kept my gaze on the Rakshasa. She was the immediate danger, not the ones who whispered from the shadows.</p><p>Her gaze came to mine again. She smiled, and in that instant I saw death.</p><p>My death.</p> <p>Amaya\u2019s heat became even fiercer, soaking through every pore and muscle, until it seemed that she was becoming a part of me.</p><p>And I suddenly realized that was exactly what she was doing. Her energy wasn\u2019t just consuming me, it was shifting through me. She was moving through my flesh from her position at my back and, in the process, freeing me from the poison that held me immobile.</p><p>I twitched my fingers, my toes. Felt elation curl through me, and swiped down on it. Hard. Moving a few digits didn\u2019t mean I was out of the woods. I needed full movement to have any hope\u2014and even then, the odds were still stacked against survival.</p><p>The Rakshasa knelt beside me again. She gripped my face, her sharp nails digging into my skin but not actually cutting. \u201cYour reaper cannot find you here,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou are ours to enjoy.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed heavily. Urged Amaya to hurry the hell up.</p><p>\u201cOur dark god demands a sacrifice during the feeding phase,\u201d she continued, \u201cand while the vampire would have sufficed, I believe you will bring us far greater favor.\u201d</p><p>Meaning they weren\u2019t going to eat me? I couldn\u2019t exactly be unhappy about that, even though I wasn\u2019t terribly keen on being sacrificed to their god instead.</p><p>She released me and rose. \u201cPrepare her.\u201d</p><p>The other Rakshasa peeled away from the shadows. I\u2019d been expecting them to be as beautiful as the first one, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Several verged on hideous, with yellowed skin, protruding teeth, long breasts and big bellies, while another had an odd number of limbs and the head of a horse. There was a dwarf with a bald head and a bulbous nose, while the last of them was tall and thin, and had the look of an elf. Except her skin was the color of moss and her hair a tangle of hissing serpents.</p><p>According to Azriel, the Rakshasa were shape-shifters, so I had to wonder why they\u2019d chosen these forms over something more pleasant. But then, I guess beauty was in the eye of the beholder, and the Rakshasa were spirit rather than flesh. They weren\u2019t likely to be governed by the same ideals of beauty as I was.</p><p>They shuffled toward me, eyes alight with an odd sense of expectation. I clenched my fists but could do little else except watch them. Amaya still burned through my body, her energy sitting somewhere in my middle, making my innards quiver and twitch\u2014more from the thought of it than any actual discomfort. The ceremony that had made her a part of me had also ensured that she could never harm me physically. I wasn\u2019t so sure about the whole mentally bit\u2014at the very least, her constant hissing could possibly drive me around the bend.</p><p>Four Rakshasa moved to compass points around my body and began to chant. The sound resonated across the heavy atmosphere, dark and oddly powerful. From deep within the stones came a response\u2014a heartbeat, slow and ponderous. It was as if the stones around me were coming to life.</p><p>The serpent-haired Rakshasa appeared, her chant joining the chorus of her kin as she swooped and tore my clothes from my body. I shivered as the cold, dense air hit my skin, and Amaya surged. She was so close to breaking through that I was surprised that the glow of her wasn\u2019t making my skin translucent.</p><p>Snakes hissed and slithered as the Rakshasa moved around to my feet. She bent and took off my shoes, then tossed them toward the pile of my clothes. Her serpents kissed my toes, their tongues like little needles, pricking rather than tickling. Blood trickled from each of the wounds, the warmth contrasting sharply with the chill of my skin.</p><p>I dug my nails into my palms, and the pain cut through the haze of panic threatening to consume me, allowing some semblance of clarity. But it was all I could do to remain still and resist the temptation to get up and run.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move yet\u2014figuratively or physically. My body still felt heavy, and Amaya had yet to finish her journey through my flesh.</p><p>The serpent-headed Rakshasa rose and disappeared back into the shadows. The other four continued their chant, and the beat of life in the stones around and underneath me got stronger. Whatever it was they were calling into life, it would soon be awake and aware. I had a feeling I didn\u2019t want to be here when that happened.</p><p>I licked my lips, my gaze darting from side to side, trying to find the position of the other two Rakshasa. I couldn\u2019t find the exotic one, but the serpent woman appeared again, an ancient-looking urn held with both hands above her head.</p><p>She stopped at my feet and spoke. The words were alien, but they ramped the power gathering in the air, making my hair stand on end and my skin quiver in revulsion.</p><p>The heat that was Amaya died within me, and I felt a moment of sheer terror. Then I realized the coolness of steel was pressed against my stomach, and the relief that swept me was so fierce that tears stung my eyes.</p><p>The serpent woman tilted the urn, her voice more strident, her words more commanding. Water poured down onto my feet and legs, thick and odorous. She continued to pour the liquid as she moved up my body, until I was completely covered in the goopy substance.</p><p>She reached my head, bent, and forced my mouth open, her sharp talons cutting into my skin as the tongues of her snakes darted across my face, tiny whips that cut and tasted. As she tilted the urn, Amaya screamed, No!</p><p>I didn\u2019t think, I just reacted. I grabbed Amaya\u2019s hilt, bought her sharply upward, and sliced through the hand that held me so brutally. The snake-headed Rakshasa screamed, the sound shattering the growing spell of power. The heartbeat in the stone hesitated, and the other Rakshasa roared. It was a sound filled with fury and death.</p><p>I threw myself sideways, scuttling the Rakshasa on my left and barely avoiding the urn as it crashed inches from my head. The moisture that ran through the shards of the ruined vessel was thick, gluey, and black. Blood, but not human, not animal. It smelled altogether different and alien.</p><p>I threw a punch into the face of the Rakshasa I\u2019d scuttled, crushing her bulbous nose and sending blood and bits of flesh flying, then scrambled to my feet and ran for the nearest fissure. It was six against one and that wasn\u2019t great odds in anyone\u2019s language. If I could restrict available space\u2014restrict the space they had to come at me\u2014I might have more of a chance.</p><p>Air stirred, and the sensation of danger swamped me. I swung around and lashed out with the heel of my foot, sending the nearest Rakshasa flying backward. Another dove at me. I sliced down with Amaya, severing flesh and bone with equal ease. I continued to swing Amaya, using her as a shield as I ran backward, and prayed like hell there was nothing between me and that fissure.</p><p>My back hit stone, and pain snatched my breath. Blood began to pour from the wounds on my back and dots danced before my eyes. I hissed, but somehow remained upright and swinging. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Rakshasa came at me as one, a hideous mass of flesh that cut and tore. I blocked blows, ducked teeth and claws, and attacked as best I could, until the nearby walls were coated and it was hard to know what blood was mine and what belonged to the Rakshasa. But there was no stopping them, no matter how much flesh I hacked from their bodies, because they didn\u2019t die. They just regenerated.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to end prettily. Not for me, anyway.</p><p>And that meant I had to try something else. Anything else.</p> <p>The fissure was several feet away to my left. It was big and dark, and air stirred sluggishly around it, hinting at a possible escape route. Or, at the very least, another chamber.</p><p>Anywhere had to be better than here.</p><p>I kicked the nearest Rakshasa in the gut, sending her sprawling into her companions, then swung Amaya viciously from left to right, hamstringing several others. Their attack briefly faltered. I spun and ran into the fissure. The walls closed in around me, slick and uneven. The air still stirred, but it was putrid and dense, and my lungs felt like they were on fire.</p><p>As my shoulders began to brush the sharp edges of the walls, I slowed, my heart racing and my breath a harsh rasp. Little sound came from behind me\u2014certainly no sound of pursuit. And yet every sense I had pulsed with the closeness of danger. Whether it was coming from the Rakshasa behind me or something unseen up ahead, I had no idea.</p><p>I struggled on, slipping sideways through the rock as the space grew tighter. It was blacker than ink in this foul-smelling place, the light of the stalactites having long since faded. Amaya wasn\u2019t emitting any flame, either, but I could hear her static running through my mind, a chant that vacillated between the need to kill and the urge for caution.</p> <p>The fissure grew even tighter, until the rocks were scraping my breasts and butt. I cursed softly, then jumped as the sensation of movement stirred the air around me. I raised Amaya, holding her in front of me even though I couldn\u2019t say whether the movement had come from ahead or behind. I scanned the darkness either way, but there was nothing to see or scent, and certainly no sound of steps.</p><p>But the Rakshasa were spirits, and maybe they\u2019d finally shed their human skins. If that were the case, then I wouldn\u2019t hear anything. And it meant I was in even deeper shit. I could fight flesh, and I could see ghosts, but would I even be able to see the Rakshasa in spirit form, let alone fight them?</p><p>I guess I was going to find out, because if the gathering sensation of movement was anything to go by, they were coming after me.</p><p>I pushed on, my lungs still burning and my head beginning to spin. I swallowed heavily and kept a fierce grip on Amaya. My skin was slick with blood\u2014both mine and the stuff from the urn\u2014but it didn\u2019t make me slip through the rocks any easier.</p><p>Sound began to creep across the silence. It was soft and whispery, and I cocked my head sideways, listening intently. The image of snakes slithering down the body of the Rakshasa and onto the floor rose, and I groaned softly. As if I didn\u2019t have enough to deal with.</p><p>My hip lodged against a rock and I twisted, trying to move around it, only to find myself stuck fast. Panic surged. With a soft cry, I raised Amaya and hit the obstruction as hard as I could with her hilt. The rock shattered like glass, spraying needle-sharp shards into the darkness and sending me sprawling forward. I landed on my knees\u2014hard\u2014and stayed there for several seconds, ignoring pain and gasping for breath as I scanned the ink and tried to get some idea of where I was. There was a sense of vastness to this place, which suggested the fissure had given way to something a lot bigger than the cavern I\u2019d been in before.</p> <p>Only trouble was, I wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>And there was an odd sort of consciousness in the air, a dark energy that thrummed around me even as the stone under my knees beat with faint life.</p><p>The house of their god, I suddenly realized, and wondered if I\u2019d run from the frying pan only to step into the fire.</p><p>I swallowed heavily and pushed to my feet. There were no stalactites here to light the way, so I swept Amaya in front of me to feel for obstructions. The knowledge that someone was near grew, until it was so thick and sharp it flayed my skin.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d the exotic Rakshasa said, her words soft but seeming to reverberate through the darkness, \u201cyou bear a dark sword. This is the power I sensed earlier.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and raised Amaya. Her chant no longer raced across the edges of my mind, but her energy still burned within me. \u201cIt\u2019s a power that will kill you all if you do not let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what weapon you bear, you are, in the end, flesh and blood. All we have to do is keep attacking. Once your life blood has soaked the stone and fed the god beneath our feet, we will dine on your flesh.\u201d</p><p>Something hit my right calf, and tiny teeth sliced deep. I yelped and jumped away, and the snake hissed. I swung Amaya, but didn\u2019t hit anything. Damn it, I needed to see to be able to fight. I was all but blind, and relying on scent and sound just wasn\u2019t good enough. Not when these creatures made little sound and had no scent.</p> <p>One, came Amaya\u2019s whisper, become.</p><p>I frowned, not sure what she meant. Static rolled through my mind, a sound of frustration if ever I\u2019d heard it.</p><p>Open, she growled, join you.</p><p>Meaning she wanted me to open myself fully to her? Wanted me to allow her\u2014a demon spirit encased in steel\u2014free rein to run through me? Control me?</p><p>Not, she said. One.</p><p>I shivered. The one thing I\u2019d feared from the moment I\u2019d plunged her steel into my flesh and felt the surge of her power was that she would somehow gain a foothold in my mind and make me more like her. And now she was asking me to grant her the freedom to leave the sword and fully become one with me.</p><p>Every instinct I had suggested it would be a very bad move.</p><p>But if my only chance of survival was to do what I feared the most, then do it I would. That determination was what had driven me to confront Jak and ask for his help, and it still drove me now.</p><p>I just had to hope that once I\u2019d given her freedom, Amaya would step back into steel when all this was over.</p><p>And that was one thought to which she didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>The air stirred to my left. I swung around, stabbing Amaya in front of me. The exotic Rakshasa laughed softly\u2014from the right, not the left. Something hard and cold hit my back and I jumped away, swearing as I swung around. Again, I hit nothing but air.</p><p>Blood was now running freely down the back of my legs, and every drop that hit the stone seemed to make the heartbeat stronger.</p><p>\u201cThe sleep of our god ends,\u201d she whispered, this time in front of me. \u201cSoon he will awaken fully, and then we will bleed you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d To Amaya, I said, Let\u2019s do it.</p><p>Invite, she whispered, excitement in her tone.</p><p>Trepidation shivered through me, but it wasn\u2019t like I had a lot of options left. I took a deep breath, then silently said, Amaya, become one with me.</p><p>For a moment, nothing happened. Then power exploded, thick and heavy, surging through steel and flesh with equal ferocity. It was a storm that tore my core apart, fiber by fiber, then pieced me back together, all within a matter of heartbeats.</p><p>Only it was no longer me, but we.</p><p>Because I wasn\u2019t alone. Someone else was in here with me, sharing my body and my thoughts, even as she shared her powers and abilities. It was a strange, unsettling sensation.</p><p>We opened my eyes. The darkness fell away, and the Rakshasa appeared. Or rather, the blue shimmer of her energy appeared. She was standing five feet away, and there was a pool of seething, sinewy flesh at her feet. She flicked a finger to the left, and several snakes instantly slithered away. Looping around to get behind me.</p><p>Amaya hissed. It sounded weird coming out of my mouth. We didn\u2019t move, just held the sword as we studied our surroundings.</p><p>The cavern itself was vast and roughly triangular in shape. Blue bolts of energy shot across the walls, the rhythm matching the beat of the heart. It seemed to be originating from a shadowed enclave at the very tip of the triangle, and I suddenly remembered what Azriel had said: Smash the god\u2019s power, and the Rakshasa will be fixed in flesh and more easily killed.</p><p>That was our way out of here.</p><p>Fight, Amaya growled and raised the sword, sweeping it from left to right so fast that the steel sang as it cut through the air.</p><p>No, I bit back. We stop the dark god rising first.</p><p>The snakes swept in. We moved, the sword little more than a blur as we struck, killing the snakes in one deadly sweep. The Rakshasa sent more snakes at us, but I had no intention of hanging around, waiting for them to get close.</p><p>My one chance of getting out of here alive might lie in reaching that enclave and destroying whatever lay within it, and I wasn\u2019t about to waste it.</p><p>I forced my limbs into a run, battling Amaya\u2019s desire to stand and fight as much as the weakness in my limbs. The Rakshasa\u2019s reaction was swift and deadly. She lunged after me, her sharp nails flashing. I twisted away, but she raked my back and a scream tore out of my throat. Not just from the pain, but also from frustration. Her nails were poisonous and I had no idea how quickly it would take effect and render me immobile once again.</p><p>Then I thrust that thought aside. All that mattered was reaching the enclave, and right now I could still run. My feet slapped quickly against the cold stone, but there was little sound to be heard other than the harsh rasp of my breathing.</p><p>Something hit the back of my legs and I stumbled. I flung out my arms to steady myself, and somehow retained balance. Again something struck at me, this time tearing into flesh. Snake. Fuck. The sword swung and there was no more snake, just clear ground between us and the enclave.</p><p>The exotic Rakshasa came at us. I heard the wind of her approach, felt the burn of her energy against my skin. We twisted away and swung the sword, the dark point slicing across perfect features, splitting flesh and cutting down to the bone. Her skin from cheek to chin peeled away, the flap hanging loose and giving her a half-skeletal look. She screamed, but it was a sound of fury rather than pain. We twisted again, and lashed out with a heel. It hit her high in the neck, hard enough to crush her larynx. Whether it did or not I had no idea, but the force behind the blow was enough to send her flailing backward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ran on. In the shadows that lurked around the cavern\u2019s point a simple urn sat on a pedestal of stone.</p><p>Power within, Amaya said. Crush.</p><p>We slid to a stop, raised the sword two-handed, and brought her down on the urn as hard as we could. The dark steel sliced through the urn as easily as it would have through butter, and the contents spewed out, a gluey mess of blood and other matter. In the center of the now shattered urn lay a small heart, its rhythm matching the beat in the stone around us. We raised the sword fractionally and slashed down. The blade shuddered as steel met flesh, then slowly, surely, it sliced through. The beat of life in the stone around us became unsteady, erratic.</p> <p>Not dead, not yet.</p><p>I raised the sword to finish the job, but the Rakshasa\u2019s scream swung me around. This time it was more than fury. This time it was devastation.</p><p>And this time it wasn\u2019t just the exotic Rakshasa who came at me, but every damn one of them.</p><p>Fight, Amaya said. Now.</p><p>We did. With a ferocity and skill that wasn\u2019t mine, we charged into the middle of them and tore them apart, piece by piece. It was a bitter, bloody battle that had blood pouring from almost every scrap of my body, but soon five of them were dead and only the exotic Rakshasa was left.</p> <p>I expected her to attack, but instead she stepped back. I raised the sword, fighting Amaya\u2019s urge to attack, my limbs trembling with exhaustion as I watched her warily. The Rakshasa\u2019s gaze swept the destruction around us, then moved to the shattered remains of the urn. Something close to grief moved across her ruined features, then her gaze returned to mine.</p><p>\u201cIt is done,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThe dark god is dead. I have failed in my duty to her.\u201d</p><p>She bowed low, then dropped to her knees before me and didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Waiting for me to step forward and finish what I\u2019d started.</p><p>Kill, Amaya said, and my fingers clenched tight against the hilt as I raised the sword.</p><p>But I fought Amaya\u2019s desire and stared instead at the Rakshasa. She just knelt there, waiting for death. I shivered. My task had always been to kill this spirit, but it didn\u2019t seem right to do it like this\u2014in cold blood rather than in the heat of battle.</p> <p>Kill, Amaya said again. Will I?</p><p>No. I had a feeling that if I acquiesced to her in this, I\u2019d somehow be handing greater control of my body to the spirit within my sword. Besides, this was my task, not hers, not Azriel\u2019s. In the end, I had to be strong enough to do it.</p><p>To prove to everyone that if the need arose, I could do what was necessary to survive.</p><p>I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, then raised the sword to full height and swept it down as hard as I could. The dark blade cut through the Rakshasa\u2019s neck with ease, but as her head plopped bloodlessly onto the stone and rolled away from her slumping body, I staggered and lost what little there was in my stomach.</p><p>After which I fell to my knees and sucked in great gulps of air. It didn\u2019t help the buzzing in my head, the trembling in my limbs, or the burning in my lungs. I needed to get out of here\u2014and get help\u2014quick, or this place might become my tomb, as well.</p><p>I sheathed the sword, then said wearily, \u201cAmaya, you need to return to the blade.\u201d</p><p>Better here.</p><p>Fear snaked through me. \u201cNo,\u201d I said determinedly. \u201cThis is my body, not yours. Your place is in steel, not flesh.\u201d</p> <p>One, she retorted. Here.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated, and closed my eyes, picturing the dark energy of her, imagining my hands encasing it, forcing it out of my body and back into steel.</p><p>She fought me every step of the way, until exhaustion trembled through every part of me and I was all but blacking out. But if I did that, she\u2019d win.</p><p>Damn it, this was my body, my life, and no matter how much it sucked at the moment, I wasn\u2019t about to give it up easily!</p><p>It was that determination that kept me going, and slowly but surely I forced her back into the sword. But as her energy and spirit left me, I felt a glimmer of almost reluctant admiration.</p><p>My sword respected my actions, even if she\u2019d fought them.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, and in the end, probably did a bit of both.</p><p>Time to go home, I thought, before either the Rakshasa\u2019s poison took effect or I collapsed from blood loss. And the dizziness sweeping me suggested I was closer to blacking out than I needed or wanted.</p><p>But how the hell did I get home?</p><p>That odd buzzing heaviness no longer rode the air, but I was weaker than a pup and I doubted I\u2019d have the strength to become Aedh.</p><p>Which left me with only one option\u2014chance the gray fields, and hope like hell Azriel found me there before anyone else did. Not that the Aedh had any reason to be hunting me given the tracker they\u2019d placed on my heart, but my father was still out there somewhere, and it\u2019d be my luck that he would choose a moment like this to hunt me down.</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a slow, somewhat shaky breath that didn\u2019t seem to contain much in the way of air. As I slowly released it, I released awareness of the battle to breathe, the pain that shook me, and the myriad of wounds that washed blood down my body, and concentrated on nothing more than slowing the beat of my heart. Gradually that beat steadied, amplified, as the dark cavern began to fade and the gray fields gathered close. Warmth throbbed at my neck\u2014Ilianna\u2019s magic at work, protecting me as my psyche, my soul, or whatever else people liked to call it, pulled away from the constraints of my flesh and stepped gently into the gray fields that were neither life nor death.</p><p>The Du\u0161an exploded from my arm, her energy flowing, buffeting me as her lilac form gained flesh and shape. She swirled around me, her movements sharp, edgy, as her ebony gaze scanned the fields around us. Looking for a threat that came from within me rather than anything the fields might offer. At least for the moment.</p><p>Azriel, I whispered, and hoped it was enough. I didn\u2019t have the energy for anything louder.</p><p>He answered. The storm of his approach quivered through me, but I didn\u2019t wait for him. I couldn\u2019t. Blackness was beginning to steal through the gray, and I knew my strength was giving out. I had to get back into my body before that happened, or I might end up stranded here in the fields.</p><p>And that could be deadly. A body could survive only so long without its soul on board.</p><p>This way, I said, and fled, down through the layers of consciousness and into my flesh. Then the blackness overtook me, and I knew no more.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Awareness surfaced slowly, as did the knowledge that I was warm and safe and\u2014most important\u2014alive. I smiled, but I couldn\u2019t seem to shake sleepiness or force my eyelids open, and soon I drifted back to sleep.</p><p>It was the aroma of cooking that eventually woke me. My nostrils flared as I drew in the tantalizing scent of roasting meat more deeply, and my stomach rumbled noisily.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d a familiar voice mused, \u201chad better be your stomach and not a fart.\u201d</p><p>Tao, I thought with a sleepy smile.</p><p>Then I sat bolt upright in bed. Tao!</p><p>I stared at him. Rubbed my eyes and stared at him some more. Reached out and touched him. Lightly, carefully, like he was a mirage that might disappear at the slightest sense of movement.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a mirage.</p><p>He was warm and real and here.</p><p>\u201cOh, god,\u201d I said, and flung myself at him.</p><p>He grunted as my weight hit him, then laughed softly and held me as fiercely as I held him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too,\u201d he said softly, his words whispering past my right ear. \u201cYou gave us quite a scare, you know.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and drew back a little, my gaze scanning his features. He was pale, and thin, and deep in his warm brown eyes something more than human burned, but none of that mattered right now. He was awake, he was aware, and most important of all, he seemed to have come back to us whole.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the same time that Azriel dragged you half-dead out of that hellhole you were stuck in.\u201d He gave me a weary smile and flicked my chin lightly. It still hurt, so the wound hadn\u2019t completely healed.</p><p>\u201cIt was touch and go for a while there, you know. Our reaper tried to heal you, but it didn\u2019t fully hold. You were out for days, and he was like a bear with a sore head. And the depth of his concern scared the hell out of us.\u201d</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t the healing hold? I glanced around the room, half expecting an answer, even though I knew he wasn\u2019t near. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>Tao shrugged. \u201cHe said something about needing to inform Hunter that the task was done.\u201d</p><p>Oh fuck, I thought, and hoped like hell the \u201cinforming\u201d didn\u2019t involve violence. We didn\u2019t need Hunter or the council as enemies right now. I took a deep, somewhat calming breath, and my stomach rumbled again.</p><p>Tao laughed. \u201cSounds like you\u2019d better get something into that belly of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you do the same.\u201d I scanned him critically. \u201cYou, my lad, need to put on some weight.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cIlianna\u2019s been feeding me like a horse for days, and with little effect. The new me, I\u2019m afraid, will probably remain razor thin.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, then said softly, \u201cHow is the new you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwake, alive, and damn grateful for both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d I said, sensing there was one.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he added grimly, \u201cI also fear it.\u201d</p><p>Given that he\u2019d consumed a fire elemental\u2014and survived, something no one had ever done\u2014he had a right to be scared. We didn\u2019t know what the long-term effects were going to be\u2014not even the most powerful witches in the country could tell us that.</p><p>Still, I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can feel it in me, Risa. Its presence burns constantly at the back of my mind, and though I\u2019ve won this battle, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve won the war. It could yet take me over.\u201d</p><p>I cupped a hand to his cheek. His skin burned under my fingertips. \u201cYou\u2019ve made it this far. You can\u2014and will\u2014control it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have more faith in my strength than I do,\u201d he muttered, and rose. \u201cI better get back to the kitchen, before Ilianna cooks the hell out of those steaks. Do you want to eat in here, or out there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOut there. I feel the need to get out and about.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cKnow that feeling. I\u2019ll give you a yell when they\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>I watched him walk out of the room, then carefully climbed out of bed. The room swung around me and my legs felt like water, and it was only a fierce determination that I would not fall that kept me upright. As Azriel had noted on numerous occasions, I could be a stubborn bitch when I wanted to be.</p> <p>I walked a little unsteadily across to my bathroom, then twisted around in front of the mirror to check out my various injuries. My reflection revealed a myriad of half-healed wounds, although the one down my spine was by far the worst. Azriel was right\u2014that one would scar.</p><p>No more low-backed evening dresses for me, I thought grimly. Especially if my aunt was around. She would not take kindly to discovering that I\u2019d been in situations dangerous enough to get hurt this badly without calling her in.</p><p>Heat shimmered across my skin. I turned around as Azriel appeared near my bed. His gaze skimmed me, a critical inspection that nevertheless had delight skittering through me.</p><p>\u201cYou should not be up,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cYou look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to stretch my legs, and I need to eat.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cHow did the meeting with Hunter go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was well aware of your victory. Apparently, the Cazador witnessed your fight with Rakshasa.\u201d</p><p>And that rankled him. Massively. \u201cMy getting snatched is not your fault, Azriel. I should have been more aware of what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs should I.\u201d He practically spat the words. \u201cIf I had been, I would have stopped the Rakshasa before she dove underground, and you would not be in this state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is a point we could argue endlessly, and one that really doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my dressing gown from the bathroom hook and put it on as I walked across the room. He didn\u2019t react when I stopped in front of him, but the connection between us was stronger than ever before. His emotions were a tidal wave that crashed through every fiber of my being, a tumultuous mix of desire, caring, and anger. If I\u2019d had the energy, I would have danced. He might be determined to hold what lay between us at arm\u2019s length, but at least he couldn\u2019t deny the strength of it. Not when it hummed so fiercely.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, the only thing that matters is that I did what the council wanted and survived.\u201d I paused, then grimaced. \u201cMy only regret is that with the Rakshasa gone, the ghosts have no outlet for their fury, and the club has no reason to stop that room from being used.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe grief of the ghosts is powerful enough that it will attract other dark forces. This will not be the last we hear of that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d I rubbed my arms against the chill of premonition. \u201cWe can only hope that next time, the council do their own fucking dirty work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt they will now that they have your services to call on in such matters.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cSo the vote has gone in my favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter seems confident it will. The Cazador\u2019s report was apparently impressive.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped an arm around my waist and pulled me close. I sighed contentedly and rested my cheek against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing you can do about the club or the council\u2019s use of the whores,\u201d he continued softly. \u201cNot without endangering yourself or anyone you told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>His lips brushed the top of my head, the touch so light and yet so electric. I shivered.</p><p>\u201cThose behind such an atrocity will in the end pay. Karma is a very real force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a force that in this case is not likely to react soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRis,\u201d Tao called from the other room. \u201cDinner is up!\u201d</p><p>I pulled somewhat reluctantly out of Azriel\u2019s arms. His grip slipped from my waist to my elbow. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and with his help, I made it into the living area. Ilianna appeared out of the kitchen, her smile wide and her expression filled with relief.</p><p>\u201cDamn, it\u2019s good to have you back.\u201d She stopped in front of me and dropped a kiss on my cheek. \u201cI\u2019d hug the hell out of you, but you look rather fragile at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look it because I feel it.\u201d With Azriel\u2019s help, I eased down onto a chair. \u201cI think I need a mountain of food and Coke, and I don\u2019t care which comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth are on their way,\u201d she said, and headed back to the kitchen.</p><p>Tao came out of the kitchen, handed me a large glass of Coke, then pulled out a chair to sit beside me. The doorbell rang, and he hesitated. \u201cYou expecting anyone?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNor me,\u201d Ilianna said from the confines of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cA human stands at the door,\u201d Azriel noted, then cocked his head sideways a little. \u201cA messenger. He leaves.\u201d</p><p>Oh god, I thought, trepidation suddenly so thick it practically closed my throat. The last two times a messenger had come to our door it was to deliver a message from my father, and a whole lot of trouble had ensued.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>I really wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I licked my lips and looked up at Tao. \u201cWe\u2019d better see what\u2019s been left this time.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked across the room. I twisted around to watch him. He punched the code on the security panel and the door slid open, revealing a plain brown envelope. He swooped, picked it up, then closed the door and walked back.</p><p>My gaze dropped to the envelope and my throat went dry. It was from my father. I recognized the handwriting on the front.</p><p>I held out a hand and Tao silently gave it to me. Tension rode his movements and his expression was dark. He knew.</p><p>I took a deep breath to gather courage, then slid a fingernail under the edge. Inside was a solitary piece of paper. I pulled it out and opened it. The words inside were brief and to the point.</p><p>The time has come to find the second key. Meet me, usual place, two days from now.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. I closed my eyes and handed the piece of paper to Tao.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what we need right now.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t, but there wasn\u2019t a whole lot we could do about it, either\u2014except pray that fate would give us a break. I didn\u2019t think any of us could stand too much more hardship.</p><p>But even as that thought crossed my mind, I knew it was futile. Fate had abandoned us long ago, and everything we\u2019d gone through so far was little more than the initial skirmish. The real war was coming, and if I was still alive at the end of it all, I\u2019d be very fucking surprised.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the courage to go on, I thought wearily. Didn\u2019t have the strength.</p><p>But even as the all-too-familiar doubts crossed my mind, I remembered everything I\u2019d done and everything I\u2019d been through\u2014with the Raziq, the Rakshasa, the battle with my sword. Time and again, I\u2019d done whatever had been needed to survive\u2014sometimes with help, sometimes not.</p><p>I had the courage. I could do what had to be done.</p><p>Not matter what the consequences.</p><p>No matter what the cost. </p> </body></html>"]
