Not her. She\u2019d be perfectly content to blot just one twelve-month period from her twenty-two years.</p><p>The past twelve months.</p><p>Last January, shortly after New Year\u2019s, she\u2019d met Ian Jacob Randall, a Navy man, a submariner. She\u2019d fallen in love with him and done something completely irresponsible\u2014she\u2019d gotten pregnant. Then she\u2019d complicated the whole situation by marrying him.</p> <p>That was mistake number three and from there, her errors in judgment had escalated. She hadn\u2019t been stupid so much as na\u00efve and in love and\u2014worst of all\u2014romantic. The Navy, and life, had cured her of that fast enough.</p><p>Their baby girl had been born premature while Ian was at sea, and it became immediately apparent that she had a defective heart. By the time Ian returned home, Allison Marie had already been laid to rest. It was Cecilia who\u2019d stood alone in the unrelenting rain of the Pacific Northwest while her baby\u2019s tiny casket was lowered into the cold, muddy earth. She\u2019d been forced to make life-and-death decisions without the counsel of family or the comfort of her husband.</p><p>Her mother lived on the East Coast and, because of a snowstorm, had been unable to fly into Washington State. Her father was as supportive as he knew how to be\u2014which was damn little. His idea of \u201cbeing there for her\u201d consisted of giving Cecilia a sympathy card and writing a few lines about how sorry he was for her loss. Cecilia had spent countless days and nights by their daughter\u2019s empty crib, alternately weeping and in shock. Other Navy wives had tried to console her, but Cecilia wasn\u2019t comfortable with strangers. She\u2019d rejected their help and their friendship. And because she\u2019d been in Cedar Cove for such a short time, she hadn\u2019t made any close friends in the community, either. As a result, she\u2019d borne her grief alone.</p><p>When Ian did return, he\u2019d blamed Navy procedures for his delay. He\u2019d tried to explain, but by then Cecilia was tired of it all. Only one reality had any meaning: her daughter was dead. Her husband didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t possibly understand what she\u2019d endured in his absence. Since he was on a nuclear submarine, all transmissions during his tour of duty were limited to fifty-word \u201cfamily grams.\u201d Nothing could have been done, anyway; the submarine was below the polar ice cap at the time. She did write to tell him about Allison\u2019s birth and then her death. She\u2019d written out her grief in these brief messages, not caring that they\u2019d be closely scrutinized by Navy personnel. But Ian\u2019s commanding officer had seen fit to postpone relaying the information until the completion of the ten-week tour. I didn\u2019t know, Ian had repeatedly insisted. Surely she couldn\u2019t hold him responsible. But she did. Unfair though it might be, Cecilia couldn\u2019t forgive him.</p><p>Now all she wanted was out. Out of her marriage, out of this emotional morass of guilt and regret, just out. The simplest form of escape was to divorce Ian.</p> <p>Sitting in the hallway near the courtroom, she felt more determined than ever to terminate her marriage. With one swift strike of a judge\u2019s gavel, she could put an end to the nightmare of the past year. Eventually she would forget she\u2019d ever met Ian Randall.</p><p>Allan Harris, Cecilia\u2019s attorney, entered the foyer outside the Kitsap County courtroom. She watched as he glanced around until he saw her. He raised his hand in a brief greeting, then walked over to where she sat on the hard wooden bench and claimed the empty space beside her.</p><p>\u201cTell me again what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said, needing the assurance that her life would return to at least an approximation of what it had been a year ago.</p><p>Allan set his briefcase on his lap. \u201cWe wait until the docket is announced. The judge will ask if we\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll announce that we are, and we\u2019ll be given a number.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia nodded, feeling numb.</p><p>\u201cWe can be assigned any number between one and fifty,\u201d her attorney continued. \u201cThen we wait our turn.\u201d</p> <p>Cecilia nodded again, hoping she wouldn\u2019t be stuck in the courthouse all day. Bad enough that she had to be here; even worse that Ian\u2019s presence was also required. She hadn\u2019t seen him yet. Maybe he was meeting somewhere with his own attorney, discussing strategies\u2014not that she expected him to contest the divorce.</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a problem, will there?\u201d Her palms were damp and cold sweat had broken out across her forehead. She wanted this to be over so she could get on with her life. She believed that couldn\u2019t happen until the divorce was filed. Only then would the pain start to go away.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that there\u2019ll be any hang-ups, especially since you\u2019ve agreed to divide all the debts.\u201d He frowned slightly. \u201cDespite that prenuptial agreement you signed.\u201d</p><p>A flu-like feeling attacked Cecilia\u2019s stomach, and she clutched her purse tightly against her. Soon, she reminded herself, soon she could walk out these doors into a new life.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rather...unusual agreement,\u201d Allan murmured.</p><p>In retrospect, the prenuptial agreement had been another in the list of mistakes she\u2019d made in the past year, but according to her attorney one that could easily be rectified. Back when she\u2019d signed it, their agreement had made perfect sense. In an effort to prove their sincerity, they\u2019d come up with the idea that the spouse who wanted the divorce should pay not only the legal costs but all debts incurred during the marriage. It could be seen as either punitive or deterrent; in either case, it hadn\u2019t worked. And now it was just one more nuisance to be dealt with.</p><p>Cecilia blamed herself for insisting on something in writing. She\u2019d wanted to be absolutely sure that Ian wasn\u2019t marrying her out of any sense of obligation. Yes, the pregnancy was unplanned, but she would\u2019ve been perfectly content to raise her child by herself. She preferred that to being trapped in an unhappy marriage\u2014or trapping Ian in a relationship he didn\u2019t want. Ian, however, had been adamant. He\u2019d sworn that he loved her, loved their unborn child and wanted to marry her.</p><p>As a ten-year-old, Cecilia\u2019s entire world had been torn apart when her parents divorced. She refused to do that to her own child. In her mind, marriage was forever, so she\u2019d wanted them to be certain before making a lifetime commitment. How na\u00efve, she thought now. How sentimental. How romantic.</p> <p>Ian had said he wanted their marriage to be forever, too, but like so much else this past year, that had been an illusion. Cecilia had needed to believe him, believe in the power of love, believe it would protect her from this kind of heartache.</p><p>In the end, blinded by the prospect of a husband who seemed totally committed to her and by the hope of a happy-ever-after kind of life, Cecilia had acquiesced to the marriage\u2014with one stipulation. The agreement.</p><p>Their marriage was supposed to last as long as they both lived, so they\u2019d devised an agreement that would help them stay true to their vows. Or so they\u2019d thought.... Before the ceremony, they\u2019d written the prenuptial contract themselves and had it notarized. She\u2019d forgotten all about it until she\u2019d made an appointment with Allan Harris and he\u2019d asked if she\u2019d signed any agreement prior to the wedding. It certainly wasn\u2019t the standard sort of document; nevertheless Allan felt they needed to have the court rescind it.</p><p>Her marriage shouldn\u2019t have ended like this, but after their baby died, everything had gone wrong. Whatever love had existed between them had been eroded by their loss. Babies weren\u2019t supposed to die\u2014even babies born premature. Any sense of rightness, of justice, had disappeared from Cecilia\u2019s world. The marriage that was meant to sustain her had become yet another source of guilt and grief. Experience had taught her she was alone, and her legal status might as well reflect that.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think about it anymore and purposely turned her thoughts elsewhere.</p><p>Attorneys milled about the crowded area, conferring with their clients, and she looked around, expecting to find Ian, bracing herself for the inevitable confrontation. She hadn\u2019t seen or talked to him in more than four months, although their attorneys were in regular contact. She wondered if all these other people were here for equally sad reasons. They must be. Why else did anyone go to court? Broken vows, fractured agreements...</p><p>\u201cWe have Judge Lockhart,\u201d Allan said, breaking into her observations.</p><p>\u201cIs that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>That was all Cecilia asked. \u201cThis is just a formality, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Allan gave her a comforting smile.</p><p>She checked at her watch. The docket was scheduled to be announced at nine and it was five minutes before. Ian still wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Ian doesn\u2019t show up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll ask for a continuance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Not another delay, she silently pleaded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here,\u201d Allan said reassuringly. \u201cBrad told me Ian\u2019s just as keen to get this over with as you are.\u201d</p><p>The knot in her stomach tightened. This was the easy part, she told herself, dismissing her nervousness. She\u2019d already been through the hard part\u2014the pain and grief, the disappointment of a marriage that hadn\u2019t worked. The hearing was merely a formality; Allan had said so. Once the prenuptial agreement was rescinded, the no-contest divorce was as good as done and this nightmare would be behind her.</p><p>Then Ian appeared.</p><p>Cecilia felt his presence before she actually saw him. Felt his gaze as he came up the stairwell and into the foyer. She turned and their eyes briefly met before they each, hurriedly, looked away.</p><p>Almost simultaneous with his arrival, the courtroom doors opened. Everyone stood and began to file inside with an eagerness that defied explanation. Allan walked beside Cecilia through the mahogany doors. Ian and his attorney entered after them and sat on the opposite side of the courtroom.</p><p>The bailiff immediately started reading off names as though taking attendance. With each name or set of names, a response was made and a number assigned. It happened so quickly that Cecilia almost missed hearing her own.</p><p>\u201cRandall.\u201d</p><p>Both Allan Harris and Brad Dumas called out.</p><p>Cecilia didn\u2019t hear the number they were given. When Allan sat down beside her, he wrote thirty on a yellow legal pad.</p><p>\u201cThirty?\u201d she whispered, astonished to realize that twenty-nine other cases would have to be heard before hers.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll go fast. We\u2019ll probably be out of here before eleven. Depends on what else is being decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the courtroom. You can wait outside if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>She did. The room felt claustrophobic, unbearably so. She stood and hurried into the nearly empty hall, practically stumbling out of the courtroom in her rush to escape.</p><p>Two steps into the foyer, she stopped\u2014barely avoiding a collision with Ian.</p><p>They both froze, staring at each other. Cecilia didn\u2019t know what to say; Ian apparently had the same problem. He looked good dressed in his Navy blues, reminding her of the first time they\u2019d met. He was tall and fit and possessed the most mesmerizing blue eyes she\u2019d ever seen. Cecilia thought that if Allison Marie had lived, she would have had her daddy\u2019s eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost over,\u201d Ian said, his voice low and devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she returned. After a moment\u2019s silence, she added, \u201cI didn\u2019t follow you out here.\u201d She wanted him to know that.</p><p>\u201cI figured as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt felt like the walls were closing in on me.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t comment and sank onto one of the wooden benches that lined the hallway outside the courtrooms. He slouched forward, elbows braced against his knees. She sat at the other end of the bench, perched uncomfortably on the very edge. Other people left the crowded courtroom and either disappeared or found a secluded corner to confer with their lawyers. Their whispered voices echoed off the granite walls.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe me, but I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s come to this,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d Then, in case he assumed she might be seeking a reconciliation, she told him, \u201cBut it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d He sat upright, his back ramrod-straight as he folded his arms across his chest. He didn\u2019t look at her again.</p><p>This was awkward\u2014both of them sitting here like this. But if he could pretend she wasn\u2019t there, she could do the same thing. Surreptitiously, she slid farther back on the bench. This was going to be a long wait.</p> <p>\u201cWell, hello there,\u201d Charlotte Jefferson said as she peeked inside the small private room at Cedar Cove Convalescent Center. \u201cI understand you\u2019re a new arrival.\u201d</p><p>The elderly, white-haired gentleman slouched forward in his wheelchair, staring at her with clouded brown eyes. Despite the ravages of illness and age\u2014he was in his nineties, she\u2019d learned\u2014she could see he\u2019d once been a handsome man. The classic bone structure was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about answering,\u201d she told him. \u201cI know you\u2019re a stroke patient. I just wanted to introduce myself. I\u2019m Charlotte Jefferson. I stopped by to see if there\u2019s anything I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>He raised his gaze to hers and slowly, as though with great effort, shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me your name. I read it outside the door. You\u2019re Thomas Harding.\u201d She paused. \u201cJanet Lester\u2014the social worker here\u2014mentioned you a few days ago. I\u2019ve always been fond of the name Thomas,\u201d she chattered on. \u201cI imagine your friends call you Tom.\u201d</p><p>A weak smile told her she was right.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Charlotte didn\u2019t mean to be pushy, but she knew how lonely it must feel to come to a strange town and not know a single, solitary soul. \u201cOne of my dearest friends was here for years, and I came to visit with her every Thursday. It got to be such a habit that after Barbara went to be with the Lord, I just continued. Last week, Janet told me you\u2019d just arrived. So I decided to come over today and introduce myself.\u201d</p><p>He tried to move his right hand, without success.</p><p>\u201cIs there something I can get you?\u201d she asked, wanting to be helpful.</p><p>He shook his head again, then with a shaky index finger pointed at the chair across from him.</p><p>\u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re asking me to sit down.\u201d</p><p>He managed a grin, lopsided though it was.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t mind if I do. These dogs are barking.\u201d She sat in the chair he\u2019d indicated and removed her right pump in order to rub some feeling back into her toes.</p><p>Tom watched her, his eyes keen with interest.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019d like to know a little something about Cedar Cove. Well, I don\u2019t blame you, poor man. Thank goodness you got transferred here. Janet said you\u2019d requested Cedar Cove in the first place, but got sent to that facility in Seattle instead. I heard about what happened there. All I can say is it\u2019s a crying shame.\u201d According to Janet, Tom\u2019s previous facility had been closed down for a number of serious violations. The patients, most of whom were wards of the state, were assigned to a variety of care units across Washington.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here in Cedar Cove\u2014it\u2019s a delightful little town, Tom,\u201d she said, purposely using his name. She wanted him to feel acknowledged. He\u2019d spent time in a substandard facility where he\u2019d been treated without dignity or compassion. In fact, Janet had told her the staff there had been particularly neglectful. Charlotte was shocked to hear that; she found it incomprehensible. Imagine being cruel to a vulnerable person like Tom! Imagine ignoring him, leaving him to lie in a dirty bed, never talking to him.... \u201cI see you\u2019ve got a view of the marina from here,\u201d she said with as much enthusiasm as she could muster. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our waterfront. During the summer there\u2019s a wonderful little festival, and of course the Farmer\u2019s Market fills the parking lot next to the library on Saturdays. Every so often, fishing boats dock at the pier and sell their wares. I swear to you, Tom, there\u2019s nothing better than Hood Canal shrimp bought fresh off the boat.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, but Tom seemed to be listening, so she went on.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see what I can tell you about Cedar Cove,\u201d she said, hardly knowing where to start. \u201cThis is a small town. Last census, I believe we totaled not quite five thousand. My husband, Clyde, and I both came from the Yakima area, in the eastern part of the state and we moved here after World War II. Back then, Cedar Cove had the only stoplight in the entire county. That was fifty years ago now.\u201d Fifty years. How could all that time have slipped away?</p><p>\u201cCedar Cove has changed in some ways, but it\u2019s stayed the same in others,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people around here are employed by the Bremerton shipyard, just like they were in the forties. And naturally the Navy has a real impact on the town\u2019s economy.\u201d</p><p>Tom must have guessed as much, with the Bremerton Naval shipyard on the other side of the cove. Huge aircraft carriers lined the waterfront; so did rows of diesel-powered submarines. The nuclear ones were stationed at the submarine base out in Bangor. On overcast days, the gray flotilla blended with the slate colors of the sky.</p><p>Tom jerkily placed his right hand over his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou served in the military?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The older man\u2019s nod was barely perceptible.</p><p>\u201cGod bless you,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cThere\u2019s all that talk about us being the greatest generation, living through the depression and the war, and you know what? They\u2019re right. Young people these days don\u2019t know what it means to sacrifice. They\u2019ve had it far too easy, but then, that\u2019s just my opinion.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes widened, and Charlotte could tell he agreed with her.</p><p>Not wanting to get sidetracked, she paused, gnawing on her lower lip. \u201cNow, what else can I tell you?\u201d she murmured. \u201cWell, for one thing, we\u2019re big on sports in Cedar Cove. Friday nights in the fall, half the town shows up for the high-school football games. This time of year, it\u2019s basketball. Two years ago, the softball team took the state championship. My oldest grandson\u2014\u201d She hesitated and looked away, sorry she\u2019d followed this train of thought. \u201cJordan showed real promise as a baseball player, but he drowned fifteen years ago.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure what had prompted her to mention Jordan and wished that she hadn\u2019t. A familiar sadness lodged in her heart. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over his death.\u201d</p><p>Tom, feeble as he was, leaned toward her, as though to rest his hand on hers.</p><p>It was a touching gesture. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to talk about this. My daughter lives in Cedar Cove,\u201d she continued, forcing a cheerful note into her voice. \u201cShe\u2019s a judge\u2014Judge Olivia Lockhart\u2014and I\u2019m proud as can be of her. When she was a little girl, Olivia was a skinny little thing. She grew up tall, though. Very striking. She\u2019s in her early fifties now, and she still turns heads. It\u2019s the way she carries herself. Just looking at her, people know she\u2019s someone important. That\u2019s my daughter, the judge, but to me she\u2019ll always be my little brown-eyed girl. I get a lot of joy out of sitting in her courtroom while she\u2019s presiding.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHere I am talking about myself instead of Cedar Cove.\u201d If she\u2019d had questions to answer, Charlotte would\u2019ve found this easier; unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t possible for Tom to ask.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only a ferry ride away from Seattle, but we\u2019re a rural community. I live in the town proper, but plenty of folks have chickens and horses. Of course, that\u2019s outside the city limits.\u201d</p><p>Tom nodded in her direction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking about me?\u201d</p><p>His answering smile told her she\u2019d guessed right.</p><p>Charlotte smiled, a bit flustered. She lifted her hand to her head and smoothed the soft wavy hair. At seventy-two, her hair was completely white. It suited her, if she did say so herself. Her face was relatively unlined; she\u2019d always been proud of her complexion\u2014a woman was allowed a little vanity, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a widow,\u201d she began. \u201cClyde\u2019s been gone nearly twenty years. He died much too young\u2014cancer.\u201d She lowered her eyes. \u201cHe worked at the Naval shipyard. We had two children, William and Olivia. You know, the judge. William works in the energy business and travels all over the world, and Olivia married and settled down right here in Cedar Cove. Her children graduated from the same high school she did. The school hangs a picture of each year\u2019s graduating class on the wall and it\u2019s quite interesting to look back on all those young smiling faces and see what\u2019s become of them.\u201d Charlotte grew thoughtful. \u201cJustine\u2019s picture is there. She was Jordan\u2019s twin and oh, I do worry about her. She\u2019s twenty-eight now and dating an older man neither her mother nor I trust.\u201d Charlotte stopped herself from saying more. \u201cJames is Olivia\u2019s youngest, and he\u2019s currently in the Navy. It was a shock to all of us when he enlisted. William and his wife decided against children, and I sometimes wonder if they regret that now. I think Will might, but not Georgia.\u201d Although both her children were in their fifties, Charlotte still worried about them.</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes drifted shut, then swiftly opened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d Charlotte said, realizing she was discussing her concerns about her daughter and grand-children more than she was giving Tom an overview of Cedar Cove.</p><p>He shook his head slightly, as if he didn\u2019t want her to leave.</p><p>Charlotte stood and placed her hand on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, Tom. You should get some sleep. Besides, it\u2019s time I headed for the courthouse. Olivia\u2019s on the bench this morning and I\u2019m finishing a baby blanket.\u201d Deciding she should explain, she added, \u201cI do my best knitting in court. The Chronicle did an article about me a couple of years ago with a photo! There I was, sitting in court with my needles and my yarn. Which reminds me, if you\u2019d like I\u2019ll bring in the local paper and read it to you. Until just this week, we only had the Wednesday edition, but the paper was recently sold and a new editor hired. He\u2019s expanded to two papers a week. Isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tom smiled.</p><p>\u201cThis is a lovely little town,\u201d Charlotte told him, leaning forward to pat his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to like it here so well.\u201d</p><p>She started out the door and saw that her new friend didn\u2019t have a lap robe. The ladies at the Senior Center would soon fix that. These halls got downright chilly, especially during Cedar Cove\u2019s damp winters. How sad that this man didn\u2019t have anyone who cared enough about his welfare to see that he had a basic comfort like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d she told him again.</p> <p>Tom nodded and gave her a rakish little grin.

What a dear man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d think so. You\u2019re exactly what he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any family?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no next of kin listed in his file. It\u2019s about five years since his stroke, and apparently he\u2019s never had visitors.\u201d She paused, frowning. \u201cBut then, I don\u2019t know how much we can trust the record-keeping at Senior Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was he there?\u201d</p><p>Janet shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t recall exactly. At least five years. After he was released from chronic care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the poor man. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn need of a friend,\u201d Janet finished for her.</p><p>\u201cWell, he found one,\u201d Charlotte said. She\u2019d always been a talker. Clyde used to say she could make friends with a brick wall. He meant it as a compliment and she\u2019d taken it that way.</p> <p>On second thought, she wouldn\u2019t ask the women at the Senior Center to knit Tom a lap robe; she\u2019d do it herself, just as soon as she finished the baby blanket. By her next visit, she\u2019d have something to give him, something to keep him warm\u2014the lap robe...and her friendship.</p><p>Judge Olivia Lockhart had a difficult time with divorce cases, which were her least favorite duty in family court. She\u2019d served on the bench for two years and figured she\u2019d seen it all. Then there were cases like this one.</p><p>Ian and Cecilia Randall were asking to rescind their handwritten notarized prenuptial agreement. As soon as that was out of the way, they would file for the dissolution of their marriage. The attorneys stood before her with their clients at their sides.</p><p>Olivia glanced at the paperwork, noting that it had been dated and signed less than a year ago. How a marriage could go so wrong so quickly was beyond her. She looked up and studied the couple. So young, they were, both of them staring down at their feet. Ian Randall seemed to be a responsible young man, probably away from his home and family for the first time, serving in the military. The wife was a fragile waif, impossibly thin with dark, soulful eyes. Her straight brown hair framed her heart-shaped face; the ends straggled to her shoulders. She repeatedly looped a strand around her ear, probably out of nerves.</p><p>\u201cI must say this is original,\u201d Olivia murmured, rereading the few lines of the text. It was straightforward enough if unusual. According to the agreement, the spouse who filed for divorce would assume all debts.</p><p>Apparently they\u2019d had a change of heart in that, as well as in the matter of their marriage. Olivia glanced over the brief list of accumulated debts and saw that they\u2019d been evenly split between the couple. If the marriage had lasted longer, of course, the debts would have been more punishing\u2014a mortgage, presumably, car payments and so on. Which would have provided the discontented spouse with an incentive of sorts to stay in the marriage, Olivia supposed. In any event, the current debts amounted to seven thousand dollars. Ian Randall assumed all credit card bills and Cecilia Randall had agreed to pay the utility bills, which included a three-hundred-dollar phone bill and oddly enough, a two-hundred-dollar charge to a florist shop. The largest of the debts, she noticed, was burial costs, which they had agreed to share equally.</p><p>\u201cBoth parties have reached an agreement in regard to all debts accumulated during the time of their marriage,\u201d Allan Harris stated.</p><p>Clearly there was more to this situation than met the eye. \u201cWas there a death in the family?\u201d she asked, directing the question to the attorney who\u2019d spoken.</p> <p>Allan nodded. \u201cA child.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s stomach spasmed. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur daughter was born premature, and she had a defective heart,\u201d Cecilia Randall said in a barely audible voice. \u201cHer name was Allison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison Marie Randall,\u201d the sailor husband added.</p><p>Olivia watched as husband and wife exchanged glances. Cecilia looked away but not fast enough for Olivia to miss the pain, the anger, the heartache. Perhaps she recognized it because she\u2019d experienced it herself, right along with the disintegration of her own marriage.</p><p>The two parties continued to await her decision. Since everything was in order and both were in agreement, there was little to hold up the procedure. This hearing was simply a formality so they could proceed to the dissolution of their marriage.</p><p>\u201cSeven thousand dollars is quite a lot of debt to accumulate in just a few months,\u201d she said, prolonging their wait.</p><p>\u201cI agree, Your Honor,\u201d Brad Dumas inserted quickly, \u201cbut there were extenuating circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Olivia caught sight of her mother in the viewing chamber. She often sat in the front row, almost always occupied with her needles and yarn. But Charlotte wasn\u2019t knitting now. Her fingers clenched the needles that rested in her lap, as though she, too, understood the significance of what was happening.</p><p>Olivia hesitated, which was completely unlike her. She was known for being swift and decisive. What this couple needed was a gentle, loving hand to guide them through the grieving process. Ending their marriage wouldn\u2019t solve the problems; personal experience had taught Olivia that. If the Randalls insisted on going through with their divorce, Olivia would be helping them pave a one-way road to pain and guilt. However, she had no legal reason not to rescind the agreement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a ten-minute recess...to review this agreement,\u201d she announced. Then, before the members of either party could reveal their shock, she got up and headed toward her chambers. She heard the rustle of the courtroom as everyone stood, followed by a flurry of hushed whispers.</p><p>Sitting at her desk, Olivia leaned her head against the high-back leather chair and closed her eyes. It was inevitable that she\u2019d see the comparisons between herself and Cecilia Randall. Fifteen years ago, Olivia had lost her oldest son. All those years had come and gone, but the pain of Jordan\u2019s death had never faded, and it never would. In the twelve months after the drowning accident, her entire world had crumbled. First she\u2019d lost her son and then her husband. Over the years, small problems had crept into her marriage\u2014nothing big, nothing overwhelming or unusual, just the typical stress experienced by any couple with dual careers and three demanding children. But after Jordan\u2019s death, that stress had multiplied tenfold, had become insurmountable. Before Olivia could fully appreciate what they were doing, they\u2019d separated. Not long afterward, Olivia and Stan found themselves standing in front of a judge, and the divorce was declared final.</p><p>Three months later, Stan had shocked her and everyone else by remarrying. Apparently he\u2019d been confiding his problems to this other woman for some time, keeping the relationship a secret from Olivia.</p><p>A knock sounded at her door and before Olivia could answer, her mother let herself in.</p><p>Olivia straightened. She should\u2019ve known her mother would take this opportunity to speak with her. \u201cHello, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not disturbing you, am I?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. Her mother knew the door was always open as far as she was concerned.</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Charlotte immediately got to the point\u2014her point. \u201cWhat a shame it is, that young couple wanting out of their marriage when they\u2019ve barely had a chance to get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was thinking the same thing, although she couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t admit it.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that neither of them is very keen on this divorce. I could be wrong, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, you know I can\u2019t discuss my cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I know, but sometimes I just can\u2019t help myself.\u201d Charlotte started to back out the door, then apparently changed her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever told you this, but your father and I didn\u2019t get along the first year, either.\u201d</p><p>This was news to Olivia.</p><p>\u201cClyde was a stubborn man, and as you might have noticed I have a strong will of my own.\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement if ever there was one.</p><p>\u201cOur first year, all we did was argue,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cAnd then, before I knew it, I was pregnant with your brother and well...well, we worked everything out. We had a lot of good years together, your father and I.\u201d Her hands tightened around her purse and her knitting bag. \u201cHe was the love of my life.\u201d As if she\u2019d said more than she\u2019d intended, Charlotte moved out of the room and gently closed the door behind her.</p><p>Grinning, Olivia got to her feet. Leave it to her mother to say exactly what she needed to hear. Her decision made, Olivia returned to the courtroom. Once she was seated, the Randalls and their attorneys approached the bench. Cecilia Randall stepped forward with her big, soulful eyes staring blankly into space. Ian Randall\u2019s expression was hard and unflinching, as though he was preparing himself for the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI cannot discount the possibility,\u201d Olivia began, \u201cthat these parties entered into this agreement in contemplation of the very issue\u2014this matter of divorce\u2014that is set before this court. They obviously placed great value on their marriage and that value served as consideration for such a contract. Their intent was clearly to avoid the outcome they now seem to be pursuing\u2014an easy divorce. Therefore, I am not setting aside the prenuptial agreement. The issue will need to be resolved at trial. In the meantime, I strongly urge these parties to seek out counseling or apply to the Dispute Resolution Center to discuss their differences.\u201d</p><p>Both spouses and their lawyers leaned closer, as if they couldn\u2019t possibly have heard correctly.</p><p>Allan Harris and Brad Dumas immediately started shuffling through their notes. The sight was almost comical as the two attorneys hurried to reread the prenuptial agreement.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Your Honor.\u201d Brad Dumas reacted first, raising his hand.</p><p>\u201cBoth parties are in agreement,\u201d Allan Harris argued. \u201cMr. Randall has agreed to set aside the prenuptial and has willingly taken on responsibility for a share of the debts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Cecilia Randall asked, looking to Allan Harris.</p><p>\u201cTo clarify, Your Honor,\u201d Brad Dumas requested, his expression puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThe agreement stands as written,\u201d Olivia stated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not setting aside the agreement?\u201d Allan Harris spoke slowly. He sounded confused.</p><p>\u201cNo, Counselors, I am not, for the reasons I\u2019ve just indicated.\u201d</p><p>Allan Harris and Brad Dumas stared at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs there a problem, gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>She waved them aside. \u201cSee the clerk and set a trial date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean we can\u2019t go through with the divorce?\u201d Cecilia asked her attorney.</p> <p>\u201cI want the divorce as much as you do,\u201d Ian Randall insisted.</p><p>Olivia slammed her gavel. \u201cOrder in the court,\u201d she told them. If the couple chose to argue, they could do so on their own time.</p><p>Moving as though they were in shock, Allan Harris and Brad Dumas picked up their papers and briefcases.</p><p>\u201cIs there any other option?\u201d Cecilia Randall asked Allan Harris as they walked toward the doors.</p><p>\u201cWe might be able to appeal, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019ll drive up the costs even more,\u201d Ian protested, close behind with his own attorney. Apparently Brad was still too dumbfounded to speak.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d Cecilia muttered once she\u2019d reached the courtroom doors. \u201cCan\u2019t we do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe judge said we have to take this to trial?\u201d Ian Randall sounded incredulous. \u201cJust how expensive is that going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d Allan Harris answered quickly, as if he\u2019d take delight in running up his client\u2019s husband\u2019s tab.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what I want,\u201d Cecilia wailed.</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest you do what the judge recommended and seek counseling or contact the Dispute Resolution Center.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not airing my problems to a group of strangers.\u201d With that Ian Randall slammed his way out of the court. Brad Dumas followed his client, but not before tossing Olivia a disgruntled look.</p><p>Allan Harris stood there shaking his head, his expression incredulous.</p><p>The bailiff read off the next number and still Allan remained.</p><p>Cecilia Randall turned away, but not fast enough to disguise the fact that her eyes had filled with tears. Olivia felt her heart break just a little\u2014and yet she was convinced she\u2019d done the right thing.</p><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Cecilia asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Olivia heard Allan Harris mumble. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia Randall shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she murmured, shrugging into her coat. \u201cNone of this should have happened, but it just did.\u201d</p><p>Two</p> <p>Olivia groaned when the telephone rang for the fifth time Saturday morning. No doubt this call, like all the others, was the result of Jack Griffin\u2019s newspaper piece published that morning. The newly appointed editor of The Cedar Cove Chronicle had for some reason decided to write an article about her. He\u2019d run the headline Divorce Denied across the editorial page. Olivia sighed; all this unwanted attention was disrupting her weekend, and she resented it.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, making sure her voice conveyed her irritation. If this caller felt compelled to discuss her judgment, then she wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk. She\u2019d brought each of the four previous conversations to a swift end.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Justine, that was a relief! Olivia had been waiting to hear from her daughter all week. \u201cHow are you?\u201d It used to be that they spoke on a regular basis, but no longer. Justine was dating a man Olivia considered disreputable, which created ongoing tension between mother and daughter. Consequently Justine avoided her. Warren Saget was a forty-eight-year-old land developer\u2014twenty years her senior\u2014who had put together more than one shady deal. The age difference didn\u2019t bother Olivia as much as the man himself.</p><p>\u201cDid you know your name was in the paper this morning?\u201d Justine asked.</p><p>As though anyone would let Olivia miss seeing it. Starting the first of the year, The Cedar Cove Chronicle had gone to two editions a week and this was the very first Saturday edition. Maybe Griffin should\u2019ve stuck to one paper a week, Olivia thought grimly, since he obviously couldn\u2019t scrape up enough real news. His entire column had been about the day he\u2019d spent sitting in her courtroom, listening to the judgments she\u2019d made. Although he didn\u2019t mention the Randalls by name, he said her ruling in that instance had come from the heart rather than from any law book and he applauded her decision, calling her gutsy and unconventional. Olivia wasn\u2019t opposed to receiving praise, but she\u2019d prefer not to have attention drawn to that particular case. While he\u2019d mentioned her in a vaguely flattering light, he certainly hadn\u2019t been as kind to others in her profession. He appeared to have a bias against attorneys and judges, and wasn\u2019t afraid to share his opinions on the subject.</p><p>It was just Olivia\u2019s luck that Jack Griffin had chosen her courtroom that day. Just her bad luck, she amended.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Justine asked. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s obvious Jack Griffin doesn\u2019t have much respect for the law, but he seems to like you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia could hear the amusement in her daughter\u2019s voice. \u201cI don\u2019t even know the man,\u201d she said dismissively.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. I thought you\u2019d been holding out on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in you\u2019d found yourself a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Olivia moaned.</p><p>\u201cWell, he seems to have made himself your champion. Especially over that \u2018divorce denied\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had known she was taking a risk when she\u2019d made her ruling on the Randall case. Her personal feelings had no role on the bench, but she was absolutely certain those two young people would be making a terrible mistake if they went through with the divorce. She\u2019d merely put up a roadblock, hoping it would be enough to force them into dealing with their problems instead of running from them.</p><p>\u201cJack wrote that you weren\u2019t afraid of making a controversial decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already read his column,\u201d Olivia said in an effort to keep her daughter from repeating any more of it.</p><p>\u201cSo you know all about it?\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d Then, hoping to change the subject, she asked, \u201cAre you free for lunch this afternoon? It\u2019s been weeks since we had a chance to visit.\u201d Justine had come for Christmas, but she\u2019d left as soon as the gifts were opened and dinner had been served. Olivia had no idea where she\u2019d spent New Year\u2019s. Then again, she did know\u2014and wished she didn\u2019t. Her daughter had spent the night with Warren Saget. \u201cYour grandma and I are getting together. We\u2019d love it if you could join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom, Warren and I already have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She should have guessed. Warren kept a tight rein on Justine. She rarely had any free time these days. That distressed and annoyed Olivia, but whenever she mentioned it, or even hinted as much, her daughter became defensive.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get together soon,\u201d Justine promised. \u201cGotta go now.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was about to suggest they set a day and a time right then, but before she had the opportunity, the line went dead.</p><p>Grumbling to herself, she finished writing out her grocery list, then reached for her jacket and purse. The January weather was gray and bleak. It was raining lightly\u2014more of a fine mist, really\u2014as she locked the front door and hurried down the porch steps to her car. Olivia loved her home, which looked out over the water on Lighthouse Road. The lighthouse itself was three miles away, situated on a jut of land that led into the protected waters of the cove. Unfortunately it couldn\u2019t be seen from her property.</p><p>She had a number of stops to make\u2014the grocery, the dry cleaner, the library. She hoped to get everything done by noon, when she was meeting her mother for lunch. She wished again that Justine could have joined them.</p><p>She picked up her dry cleaning and returned her books to the library, then swung over to the local Safeway, where she always did her weekly shopping. Thankfully, she was early enough to avoid the usual Saturday morning crush. She began with the produce aisle, where she stood debating whether a head of lettuce was worth this outrageous price.</p><p>\u201cJudge Lockhart. Didn\u2019t expect to run into you here.\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned to confront the very man who\u2019d managed to upset her morning. She recognized his face from that day in her courtroom\u2014the man who\u2019d sat right in front, notebook and pen in hand. \u201cWell, well, if it isn\u2019t Mr. Jack Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had the pleasure of a formal introduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Mr. Griffin, after this morning\u2019s paper, I know who you are.\u201d He was around her age, Olivia guessed, in his early fifties, and about her height. Dark hair, starting to gray. Clean-shaven, with pleasant regular features, he didn\u2019t strike her as outstandingly handsome but he had what she could only describe as an appealing quality. He smiled readily and his gaze was clear and direct. He seemed a bit disheveled in a loose raincoat, and she noticed that his shirt was casual, the top two buttons unfastened.</p><p>\u201cDo I detect a note of censure?\u201d he asked, his smile flirting with her.</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. She was annoyed with him, but letting him know that would serve no useful purpose. \u201cI suppose you were just doing your job,\u201d she muttered, tossing a green pepper into her cart. Rubies cost less per pound, but she had a fondness for green peppers and felt she deserved a treat. Especially after this morning. Green peppers were a whole lot better for her than butter-pecan ice cream.</p><p>She started to push her cart away, but Jack stopped her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got a coffee shop next door. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Jack followed her as she sorted through the fresh green beans. \u201cIt might\u2019ve been my imagination, but you didn\u2019t want to see that couple go through with the divorce, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t discuss my cases outside the courtroom,\u201d she informed him stiffly.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d he said in a reasonable tone as he continued walking at her side. \u201cIt was personal, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Losing her patience, Olivia turned and glared at him. As though she\u2019d admit such a thing to a reporter! He\u2019d make the whole episode sound like a breach of professional ethics. She\u2019d done nothing wrong, dammit. She\u2019d acted with the best of intentions, and she\u2019d remained steadfastly within the law.</p><p>\u201cYou lost a son, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cAre you gathering information on me for your next article, Mr. Griffin?\u201d she asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014and it\u2019s Jack.\u201d He held up both hands, which was supposed to reassure her, Olivia supposed. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI nearly lost my own son,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you always pester people who prefer to go about their own business, or am I special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re special,\u201d he answered without a pause. \u201cI knew it the minute you made your judgment in the Randall case. You were right, you know. Everyone in that courtroom could see they had no business getting divorced. What you did took guts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I explained earlier, I cannot discuss my cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could have a cup of coffee with me, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d He didn\u2019t plead, didn\u2019t prod, but there was a good-natured quality about him that was beginning to work on her. He had a sense of humor, even a certain roguishness. She gave up. It probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to talk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed. She glanced down at her cart, calculating how long it would take her to finish.</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes,\u201d he suggested, grinning triumphantly. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>That settled, he walked away. Olivia couldn\u2019t help it, she was curious about this man and his comment about almost losing his own son. Perhaps they had more in common than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>Twenty-five minutes later, her groceries in the trunk of her car, Olivia entered Java and Juice, the coffeehouse next to the Safeway. Sure enough, Jack was waiting for her, hands cupped around a steaming latte. He sat at a round table by the window and stood when she approached. It was a small thing, coming to his feet like that, a show of good manners and respect. But that one gentlemanly gesture told her as much about him as everything else he\u2019d said and done.</p> <p>She sat in the chair across from him and he waved to the waitress, who appeared promptly. Olivia ordered a regular coffee; a minute later, a thick ceramic mug was set before her.</p><p>Jack waited until the high-school girl had left before he spoke. \u201cI just wanted you to know I meant what I said\u2014I admire what you did last week. It couldn\u2019t have been easy.\u201d Olivia was about to remind him yet again that she couldn\u2019t discuss her court cases when he stopped her, shaking his head. \u201cI know, I know. But in my opinion you made a bold move and I couldn\u2019t let that go unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>Olivia would have preferred he not publish his opinions for the entire town to discuss. However, there was nothing she could say or do that would change what had already seen the light of the printed page.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in Cedar Cove?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>\u201cThree months,\u201d he answered. \u201cAre you purposely turning the attention away from yourself?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia grinned. \u201cI sure am,\u201d she told him. \u201cSo\u2014you have a son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric. He\u2019s twenty-six and lives in Seattle. When he was ten, he was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer. He wasn\u2019t expected to live....\u201d His face darkened at the memory.</p><p>\u201cBut he did,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s alive and healthy, and for that I\u2019m deeply grateful.\u201d Then he went on to say that Eric worked for Microsoft and was doing very well.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s gaze went automatically to his ring finger. Jack had mentioned his son, but not his wife.</p><p>He\u2019d obviously noticed her quick look. \u201cEric survived the cancer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut unfortunately my marriage didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>So he understood on a personal level what had occurred in her own life. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged carelessly. \u201cThat was a long time ago. Life goes on and so do I. You\u2019re divorced yourself?\u201d Although he asked the question, she was fairly certain he already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cFifteen years now.\u201d</p><p>The conversation flowed smoothly after that, and before she knew it, she had to leave to meet her mother for lunch. Reaching for her purse, Olivia stood and extended her hand to Jack.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed getting to know you.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet, taking her hand in his. \u201cYou, too, Olivia.\u201d He briefly squeezed her fingers, as if to say they\u2019d formed a bond with one another. When they\u2019d first met today\u2014and definitely before that\u2014she\u2019d been irritated with him, but Jack had managed to thwart her displeasure. By the time she walked out the door, Olivia felt she\u2019d made a friend. She was well aware that Jack Griffin was no ordinary man, though; she wouldn\u2019t make the mistake of underestimating him.</p><p>Ian Randall sat in his car outside his wife\u2019s apartment building, dreading what was certain to be another confrontation. The judge had made it plain that the prenuptial agreement wasn\u2019t going to be rescinded. Now what? They had a few options, none of which suited him or, apparently, his wife.</p><p>Cecilia was the one who wanted the divorce. She\u2019d been the first to hire an attorney. Hell, she\u2019d rammed this whole stupid idea down his throat. She wanted out. Okay, fine. If she preferred not to be with him, he was hardly going to fight for the privilege of remaining her husband. But now they were faced with a stumbling block in their attempt to end the marriage, such as it was. All because they\u2019d written that agreement, intended to safeguard their wedding vows. Some decision had to be made.</p> <p>There was no point in waiting any longer. He climbed out of his car and slowly entered the building, approaching the first-floor apartment they\u2019d once shared.</p><p>Ian was irritated that he had to ring the doorbell to what had recently been his own home. After their separation, he\u2019d had to move on base. Fortunately, his friend Andrew Lackey had allowed Ian to store a few things at his house. He leaned hard against the buzzer now, fighting down his resentment. Releasing the button, he retreated a step and squared his shoulders. He steeled his emotions the way he\u2019d been taught in basic training, unwilling to reveal any of his thoughts or feelings to Cecilia.</p><p>His wife opened the door, frowning when she saw who it was.</p><p>\u201cI thought we should come to a decision,\u201d he announced in resolute tones. No matter how many times he told himself he shouldn\u2019t feel anything for her, he did. He couldn\u2019t be in the same room with her and forget what it was like when they\u2019d made love or when he\u2019d first felt their baby move inside her. Nor could he forget how it had felt to stand over his daughter\u2019s grave, never having had the opportunity to hold Allison or tell her he loved her.</p><p>Cecilia held open the door. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The hesitation in her voice was unmistakable.</p><p>Ian followed her into the compact living room and sat on the edge of the sofa. They\u2019d picked it up second-hand at a garage sale shortly after their wedding. Ian had refused to let Cecilia help him move it, since she was already three months pregnant. His stubbornness had resulted in a wrenched back. This old sofa came with a lot of bad memories, just like his short-lived marriage.</p><p>Cecilia sat across from him, her hands folded, her face unrevealing.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you the judge\u2019s decision was kind of a shock,\u201d he said, opening the discussion.</p><p>\u201cMy attorney said we could appeal it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Ian muttered, his anger flaring. \u201cAnd rack up another five or six hundred dollars\u2019 worth of legal fees. I don\u2019t have that kind of money to burn and neither do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the state of my finances,\u201d Cecilia snapped.</p><p>This was the way every discussion started with them. At first they were courteous, almost too polite, but within minutes they were arguing and everything exploded in his face. They seemed to reach that level of irrational anger so quickly these days, or at least since Allison Marie\u2019s birth\u2014and death. Ian sighed, feeling a sense of hopelessness. With the way things were between them now, it was hard to believe they\u2019d ever slept together.</p><p>Ian diverted his thoughts from their once healthy and energetic love life. In bed they\u2019d found little to disagree about, but that was before...</p><p>\u201cWe could always do as my attorney suggested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d Ian had no intention of taking Allan Harris\u2019s advice. The other man represented his wife\u2019s interests, not his.</p><p>\u201cAllan recommended we do what the judge said and take our disagreement to the Dispute Resolution Center.\u201d</p><p>Ian remembered Judge Lockhart making some comment about that, and he remembered his own reaction at the time. \u201cWhat exactly is that supposed to do?\u201d he asked, trying to sound reasonable and conciliatory.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say for certain, but I think we\u2019d each present our sides to an impartial third party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will that cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes everything boil down to money with you?\u201d Cecilia demanded.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes.\u201d This divorce had already set him back plenty. He wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d wanted it in the first place, he told himself stubbornly. Sure, after Allison died, they\u2019d had a few arguments but he\u2019d never expected it to lead to this.</p><p>Cecilia had never understood what it\u2019d been like for him, although he\u2019d tried to explain countless times. He hadn\u2019t received her \u201cfamily gram\u201d until the end of the tour. His commanding officer had withheld the information about the premature birth and death of his daughter, since there was no possibility of a humanitarian airlift or any way of contacting Cecilia. When he finally reached the base, he hadn\u2019t had a chance to absorb the reality of their loss.</p><p>His wife gave him a disgusted look. \u201cDo you have any suggestions, then?\u201d she asked in a superior tone of voice that set his teeth on edge. She knew he hated it when she spoke to him as though he was still in grade school.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do,\u201d he said, and got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cFine. I can\u2019t wait to hear it.\u201d Cecilia crossed her arms in that huffy way of hers.</p><p>\u201cI say we simply go on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to remarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. Maybe someday.\u201d</p><p>As far as he was concerned, Ian was through with it. Never again would he subject himself to a woman\u2019s volatile emotions or fickle whims. \u201cNot me. I\u2019ve had it with marriage, with you, with the entire mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see if I understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Cecilia stood, too, and started pacing the small living room, passing directly in front of him. He caught a whiff of her perfume, and it was all he could do not to close his eyes and savor the scent. He hated that she still had the power to make him weak, to leave him wanting her....</p><p>\u201cYou can figure it out, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he said, purposely being sarcastic because he was angry now. He couldn\u2019t be near Cecilia and not feel a rush of resentment. Not just at her but at himself for harboring emotions that wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>She ignored his attitude. \u201cAre you suggesting we not divorce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d He didn\u2019t want her to assume he was seeking a reconciliation. That wouldn\u2019t work; he already knew it. In the months after Allison\u2019s death, they\u2019d both tried to make the best of a painful situation, without success.</p><p>\u201cSort of?\u201d she echoed, then waved her hand at him. \u201cTell me more. This whole concept of yours intrigues me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just bet it did. \u201cWe could pretend we\u2019re divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend?\u201d Cecilia didn\u2019t bother to hide her anger. \u201cThat is the stupidest idea I\u2019ve ever heard. Pretend,\u201d she repeated, shaking her head. \u201cYou think we can ignore all our problems and pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her, not trusting himself to speak. Okay, maybe she was right. He didn\u2019t want to deal with this divorce.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always looking for the easy way out,\u201d she said scornfully.</p><p>He might be a lot of things, but irresponsible wasn\u2019t one of them. The Navy trusted him with a multi-million-dollar nuclear submarine\u2014didn\u2019t that prove how dependable he was? Dammit, he\u2019d been brought up to meet his obligations, to stand by his word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I was trying to escape my responsibilities, I\u2019d never have married you.\u201d Ian knew the minute he uttered the words that he\u2019d said the wrong thing.</p><p>Cecilia flew across the room. \u201cI never wanted you to marry me because of Allison! We would\u2019ve been fine....\u201d She faltered and abruptly looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t need you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you didn\u2019t. You still do.\u201d If for no other reason than the health benefits the Navy provided, his wife and daughter had needed him.</p><p>\u201cYou would never have married me if it wasn\u2019t for the pregnancy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot true.\u201d</p><p>She swept the hair away from her face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he burst out. Apparently Cecilia thought she was the only one with regrets. He had his own, and every one of them included her.</p><p>\u201cAllison and I were...\u201d She hesitated, suddenly inarticulate. \u201cWe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison was my daughter, too, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll allow you to tell me what my feelings are. Don\u2019t go putting words in my mouth, or discount the way I felt about her. Just because I couldn\u2019t be here when she was born doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t care. For the love of God, I was under the polar icecap when you went into labor. You weren\u2019t even due until\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re blaming me.\u201d She thrust her hand over her mouth as if to hold back emotion.</p><p>It didn\u2019t do any good to talk. He\u2019d tried, damn it to hell, he\u2019d tried, but it never got him anywhere. He just couldn\u2019t find any middle ground with her.</p><p>Rather than prolong the agony, he stormed out of the apartment. The door banged in his wake, and he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d closed it or Cecilia had slammed it after him.</p><p>He left the building, fury propelling his steps, and got into his car. Feeling the way he did just then, Ian realized he shouldn\u2019t be driving, but he wasn\u2019t about to sit outside this apartment. Not when Cecilia might think he sat there pining for her.</p><p>He revved the engine and threw the transmission into drive. The tires squealed as he sped off, burning rubber. He hadn\u2019t gone more than a quarter mile when he saw the red-and-blue lights of a police car flashing behind him.</p><p>A cop. Damn it all. He eased to a stop at the curb and rolled down his window. By the time the officer reached his vehicle, Ian had removed his military driver\u2019s license from his wallet.</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Morning, sir,\u201d he said, wondering how good an actor he was.</p><p>\u201cIn a bit of a hurry back there, weren\u2019t you?\u201d the policeman asked. He was middle-aged, his posture rigid, his hair worn in a crewcut. Everything about him screamed ex-military, which meant he just might be inclined to cut Ian a little slack.</p><p>\u201cHurry?\u201d Ian repeated and forced himself to relax. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were doing forty in a twenty-mile-an-hour zone.\u201d He glanced at the license and started writing out a ticket, apparently unimpressed by Ian\u2019s military status.</p><p>From the looks of it, Ian wasn\u2019t going to get the opportunity to talk his way out of this one. He quickly calculated what the ticket would cost him, plus the rate hike in his insurance.</p><p>Thanks, Cecilia, he thought bitterly. The price of marriage just kept going up.</p><p>Grace Sherman and Olivia Lockhart had been best friends nearly their entire lives. They\u2019d met in seventh grade, which was when students from both South Ridge Elementary and Mariner\u2019s Glen entered Colchester Junior High. Grace had served as Olivia\u2019s maid-of-honor when she\u2019d married Stanley Lockhart soon after her college graduation and was godmother to her youngest son, James.</p><p>The summer following their high-school graduation, Grace had married Daniel Sherman and they quickly had two daughters. When Kelly, her youngest, turned six, Grace had gone back to school and earned her Bachelor of Library Science degree. Then she\u2019d started working for the Cedar Cove Library, and within ten years had been promoted to head librarian.</p> <p>Even while Olivia was attending a prestigious women\u2019s college in Oregon and Grace was an at-home mother with two small children, they\u2019d remained close. They still were. Because their lives were busy, they\u2019d created routines to sustain their friendship. Lunch together once a month. And every Wednesday night at seven, they met for an aerobics class at the local YMCA.</p><p>Grace waited in the well-lit parking lot for her friend. She hadn\u2019t felt good when she left the house. The sensation was all-encompassing. Physically, she was tired, her weight was up and she didn\u2019t have her period to blame anymore. For years, she\u2019d managed to keep within ten pounds of what she\u2019d weighed in high school, but during the past five, she\u2019d gained an extra fifteen pounds. It had happened despite all her efforts. Somehow the weight had crept on. She was dissatisfied with other aspects of her appearance, too. Her salt-and-pepper hair was badly in need of a cut. On second thought, perhaps she\u2019d live dangerously and let it grow. She was in the mood for a change\u2014although she wasn\u2019t convinced it would make much difference.</p><p>Emotionally, she wasn\u2019t feeling any better. After thirty-five years of marriage, she knew her husband as well as she did herself. Something was troubling Dan, but when she\u2019d gently asked him about it, he\u2019d bristled and they\u2019d had an argument. He\u2019d hurt her feelings and Grace had rushed away without resolving the issue.</p><p>For most of their marriage, Dan had been employed as a logger. When hard times fell on the industry, he\u2019d taken a job with a local tree-trimming service. The work wasn\u2019t as steady as either of them would have liked, but with her income and some inventive budgeting, they managed. There wasn\u2019t any extra for small extravagances, but those had never mattered to Grace. She had her husband, her children, her friends and a decent roof over her head.</p><p>She watched Olivia\u2019s dark-blue sedan pull into the parking lot and saw her climb out, gym bag in hand.</p><p>Grace slid out of her vehicle. \u201cSo, how does it feel to be a celebrity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you, too?\u201d Olivia complained as they walked toward the building. She held open the door for Grace. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing but grief over that stupid article.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled as color instantly flooded her friend\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI let him have a piece of my mind,\u201d Olivia muttered, as they marched past a group of youngsters headed for the swimming pool. Once inside the locker room, they placed their bags on the bench, stripped out of their sweats and changed their shoes.</p><p>One foot braced on the side of the bench, Grace tied her running shoe. \u201cYou met Griffin? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday.\u201d</p><p>Grace raised both eyebrows. She found it interesting that Olivia was skimping on the details. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp? Not one thing,\u201d her friend said. \u201cI just happened to run into Jack at the Safeway and we...chatted a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have the feeling you\u2019re not telling me something?\u201d</p><p>Olivia slipped the sweatband around her forehead. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you?\u201d Grace echoed, following her out of the locker room and into the aerobics area of the gym. Children and adults milled about, and Grace and Olivia had to stop several times to allow others to pass by. \u201cHave you ever noticed that the only time people ask you to trust them is when they probably shouldn\u2019t be trusted?\u201d</p><p>Olivia paused, then started a few warm-up exercises on her own. \u201cI hadn\u2019t, but you\u2019re right.\u201d She propped her leg on the ballet bar and bent her forehead to her knee.</p><p>Grace leaned against the bar, envying her friend\u2019s suppleness. Her own body was far less flexible. \u201cDid you know people have been talking about the article all week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Disregarding her sarcasm, Grace continued, her voice deceptively mild. \u201cActually a lot of the talk has to do with Jack Griffin.\u201d</p><p>Olivia raised her head. \u201cAnything interesting?\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged and adjusted the waistband of her spandex shorts. \u201cOh, a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>Grace was determined not to make this easy. Olivia had never, to her recollection, shown this much interest in any man since her divorce. Grace had felt for some time that her friend should \u201cget back into circulation,\u201d as people called it. Appropriate comment for a librarian, she always thought. \u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p>The question seemed to require a great deal of thought. \u201cNo\u2014forget it.\u201d Then in the next breath, Olivia changed her mind. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m curious. What have you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe moved to Cedar Cove three months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld news,\u201d Olivia muttered. \u201cIf that\u2019s all you have...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the Spokane area.\u201d</p><p>This appeared to be something Olivia didn\u2019t know. \u201cNewspaper background, obviously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, from a paper with ten times the circulation of The Chronicle.\u201d Grace wasn\u2019t a gossip by nature, but she\u2019d been wondering about Jack Griffin since she\u2019d read his first Saturday column. She\u2019d liked what he\u2019d had to say, and it was apparent he approved of Olivia. She\u2019d met him briefly at a Chamber of Commerce meeting shortly after he\u2019d come to Cedar Cove but hadn\u2019t formed an impression one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cWhy does a man give up working for a prestigious newspaper and move across the state to a town the size of Cedar Cove?\u201d she asked Olivia.</p><p>Her friend shrugged. \u201cYour guess is as good as mine. Perhaps he wanted to be closer to his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a son?\u201d No one Grace had spoken to knew that.</p><p>\u201cEric. He lives in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>That was interesting. But before she could comment further, their instructor, Shannon Devlin, entered the room, clapping her hands to gather her students around her.</p><p>\u201cTrust me. There\u2019s more to this career change than meets the eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, trust me,\u201d Grace joked.</p><p>Olivia grinned and placed her hands on her hips as she rotated her waist, making deep bends as Shannon led the class in warm-ups. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging around the mystery section of the library too long,\u201d she whispered as they took their places in front of the floor-to-ceiling mirror.</p><p>Shannon was twenty, if that. A pretty girl with pliant limbs and a body devoid of fat. Grace\u2019s own figure had once been that slim and perfect, she reminded herself\u2014before two children and the onset of menopause.</p><p>The music, impossibly loud, gave her a surge of energy. She had a love/hate relationship with this class. If not for Olivia, she would have dropped out a dozen times. Unfortunately she needed the benefits of all this huffing, puffing and stretching. Despite the muscle pain, she didn\u2019t mind the mat exercises, the sit-ups and such, but she hated Shannon\u2019s little dance routines. Step back, slide left, cross right... Olivia never seemed to have a problem with the complicated patterns; Grace, on the other hand, had trouble living up to her name.</p><p>After fifty minutes of sweating and grumbling under her breath, plus cool-down exercises, they were finished. None too soon, as far as Grace was concerned. Not until they\u2019d showered and changed back into their sweats did Olivia mention Jack again. The fact that she wanted to continue the conversation surprised Grace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you learn anything else about Jack Griffin?\u201d</p><p>Grace had to think.

First Dan and now her best friend, and Grace hadn\u2019t meant to upset either of them.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d she assured her. \u201cI just think you should leave your options open when it comes to Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d And that was all the answer she was willing to give, but Grace had a very strong feeling that the new editor of The Cedar Cove Chronicle was going to bring something new and exciting to Olivia\u2019s life.</p> <p>Three</p><p>Cecilia was working as a hostess at The Captain\u2019s Galley the night she\u2019d met Ian Randall, and she continued to work there five evenings a week. Her father, Bobby Merrick, was one of the bartenders and had gotten her the job.</p><p>Soon after graduating from high school, Cecilia had moved to Cedar Cove at her father\u2019s urging. After a long estrangement, he\u2019d contacted her with promises of making up for lost time. He\u2019d seemed genuine, and because she\u2019d felt cheated out of a father during her childhood, she\u2019d readily agreed. Following her parents\u2019 divorce when she was ten, Cecilia hardly ever saw her father and she welcomed this unexpected opportunity. Refusing to heed her mother\u2019s warnings, she\u2019d packed up her entire life and moved across the country, from New Hampshire to this small waterfront community in Washington. Within three months she knew she\u2019d made a mistake. Her dreams of a college education were simply that. Dreams. Bobby\u2019s idea of setting her up for the future was talking to his boss and getting her a job at the same restaurant where he worked. Being a hostess and cocktail waitress wasn\u2019t how Cecilia wanted to spend the next few decades, but it was all too easy to imagine. Without intending it, she\u2019d let her entire life get sidetracked.</p><p>Now she was about to be divorced, up to her ears in debt and utterly miserable. Her illusions about her father and men in general had been shattered. Bobby wanted to be her friend, but as badly as Cecilia needed a friend, she needed a father more.</p><p>One day, she vowed, she\u2019d find a way to attend college but first she had to figure out how to pay for it. With the legal fees and what it\u2019d cost to bury her daughter, she suspected she\u2019d be at least thirty before she could afford to get an education. Bobby couldn\u2019t help her out financially; he\u2019d made that completely clear.</p><p>In an effort to supplement her income, she was putting in extra hours on weekends, serving drinks in the bar once the dining room closed at ten. Often she wasn\u2019t home until two-thirty in the morning.</p><p>When she showed up for work late Friday afternoon, she knew she was in for a hectic shift. The aircraft carrier, The Carl Vinson, was in town, which meant a crew of 2,500 sailors. The Captain\u2019s Galley served the best seafood in the area and the bar was a popular meeting place.</p><p>It was here that Ian had come for a drink one night last January. He\u2019d had his eye on her, and she\u2019d been watching him just as avidly. Then he\u2014She gave herself a mental shake. Cecilia didn\u2019t want to think about her husband, and tried to push him from her mind. It didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him since he\u2019d charged out of her apartment a week earlier. They hadn\u2019t made any decisions about what to do next. That was typical of him, she thought angrily. He left every decision to her. If they were going ahead with this divorce, then their best option was the Dispute Resolution Center. Not that their dispute could ever be resolved...She sighed in resignation. Obviously, she\u2019d have to make the appointment. Ian\u2019s so-called suggestion that they pretend to be divorced was ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous!</p><p>The bar was already hopping when the restaurant closed. Cecilia collected her tray and joined Beverly and Carla, the two other cocktail waitresses. The lounge was thick with cigarette smoke and the smell of beer hung in the air, trapped by the smoke. The music came from a jukebox and was earsplitting loud. Cecilia had to struggle to hear her customers\u2019 orders.</p><p>One man who drank alone seemed to speak softly in an effort to force her to lean closer. He was older, at least forty, and he sent out all the signals\u2014he was interested in her. He gave her the creeps and Cecilia did her best to ignore him. The way his eyes followed her about the room made her skin crawl.</p><p>By closing time only a few patrons lingered; unfortunately her admirer was one of them. Cecilia\u2019s feet hurt and her eyes smarted from the smoke. She was eager to collect her tips and head home. Just when she thought she was finished for the night, Ian and Andrew Lackey, another sailor, walked into the bar.</p><p>Cecilia tensed, especially when she noticed Ian\u2019s demeanor. It was obvious The Captain\u2019s Galley hadn\u2019t been his first stop. Her husband didn\u2019t hold his liquor well, never had, and generally avoided anything stronger than beer.</p><p>Her attention was on Ian when she should have been keeping closer tabs on the loner whose gaze had been glued to her for the last four hours.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna bite to eat?\u201d The husky male voice spoke from behind her.</p><p>Cecilia whirled around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bart, and you\u2019re Cecilia, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She watched Ian and his friend stroll up to the bar. Her husband seemed to be pretending she wasn\u2019t there. But then, that was his preferred approach to anything awkward or inconvenient, wasn\u2019t it? \u201cActually it\u2019s been a long night,\u201d she answered, her gaze flicking back to Bart. \u201cAnother time.\u201d In your dreams, she added silently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>Ian finally glanced in her direction, and his eyes narrowed when he saw her talking to the other man.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s no big deal. Breakfast, conversation.\u201d Bart continued the pressure. \u201cYou look like you could use a friend and I can be a very good...friend.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia was more concerned about Ian than ditching Bart. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow then, just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Her gaze flew from Bart to Ian, who was scowling heavily. She was afraid he\u2019d cause a scene, which she wanted to avoid, for everyone\u2019s sake.</p><p>Ian leaned toward his friend and whispered, but Andrew adamantly shook his head. Cecilia could see that Ian was looking for trouble and his friend was trying to dissuade him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps another night,\u201d Cecilia said quickly, putting Bart off. That seemed the best way of getting rid of him before Ian did something stupid.</p><p>Her husband stepped away from the bar. \u201cIs he bothering you?\u201d he demanded, his words half-slurred.</p><p>\u201cButt out,\u201d Bart snarled, angry at the interruption. He seemed to think he was making progress with Cecilia. He wasn\u2019t, but Ian didn\u2019t know that and apparently neither did he.</p><p>Andrew tried to stop him, but Ian shook off his hand and advanced a menacing step. He wasn\u2019t about to back down, even if Bart outweighed him by fifty pounds. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t know it, you\u2019re trying to pick up my wife.\u201d</p><p>Bart glanced at Cecilia as if to gauge the truth. She didn\u2019t dare meet his look.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re divorced, remember?\u201d she taunted, reminding her husband that it\u2019d been his idea to pretend they were no longer married.</p><p>\u201cThe hell we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said we should just get on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d Ian sputtered, searching for a satisfactory reply.</p><p>\u201cWhy should you care if I date another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause until a judge says otherwise, you\u2019re legally my wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you married or not?\u201d Bart muttered.</p><p>\u201cMarried!\u201d Ian shouted.</p><p>\u201cSeparated,\u201d Cecilia said.</p><p>Bart reached for his jacket. \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell she will.\u201d Ian started toward Bart, but Andrew stepped between them.</p><p>\u201cAnytime, buddy,\u201d Bart growled.</p><p>\u201cRight now sounds good to me,\u201d Ian said, raising his clenched fists.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Cecilia cried. \u201cBoth of you! I have no intention of going anywhere with either one of you.\u201d She ran toward the back room where her father had conveniently disappeared, supposedly checking inventory.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening out there?\u201d Bobby Merrick asked as if he wasn\u2019t aware of the situation he\u2019d left her to deal with on her own. Ian and Bobby had never gotten along, and Bobby avoided any confrontation between them by making himself scarce.</p><p>Cecilia shook her head. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan\u2019s here, looking for a fight. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Her father stared back, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble here. Tell him to take it outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Cecilia sighed wearily. \u201cI did. And now I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of Ian first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>She retrieved her coat and purse, got her share of the tips and walked toward the front door, hoping she wouldn\u2019t stumble upon her husband slugging it out with the loner. To Cecilia\u2019s surprise, Ian hadn\u2019t left, after all. They stared at each other from opposite sides of the room.</p><p>Beverly was the only other person in the bar, preparing the night\u2019s cash for deposit; she muttered \u201cgood night,\u201d still intent on her task.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closed,\u201d Cecilia told Ian.</p><p>He paid no attention. \u201cWere you actually going to leave with that sleazebag?\u201d</p><p>The contempt in his voice rankled. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a long moment, then turned and stalked out the door.</p><p>Cecilia resisted the urge to hurry after him. Ian was in no condition to drive. She hesitated, arguing with herself. He wouldn\u2019t appreciate her concern, and it might give him the wrong impression. Just a few minutes earlier she\u2019d demanded he stay out of her life. The least she could do was follow her own advice and stay out of his.</p><p>The door opened and she glanced up expectantly, thinking it might be Ian. Instead, it was his friend. Andrew seemed awkward and unsure. She barely knew the other sailor, who\u2019d recently been transferred to Bremerton. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you should know Ian\u2019s going to sea. He\u2019s been transferred to the George Washington\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t make sense to her. The George Washington was an aircraft carrier. Ian was a submariner, a nuclear electronic technician. \u201cHe\u2019ll be away six weeks?\u201d she asked numbly, not understanding the transfer.</p><p>\u201cMore like six months.\u201d</p> <p>Six months? \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he came by tonight. He wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia wasn\u2019t sure what to say.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to cause any trouble.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia swallowed hard. \u201cHe didn\u2019t...not really.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew peered over his shoulder as if he\u2019d heard someone call his name. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. I just wanted to tell you I\u2019m real sorry about your little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-thank you,\u201d she managed to say. But he was already gone. She waited a few moments and decided her peace of mind was worth more than her pride. She had to be sure Ian wasn\u2019t driving. Hurrying outside, she stood on the sidewalk, searching for her husband\u2019s car. He was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>A sense of loss filled her, an emptiness. Ian was going to sea for six months and she hated the thought of it. She didn\u2019t want to feel anything for him, but she did. At any rate, she told herself wryly, he had his wish\u2014with Ian at sea, she couldn\u2019t proceed with the divorce.</p><p>Tired and discouraged, Cecilia strolled toward her own ramshackle car, shoulders hunched against the cold. She could smell the ocean tonight, and a lowlying fog was rolling in from the cove. A car drove slowly past. Looking up, Cecilia saw that it was Ian\u2019s. Thankfully, Andrew was behind the wheel. As she watched, her husband\u2019s gaze connected with hers.</p><p>Cecilia was shocked by the longing she saw in him. It was all she could do to keep herself from calling out. She yearned to wish Ian a safe voyage and see him off without this animosity between them.</p><p>But it was too late. Much too late.</p> <p>Charlotte Jefferson wore her finest dress\u2014Navy dotted Swiss, with long sleeves and a full skirt\u2014on her next visit to Tom Harding at the Cedar Cove Convalescent Center. She\u2019d worked feverishly knitting the lap robe for him, and it showed excellent workmanship, even if she said so herself.</p><p>Tom was sitting in his wheelchair when she breezed into the room. \u201cI told you I\u2019d be back,\u201d she said, smiling warmly, the newspaper tucked under one arm. Her new friend looked well. There was color in his cheeks and his eyes were clear and bright.</p><p>Tom nodded, obviously pleased to see her. His right hand pointed shakily to the empty chair.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, sinking gratefully onto the seat. \u201cI don\u2019t usually dress up in my best except on Sundays, but I just came from the funeral of a friend of my husband\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Tom stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends with the Iversons for years,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a good man. Died of lung cancer. Used to smoke like a chimney.\u201d She shook her head sadly, then crossed her legs and removed her left shoe. \u201cI was on my feet most of the afternoon,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m not as young as I used to be, and Lloyd Iverson\u2019s death really shook me.\u201d Sighing, she looked over at him. \u201cHow was your week?\u201d</p><p>Tom shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAre they treating you well?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded as if to say he had no complaints.</p><p>\u201cHow about the food?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of food,\u201d she said, brightening. \u201cI got the most fabulous recipe for broccoli lasagna at the wake. I just love it when I find a good recipe. Last month we buried Marion Parsons, and a lady from her church brought the most incredible noodle salad made with\u2014and this is the kicker\u2014whipped cream. Spaghetti noodles with a marshmallow and cream dressing. It was out of this world.\u201d It suddenly occurred to her that Tom might not be interested in hearing about the recipe exchange that went on at wakes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you like it here in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll make up a batch of that broccoli lasagna and take half of it over to my daughter. She lives alone now, and I just don\u2019t think she eats enough vegetables. It doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s fifty-two, she\u2019s still my little girl and I worry about her.\u201d</p><p>Tom smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to bring you a piece, too?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Tom shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like broccoli, is that it? You and George Bush. Not George W. I don\u2019t know if he likes broccoli or not.\u201d</p><p>Once more Tom shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBroccoli\u2019s good for the bowels. Now, that\u2019s something we both need to think about, especially at our age.\u201d She laughed outright, wondering how Olivia would react if she could hear her now.</p><p>Shuffling his right foot, Tom laboriously rolled the wheelchair over to his nightstand.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to get something for you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His white head bobbed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s inside the drawer here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His brown eyes were intense, and he indicated that she\u2019d guessed right.</p><p>Charlotte eased open the drawer and found a pen, pad and a small coin purse that closed with a zipper. Years earlier, Clyde had carried a similar one. Thinking Tom might want her to write something down, she took out the pen and paper.</p><p>He frowned and shook his head.</p><p>She reached for the coin purse, instead, and glanced at him again.</p><p>Tom smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to open it?\u201d She realized that he must and carefully unzipped the small leather pouch. Inside was a folded yellow sheet of paper, which she removed. She set aside the coin holder and realized there was something enclosed in the paper. A key.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked, openly curious now.</p><p>Tom sat back; he seemed to be waiting for her to discover the answer on her own.</p><p>Charlotte unfolded the single sheet of paper and saw that it was a receipt for a storage unit right here in Cedar Cove. How he\u2019d arranged that, she couldn\u2019t guess. She\u2019d have to ask Janet Lester.</p><p>Uncertain what she was supposed to do with the key, Charlotte looked questioningly at Tom. \u201cEverything seems to be in order,\u201d she assured him, returning the key and the receipt to the pouch. She was about to place it in the drawer when he stopped her, leaning forward and clasping her forearm with his right hand.</p><p>His eyes pleaded with her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to put it back here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head, breathing hard from his exertion.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to do with it?\u201d</p><p>He looked directly at her purse, which rested on the floor next to her large knitting bag.</p><p>\u201cTake it with me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather I gave it to someone in the office?\u201d Surely that would be more appropriate than for Charlotte to keep it.</p><p>He shook his head, his expression adamant.</p><p>\u201cAll right, but I feel I should tell Janet about this.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your key\u2019s in good hands. I\u2019ll make sure nothing happens to it.\u201d She slipped the pouch inside her purse, then reached for her knitting bag. \u201cI made you a lap robe. You need something to keep your legs warm. There\u2019s a chill in the air these January mornings, isn\u2019t there?\u201d She settled the robe over his legs and stepped back to admire it.</p><p>Tom smiled, and made a shaky gesture to show his appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re most welcome,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes closed briefly and she understood that he was tired. It was time to go. \u201cI\u2019ll be back next Thursday,\u201d she said, gathering her bags.</p><p>He gave a slight nod.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fret about a single thing. Oh, and I\u2019ll bring you a slice of that lasagna.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll spare you.\u201d Tom was probably on a special diet, anyway. \u201cI promise to take good care of this key for you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and patted the lap robe.</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure was all mine. Goodbye until next week.\u201d</p><p>She left his room more quietly than she\u2019d entered it, and immediately sought out the social worker. She didn\u2019t want to take the key without letting someone know.</p><p>Janet was in her office, talking on the phone. When she saw Charlotte, she motioned her in and ended the conversation a minute later.</p><p>\u201cHello, Charlotte, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>She explained about Tom Harding and the key.</p><p>Janet rolled her chair over to the filing cabinet and opened the top drawer. Extracting a file, she laid it on her desk. While she read through the file, Charlotte took a second look at the receipt for the storage unit. She saw that it was a renewal, which had been paid by the state\u2014paid in full for the entire year. Apparently Tom had run out of funds for his care and become a ward of the state. What assets he owned were being stored in the unit and would be sold at the time of his death.</p><p>Janet continued to scan the file. \u201cUnfortunately the information I have here is the bare minimum. Tom suffered a stroke five years ago, but there\u2019s nothing about any family\u2014and next to nothing about his background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to want me to keep the key,\u201d Charlotte said, unsure what she should do.</p><p>\u201cThen I think you should. I know you have it, and so does Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will.\u201d That settled, Charlotte stood. \u201cHe\u2019s a lovely man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is, but just a little mysterious.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had to agree and she admitted to being intrigued.</p><p>Grace Sherman grabbed a carton of milk and placed it in her grocery cart, then headed for the checkout stand. As she wheeled toward the front of the store, she decided to take a short detour and look over the paperback display. Books were her passion\u2014books of all kinds, from classic fiction to mysteries and romances, from bestseller titles to biographies and history and...almost everything. That was why she\u2019d gone into library work. She loved to read and often read late into the night. Her daughters shared her delight in books, although Dan had never been much of a reader.</p><p>As Grace reached the front of the store, she noticed that the lineups were long. She chose one, then got the current copy of People magazine and flipped through that while she waited. The truth came to her as she approached the cashier\u2014she dreaded going home.</p><p>The realization left her breathless. They were low on milk, but it certainly hadn\u2019t been necessary to make a special trip. She could easily have waited a day or two. Since she was here anyway, she\u2019d thrown several packets of pasta into her cart, plus toilet paper and a couple of yogurts...as though to justify being to the supermarket at all. In fact, she\u2019d been delaying the inevitable.</p><p>Dan had been in such a bleak mood lately. There seemed to be problems at work, but that was only a guess because her husband refused to talk to her about anything beyond the mundane. Any other inquiries were met with one-word replies. Television was vastly more interesting than sharing any part of himself with her.</p><p>Grace wanted to discover what was wrong, but he snapped at her whenever she tried. Every night it was the same. Walking into the house after work was like standing in an electrical storm; she never knew when lightning might strike. Because Dan was uncommunicative and morose, she chatted endlessly about this thing and that, in an effort to lighten his mood\u2014and to forestall his outbursts of anger. They always came without warning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dan listened to her remarks, nodded at the appropriate times, even smiled now and again. But he contributed nothing to the conversation. The quieter he was, the harder she tried to draw him out, to no avail. Practically every evening he settled in front of the television and didn\u2019t move until it was time for bed.</p><p>This was no marriage. They might as well be college roommates for all the love and affection they exchanged.</p><p>Their marriage had never fulfilled Grace\u2019s expectations. She\u2019d been eighteen and pregnant with Maryellen when she married Dan. He\u2019d enlisted in the Army and almost immediately been shipped to Vietnam. The two years he\u2019d been away were hell, for him and for her. When he returned, Dan was a different person from the young man who\u2019d left. He\u2019d become bitter and cynical, prone to rages; he\u2019d also experimented with drugs and when she refused to allow them in the house they\u2019d briefly separated.</p><p>For Maryellen\u2019s sake, they\u2019d managed to patch things up long enough for Grace to get pregnant a second time. Later, because of their daughters, Dan and Grace had tried hard to make their marriage work.</p> <p>The war still haunted him and for years Dan used to be awakened by nightmares. He never spoke of his experiences. Those, along with everything else, were hidden away inside his head. Throughout their marriage, Grace had continually hoped things would improve. Once the girls were in school, once she finished her own studies and got the job at the library, once the girls graduated from high school\u2014surely then everything would be better. Year after year of hoping, of looking for signs...</p><p>It wasn\u2019t all bad. There\u2019d been good times, too. When the girls started grade school, Grace had entered Olympic College and later commuted into Seattle to attend the University of Washington. Dan had been wonderfully supportive, working two jobs and helping with all their daughters\u2019 assorted activities.</p><p>Maryellen and Kelly had both been difficult teenagers, but they\u2019d turned into responsible young women. Dan deeply loved his daughters. Grace never questioned his devotion to them, but she seriously doubted he was still in love with her.</p><p>These last few years had been hard on his pride. His career was over, and his job with the tree service wasn\u2019t nearly as satisfying as logging had been. Her salary now paid a larger share of the expenses, and she suspected that bothered him\u2014not that he\u2019d actually said so. But then, they didn\u2019t talk about money, mainly because she avoided any subject that might distress him.</p><p>Although she was half an hour later than usual, Dan didn\u2019t comment when she walked into the kitchen, carrying her groceries.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d she announced unnecessarily as she set the sack on the countertop.</p><p>Dan had already positioned himself in front of the television, watching the local news. His boots were off and his sock-covered feet rested on the footstool that matched his old overstuffed chair.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d have taco salad for dinner. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he answered without enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d His eyes didn\u2019t waver from the television screen.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to ask about mine?\u201d she asked, growing irritated. The least he could do was show some interest in her and their life together, even if it was just a token effort.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d he muttered, his voice impassive.</p><p>\u201cTerrible.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me if you want.\u201d</p><p>The man she\u2019d lived with for thirty-five years couldn\u2019t have cared less. Grace couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Each attempt to draw him out was met with denial and accusation. If she was unhappy, it was her fault, not his\u2014that was his argument the last time she\u2019d tried to talk to him.</p><p>Walking into the living room, Grace reached for the remote control and muted the sound. Sitting down on the footstool, she faced her husband.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded, annoyed that she\u2019d disrupted his news program.</p><p>Grace stared at him. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed as though she\u2019d made a joke. \u201cLove you? We\u2019ve been married for thirty-five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? Of course I love you. I can\u2019t believe you have to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there someone else?\u201d</p><p>He sat back and looked hard at her, then shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo. When\u2019s dinner going to be ready?\u201d</p><p>Grace had another question first. \u201cDo you remember the last time we made love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you keeping track?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fooled. Answering a question with one of his own was a familiar trick of his. \u201cNo, but I can\u2019t remember. Can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you do this.\u201d He shoved the footstool forcefully away and got up, burying his hands in his pants pockets. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have an argument, let\u2019s make it over something worthwhile. I didn\u2019t realize you were so insecure that you need to be told I still love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I need is some affirmation that you want to be in this marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you were so paranoid.\u201d He walked to the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suggested I\u2019m having an affair.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe it, and in fact, there was no real evidence, but she\u2019d felt it might shock him enough to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cSome sign of life,\u201d she cried.</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cDid it ever occur to you that I might be tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo tired to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been a conversationalist. You knew that when you married me. I\u2019m not going to change at this stage of my life. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s bothering you, Grace, but get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair! I\u2019m trying to get you to take some responsibility for what\u2019s happening to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s so unhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want more from our marriage than this.\u201d She motioned with her arms in a futile effort to explain.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI\u2019m giving you everything I have to give.\u201d</p><p>So was she. Dear God, so was she.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t enough, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Her throat thickened with heartache. This was all there was, all there would ever be, and it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>The phone rang and they both jerked their attention toward the kitchen wall. Tears rolled down her cheeks and she brushed them aside as she hurried into the other room.</p><p>\u201cLet the machine get it,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cWhy, so we can talk some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded gruffly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d She reached for the receiver and cleared her throat before she spoke. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, forcing herself to sound calm.</p><p>\u201cMom? Oh, Mom, you\u2019ll never guess what?\u201d Kelly cried. \u201cI just got the news. We\u2019re pregnant!\u201d The joy in her youngest daughter\u2019s voice was as pure and sweet as anything Grace had ever known.</p><p>\u201cPregnant? You\u2019re sure?\u201d Grace felt her tears start again, but these were tears of an altogether different kind. After ten years of marriage, Kelly and Paul were desperate for a child. They\u2019d undergone countless tests and procedures, and Grace had about given up hope that her daughter would ever conceive. She longed for grandchildren and it hadn\u2019t seemed likely. Not with Kelly\u2019s fertility problems and Maryellen divorced. This was incredible news. Fabulous news.</p><p>Dan walked into the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s Kelly,\u201d she said excitedly, putting her hand over the receiver. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Her husband\u2019s eyes lit up and he smiled. It was the first real smile she\u2019d seen from him in months. \u201cDamn, that\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, your father and I are thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Grace handed him the receiver. Kelly had always been especially close to her father, and they chatted for several minutes.</p><p>Dan replaced the receiver and went over to the stove where she\u2019d put the hamburger on to fry for their meal. He slid his arms around her waist from behind and hugged her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And it would. Grace had faith. Hope. And now she had a reason to continue, a reason to look to the future. Her marriage wasn\u2019t everything she wanted, but maybe it was enough. She\u2019d make it enough. She\u2019d shared thirty-five years with Dan. There had been good times and some not so good.</p><p>A grandchild gave her hope for the future.</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive this evening,\u201d Olivia told her mother. The previous time she\u2019d gotten into a car with Charlotte driving, Olivia had sworn it would be the last. Her mother out on the roads was a frightening thing to contemplate. She suspected Charlotte was the type of driver who never had an accident, but caused them.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s my turn, although I have to admit I don\u2019t like driving at night.\u201d</p><p>Olivia removed her black robe and hung it in the small closet inside her chambers. Court was over for the week and her hot Friday-night date was with her mother. In fact, she ate more meals out with Charlotte than anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t mind driving,\u201d Olivia told her.</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you insist.\u201d</p><p>Olivia did insist. The previous driving adventure with her mother had ended up being a narrow escape. Apparently Charlotte had lost the ability to turn her neck in order to look behind her. She adjusted the rearview mirrors left and right and honked before barreling willy-nilly out of her parking space. She\u2019d also confessed that her eyes weren\u2019t what they used to be. It was a quandary. Olivia didn\u2019t want to limit her mother\u2019s independence, but she couldn\u2019t help worrying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a girls\u2019 night out,\u201d Charlotte said, sounding excited at the prospect. \u201cBut I have to be home by eleven. Harry worries if I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p><p>Her mother doted on her cat. \u201cNot a problem. The play starts at eight, so it should be over long before eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we have dinner first?\u201d Charlotte suggested.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Olivia was in the mood to live it up. Her best friend was about to become a grandmother. Her seventy-two-year-old mother had a beau of sorts. Charlotte talked incessantly about her friend Tom at the convalescent center. The only person without something significant happening in her life seemed to be Olivia. She was ready for a change, ready for a risk. She\u2019d hoped to hear from Jack Griffin, but he hadn\u2019t phoned nor had he shown up in court again. He obviously wasn\u2019t interested. Well, she could deal with that.</p><p>They arrived at the Playhouse shortly after seven-thirty. Plays were staged upstairs at the Community Theater, located on Harbor Street, which was the main road through the center of what was commonly referred to as downtown. The old theater still ran movies, but generally second-run features that had appeared earlier at the six-plex on the hill. The Playhouse was above the movie theater in small but cozy quarters. Every time Olivia attended a local production, she was astonished at the talent in a town as small as Cedar Cove. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without assigned seating, Charlotte chose the very front row. No sooner had they settled in than Jack Griffin approached.</p><p>\u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d he asked, looking at the empty space next to Olivia.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d She\u2019d blurted his name before she had a chance to restrain her delight.</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin? Is this Jack Griffin?\u201d Charlotte was immediately on her feet. Before Olivia could even guess what her mother intended, she\u2019d wrapped both arms around Jack and given him one of her enthusiastic hugs.</p> <p>He met Olivia\u2019s gaze over Charlotte\u2019s shoulder. She noted his surprise and amusement at such a vigorous greeting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to meet you,\u201d Charlotte said, sitting down again\u2014one seat over\u2014and patting the empty space beside her. \u201cThat was such a wonderful column you wrote about Olivia. I made sure all my friends read it.\u201d</p><p>Jack arched his brows\u2014as though to suggest her mother might have been impressed but that hadn\u2019t been the case with Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI was so pleased with what you had to say about my daughter. She is a gutsy judge and an innovative thinker, too,\u201d Charlotte continued.</p><p>Olivia was mortified, but she knew better than to say anything, so she smiled blandly and felt the heat radiate from her cheeks.</p> <p>Charlotte had arranged it so Jack was now sitting between the two of them. Olivia hadn\u2019t been quick enough to realize what was happening in order to avoid it. She was interested in spending time with Jack, but she\u2019d prefer to do so without her mother present.</p><p>Soon, Jack and her mother were deeply engrossed in conversation. At one point Jack let out a hoot of laughter and abruptly turned to look at Olivia, still smiling.</p><p>Olivia could only wonder what was so funny; she was fairly sure it had to do with her. What could her mother have told him? No doubt it was something embarrassing from her teen years.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s hilarious,\u201d Jack said a moment later, leaning toward her.</p><p>That was true enough. Olivia merely nodded, and Jack soon turned back to Charlotte for entertainment. Meanwhile, Olivia studied the program. To Kill a Mockingbird was an ambitious project for so small a troupe, but those who\u2019d seen it had raved about the performances. She assumed Jack had come to write a review.</p><p>Olivia happened to be looking idly around the theater when Justine strolled in. She wore black pants with a cropped cashmere sweater in a soft green, her long dark hair hanging loose to the middle of her back. Her arm was entwined with Warren Saget\u2019s and she gazed up at the older man with wide, adoring eyes. Olivia immediately felt her hackles rise. She didn\u2019t like Warren, never had, and hated the fact that her daughter was dating him.</p> <p>Warren had moved to Cedar Cove twenty years ago. He\u2019d bought up large parcels of land and built row upon row of tract houses. The homes had been constructed of the cheapest possible materials and had quickly developed a host of problems. First, the roofs leaked and then the siding developed mold. Basements flooded, walls shifted, ceilings cracked. Lawsuit followed lawsuit.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t recall how it was all settled\u2014her own life was undergoing a series of traumas at the time\u2014but somehow Warren and his company had survived.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only his business practices that distressed Olivia. Everyone knew that Warren had cheated on his wife\u2014correction, wives. He\u2019d flaunted his affairs until both women had filed for divorce and left town. The most recent Mrs. Saget had left five or so years ago, leaving Warren free to go through young women like a kid through a candy store. It hurt Olivia to see her own daughter fall victim to such an unscrupulous man.</p><p>Warren apparently liked his women young. The younger the better. A woman like Justine\u2014tall, classy and beautiful\u2014enhanced his image. She looked good on his arm, and Warren knew it.</p><p>Olivia wondered whose idea it was to see the play. To Kill a Mockingbird wasn\u2019t the sort of entertainment she suspected a man like Warren would choose. The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas seemed more his kind of show.</p><p>Apparently Justine hadn\u2019t noticed Olivia. Or if she had, she\u2019d chosen to ignore the fact that her mother and grandmother were seated in the front of the theater. Justine and Warren sat in the last row, where the shadows were darkest and they couldn\u2019t easily be seen.</p><p>This relationship had worried Olivia from the start and not solely because of Warren\u2019s age and reputation. Over the years, Olivia had observed a pattern. Justine preferred older men and there\u2019d been several, all quite similar to each other in situation and personality. Warren had lasted the longest. Olivia cringed every time she thought of her daughter marrying the likes of Warren Saget. But at twenty-eight, Justine had revealed no desire to marry. Olivia prayed Warren wouldn\u2019t be the one to change her mind.</p><p>Her heart told Olivia that her daughter\u2019s dating habits were linked to that fateful August day in 1986. Justine refused to risk the pain that real closeness could bring. She\u2019d been with her twin brother when he died, and the love she felt for him had turned into agony. Caught up in her own grief, Olivia had failed to recognize the devastating effect his death had had on her daughter.</p> <p>Olivia suspected that, deep down, Justine blamed herself. She\u2019d been at the lake with Jordan and a whole slew of friends, not paying any attention to her twin. He\u2019d been diving off a floating dock, joking and splashing, all of them laughing at their own antics. It\u2019d been a hot lazy afternoon, and the world had seemed a beautiful place. Then within a matter of seconds all their lives were changed. Their capacity for innocent, uncomplicated pleasure was gone forever. Jordan, clowning around with his buddies, dove into the lake and didn\u2019t surface. By the time his friends figured out it wasn\u2019t a joke, it\u2019d been too late. Jordan had broken his neck and drowned.</p><p>Justine had swum out to the dock and sat with Jordan\u2019s lifeless body until the paramedics arrived, but there was no hope. The poor girl hadn\u2019t slept a full night for weeks afterward. She\u2019d been lost and confused, believing she should\u2019ve been able to do something.</p><p>Olivia had her own share of regrets. If she\u2019d been more focused on Justine\u2019s grief, gotten her into counseling, spent time helping her deal with the tragedy...</p><p>But it\u2019d been all Olivia could manage to make it from one day to the next. For the sake of her husband and her two other children, she\u2019d tried to be strong. Each day had been filled with busywork so she wouldn\u2019t have time to think. Pretending had failed miserably. Her marriage had collapsed, and her beautiful daughter had never recovered from the tragedy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to phone you,\u201d Jack said, breaking into Olivia\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>That was encouraging news. Olivia had been brought up to believe that girls shouldn\u2019t phone boys\u2014a bit of social conditioning she\u2019d never shaken off. She\u2019d dated since the divorce, but not much. Friends had attempted to matchmake, without notable success.</p><p>Jack appeared to be waiting for a response from her, some indication that she would have welcomed his call.</p><p>\u201cI wish you had.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it, and it was true. She liked Jack Griffin and had thoroughly enjoyed their impromptu meeting and the talk that followed.</p><p>Jack stared at her as though he wasn\u2019t sure he should believe her. He seemed about to say something when Bob Beldon stepped onto the middle of the compact stage. Bob and his wife, Peggy, ran Thyme and Tide, a local bed-and-breakfast. Bob was actively involved in the theater group.</p><p>Once he had everyone\u2019s attention, Bob made several safety announcements regarding the fire codes and pointed out the exits. When he\u2019d finished, he introduced the play and the actors. Before he left the stage, he looked at Jack Griffin and Olivia\u2014and then Bob did the oddest thing. He winked at Jack.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Olivia asked him.</p><p>\u201cBob\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew him before moving to Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>He nodded absently as he watched the actors take their places on stage. \u201cIt was Bob\u2019s way of encouraging me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d Olivia pressed.</p><p>Jack squared his shoulders. \u201cTo ask you to dinner.\u201d He glanced in her direction. \u201cAre you game?\u201d</p><p>Are you game? was certainly an inventive invitation.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask her yet?\u201d Charlotte bent forward in order to get a better look at them both.</p><p>\u201cI just did,\u201d Jack answered.</p><p>\u201cAsk her what?\u201d Someone Olivia didn\u2019t recognize called out from two rows back.</p><p>Mortified, Olivia slid down in her chair and hunched her shoulders.</p><p>Jack slid down, too. \u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Well, why not? She\u2019d already admitted that she was anxious to hear from Jack. Now he\u2019d taken the next step. A dinner date.</p><p>She intended to have a very good time.</p><p>Cecilia woke Saturday morning feeling more than a little depressed. She hadn\u2019t heard from Ian. She\u2019d deluded herself, thinking he\u2019d call. He might already be out to sea; she wasn\u2019t sure whether the George Washington had left port, but then how would she know? She got her information from rumor and an occasional issue of The Chronicle. Nor had Ian mentioned being transferred from the submarine to the aircraft carrier. Apparently there was a lot he hadn\u2019t told her.</p><p>Cecilia wished now that she\u2019d made friends with other Navy wives. She\u2019d tried early on, but had felt like an intruder. The women had already formed cliques and she was an outsider. Between her job and the pregnancy, she didn\u2019t have the time or emotional reserves to socialize with them. She had declined the few invitations she\u2019d received.</p><p>When Allison was born, no one had come to the hospital and after her daughter\u2019s death, Cecilia had rejected all attempts\u2014by the other wives, by Ian\u2019s family in Georgia, by nurses and a Navy chaplain\u2014to help her cope with the loss. As far as she was concerned, it was too little, too late. Her father hated anything to do with death and dying and avoided her entirely. Other than giving her the sympathy card, all he\u2019d done was pat her on the back, mumbling a clich\u00e9d condolence or two.</p><p>And Ian...wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>It did no good to brood about Ian, the pending divorce and past hurts, so Cecilia showered and changed into a clean pair of jeans and a worn, comfortable sweatshirt. As always, Saturday was reserved for errands, but today she lacked the energy for it. Once she got to the grocery, her sole purchase was a big bouquet of flowers.</p><p>The cemetery was on the outskirts of town. A dense fog had rolled in; it was impossible to see across the street, let alone to the other side of the cove and the naval shipyard. Cecilia had purposely chosen this burial site because it overlooked the naval base. Maybe that didn\u2019t make sense, but she\u2019d wanted their daughter to be close to her father, and this was the only way Cecilia knew to make that happen.</p><p>The lawn was spongy and damp, and her feet sank into the earth as she walked toward the grave. She squatted down and brushed a few dead leaves away from the small, flat headstone. The vase was too narrow to hold all the flowers, so she sorted through and removed the prettiest ones and arranged those inside. When she\u2019d finished, she divided the remaining flowers among the other graves in the row. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing, she found Ian several feet back, watching her.</p><p>Neither spoke. He wore his thick Navy coat, with his white sailor\u2019s cap. His hands were buried in his coat pockets, arms pressed against his sides.</p><p>\u201cI saw you leave the grocery store,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou followed me here?\u201d She didn\u2019t like the idea of that.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a habit, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. I just happened to see you and wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia thrust her own hands into her pockets, waiting, unsure what to say.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if this was where you were heading,\u201d Ian continued, \u201cand I was right.\u201d He paused, shrugging. \u201cI thought we could talk.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d The last time she\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d been drinking and argumentative.</p><p>Ian sighed, glancing past her, past the row of graves. \u201cI want to apologize for showing up at the restaurant the other night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAndrew told me you\u2019re leaving on the George Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, or explain the transfer.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get assigned to the carrier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d know the answer to that if you hadn\u2019t been in such a hurry to file for divorce,\u201d he said with unconcealed bitterness.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t\u2014can\u2019t\u2014even talk without snarling at each other.\u201d Then and now. It hurt so badly to be standing on one side of their daughter\u2019s grave while he stood on the other.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m in the Navy\u2014that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. The reasons were unimportant; he didn\u2019t owe her an explanation. Defensiveness had become an automatic response, a means of keeping people at a distance. Especially him...</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cWhy is it so hard to talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t he already know? What else could she say?</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m sorry about the other night. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d He turned away, his movement abrupt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving soon?\u201d she called after him, not wanting him to walk off just yet.</p><p>He turned back to face her and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know about the transfer.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at their daughter\u2019s grave. \u201cI requested it. If I\u2019d been assigned to the carrier when Allison was born, I could\u2019ve been airlifted home. To be with you.... It\u2019s a moot point now, but I didn\u2019t want to risk anything like that ever again.\u201d</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t known such a transfer was possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be away for six months,\u201d he told her.</p><p>It sounded longer than a lifetime. Her reaction must have shown on her face.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re worried about your divorce.\u201d</p><p>He always referred to it like that, emphasizing whose decision it had been. \u201cThe delay doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money for attorney\u2019s fees, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to take it to the Dispute Resolution Center?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but with you at sea, it\u2019d be a waste of time, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d She could talk to an impartial third party, but without Ian available, they wouldn\u2019t be able to resolve anything.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still legally married then\u2014right?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia guessed this was his way of telling her he regretted last week\u2019s suggestion about pretending they were divorced.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry that I\u2019ll be dating anyone else.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d read him wrong. \u201cThat\u2019s what you were saying, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help recalling his reaction to the man in the bar.</p><p>He looked at her blankly. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m glad to hear it. No man likes to think of his wife with someone else, regardless of the situation.\u201d</p><p>Now Cecilia was confused. \u201cExactly what are you saying? Do you want us to be married? Or do you just want me to remember that I\u2019m still legally bound to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to keep in mind that we\u2019re stuck together\u2014legally and financially\u2014until we can sort this mess out, all right?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia nodded, crossing her arms. She had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to like his reasoning.</p><p>\u201cThe last time I was away...\u201d He paused and glanced toward Allison\u2019s gravestone. \u201cYou ran up the credit cards. While we\u2019re still married, I\u2019m legally responsible for those bills, so I\u2019d appreciate it if you used some discretion.\u201d</p><p>It would have hurt less if he\u2019d punched her.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re worried about me spending money while you\u2019re at sea?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d say such a thing. \u201cEvery penny I spent, every single penny that went on those charge cards, was so I could bury Allison.\u201d Cecilia started to shake, first with anger, then with outrage. How dared he? How dared he! If she\u2019d needed a reminder of why she could no longer stay in this marriage, he\u2019d certainly given it to her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d she said in a deadened voice, consciously echoing his earlier words.</p><p>Ian shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I mentioned that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him. Her lack of response should be answer enough.</p><p>\u201cYou do this every time,\u201d he said, sounding exasperated. \u201cI try to talk to you, get things into the open and you clam up on me like I\u2019m not even here.\u201d</p><p>Her arms remained buried deep in her pockets, her head down. \u201cEvery penny I charged was so I could bury our daughter,\u201d she repeated dully. \u201cAnd the three-hundred-dollar phone bill...I know it upset you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she could no longer control her voice\u2014or her emotions.</p><p>\u201cBut that was for me!\u201d she cried, shouting the words at him, hurling them in her anger and pain. \u201cSo there wouldn\u2019t be two funerals that day instead of one. I\u2019m sorry, Ian, for being so weak, but I\u2019m not like you. I needed my mother...I needed to talk to someone. My dad couldn\u2019t deal with it and you weren\u2019t here. My mother...\u201d Unwilling to have him witness her tears, she whirled around and started searching frantically through her purse.</p><p>\u201cCecilia?\u201d</p><p>She found what she was looking for and tore open the small plastic holder. \u201cHere,\u201d she choked, taking out the VISA card and throwing it at him. The card landed on the wet green grass. \u201cTake it! I don\u2019t want it....\u201d</p><p>He hesitated before picking it up. \u201cYou might need it for emergencies.\u201d</p><p>As though the death of their daughter hadn\u2019t been one.</p><p>She shook her head vehemently. She\u2019d rot in hell before she\u2019d use any credit card with his name on it again. She\u2019d get one with her own name. Her maiden name.</p><p>Ian examined the card, and ran his thumb over the raised letters that spelled out Cecilia Randall.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to get your credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have it now,\u201d she returned flippantly, refusing to look at him.</p><p>Ian said nothing. A long moment passed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cecilia,\u201d he finally whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat for this time?\u201d</p><p>There was another pause. \u201cI\u2019m going away for six months,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI wish we\u2019d been able to settle this divorce business before I left, but...\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been over this too many times already.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to leave without bad feelings between us. I know you\u2019d rather not be married to me anymore, but we can\u2019t do anything about that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d she asked, deliberately sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Cecilia, would you listen to us? Is this what you want? Is this how you want things to be? I don\u2019t. I followed you here because I thought...I hoped there\u2019d be a chance for us to end this on a friendly note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorces aren\u2019t friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but does that give you any pleasure?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t. She knew why he\u2019d come. Ian would leave for sea in a few days, and when he left he wanted to go without a huge knot in his gut over her.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Ian,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHave a good tour.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, as though he wasn\u2019t sure he should trust her. \u201cDo you mean it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight, I never did. Go with a clear conscience. When you get back, we\u2019ll settle all the legal stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His relief was evident and his eyes softened as he turned away. Cecilia watched him disappear into the fog, watched until she could no longer see his dark shape.</p><p>She closed her eyes. She pictured how their parting might have been if Allison had lived. She\u2019d be standing on the pier with all the other Navy wives and Ian would kiss her goodbye, kiss Allison and then her again, one last time. Then he\u2019d run toward the aircraft carrier and she\u2019d hold the baby in her arms, raise Allison\u2019s tiny arm so she could send her daddy off with a wave. Instead, they bade each other farewell standing over their daughter\u2019s grave.</p><p>Justine had avoided her mother all weekend, and with good reason. The minute they were together, Olivia would start to criticize Warren. Not openly, but she\u2019d insinuate things. For instance, she\u2019d mention some piece of gossip she\u2019d supposedly heard about one of his ex-wives. Or she\u2019d refer to problems with one or other of the homes his company constructed.</p><p>In Justine\u2019s opinion, the fact that she was seeing Warren was none of her mother\u2019s business. Okay, he was a few years older. And she\u2019d concede that his reputation wasn\u2019t the greatest. But there were things about Warren that her mother and most other people didn\u2019t know and never would. Warren trusted her and his confidence meant a great deal to her.</p><p>The second reason Justine had been avoiding her mother had to do with her brother James. A year earlier, without warning, he\u2019d joined the Navy and as a result, was away from home for the first time. He missed his family, and their mother fretted about him. Now her younger brother had made another life-altering decision and had left it to Justine to announce to their family.</p><p>\u201cTell her for me,\u201d he\u2019d pleaded, and because she loved him she\u2019d foolishly agreed.</p><p>Now a confrontation was inevitable. Monday morning, she\u2019d half decided to call her grandmother and let Charlotte deliver the news. She went as far as picking up the phone and actually dialing the number. At the first ring, she\u2019d replaced the receiver, berating herself as a coward.</p><p>All afternoon, she\u2019d had difficulty concentrating on loan applications and staff meetings\u2014she was the manager of the Cedar Cove branch of First National Bank and had plenty of responsibilities to occupy her. Justine sighed; she knew she had to tell her mother in person and as soon as possible.</p><p>After work, she drove straight from the bank to the family home at 16 Lighthouse Road. She\u2019d lived here until she left for college ten years ago; she\u2019d returned for short periods in the intervening years. It was home in a way no other place had ever been. Every time she took the curve in the road and came upon it, Justine experienced a sensation that had been impossible to reproduce anywhere she\u2019d lived since. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She parked out front. Her mother must have been looking out the window when she drove up, because she opened the door as Justine climbed the steps to the porch.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Olivia said, holding out her arms for a hug. \u201cThis is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>Justine forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>Justine could never figure out why her mother insisted on feeding her. It was the same with her grandmother. A maternal need to nurture, she supposed. Not that she needed nurturing anymore. Well, not that kind. \u201cGreat,\u201d she said, without enthusiasm. Her stomach was in knots already.</p><p>Olivia took a good look at her. \u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d</p><p>Radar. Justine swore her mother had radar.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a pot of tea?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Her mother froze. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant, aren\u2019t you? Dear God, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to marry Warren!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMother, just make the tea and no, I\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Her relief couldn\u2019t have been more evident. Did she even realize how insulting her reaction was?</p><p>Olivia moved into the kitchen and Justine followed.</p><p>\u201cThat was rude of me, honey. Forgive me,\u201d her mother said, putting the kettle on the burner. She sighed. \u201cYou know the way I feel about Warren.\u201d</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t need to be reminded.</p><p>\u201cBut you seem to enjoy his company and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p> <p>Justine didn\u2019t respond to her mother\u2019s halfhearted apology. What was the point? Yes, she liked Warren, but she wasn\u2019t blind to his faults, either. The most appealing thing about him was his age. Justine liked older men. They were settled, confident and, for the most part, secure. She didn\u2019t intend on having children herself and was looking for a mature relationship. She found most men her own age childish and irresponsible.</p><p>Olivia poured the tea and carried two cups to the dining-room table. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said when they\u2019d both sat down. \u201cIf you\u2019re not pregnant, then what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Justine ignored the question and doctored her tea. \u201cI heard from James last week.\u201d</p><p>Her mother stared at her blankly. \u201cWhat does James have to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounded good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy,\u201d she elaborated.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a new girlfriend?\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t believe her mother hadn\u2019t made the connection. \u201cNot...exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seeing the same girl as before? Selina? I can\u2019t recall her surname at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Every time James mentions her, they\u2019re fighting over one thing or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting along just fine at the moment,\u201d Justine said, struggling not to laugh outright. Her mother appeared to be completely dense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, Mother?\u201d Justine pressed.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d Olivia hesitated. \u201cAre you trying to tell me that James and Selina are engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here to tell you they\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Olivia came out of her chair and just as quickly sat down again. \u201cMarried? Without letting me know? Without a word until the deed is done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames was afraid of how you\u2019d react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be a lot more afraid of what I\u2019m going to say now,\u201d Olivia muttered grimly. \u201cWhy would he think such a thing? What about Selina\u2019s family? Was it as much of a shock to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelina\u2019s father insisted they be married by a priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames isn\u2019t Catholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s converting.\u201d Justine could see from the bewilderment in her mother\u2019s eyes that she found it difficult to take in the news. The son she\u2019d raised Protestant had converted to Catholicism overnight.</p><p>\u201cHe must love her very much,\u201d Olivia responded thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo in other words, my son and this young woman I\u2019ve never met were married in a Catholic ceremony without telling anyone from our family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Justine concurred.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Justine held her breath for an instant. \u201cJames wanted you and Dad there, but he was afraid you might disapprove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of heaven, why? Because Selina\u2019s Hispanic? James knows us better than that.\u201d</p><p>Justine shrugged. She disagreed with what her brother had done, but it was too late to worry about that.</p><p>\u201cWhen will I meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, there\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>Olivia set the cup back into the saucer.</p><p>\u201cSelina\u2019s pregnant, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Finally, Mom. It took you long enough. \u201cI talked to Selina myself,\u201d Justine said cheerfully. \u201cShe sounds delightful. James is crazy about her and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to make him a good wife.\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t look nearly as certain. \u201cHow far along?\u201d</p><p>This was the hard part. \u201cShe\u2019s due in four months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour months,\u201d her mother echoed. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a grandmother in four months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems that way.\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t say anything for several moments, then her eyes glistened and Justine could tell she was struggling not to cry.</p><p>\u201cMom, does being a grandmother bother you so much?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head and dabbed at her eyes with the napkin. \u201cOh, no...I just wish my son had the courage to tell me himself.\u201d</p><p>Justine hugged her close. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting to hear from you now. Do you want me to dial the phone for you?\u201d</p><p>Her mother nodded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Cecilia arrived for work at four, an hour earlier than she was scheduled to start. The bar at The Captain\u2019s Galley was already getting crowded. She slipped onto a padded stool, hoping for an opportunity to speak to her father.</p><p>\u201cHow you doin\u2019, kiddo?\u201d Bobby Merrick asked from the other side of the counter. \u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia hated it when he treated her like a customer. \u201cOkay, how about a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want anything stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d In some respects, her father had never grown up, still dressing and acting like he had as a young man. He had shoulder-length graying hair, and his wardrobe consisted of wildly printed shirts that he wore with jeans. While that didn\u2019t bother Cecilia, there were times she wanted and needed him to be a father. This afternoon was one of those times.</p><p>He brought her a mug of stale black coffee, waited on someone else, then drifted back to visit with her. \u201cHeard from your mother lately?\u201d he asked.</p><p>After her parents\u2019 divorce, Bobby\u2014which he insisted Cecilia call him\u2014had left New Jersey and moved first to New Mexico, then Arizona and had gradually drifted north to Washington State.</p><p>\u201cShe phoned this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s well?\u201d To the best of her knowledge, her parents hadn\u2019t spoken to or seen each other in years, until last May, when her mother flew out for Cecilia\u2019s wedding. Now all of a sudden Bobby was asking about her.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d he said, leaning against the bar. \u201cShe\u2019s one hell of a woman.\u201d</p><p>That being the case, Cecilia wondered why he\u2019d abandoned them both, but she didn\u2019t want to bring up any unpleasantness. She understood her father. He couldn\u2019t tolerate conflict of any kind. He wanted people to love each other and get along, as he\u2019d frequently explained to Cecilia. He couldn\u2019t function if anyone was upset with him; he even disliked being around other people\u2019s arguments. When a situation became too intense for him, he simply moved on.</p><p>He\u2019d asked about her mother, but he hadn\u2019t sought her out, hadn\u2019t called or written her in years. That made sense. He didn\u2019t want to hear about difficulties or disappointments\u2014especially if he\u2019d caused them. When Allison Marie died, he\u2019d stayed away, emotionally and physically. He was incapable of giving Cecilia the support she\u2019d needed so badly; he didn\u2019t have it in him. It\u2019d taken her time to reach this conclusion. She could be angry with him, perhaps should have been, but it wouldn\u2019t have done any good. Bobby was Bobby, and she either had to accept him or do without a father, lame as he was in that role.</p><p>\u201cI was out at Olympic College this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I signed up for an algebra class and for English.\u201d It was the 101-level, basic stuff, but she had to start somewhere. For the first time in a very long while, she was looking toward the future instead of dwelling on the past.</p><p>\u201cAlgebra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always good with numbers.\u201d Math was something she enjoyed and she\u2019d done well at it in high school. She liked the sense of order mathematics offered her. Everything fell neatly into place, and problems all had solutions. Perhaps that was what appealed to her most.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to use algebra?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia didn\u2019t know that yet, but this was more a refresher course than anything that would lead to a career. \u201cIt\u2019s important that I know how to solve for x,\u201d she said, just for fun. \u201cThat\u2019s how I can unlock the secrets of the universe. Like Einstein, you know. It all starts with x.\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>It was a joke, and he\u2019d taken her seriously. \u201cSure. Well, sort of.\u201d Clearly he wouldn\u2019t have been any help with high-school math if he\u2019d been around. \u201cWhat do you think about me taking these classes?\u201d she asked, seeking his encouragement.</p><p>His returning look was blank. \u201cHey, that\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>Cool?</p><p>She\u2019d done it again. Once more she\u2019d set herself up for disappointment. She should\u2019ve known Bobby\u2019s response would be inadequate at best.</p><p>He waited on a customer, and Cecilia slipped off the stool, ready to start her shift at the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d Bobby called after her.</p><p>She nodded. This was about as deep as any conversation went with him. The man just didn\u2019t get it, and nothing she said or did was going to change that.</p><p>Before long, the restaurant started to fill up. Escorting customers to their tables, answering the phone and manning the cash register kept her busy. She preferred it that way. It was when she had time on her hands that her thoughts automatically drifted to Ian. The George Washington had pulled out of Cedar Cove two days earlier. She\u2019d watched it on the evening news, which had shown the massive aircraft carrier gliding through the protected waters of the cove.</p><p>Cecilia had sat intently in front of the television. She couldn\u2019t have stayed away even if she\u2019d wanted to. Ian was gone. Deployed for six months. She wondered if he\u2019d write. She could go to the library and e-mail him herself, but she wasn\u2019t convinced she should. And yet, that was exactly what she longed to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dammit, everything was so complicated! She didn\u2019t understand her own feelings, and certainly not his. All these contradictory emotions\u2014anger and yearning and regret. Well, she had six months to think about the divorce and how she should proceed. Ian had time to think, too. His leaving was good for them both, she told herself. Still, she had to admit she hated the idea of not seeing or talking to him for half a year.</p><p>Ever since the news broadcast, Cecilia had thought about what she should\u2019ve said the day they met at the cemetery. She was sorry she\u2019d been so quick to take offense and realized Ian hadn\u2019t been trying to upset her when he asked about the credit card. He\u2019d been clumsy. It occurred to her later that he was no more skilled at expressing his real feelings than she was. She wished she\u2019d hugged him before they parted. It would have felt good to have his arms around her again.</p><p>Cecilia was getting ready to leave for the night when her father came looking for her.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about Ian?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cHear what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he was on the George Washington, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia frowned in confusion. \u201cYou mean the carrier\u2019s returning to Bremerton?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it sounds. I heard two sailors talking, and they said there\u2019s something wrong with the navigational gear.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia knew she shouldn\u2019t be pleased, shouldn\u2019t listen to gossip, either. She\u2019d heard rumors such as this before, and they hadn\u2019t been true.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask them yourself,\u201d Bobby said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cI think I will.\u201d She entered the bar, which by this time was thick with cigarette smoke. Two sailors sat at the counter, nursing mugs of beer.</p><p>Cecilia walked over to them. Both men turned to her, smiling in welcome.</p><p>\u201cBobby here just told me you have some information about the George Washington,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The heavier of the two nodded. \u201cJoin us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, I\u2019m on my way home. Can you tell me what you know?\u201d</p><p>The two shared a look of disappointment. \u201cI got a buddy on the George Washington,\u201d the first one said, \u201cand he e-mailed me that they\u2019re having some technical problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s coming back?\u201d Eagerness crept into her voice.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. He thinks so, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t sure it\u2019s returning to port. Won\u2019t know for a day or two. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s on board,\u201d she said quickly.</p> <p>Both men looked at her left hand, where she continued to wear the plain gold ring.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably hear from him soon,\u201d the first sailor said.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d the second added.</p><p>Even though Cecilia knew he was right, she couldn\u2019t help feeling hopeful. Ian might be back\u2014but only God and the Navy knew for how long.</p><p>The phone rang just as Olivia was putting the finishing touches on her makeup for her dinner date with Jack Griffin. She glanced at her watch; she still had fifteen minutes before he was due to pick her up.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said cheerfully, half expecting it to be her mother. Charlotte had fallen completely under Jack\u2019s spell and had been singing his praises ever since they\u2019d met last Friday night.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Stan.\u201d</p><p>Her ex-husband always did have a no-nonsense way about him. He got directly to the point. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard from James?\u201d</p><p>Olivia had spoken to her son and his wife the afternoon Justine had delivered their news. It had been an emotional conversation, filled with congratulations and with tears, on her part and Selina\u2019s. She\u2019d called again after her head had cleared, asking all the questions she\u2019d forgotten the first time. \u201cI spoke to him twice last week,\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cThen you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s married and about to be a father? Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about James converting to Catholicism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him yourself.\u201d She paused, wondering why he\u2019d brought up that particular aspect of their son\u2019s news. \u201cYou\u2019re not upset about it, are you?\u201d Olivia would be astonished if he was. Stan had never been too concerned with religion; he didn\u2019t object when she attended worship services or brought the children, but it wasn\u2019t something that interested him. Sunday mornings were for golf games, in his view.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHe sounds happy, don\u2019t you think? When did you speak to him?\u201d</p><p>Stan hesitated. \u201cJust a few minutes ago. He seemed to be in a rush so I figured I\u2019d get the story from you.\u201d</p><p>Her ex-husband apparently believed she knew more than she did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to tell you. Our son is married and we\u2019re both about to become grandparents for the first time.\u201d</p><p>Stan chuckled, sounding slightly chagrined. \u201cI was beginning to doubt that was ever going to happen.\u201d</p><p>The tension left her and she smiled. The circumstances weren\u2019t what she would have preferred, but she was absolutely delighted at the prospect of a grandchild.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to spoil that baby rotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly plan to,\u201d she said. But Stan was the indulgent one, and they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cI wish James had been a bit more forthcoming with the details,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Olivia concurred. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to fly down once the baby\u2019s born and meet Selina and her family and welcome her to ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. I cut a five-hundred-dollar check as a wedding gift.\u201d</p><p>Stan had always been excessively generous and she said so. \u201cI sent flowers,\u201d she added ruefully. \u201cI\u2019ll bring a real wedding gift when I visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the first one of the kids to marry\u2014and he\u2019s expecting a baby. It was the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell chimed and Olivia was surprised to realize they\u2019d been talking for fifteen minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s my dinner date,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating?\u201d There was no jealousy in the question, just curiosity.</p><p>Olivia laughed softly. \u201cDon\u2019t sound so shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Who\u2019s the lucky fellow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin. He\u2019s new in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep him waiting, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Stan. It was good to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Olivia, and listen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said, eager to get off the phone.</p><p>\u201cHave a good time. You deserve a decent man in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, and replaced the receiver. She glanced down at the phone, overwhelmed by an unexpected rush of regret. They\u2019d had a good marriage once.... The divorce had been final years ago, but she\u2019d never stopped loving Stan. They\u2019d had their problems\u2014every marriage did\u2014only she\u2019d believed that the bond between them was strong enough to survive a crisis. Unfortunately she\u2019d been wrong. Still, she\u2019d always feel connected to him; they shared children and a history, and nothing could change that.</p><p>She hurried to answer the door. Jack stood there, looking the same way he did every time she saw him. He wore a raincoat, black slacks and a blue shirt with the top two buttons left unfastened. She was beginning to wonder if he owned more than one set of clothes.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, his eyes sweeping over her. \u201cYou look fabulous. Wow.\u201d</p><p>Assuming something formal, Olivia had gone to a lot of trouble. The navy-blue wool dress was new; the straight skirt was a flattering mid-calf length, and the bodice, decorated with a row of gold buttons, was formfitting. She purposely wore heels and dark hosiery, contrasting the outfit with the pearls her father had bought in Japan fifty years ago.</p><p>\u201cAm I overdressed?\u201d She asked the obvious. They hadn\u2019t discussed where they\u2019d be dining.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m underdressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Where are we going for dinner?\u201d She should have asked much sooner.</p><p>Looking embarassed, he told her, \u201cI was thinking about the Taco Shack.\u201d</p><p>The restaurant, on the highway outside town, was a roadhouse of sorts, where patrons ordered at the counter and served themselves. The food was some of the best in the area; it was also fast and cheap. The salsa was freshly made every day and known all over the county.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change,\u201d Olivia offered quickly, and left the room before Jack could protest. So much for a hot date. She\u2019d been thinking they\u2019d linger over wine and candlelight, and he\u2019d envisioned tacos and margaritas. Fortunately she was a flexible person.</p><p>When she returned, Olivia had changed into blue-green plaid wool slacks and a matching green turtleneck sweater. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d she said, hoping to put him at ease.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the Taco Shack,\u201d she assured him, and it was the truth. She should\u2019ve known better than to expect fine French dining. Jack was a taco kind of guy.</p><p>He looked vastly relieved as he led the way to his vehicle. She could tell he\u2019d made an effort to clean off the front seat of his car; he\u2019d tossed everything in the back, which was littered with wadded-up bags from fast-food establishments, old newspapers, books and a variety of other junk she didn\u2019t get a chance to see.</p><p>Jack seemed oblivious to it all. By nature, Olivia was neat and orderly. One look at his Ford Taurus told her Jack Griffin was her exact opposite.</p><p>Olivia had to fumble with her seat belt before she managed to secure it. It was obvious he didn\u2019t often have anyone riding with him.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had the stir-fried jalape\u00f1os at the Shack?\u201d he asked as they headed out of town.</p><p>\u201cYou can stir-fry them?\u201d Olivia asked, thinking that sounded more like Chinese cooking than Mexican.</p><p>\u201cSure. Just until the skins start to blister. Then they squeeze lime juice over top, sprinkle on seasoned salt\u2014and serve them with plenty of water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou eat whole jalape\u00f1os?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Olivia enjoyed a bit of spice now and then, but she wasn\u2019t interested in experiencing pain as part of her meal. \u201cFood isn\u2019t supposed to hurt.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cYou have a sense of humor. I knew there was a reason I liked you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia liked him, too.</p><p>He pulled into the gravel parking lot outside the Taco Shack and hurried around to help her out. Not until he slammed the car door did she notice that it was dented and didn\u2019t close properly.</p><p>Ever the gentleman, he held the door to the roadhouse for her. They walked up to the counter, and stood in line; the place was deservedly popular. Olivia studied the menu, hand-printed on a large board suspended from the ceiling. She ordered the combination plate, which included a cheese enchilada and a bean burrito, and iced tea. Jack ordered something she\u2019d never heard of, plus a side of the stir-fried jalape\u00f1os. That suggested he wasn\u2019t planning to kiss her\u2014definitely a disappointment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She found them a seat by the window, vacated by another couple barely a minute before. When she climbed over the bench of the red-painted picnic table, Olivia was grateful she\u2019d changed out of her dress. She hadn\u2019t been here in ages and had forgotten just how rustic it was. The window was decorated with what resembled red Christmas lights, but on closer examination, she saw they were shiny plastic peppers. She found that an amusing detail.</p><p>Jack brought napkins and plastic forks to the table and a large container of fresh salsa. When their order was ready, he collected both plates, then went back for their drinks. The food smelled delicious and she closed her eyes and breathed in the scent of Jack\u2019s peppers and the mixture of salsa and coriander.</p><p>They talked comfortably about a variety of topics: town politics, the paper, the play they\u2019d both seen. She felt as though she\u2019d known him for years. She wouldn\u2019t have said he was her type, but she was beginning to believe she didn\u2019t have one. Stan was an engineer, and like her, a highly organized person.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention my son recently got married?\u201d she said casually.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jack grinned widely. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s about to make me a grandmother.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an engaging grin. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful grandmother I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Her ego thanked him. \u201cBoth the marriage and the pregnancy came as a surprise, but I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Well, she did...a little. \u201cJames sounded happy and although I haven\u2019t met his wife, she seems very nice.\u201d Olivia had her fears, but she wouldn\u2019t second-guess her son and his decisions. This was his life, not hers.</p><p>\u201cStan and I were on the phone, discussing the prospect of becoming grandparents when you arrived. That\u2019s why it took me so long to answer the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must have a good relationship with your ex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish we\u2019d gotten along this well while we were married,\u201d she joked. \u201cNow his second wife\u2019s getting the benefit of all my training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStan\u2019s remarried?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded.</p><p>Jack studied his dinner for a moment, then said, \u201cBecause of the treatments Eric underwent for the cancer, he\u2019ll never father children.\u201d</p><p>Which meant there was no possibility of Jack\u2019s ever being a grandfather, Olivia realized. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need to be.\u201d It seemed he wanted to change the subject. \u201cDo you speak to Stan often?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly in matters having to do with the children,\u201d she told him. \u201cThey\u2019re both adults now, so there isn\u2019t much reason for phone calls and so forth. I suppose we\u2019ll be in touch a little more often once James\u2019s baby is born. What about you and your ex?\u201d</p><p>Jack tore his paper napkin in half, then looked horrified by what he\u2019d done. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Vicki in years. Unfortunately, our divorce was bitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again because she could see that talking about his ex-wife distressed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with couples these days?\u201d he asked. \u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone stay together anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Beldons have been married since shortly after high school,\u201d Olivia said, leading into the subject of how he knew Bob.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, Bob and Peggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to high school with both of them,\u201d Olivia explained.</p> <p>\u201cThey were boyfriend and girlfriend back then?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom tenth grade on.\u201d Those two had been together practically as long as she could remember.</p><p>\u201cBob was in Vietnam,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you know him?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cI met him later. About ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>Olivia waited, wondering if he\u2019d tell her how they\u2019d come to meet. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBob\u2019s the one who suggested I apply for the job here in Cedar Cove. I was looking for a slower pace and decided to take him up on his offer to visit the bed-and-breakfast. I immediately fell in love with the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you uprooted your whole life.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze and they shared a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I did,\u201d he said, offering her a jalape\u00f1o.</p><p>She shook her head vigorously. \u201cI\u2019m glad you made the move, too.\u201d</p><p>Very glad!</p><p>In the wee hours of Sunday morning, Cecilia poured herself a soothing glass of milk and sat at the small table in her tiny kitchen. She rested her bare legs on the second chair and leaned back, closing her eyes.</p><p>After a night on her feet, her toes throbbed. It\u2019d been much worse when she was pregnant. She remembered how badly her ankles had swollen nearly every night. From the first, the pregnancy had been hard on her. She hoped subsequent pregnancies wouldn\u2019t be as difficult, then realized there wouldn\u2019t be any more. Never again did she plan to risk that kind of emotional pain.</p><p>She sipped the milk, hoping it would help her sleep. The George Washington had pulled back into the naval shipyard earlier in the day, just as predicted, leaving Cecilia to wonder if she\u2019d hear from Ian.</p><p>Probably not. She was mentally reviewing the reasons they should stay away from each other when the phone rang.</p><p>Startled by the unexpectedness of it, Cecilia grabbed the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Great, a prank call. If she could afford caller ID, she would\u2019ve phoned right back and given the pervert a piece of her mind.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Ian.</p><p>She was too breathless to respond.</p><p>\u201cI tried calling you earlier, but you weren\u2019t home,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I thought of stopping by The Captain\u2019s Galley, but I promised you I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She supposed he was letting her know he\u2019d kept his word. \u201cI just got home a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured. I didn\u2019t wake you or anything, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cecilia could hear background traffic and supposed he was calling from a pay phone. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Nothing had changed in the week since she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>\u201cYou heard the George Washington had to turn back, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that news had drifted into town on Wednesday\u2014four days ago.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to be in port, but probably not long.\u201d He paused, then added, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you. Would you be willing to meet?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia squeezed her eyes shut. She wasn\u2019t thinking clearly enough to answer him. Her heart leapt at the offer, but her head told her it would be a big mistake.</p><p>\u201cI was at the college this week,\u201d she told him, avoiding his question for the moment.</p><p>\u201cOlympic College?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI signed up for two classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecilia, that\u2019s great!\u201d At least Ian was willing to encourage her, even if her father wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhat else is new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working in the bar on weekends, to help pay off the credit card bills.\u201d And all the attorney-related expenses, too. \u201cI got paid on Friday and since I\u2019m current with everything, I thought I\u2019d put the extra money in the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, until I went window shopping.\u201d It\u2019d been almost a year since she\u2019d gotten anything new\u2014a few maternity outfits she\u2019d recently given to charity. Last week, the temptation to spend her extra cash had been overwhelming. The spring clothes looked so appealing. There were new books she wanted. Cosmetics. A gorgeous pair of shoes. She sighed. \u201cEverything started calling my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you decided if you were going to spend it, you\u2019d make sure it was on something productive.\u201d</p><p>Ian did know her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. When are your classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly mornings, three days a week.\u201d She was lucky to get in, since school had already started. The early classes meant she wasn\u2019t going to have a lot of time for sleeping in. That was all right, though. The months after she\u2019d buried Allison, all she\u2019d done was sleep. She\u2019d welcomed the oblivion it offered, the release from pain.</p><p>\u201cAre you driving to school?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia laughed. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the most reliable car.\u201d</p><p>Her 1993 Ford Tempo had almost a hundred-and-fifty-thousand miles on it. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said, knowing she sounded defensive. \u201cIf I run into problems, I can always take the bus.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be a short trip nor would it be convenient, but it was manageable.</p><p>Ian paused, as if silently debating with himself. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need a reason? You\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re separated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Cecilia\u2019s hand tightened around the receiver. \u201cWe didn\u2019t speak for months. Remember? Why is it so important that we see each other now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something I want to ask you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAsk me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was adamant about that. \u201cI\u2019d rather do it in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d She knew all these questions of hers were nothing more than a delaying tactic.</p><p>\u201cSoon. Listen, Cecilia, I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll have before I\u2019m deployed. I\u2019ve got a proposition for you.\u201d When she didn\u2019t reply, he said, \u201cOkay, okay, you\u2019re right, we are separated, but you\u2019re the one who wanted that.\u201d</p><p>By the time he\u2019d moved out of the apartment, Ian had been in full agreement. Now he\u2019d decided to heap all the blame for the separation on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cFine, you don\u2019t want to see me,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>Cecilia sighed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that.\u201d The truth of it was she did want to see him. More than anything.</p><p>\u201cThen set the day and time.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia closed her eyes and pressed her fingertips to her brow as she tried to think.</p><p>\u201cDo you want my attorney to contact your attorney?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she flared, angry he\u2019d even suggest such a thing.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me when I should come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to come here?\u201d That put a whole new slant on the invitation.</p><p>\u201cFine, we can go somewhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cAnytime, anyplace. You just tell me. I\u2019m not asking again, Cecilia.\u201d His voice held an edge that hadn\u2019t been there earlier.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow about next week? Someplace in Bremerton? You choose.\u201d</p><p>His relief was palpable, even over the phone. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d</p><p>But it was, damn hard, and Ian knew it.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you free to meet?\u201d she asked, barely able to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know. All right? It depends on what\u2019s happening with the George Washington, but it\u2019ll be soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This wasn\u2019t exactly anytime or anyplace, but then he was in the Navy, and the military ruled his life\u2014and consequently hers.</p><p>Six</p><p>Thursday afternoon was the monthly potluck at the Jackson Senior Center, named after longtime Washington State senator Henry M. Jackson. Charlotte looked forward to these get-togethers with her dearest friends. It was a time to visit, catch up on each other\u2019s lives, share a fabulous lunch and listen to a speaker. Generally it was someone from the community. A local politician had spoken in January\u2014a real windbag, as far as Charlotte was concerned. In December, the police chief had discussed safety tips for seniors, and his talk was one of the best received in months. He\u2019d been both interesting and informative.</p><p>It just so happened that the speaker for the first week in February was Jack Griffin. Charlotte wouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world. She arrived early, secured a table for her knitting friends and made sure the spot next to her was saved for Jack.</p> <p>\u201cYoo-hoo, Laura,\u201d Charlotte called, waving her hand so her friend could see where she was sitting. The ladies in the knitting group always ate together at these functions. As the unofficial head of the group, Charlotte was expected to arrive early and claim the table\u2014not that she minded.</p><p>Laura nodded in her direction and carried her dish of deviled eggs to the buffet table. Her friend made the most incredible deviled eggs. She didn\u2019t fill them with the standard yolk-and-mayonnaise mixture. Instead, Laura stuffed hard-boiled egg whites with a crabmeat-and-shrimp salad. Every month, her platter was among the first to empty.</p><p>Charlotte had brought the broccoli lasagna recipe she\u2019d picked up at Lloyd Iverson\u2019s wake. She\u2019d experimented with it and added her own personal touch\u2014mushrooms to the crumbled bacon, and cheddar cheese as well as mozzarella. She hadn\u2019t been sure what to bring, seeing that she\u2019d collected several excellent recipes lately. That was what happened when she attended three funerals in as many weeks. The dessert recipe she\u2019d gotten last Monday, made with lemon pudding and cream cheese, was worth sitting through the two-hour wake, even if she hadn\u2019t been all that fond of Kathleen O\u2019Hara\u2019s husband.</p><p>Laura joined her, and Evelyn and Helen followed. As soon as they were seated, they reached for their dessert plates, headed for the buffet table and took their pick. Everyone did. Charlotte disapproved of the practice, but choosing your dessert early was the only way to guarantee you\u2019d get one.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Jack now,\u201d Charlotte said, hurrying down the narrow aisle between the tables.</p> <p>\u201cJack!\u201d she called out. It was important after all the bragging she\u2019d done that her friends know the newspaperman considered her his personal friend. She made a show of hugging him and was gratified when he returned the gesture.</p><p>Mary Berger, president of the Senior Center, joined them and held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you could be with us today, Mr. Griffin,\u201d she said formally, frowning at Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine.\u201d His gaze met Charlotte\u2019s over the top of Mary\u2019s head and he winked.</p><p>Charlotte couldn\u2019t help it; she blushed. Oh, that young man could melt a heart or two. Her own included. Now if only Olivia would wake up and realize what a catch he was. She did hope this was the man for her daughter. Charlotte had liked Jack the instant they met, and it wasn\u2019t often she felt such complete rapport with a man. It seemed to be happening more and more these days. First Tom Harding and then Jack Griffin, both newcomers to the community.</p><p>\u201cI saved you a place at my table,\u201d Charlotte told Jack, eager for her friends to meet him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve arranged a seat for Jack at the head table,\u201d Mary countered, glaring at Charlotte.</p> <p>\u201cBut Jack and I are friends,\u201d Charlotte said, certain that he\u2019d prefer her company to the stuffed shirts who ran the Senior Center.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we leave it up to Jack?\u201d Mary offered and stepped back, crossing her arms. Her expression was confident, as if to suggest there was no contest.</p><p>Jack was smiling. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had two lovely women fighting over me.\u201d</p><p>Mary cast Charlotte a saccharine-sweet smile, and it was all Charlotte could do not to throw up.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I sit with Charlotte and her friends for the buffet,\u201d Jack suggested, \u201cand join Mary and her friends for dessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent suggestion,\u201d Charlotte said, firmly taking his arm. Without giving anyone an opportunity to sidetrack him, she led Jack to the table where her friends were waiting.</p><p>Evelyn and Helen were dying to talk to Jack, Charlotte knew. They both had article ideas they wanted to discuss with him. Her friends felt that the community had long ignored the contribution of its senior citizens. With Jack as editor, Charlotte believed this was about to change.</p><p>Just as she knew he would, Jack won over her friends with little more than a smile. Since she\u2019d talked his ear off the night of the community play, Charlotte was willing to share him now. The ladies gathered around him like deer at a salt lick, each one spouting her opinion of the local newspaper.</p> <p>Evelyn and Helen spoke nonstop, outlining their ideas and making suggestions.</p><p>\u201cLadies, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s friends beamed at the praise.</p><p>\u201cWhat The Cedar Cove Chronicle needs is a page specifically for seniors. Interviews, health news...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecipes,\u201d Charlotte inserted.</p><p>Jack pointed his index finger in her direction. \u201cRecipes,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cI sometimes feel the young people don\u2019t understand or appreciate the history of this town,\u201d Laura added. \u201cDid you know Cedar Cove has had three different names in the last hundred years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree?\u201d Charlotte only knew of two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in why the name changed,\u201d Jack said. \u201cLaura, you seem to know. Write me an article for the next edition and I\u2019ll print it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will people read it?\u201d Laura asked, sounding doubtful.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll read it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure of that.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte chuckled, guessing at his strategy. Jack would come up with a misleading headline guaranteed to generate interest.</p><p>\u201cI like your ideas,\u201d he told the women. \u201cNow, which one of you is willing to head up the senior page?\u201d</p><p>Laura, Evelyn, Helen and Bess, who was the quietest member of the knitting group, all looked to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows if you want to get something done, you should ask Charlotte,\u201d Bess said, blushing profusely. \u201cShe\u2019s got more energy than the rest of us combined.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned as if to say he\u2019d find it a distinct pleasure to work with her. \u201cAll right,\u201d Charlotte muttered, thinking she needed her head examined for taking on another project. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, but I\u2019ve got to have help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all help,\u201d Laura promised.</p><p>\u201cBring your ideas to me,\u201d Jack said, \u201cand we\u2019ll work on them together.\u201d</p><p>Those few words were all the incentive Charlotte required. She wanted to encourage Jack\u2019s relationship with her daughter and she could think of no better opportunity to provide him with information about Olivia. Her daughter needed a little assistance. This wasn\u2019t so different from the way things had been when Olivia was a shy teenager and Charlotte had spoken to Betty Nelson about having her son ask Olivia to the Junior Prom. Olivia never knew that the date had been arranged between the two mothers, and what her daughter didn\u2019t know hadn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Delighted with this turn of events, Charlotte enjoyed her lunch. All too soon, Jack had to move to the head table. The second he was out of earshot, Charlotte leaned toward her friends. \u201cIsn\u2019t he a sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Everyone agreed. The knitting group loved him. It hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed that he\u2019d chosen to eat at their table, either. Charlotte\u2019s stock had gone up considerably.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dating my daughter, you know,\u201d she announced. It was difficult not to gloat.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s dating Olivia?\u201d Laura\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYes, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re perfect together.\u201d Charlotte had high hopes for this relationship. Very high hopes, indeed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d Bess whispered. \u201cBut a bit rough around the edges, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Charlotte instantly took Jack\u2019s side. He might not be the smoothest dresser in town, but he was honest, open-minded and he valued their opinions. This was the first time anyone from the newspaper had taken their suggestions seriously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Bess shrugged, and reached for her knitting. \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me, I like Mr. Griffin, but I believe there\u2019s more to him than meets the eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to check him out on the Internet?\u201d Evelyn asked, lowering her voice to a husky whisper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Charlotte muttered. The former schoolteacher had taken a computer class, and ever since, she\u2019d been downright obnoxious, forever expounding on what she could find out about a person\u2019s background. Evelyn fancied herself a private investigator, Charlotte thought sourly.</p><p>Before anything more could be said, Mary Berger introduced Jack, and he stepped to the podium, looking completely at ease.</p><p>Charlotte found Jack\u2019s talk fascinating. He started by recounting his first visit to Cedar Cove and his impressions of the town. Bob Beldon had mentioned that The Cedar Cove Chronicle was planning to hire a new editor. It was Jack\u2019s luck to arrive the weekend of the Annual Seagull Calling Contest, he said, and his retelling of the day had the entire room in hysterics.</p><p>His talk was one of the most entertaining they\u2019d ever had. Those thirty minutes passed quickly.</p><p>The seniors gave him a standing ovation.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice,\u201d Bess said, whispering in Charlotte\u2019s ear when they stood to applaud him, \u201che didn\u2019t tell us a single detail about his own background?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Charlotte argued, then realized her friend was right. Well, she didn\u2019t care. Where he\u2019d lived and worked before moving to Cedar Cove wasn\u2019t important. She\u2019d always been a good judge of character, and her instincts told her she could trust Jack Griffin. Besides, Olivia had said Jack was from the Spokane area.</p><p>Later, however, Charlotte decided she was curious. Bess and Laura were right; one could never be too careful. Besides, her daughter was involved now, and that meant she had an obligation to dig up whatever she could.</p><p>On the pretext of finding out more about the Seniors\u2019 Page in The Cedar Cove Chronicle, Charlotte stopped at The Chronicle headquarters next to the Laundromat on Seaview Drive. She hadn\u2019t been inside the newspaper office in years.</p><p>The building was new, and it saddened her to see a neat row of desks with computer screens. She longed for the days when the scent of ink hung in the air and reporters yelled into phones and kept bottles of booze in their bottom drawers. Like in those 1940s movies. Or maybe she was thinking of Lou Grant. They didn\u2019t make newsmen like that anymore. Jack Griffin, however, passed muster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack came out of his office to greet her personally. \u201cDid you enjoy the talk yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut I was disappointed not to learn more about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He laughed lightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour newspaper history,\u201d she elaborated.</p> <p>He rattled off a number of newspapers he\u2019d worked for over the years. The towns and positions sounded impressive. When he\u2019d finished, he waited as if he expected her to respond.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Charlotte said, and sighed. \u201cThat does sound grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd boring. Which is why I gave a talk I hoped would be more entertaining. I\u2019m sorry to hear you were disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not me,\u201d she was quick to tell him. It was her suspicious friends\u2014who didn\u2019t know Jack the way she did.</p><p>Ian asked Cecilia to meet him at the Thai restaurant in Bremerton, where he\u2019d taken her on their first official date. He\u2019d chosen this place on purpose and hoped his wife would remember that night with the same fondness he did.</p> <p>Cecilia had agreed, although dining out on a Thursday night meant she had to find someone to cover for her at The Captain\u2019s Galley. He was sorry about that, but he didn\u2019t have any choice; he\u2019d had three straight days of duty. The George Washington probably wouldn\u2019t be in dock much longer and this might well be his only opportunity to spend time with her.</p><p>He was at the table waiting when Cecilia arrived. He watched her come toward him and was struck anew by her loveliness. She looked better\u2014healthier\u2014than she had in months. After Allison\u2019s death, she\u2019d lost weight. More than she could afford to lose, but it wasn\u2019t just that; it seemed as though his wife had given up caring about herself. She hadn\u2019t bothered with her hair, or her makeup or any of the other things she used to do when they were first married. Their sex life had gone to hell, along with everything else. He\u2019d tried to help her, but everything he suggested had backfired. He\u2019d asked his mother to call, to talk to her, but Cecilia had taken offense at that. Perhaps if they\u2019d met face-to-face...But his home was in Georgia. His mother had offered to fly to Washington\u2014an offer Cecilia had rejected. Ian had tried to arrange an appointment with a Navy psychologist; she\u2019d refused to go. He\u2019d had conversations with her mother but Cecilia had accused him of interfering. He didn\u2019t want to seem critical of Sandra Merrick, but he sensed that her sympathy wasn\u2019t entirely a positive thing. As far as he could tell, Sandra wasn\u2019t encouraging her to recover, to move on. And because Cecilia didn\u2019t know his family, she\u2019d been uninterested in their attempts to help. His own efforts to reach her emotionally had failed. He\u2019d been in pain, too, dammit! Cecilia was angry with him and irrational though her anger was, he understood. But he couldn\u2019t have been with her when Allison died. It was that simple.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning,\u201d she said as she stepped up to the table.</p><p>She was probably right. He couldn\u2019t think about the events of last year and not feel depressed.</p><p>He stood and pulled out her chair. Ian remembered how she\u2019d told him, after their first date, that those small old-fashioned courtesies impressed her. He had his father to thank for that. Denny Randall had been a stickler for etiquette and taught all four of his sons well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came.\u201d</p> <p>Cecilia smiled as she reached for her linen napkin and set it on her lap before reading the menu. They always ordered the same dish, the Phad Thai, but it didn\u2019t hurt to look.</p><p>Ian suspected she was already regretting that she\u2019d agreed to see him. He hoped that once he explained why he\u2019d asked her here, she\u2019d change her mind. It was hard to remember he wasn\u2019t supposed to love her anymore, because he did. He\u2019d never stopped.</p><p>The waitress arrived and they ordered. Ian was mildly surprised when she asked for something different. He didn\u2019t hear the name. Perhaps this was her way of letting him know she was willing to try new things, to change. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was simply looking for signs, reading her behaviour too closely\u2014and if it was a sign, was it a good one?</p><p>As soon as the waitress left, Ian decided to launch into his proposition.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you signed up for those college classes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Although I feel like I\u2019m a thousand years older than everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Actually Cecilia had left high school only four years ago. He was two years older than she was.</p><p>\u201cYour car\u2019s not giving you problems, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sounded almost defiant.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d He wanted her to know how strongly he approved of her going back to school. They\u2019d had a number of arguments over her working at the restaurant; Cecilia thought it was because he was jealous of her being around other men. Maybe that was a small part of his reaction, but there was more. He felt Cecilia was wasting her abilities, her potential. She was smart, a whole lot smarter than she gave herself credit for.</p><p>She glanced at him, and Ian had to resist an impulse to reach across the table and put his hand over hers. Sometimes he ached just wanting to touch her. It\u2019d been months since he\u2019d held her in his arms or kissed her. After Allison, it seemed that whatever she\u2019d felt for him physically had died, too.</p><p>\u201cMy car\u2019s only two years old,\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, as if she thought he was bragging or something.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re wondering why I asked to meet you, and it has to do with my car.\u201d He had her attention, he noticed; that was a start. \u201cI want you to drive it while I\u2019m away.\u201d He could see from her reaction that she was going to argue with him. \u201cIt\u2019s more dependable, especially in the mornings,\u201d he added quickly, hoping she\u2019d see the wisdom of accepting his offer.</p><p>Cecilia shook her head. \u201cI appreciate it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually you\u2019d be doing me a favor.\u201d Ian could tell she didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good to have an engine sit idle for six months,\u201d he said in authoritative tones. \u201cA lot of guys lend out their cars while they\u2019re deployed for that very reason.\u201d Ian didn\u2019t know if this was true or not, but it made sense.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Their meals arrived, and Ian studied Cecilia\u2019s dish. Chicken breast on cooked spinach, he thought, with peanut sauce ladled over top. He hadn\u2019t known she liked spinach. That was a pretty minor thing but it made him realize there was still a great deal they didn\u2019t know about each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbout the car...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting a divorce, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t welcome the reminder. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe choice is yours, but like I said, I\u2019ll be lending it out and if you want to use it, fine. If not, I\u2019ll leave it with a friend.\u201d He probably wouldn\u2019t, but he wanted her to think so.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d worry about you less.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to admit. However, it was the truth. If she was driving twenty-plus miles every morning in the heavy shipyard traffic, he\u2019d prefer to know she was in a more reliable vehicle than the dilapidated car she currently drove.</p><p>She smiled then, and it was as if everything in the world had righted itself. \u201cThis is really thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>Damn, it was hard not to touch her. He shrugged off her words. \u201cIt\u2019s more for me and my car than anything.\u201d</p><p>Her smile dimmed.</p><p>\u201cAnd like I said, you\u2019d be doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>They ate their dinner and lingered over tea. After an hour and a half, the restaurant was getting full, and their waitress was sending some obvious signals their way. But Ian didn\u2019t want the evening to end.</p><p>\u201cHow about a movie?\u201d he suggested, hoping she\u2019d agree but afraid she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>To his surprise, she smiled and nodded.</p><p>Ian felt a surge of happiness...and optimism. He didn\u2019t care what they saw, as long as he could sit at her side and pretend the last eight months had never happened.</p><p>He let Cecilia choose the movie, and while he bought the tickets, she picked up a bag of buttered popcorn. They sat in the back row of the theater. Because it was a Thursday night, the place was practically deserted. Only one other couple showed up before the previews, and they sat near the front.</p><p>Ian placed his arm along the back of Cecilia\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cWe went to dinner at the Thai restaurant and then a movie on our first date, too,\u201d she said casually.</p><p>As though Ian had forgotten. \u201cDid we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cecilia scooped up a handful of popcorn.</p><p>\u201cDid I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and blinked hard. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her shoulder. \u201cI remember everything about that date,\u201d he whispered. And every subsequent one. For the first month after they\u2019d met, she was all he thought about. It was no thanks to him the Navy had survived, since his mind certainly wasn\u2019t on his job.</p><p>In addition to etiquette, his father had taught Ian about birth control. But every lesson he\u2019d ever learned had vanished the first time they\u2019d made love. He wasn\u2019t usually irresponsible, but he\u2019d been so crazy about Cecilia they\u2019d both taken wild chances. He didn\u2019t care, because he loved her. If she did get pregnant, that would be all the excuse he needed to marry her. He wanted to marry her. With an attitude like that, it was bound to happen sooner or later\u2014and for them it had been sooner.</p><p>It took him weeks to talk her into marrying him. That hadn\u2019t been easy on his ego. Her parents\u2019 failed relationship had left her with a real anxiety about marriage. The irony was that now she was the one who wanted out.</p><p>\u201cI still remember our first kiss,\u201d she said in a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Ian was surprised she\u2019d admit it.</p><p>\u201cNo man had ever kissed me the way you do...did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d he corrected, and then not giving a damn if anyone saw him, he leaned down and brushed his mouth over hers. That kiss was an experiment to see how receptive she was. When her mouth parted and her tongue met his, Ian could hardly keep from groaning aloud. Her lips were soft and slippery from the butter and she tasted like popcorn and salt. His heart went wild; he loved her so much.</p><p>He knew he should stop. They weren\u2019t teenagers without a place to go for privacy. Nor did Ian want anyone to find him necking with his wife in the back of a theater. But those thoughts had barely made it into his head when he found any number of compelling reasons to continue doing exactly what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she whispered, and slowly, reluctantly eased her mouth from his.</p><p>Ian kept his eyes closed and leaned his forehead against hers.</p><p>\u201cThank you for letting me use your car.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her how much he loved her, but he was afraid she\u2019d pull away and the moment would be ruined. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of it for you,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you took good care of yourself,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>The movie started then, and Cecilia settled back, her head resting on his shoulder. He slid one arm around her; she didn\u2019t object. Ian had no idea what the movie was about. He thought only of Cecilia, remembering the early days of their relationship and reveling in her nearness.</p><p>When the movie ended they walked slowly out of the theater, but Ian wasn\u2019t ready to leave her. \u201cI want to come home with you,\u201d he said, standing next to her car, the driver\u2019s door open. Just so there\u2019d be no misunderstanding about what he intended, he kissed her again, his mouth hard and hot.</p> <p>Her eyes still closed, Cecilia broke it off and lowered her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Cecilia, we\u2019re married. It\u2019s been months since we made love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, divorce me later, but love me now. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan...\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t say no, but she didn\u2019t quite say yes, either. Ian followed her home. When she arrived, he climbed quickly out of his car and opened the building door to let her in.</p><p>He waited in the hallway while Cecilia unlocked the apartment. She glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>It was all the invitation Ian needed. She met him just inside; he closed the door with his foot and reached for her. She came to him willingly, throwing her arms around his neck.</p><p>Ian lifted her from the floor and they kissed with such abandon that the world could have come to an end and they wouldn\u2019t have noticed. He removed her sweater and her bra, kissing her as he peeled away the layers of clothing. Her breasts seemed to throb in his hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me wait,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Even in the dark, Ian had no trouble finding the bedroom. He held her by one hand and led her there.</p> <p>He placed her on the bed, pressing against her, all the while kissing her slowly, dragging out each kiss until he thought he\u2019d explode. The blood pounded in his ears as he stepped back and stripped off his own clothes. Cecilia shed her slacks.</p><p>It\u2019d been so long, too long, and he was ready. He prayed she was, too. His gaze sought out hers in the dim moonlight that filtered through the bedroom curtains. She smiled softly and lifted her arms to him. He felt overwhelming relief\u2014and then he was on his knees over her.</p><p>She linked her arms around his neck and they kissed until they were breathless and he entered her. Slowly, so slowly, for fear of hurting her. When he paused, Cecilia whimpered, urging him to continue.</p><p>\u201cCecilia...\u201d He groaned her name when he realized what he\u2019d done. He had protection with him, and here they were risking the possibility of another pregnancy. \u201cI didn\u2019t...I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her arms tightened around him. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Not now. It\u2019s all right...this is my safe time.\u201d</p><p>God forgive him his weakness, but he did as she asked and poured his life into her.</p><p>Afterward Ian held her, kissing her repeatedly. Maybe now this insanity about divorce would be over. Maybe now they could go back to being married. But he was afraid to suggest it, afraid she\u2019d reject him.</p><p>A few minutes later, he stood and retrieved his clothes. Cecilia sat up on the bed, clasping her knees with both arms, and watched him dress. He silently begged her to speak, invite him to stay the night.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>This was crazy, idiotic! They\u2019d just finished making love. She had to know how he felt about her. He hadn\u2019t tried to hide his feelings. He waited for her to say something, to stop him. A word, that was all it would take. One damn word. She wasn\u2019t willing to give him even that. So he left.</p><p>Grace was in a glorious mood. The entire world could now be viewed through rose-colored glasses, and all because she was going to become a grandmother. That news was just the boost her life and her marriage had needed. Dan\u2019s spirits, too, had revived, and they\u2019d had a wonderful talk, reminiscing over the early years of their own marriage when their daughters were young. In the weeks since Kelly\u2019s phone call, Grace\u2019s love for her husband had been rekindled. The dark times they\u2019d experienced recently had clouded her perspective on their years together. Maybe she didn\u2019t always get what she wanted from Dan, what she needed, but she did love him.</p><p>They\u2019d been little more than teenagers when they got married. So young...It hadn\u2019t mattered that they\u2019d lived below the poverty line, they were happy. Vietnam had shaken up their lives, but they\u2019d survived and so had the marriage.</p><p>Wednesday night was her aerobics class, and Grace hurried in the front door, coming straight home from the library. To her surprise, the house on Rosewood Lane was dark and silent.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d she called out. Almost always he was home before her.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The first thing her husband did when he walked in was turn on the television. He showered and changed clothes, but the TV was on, even if he wasn\u2019t watching.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t mentioned anything that morning about being late. She checked the calendar to be sure he didn\u2019t have a dentist\u2019s or doctor\u2019s appointment, but nothing was noted. Pulling hamburger out of the refrigerator, she hurriedly put together a casserole and placed it in the oven, then packed her exercise clothes and tennis shoes inside her gym bag.</p><p>The phone rang and she answered it immediately, expecting to hear Dan\u2019s voice. The caller was someone wanting to ask her questions for a survey; she got rid of him in short order. Answering the phone prompted her to check the machine, but there were no messages.</p><p>When the oven timer went off sixty minutes later, she took out the beef-and-rice casserole and set it on the stovetop to cool. Wednesday evenings were hectic for Grace. Dan didn\u2019t object to her attending the exercise class, but he didn\u2019t like waiting for her to return before he ate dinner. Consequently, Grace rushed home, got a meal on the table and then rushed out the door to meet Olivia for their seven o\u2019clock class.</p><p>When it was obvious that Dan wasn\u2019t going to be there to join her, Grace ate alone. She picked at the casserole, which was one of his favorite recipes and not hers. Because she\u2019d be leaving him, she always chose a dish she knew he\u2019d enjoy. That was something she did, almost unconsciously, on Wednesdays.</p><p>As she sat at the table, the space across from her empty, Grace reviewed that morning\u2019s conversation for something she might have missed. The alarm had gone off at the usual time. Dan made the coffee and packed his lunch; Grace showered and dressed. They each had toast and homemade strawberry preserves while she wrote her list for the day and he read the Bremerton Sun. After thirty-five years together, they\u2019d settled into the comfort of habit.</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t recall Dan saying or doing anything out of the ordinary that morning. She\u2019d kissed him on his way out the door, same as usual, mentioned what she\u2019d be making for dinner and said she\u2019d see him that evening. With his thermos and lunch bucket in hand, he\u2019d headed for his truck and pulled out of the driveway. An hour later, after she\u2019d finished wiping down the kitchen counter and running a load of laundry, Grace left for the library. Their morning routine had been the same as always. But where was Dan?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making too much of this,\u201d Grace said aloud. It was just that the house seemed so empty. Everything felt slightly wrong without him there. He should\u2019ve been sitting in front of the television, drinking his after-dinner coffee, watching the news.</p><p>Grace delayed leaving for her exercise class as long as she could. Before she went to the gym, she jotted a note and left it on the kitchen counter where Dan would see it when he came in the back door.</p><p>Driving into the lot at the YMCA a few minutes late, Grace noticed that Olivia was waiting for her. Her friend seemed positively lighthearted, and Grace wondered if her good mood could be attributed to the news about James or her dinner date with Jack Griffin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking terrific,\u201d Grace commented, as they walked into the building.</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cI feel terrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your date?\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I find Jack Griffin an interesting guy. He\u2019s thoughtful, well-read, has strong opinions. He seems open and honest, and yet there\u2019s a hint of...mystery about him. It\u2019s probably nothing important, but you know how much I hate secrets and deceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of mystery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, he\u2019s friends with Bob Beldon. Apparently they\u2019ve known each other for ten years, but he never once mentioned how they met. It seemed odd, you know?\u201d</p><p>Grace wasn\u2019t sure she did, but she let her friend continue talking because it distracted her from worrying about Dan. She was overreacting, she told herself again, but then she had a tendency to do that. Her imagination frequently got the best of her. The girls were never just late, they\u2019d been in a horrible car crash and were lying in a ditch bleeding, calling out for her. That was just how her mind worked. It was probably all the murder mysteries she read.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly quiet,\u201d Olivia remarked.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Grace returned, acting surprised.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could be wrong? I\u2019m fine\u2014great. Excited about Kelly\u2019s news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dan?\u201d</p><p>Olivia always did have a way of homing in on the problem. Grace glanced toward her and sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt is Dan, isn\u2019t it? Is he in another one of his moods?\u201d</p><p>They entered the crowded locker room and Grace found a place on the bench. \u201cNo. Actually, his spirits have been good lately. I know we\u2019ve had our ups and downs over the years, but this is a positive time for us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStan and I had our own roller-coaster ride.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t encouraging, seeing that her friend had been divorced for nearly fifteen years.</p><p>Olivia looked away. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. Olivia might be divorced but, regardless of anything she might say to the contrary, she remained linked to Stan by more than their children. He\u2019d been the love of her life, and the death of their oldest son and the divorce that followed hadn\u2019t changed that. Stan would always be part of Olivia\u2019s life, even while he was married to another woman. Grace understood this. She doubted that Olivia fully recognized the strength of her bond to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Dan?\u201d Olivia pressed.</p><p>Grace stripped off her sweats and changed her shoes. \u201cHe isn\u2019t home from work yet.\u201d Then, before Olivia could chastise her for worrying, she added, \u201cHe probably had an appointment and forgot to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have said something and it slipped your mind,\u201d Olivia suggested.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Grace had already considered that scenario, but didn\u2019t really believe it. Something was wrong. Her heart told her and her head echoed that certainty, pounding with fear.</p><p>Probably because of her pent-up anxiety, Grace had the best workout of her life. By the time class finished, she was so weak she could barely walk back to the change room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCall me,\u201d Olivia said as they strolled toward the parking lot. The air was damp and cold, and their breath came out in little puffs of fog. The huge lights in the asphalt lot cast a bluish glow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Dan\u2019s home by now,\u201d Grace murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is, too,\u201d Olivia said, but her words rang false.</p><p>Grace waited until Olivia was inside her car before she got into her own. As she turned down Rosewood Lane, her heart beat so loudly it sounded like a distant drumbeat in her ear. She felt almost as though she were sitting in a theater and the music preceding a tense moment in the story had begun, growing louder and louder around her.</p> <p>Other than the porch light, the house was still dark. Dread suffused her whole being. She could hardly breathe.</p><p>Where the hell was Dan?</p><p>Then it occurred to her that he might be in bed. If he\u2019d had to work overtime or been delayed in traffic, he\u2019d probably arrived home exhausted. In that case, he\u2019d have showered and gone straight to bed.</p><p>Only Dan\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t in its usual parking space. Going inside, Grace sat her gym bag in the laundry room, then moved into the darkened living room and slowly lowered herself into her husband\u2019s recliner. The cushion gave, broken down by years of use, and she sank into the comfortable old chair he loved so much. That was when she started to shake.</p><p>She waited fifteen minutes, then walked into the kitchen and reached for the phone. Without turning on the light, she dialed Olivia\u2019s number and let it ring until her friend answered.</p> <p>\u201cDan isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t say anything for several tense moments. Then calmly, as though this was an everyday occurrence, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right over.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Grace sat up all night, her fears out of control. Olivia had stayed up with her until after midnight, when she\u2019d fallen asleep on the sofa out of sheer exhaustion. Grace let her friend sleep. There wasn\u2019t anything Olivia could say that would reassure her. Nothing either one of them could do, for that matter. None of this felt real.</p><p>At six-thirty, just as the first light of morning crept toward the horizon, Olivia woke. Bolting upright, she blinked rapidly and looked around.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything?\u201d she asked, rubbing her face with both hands.</p> <p>Grace shook her head. She\u2019d brewed a pot of coffee, more for something to do than any desire for caffeine.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time I called Troy Davis,\u201d Olivia said in that no-nonsense way of hers. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost twenty-four hours, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded, and automatically poured them each a cup of coffee. She stood in the kitchen, sipping hers, while Olivia made the call to the local sheriff\u2019s office. She found it difficult to keep her mind clear and focused. The sleepless night hadn\u2019t helped. Her thoughts were fearful and obsessive\u2014ideas of where Dan might be, what could have happened, what plausible reason he might have for not coming home.</p><p>\u201cTroy isn\u2019t on duty until seven,\u201d Olivia explained when she\u2019d finished.</p><p>\u201cShould we go there ourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I talked to Lowell Price and he said Troy would take a drive out here. He knows Dan and he\u2019ll want to handle this personally.\u201d</p><p>Grace felt a tremendous sense of relief. \u201cShould I phone the girls?\u201d After all those sleepless hours of worrying, she seemed incapable of making decisions.</p><p>Olivia appeared to weigh her answer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait until after you\u2019ve talked to Troy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She hated the idea of alarming her daughters, but they had a right to know their father had disappeared. Dear God, where could he be? Never in all the years they\u2019d been married had Dan done anything like this. Something had to be very wrong.</p><p>\u201cHave you given any more thought to where Dan might\u2019ve gone?\u201d</p><p>She had, but Grace found it hard to voice the words. \u201cLately...before Kelly announced she was pregnant, Dan\u2019s been...\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to continue and struggled not to break into tears. \u201cI think there might be another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan? No way! He\u2019s not the type.\u201d Olivia shook her head adamantly. \u201cNot Dan,\u201d she repeated. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>Grace found it hard to believe herself. But unlikely though it seemed, the thought refused to leave her mind. \u201cI realized a long time ago that we don\u2019t have a perfect marriage, but lately it\u2019s...it\u2019s as though something\u2019s changed in Dan. He\u2019s different.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it, but putting into words exactly what was different about her husband proved far more difficult. She knew he was restless. He\u2019d been moody for thirty years, ever since Vietnam, but lately the swings had been wider, more extreme. Whenever she tried to draw him out, get him to confide in her, Dan seemed to resent her effort. That had led Grace to wonder if there was someone else he was talking to, someone else he\u2019d come to care about. The only time he\u2019d been himself lately was when they\u2019d heard Kelly\u2019s wonderful news. After their daughter\u2019s announcement, everything had been better\u2014for a while. Now this.</p><p>\u201cDan just isn\u2019t the kind of man who would cheat on you,\u201d Olivia said in a confident voice.</p><p>\u201cDo any of us really know our husbands?\u201d Grace asked quietly. She didn\u2019t mean to be cruel, but her friend had learned that lesson the hard way. Apparently Stan had met his current wife while commuting on the ferry to his job in Seattle. Grace didn\u2019t think he\u2019d been involved in an actual affair with Marge, but she\u2019d offered a sympathetic ear after Jordan\u2019s death and had helped Stan deal with the guilt and anger that followed. His relationship with Marge had been one of emotional rather than sexual intensity. It was the only thing that could explain how quickly he\u2019d remarried.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t answer right away. Carrying her mug, she paced the area in front of the sofa. \u201cWhat makes you think Dan might be seeing someone else?\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t have any specific details. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a gut feeling,\u201d she said with a helpless shrug.</p><p>\u201cThink back over the last six months. Has he taken special care with his appearance, attended meetings at odd times of the day or night?\u201d</p><p>Her mind was a blank. \u201cUh...not that I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say he went hunting last fall?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. He\u2019d taken up the sport after a long absence, and while it wasn\u2019t something she could possibly like, she\u2019d been grateful that he was showing interest in an activity other than watching TV. He\u2019d left on a Friday afternoon in late October and returned on the Sunday evening. He\u2019d spoken enthusiastically about his trek through the woods, more voluble than he\u2019d been for quite a while.</p><p>\u201cHe went alone?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Dan hadn\u2019t mentioned anyone else, but at the time Grace hadn\u2019t thought of that as odd. He didn\u2019t have a lot of friends and often preferred his own company.</p><p>\u201cDid he bring home any game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But that made sense, too, since it\u2019d been years since he\u2019d gone hunting. Putting down her coffee, Grace frowned, remembering that weekend. \u201cAre you suggesting he was with someone else?\u201d</p><p>Olivia boldly met her look. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, but deep down I think you do.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she did. That free weekend had been wonderful for her. She\u2019d spent a delightful two days with Maryellen and Kelly, shopping at an outlet mall in Oregon. It\u2019d been their first \u201cMother-Daughter Getaway Weekend,\u201d an event they hoped to repeat annually.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed...happy,\u201d Grace murmured. He was so rarely in a good mood that it\u2019d struck her as unusual. She couldn\u2019t believe that a man would go from another woman\u2019s bed and then home to his wife, without somehow betraying his guilt. She couldn\u2019t accept that her husband was capable of such a thing, and yet...</p><p>They heard a car outside and Olivia glanced out the living-room window. \u201cTroy\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Grace had opened the front door and was standing on the porch as Sheriff Davis came up the walkway.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d Grace told him, grateful he\u2019d decided to attend to this himself.</p><p>Troy removed his hat as he stepped into the house and nodded in Olivia\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure who else to call,\u201d Olivia explained.</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d Troy was a good-looking man who\u2019d been two years ahead of them in school and the biggest heartthrob in Cedar Cove. He\u2019d gone into the service after graduation, then joined the sheriff\u2019s department on his return. For the last thirty-eight years, he\u2019d kept order in their community; ten years ago, he\u2019d been elected sheriff. Folks liked and trusted Troy.</p><p>Grace invited him to make himself comfortable and he chose to sit in Dan\u2019s recliner. He carried a clipboard and had a pencil ready.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019d like to file a missing person\u2019s report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Grace said, nearly choking on the word.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you know,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>Grace told him everything she could think of. Although it broke her heart, she mentioned the hunting trip and Olivia\u2019s suspicions that there could be another woman in his life.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s someone else?\u201d</p><p>Grace raised her hands in a gesture of defeat. \u201cWhat is it people say? The wife is always the last to know.\u201d The more often she acknowledged the possibility, the more real it seemed to become. She told herself Dan wouldn\u2019t do that to her, to their daughters. She had to believe it. Yet she knew something wasn\u2019t right and hadn\u2019t been for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens next?\u201d Grace asked once the report had been completed.</p><p>Troy glanced at Olivia and then back at her. \u201cActually, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Grace was appalled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve checked both hospitals in the area, but they don\u2019t have anyone admitted under Dan\u2019s name, nor do they have any unidentified patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been arrested, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Troy confirmed. \u201cNot by us and not by the State Patrol.\u201d In other words, no one knew anything about Dan or could guess where he might have gone. \u201cAs far as I can see, there isn\u2019t any evidence of foul play.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. She\u2019d walked through the house a dozen times during the night, looking for even the tiniest clue that would tell her where Dan might be. She\u2019d combed through his pockets, his dresser, everything.</p><p>\u201cThen we have to assume Dan is missing of his own accord,\u201d Troy said calmly.</p><p>Confused, Grace looked at her friend. \u201cWhat Troy is saying,\u201d Olivia told her, \u201cis that it isn\u2019t a crime for an adult to run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHusbands and wives abandon their families. Unfortunately it\u2019s a common occurrence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that was the case,\u201d Grace snapped, \u201cthen Dan would\u2019ve taken something with him, don\u2019t you think? All he had were the clothes on his back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize it might not make sense,\u201d Troy went on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMake sense?\u201d Grace echoed. \u201cThis is ludicrous! My husband is missing and the police won\u2019t do anything to help me find him.\u201d</p><p>Troy held her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grace, but that\u2019s the law. If anyone sees him, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for nothing,\u201d she muttered, crossing her arms. She was furious, embarrassed and filled with a restless energy she didn\u2019t know how to dispel.</p><p>It was then that Grace heard the back door open and close. A moment later, as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world, her husband walked into the living room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d he asked, obviously surprised to find Olivia and Troy in his home.</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Grace\u2019s relief at seeing him was so great, she started to weep. \u201cOh, Dan. Dear God in heaven, where were you? I\u2019ve been out of my mind with worry.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cIs there a problem here, Troy?\u201d he asked stiffly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The sheriff stood, tore the report free from his clipboard and folded it in half. He handed it to Grace and, without a word of farewell, headed out the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get ready for court,\u201d Olivia said. She glared fiercely in Dan\u2019s direction and quickly left.</p> <p>\u201cYou called Troy?\u201d Dan said as soon as they were alone. He glowered at her as though she\u2019d done something wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Grace cried again, unable to hold back her anger or her tears. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize what you put me through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your damn business where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell!\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re my husband.\u201d</p><p>Dan scowled darkly. \u201cI refuse to allow this marriage to be a ball and chain around my neck.\u201d</p><p>Grace was so shocked, she couldn\u2019t restrain herself. \u201cYou go out and spend the entire night God-knows-where,\u201d she screamed, \u201cand then casually come home as if nothing happened? You expect me to pretend everything\u2019s all right?\u201d She couldn\u2019t do it. Wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cWhere I was and what I was doing are my own damn business.\u201d He marched into the bedroom. Grace followed him.</p><p>\u201cYou were with another woman, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Her heart ached as she asked the question.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Gracie, I was with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s responding laugh lacked humor.</p><p>\u201cI have a right to know that much.\u201d</p><p>Dan refused to answer her question. Then he went to his drawer and took out a fresh change of underwear. \u201cI haven\u2019t got time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have time,\u201d she repeated. How dared he, after all the anguish he\u2019d caused? For a moment she thought she was going to be physically ill.</p> <p>He stomped into the bathroom. Grace went in the opposite direction and slammed the bedroom door so hard their daughters\u2019 graduation pictures flew off the wall. They crashed onto the hardwood floor of the hallway, shattering the glass.</p><p>Horrified by what she\u2019d done, Grace stared at the beautiful faces of her children and wanted to grind her teeth with frustration.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d she yelled at her husband.</p><p>The bedroom door opened and Dan stood there. He wore a hard, unyielding look. \u201cBeen there, Gracie. What else would you call the last thirty-five years?\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t show up for their next exercise class. Olivia knew that relations with Dan had been rocky since his disappearing act. Grace hadn\u2019t explained Dan\u2019s disappearance or where he\u2019d been, and Olivia didn\u2019t pry. If there was another woman involved, then the matter was best settled between husband and wife. Still, Olivia couldn\u2019t help worrying.</p><p>In addition to that, she had other concerns. At the top of her list just now was Justine.</p><p>Her daughter had been avoiding her again, despite Olivia\u2019s efforts to build a bridge between them. She longed for them to be close, the way she was with her own mother. Perhaps it was too late for that; she hoped not and would willingly make any overtures. She vowed that under no circumstances would she bring up the subject of Warren Saget. Olivia\u2019s one wish was that she and Justine simply enjoy each other\u2019s company.</p><p>Olivia had invited Justine for lunch on Saturday, and Justine had accepted. Using one of her mother\u2019s favorite recipes, she prepared a main-dish chicken salad. Personally, Olivia would have preferred a restaurant meal, which would\u2019ve been easier all around. Having lunch here, however, would allow for a more relaxed, casual atmosphere\u2014and greater privacy. At a restaurant there was always the chance they\u2019d run into someone they knew and get sidetracked.</p><p>Justine showed up right on time. She brought a small bouquet of yellow daffodils and gave Olivia a perfunctory kiss on the cheek as she walked into the house.</p><p>\u201cHow thoughtful,\u201d Olivia said, touched by the gesture. She found a vase for the flowers and set them in the middle of the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve gotten together for lunch,\u201d Justine commented, grabbing a breadstick from the table.</p><p>\u201cToo long.\u201d Olivia removed the salad from the refrigerator, filled two plates, and carried them to the table. A kettle of water waited on the stove for tea later on.</p><p>Her beautiful daughter sat across from her, and Olivia had the sudden urge to speak from her heart. \u201cI don\u2019t think I tell you often enough how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>Justine stared at her as if she didn\u2019t know how to react, then smiled. \u201cThis has to do with James, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Nothing could be further from the truth. Still, she asked, \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it was a shock, his suddenly getting married like that, without any of the family even knowing or being there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with your brother, and everything to do with us.\u201d Olivia found herself growing irritated with both Justine and herself. It shouldn\u2019t be so difficult to tell your child she was deeply loved.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mother, don\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about the fact that I\u2019m seeing Warren and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with your boyfriend, either.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter laughed. \u201cBoyfriend? You make me sound sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine,\u201d Olivia said, trying to control her irritation. \u201cAs I told you, this isn\u2019t about your brother, your boyfriend, your job or anything else. I\u2019m your mother, and I want us to be able to talk, to share, to laugh together, and I\u2019m hoping you want that, too. I\u2019ve felt...I don\u2019t know, that we\u2019re somewhat estranged these days. Distant. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s happened, but I don\u2019t like it. I love you.\u201d</p><p>If Justine rolled her eyes, Olivia swore she\u2019d...well, she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do. Weep, maybe.</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t make a scornful face or flip remark; in fact she seemed to have difficulty taking in the words. She went still and after a moment, she met Olivia\u2019s gaze and whispered, \u201cI love you, too, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Olivia swallowed the lump in her throat and picked up her fork. Perhaps there was hope of reaching her daughter, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to discuss?\u201d Justine asked.</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t sure. She quickly reviewed a number of topics and remembered a notice in Wednesday\u2019s paper. Not wanting to mention the source for fear of diverting the conversation to her relationship with Jack Griffin, she spoke in an offhand manner. \u201cIt\u2019s your ten-year class reunion this year, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Justine set down her fork and sighed. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>Ten years? It hardly seemed possible. \u201cYou\u2019ll be attending, of course.\u201d</p><p>To Olivia\u2019s surprise, her daughter hesitated. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d But Olivia knew. Warren. It might embarrass Justine to show up with a man old enough to be her father. More likely, Warren would simply decline.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d probably have to go alone. It\u2019s bad enough that I\u2019m still single, but to come without a date\u2014I don\u2019t know if my ego can stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have several single friends who\u2019ll probably be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Justine said doubtfully.</p><p>This was exactly the sort of event that might open her daughter\u2019s eyes. Olivia hoped that if Justine saw her high-school friends, she\u2019d recognize how completely wrong Warren was for her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a meeting later in the week,\u201d Justine said.</p><p>Olivia remembered that her daughter had been a senior class officer. Surely she\u2019d be involved in planning the reunion. Since Justine was the local bank manager, the reunion committee would likely welcome her expertise with finances.</p><p>\u201cWill you be helping?\u201d Olivia pressed.</p><p>Justine sighed. \u201cProbably,\u201d she said in a resigned voice. Then she brightened. \u201cDo you remember Julie Wyatt and Annie Willoughby? I haven\u2019t seen either of them in years and they both live right here in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Olivia remembered both families well.</p><p>\u201cSeth Gunderson still lives in town, too,\u201d Justine murmured.</p><p>Olivia remembered Seth because he\u2019d been Jordan\u2019s best friend. He\u2019d been fishing with his father in Alaska at the time of her son\u2019s accident. Olivia had never forgotten the letter the thirteen-year-old boy had written her and Stan after he\u2019d learned of Jordan\u2019s death. The few short lines, a simple expression of grief and condolence, had touched her heart.</p><p>\u201cI always liked Seth,\u201d Olivia said thoughtfully. \u201cWhatever became of him?\u201d</p><p>Justine shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I know he still fishes in Alaska every summer, which means he probably won\u2019t be home for the reunion.\u201d</p><p>That saddened her. If Olivia were to handpick a husband for her daughter, she\u2019d choose a man like Seth.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t, Mom.\u201d Justine good-naturedly waved her finger. \u201cI can see the wheels turning in your head. You want to link me up with Seth, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first of all, he hasn\u2019t got a brain in his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Justine, that\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that ever interested him was sports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, he was good at sports.\u201d Seth had been the star football and basketball player through all four years of high school.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fisherman, for crying out loud!\u201d</p><p>Olivia frowned; she hadn\u2019t raised her daughter to be a snob. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard worker, Justine, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to Warren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Olivia refused to get drawn into that argument. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, he lives on his boat at the marina. I like Seth, don\u2019t get me wrong, but he\u2019s a big oaf. I haven\u2019t talked to him once since we graduated and I sincerely doubt we have anything more in common than we did in high school.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed inwardly. \u201cSweetheart, I didn\u2019t mean to suggest that Seth is the right man for you.\u201d Well, yes, she did, but she could hardly admit it. \u201cSomeday you\u2019ll find the one, and in fact you may have already.\u201d She had to grit her teeth to say it, but if Justine married Warren, Olivia would somehow manage to welcome him into the family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her daughter looked away. \u201cWhen James first called to tell me he and Selina were married\u2014and that she\u2019s pregnant\u2014I was so relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved?\u201d That was a curious reaction.</p><p>\u201cIt took the pressure off me. I know you want grandchildren and I want you to have them.\u201d She straightened and met Olivia\u2019s gaze. \u201cBut unfortunately, you won\u2019t get them from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen to me, Mom, please, just this once. I have no intention of ever marrying or having children. I realize you\u2019re concerned about my relationship with Warren, but you don\u2019t need to be. He treats me well and I enjoy his company most of the time, but I\u2019m not serious about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get married?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI know I\u2019m a disappointment to you and I\u2019m sorry, but please accept that I\u2019m just not interested in being a wife or a mother.\u201d</p><p>Olivia let the words sink into her heart, then nodded. \u201cI said it earlier and I meant it. I love you, Justine, not for what you do but for who you are.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter blinked back tears and lowered her head in order to hide the emotion from Olivia, but it was too late. She saw.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Then as if nothing noteworthy had transpired between them, they went back to eating their salads.</p><p>Every afternoon as Cecilia arrived for work, she looked across Cedar Cove to the Bremerton shipyard, where the George Washington was still berthed. It\u2019d been more than a week since her dinner with Ian and she hadn\u2019t heard a word from him. Before he\u2019d left her that night, he\u2019d promised to get in touch prior to sailing. Apparently the aircraft carrier was still undergoing repairs.</p><p>Cecilia knew she had no right to feel disappointed that he hadn\u2019t called. He didn\u2019t have any reason to contact her, other than to leave her the keys to his car.</p><p>The dinner and movie had been wonderful; the lovemaking, too. Until he\u2019d abruptly left, Cecilia had begun to feel that they\u2019d made a breakthrough in their relationship. Now she wasn\u2019t sure what to think. And she was horrified that they\u2019d done something as foolish as having unprotected sex. Granted, the likelihood of her being pregnant was very slight, but anyone might figure she\u2019d learned her lesson the first time. Apparently not. When she was in his arms, she\u2019d felt desired\u2014and reassured. Safe. Then he\u2019d dressed and run out as if he couldn\u2019t get away fast enough.</p><p>Now this silence. She didn\u2019t understand any of it.</p> <p>Perhaps Ian was waiting for her to call him. She couldn\u2019t remember exactly what they\u2019d said before he walked out the door. Nothing of importance. Nothing she could even remember. All she could think at the time was that she didn\u2019t want him to leave, but couldn\u2019t ask him to stay, either.</p><p>The more she thought about phoning him, the more appealing the idea became. By the end of her shift on Monday night, she\u2019d decided to call Ian first thing after her classes on Tuesday.</p><p>All morning Cecilia found herself eyeing the time. She had no idea what Ian\u2019s work schedule was. She hoped he\u2019d be available, but if not, she could always leave him a message.</p><p>She knew he was living on base and had a cell phone; she\u2019d written the number in her address book more than a year ago. She called from a pay phone on the community college campus. The phone rang four times and then she got his voice mail, inviting her to leave a message.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she said, worried now that she might be doing the wrong thing. \u201cIt\u2019s Cecilia...I hadn\u2019t heard from you and was wondering if you\u2019d changed your mind about the car...which is fine. I mean, I don\u2019t need it or anything. My car\u2019s running great. I\u2019ll talk to you later\u2014that is, if you still want to talk to me.\u201d The last part came out sounding defensive. He\u2019d wanted her badly enough earlier, but apparently sex was all he\u2019d been after. She quickly hung up the receiver and felt foolish, wishing now that she hadn\u2019t given in to the impulse.</p><p>Wednesday afternoon when she showed up for work, Cecilia was convinced that Ian wanted nothing more to do with her. Just as the dinner hour was picking up and she was at her busiest, her father appeared.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a call for you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart raced. \u201cMe?\u201d It had to be Ian. No one else would think to contact her here.</p> <p>\u201cYou can take it at the bar,\u201d he told her, glancing around for their boss.</p><p>Cecilia quickly abandoned her duties and hurried in. Her hands were moist, her mouth dry with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cThis is Cecilia Randall,\u201d she said into the mouthpiece, eagerly anticipating Ian\u2019s voice.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t her husband on the other end of the line. Instead, Andrew Lackey answered.</p><p>\u201cWe met not long ago, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Where\u2019s Ian?\u201d He might have been transferred again. The Navy did that, often without rhyme or reason\u2014at least in her opinion.</p><p>\u201cListen, I thought you should know. Ian\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing too serious. He took a tumble and wrenched his back. Apparently he hit his head, too, because he has a concussion. They\u2019re keeping him for observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. I just thought you\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they\u2019d finished the conversation, Cecilia walked over to her father. \u201cIan\u2019s been hurt...I\u2019m going to the hospital. Find someone to cover for me, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. You go, and I\u2019ll hold down the fort.\u201d</p><p>Grateful, she smiled at her father and impulsively hugged him. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d The tears sprang to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, none of that. Now, give Ian my best and let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said and hurriedly reached for her coat and purse.</p><p>The drive to the Navy Hospital in Bremerton seemed to take forever. Her car belched thick smoke as she turned off the freeway and headed for the extensive parking lot outside the hospital.</p><p>She quickly found out where she needed to go. Breathless, Cecilia charged into the elevator. Once she\u2019d located his room, she paused in the hallway for a moment, just long enough to brush a hand through her hair and draw in a deep breath. Then she knocked at the door.</p><p>No one answered, so she opened it and stepped inside. At her first sight of her husband, Cecilia couldn\u2019t prevent an exclamation of shock. Andrew had led her to believe that Ian had suffered a minor fall, that the only reason he\u2019d been hospitalized was as a precaution. One quick look told her his injuries were far worse than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Ian lifted his bandaged head and when he saw who it was, he groaned.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, moving fully into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he demanded, and it was plain she was the last person he wanted to see.</p><p>\u201cI-I...Andrew called me, and...\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and winced; no wonder, she thought. One side of his face was swollen and badly bruised. His left eye was completely shut and there was a bandage around his left arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other guy look like?\u201d she asked, hoping a light approach would relax him.</p><p>He ignored the question.</p><p>\u201cIan...what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come here,\u201d he returned gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI know. I came because I wanted to make sure you were all right.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that she\u2019d risked her job to do so. Her father had said he\u2019d cover for her, but in her rush, she hadn\u2019t spoken to her boss and had left without permission.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m just hunky-dory, so you can leave now.\u201d</p><p>His words stung. \u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t figured it out, I\u2019m not exactly in the mood for company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered and retreated a step.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, unbearably hurt that Ian would speak to her this way. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you feel, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he shouted, pointing at the door.</p><p>Turning on her heel, Cecilia ran out of the room. If he didn\u2019t want her concern or...or her love, that was fine with her.</p><p>\u201cCecilia!\u201d he called after her, but she resolutely ignored him. She hurried to the elevator, pushing the button with more force than necessary. Maybe it was time to see her attorney, after all. She refused to stay married to a man who treated her like this.</p><p>Eight</p><p>The March rains had arrived, and the last thing Justine Lockhart wanted was to sit in a stuffy room with a bunch of classmates, planning an event she probably wouldn\u2019t even attend. But that was exactly what she\u2019d have to do. As Justine had predicted, she\u2019d been contacted by the reunion committee and asked if she\u2019d be willing to help. In a moment of weakness, she\u2019d agreed.</p><p>Unfortunately, Justine had made the mistake of mentioning the reunion to Warren. He\u2019d refused to even consider going with her. After all the times she\u2019d sat through dead boring meetings waiting for him or played hostess to a group of his business colleagues, she\u2019d assumed he\u2019d do this one small thing for her. She\u2019d obviously assumed wrong.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to smooth over their spat with a pretty sapphire necklace and an invitation to dinner. In the past, Justine had accepted his jewel-encrusted apologies, and they\u2019d gone on as before. Justine was well acquainted with Warren\u2019s faults; she usually chose to ignore them. He could be entertaining and he tended to indulge her in return for her company. That might sound calculating but it was an arrangement that suited them both. Besides, for all his money, he had few friends. And neither of them was in this relationship for the long haul. Expectations were clear.</p><p>The planning meeting was held at the home of Lana Sullivan, who\u2019d married Jay Rothchild. In the ten years since she\u2019d graduated, Justine hadn\u2019t spoken to Lana once.</p><p>\u201cJustine!\u201d Lana greeted her enthusiastically, hugging her as though they were long-lost friends. \u201cCome in! Seth\u2019s here and so is Mary.\u201d</p><p>Justine glanced into the living room and saw that Mary O\u2019Donnell was several months pregnant. \u201cGood to see you Mary,\u201d Justine said, smiling, then nodded at Seth.</p><p>The school\u2019s star athlete hadn\u2019t changed much\u2014physically, at least. He was just as tall and muscular, although he\u2019d filled out and had a more mature look. He remained strikingly blond. She didn\u2019t remember him being this handsome, but her high-school years were pretty much a blur.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing these days?\u201d Mary asked.</p><p>Justine shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m working at First National.\u201d She\u2019d graduated from college with a degree in history; unfortunately, this hadn\u2019t translated into an employable skill.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re the manager,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d It surprised her he knew that. He wasn\u2019t a customer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ill at ease, Justine claimed a chair across from Mary, tucked her hands under her thighs and made polite conversation with the small group, declining a cup of coffee. She wasn\u2019t sure when the strained atmosphere shifted into comfortable exchange, but it did. Soon she found herself laughing with these people who were little more than familiar strangers.</p><p>Once the schedule of events had been decided and committees formed, the meeting was over. Justine left at the same time as Seth.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d he asked, to her astonishment. He dangled his car keys as he waited for her reply.</p><p>Justine realized this was more than a mere inquiry; it was an invitation. \u201cNo, as a matter of fact, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Warren had suggested she phone when she was finished with her meeting\u2014he\u2019d said he might be able to take her out for a drink\u2014but she was in no hurry to do so. \u201cWould you like some company?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As Justine had discovered early in the evening, Seth wasn\u2019t at all the way she remembered him. It hadn\u2019t taken her long to see that her view of him as an empty-headed jock was completely off-base. He had a sharp wit and the most wonderful, hearty laugh. She\u2019d liked his ideas for the reunion, which revealed imagination combined with practicality.</p><p>They drove in separate cars to D.D.\u2019s on the Cove, a fashionable seafood restaurant on the pier, close to the marina. The restaurant had opened that summer, and Justine had gone there for lunch but never dinner.</p><p>Since it was already past eight, they were seated right away. A prime table, too, by one of the windows overlooking the harbor, where they could see the lights from the Bremerton shipyard blinking across the cove. Justine glanced quickly at the menu and made her choice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe we graduated ten years ago, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cNobody looks that different. Well, except for Mary...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have mixed feelings about the reunion,\u201d Seth confessed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked with some puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cIf I go at all, I\u2019ll probably end up going alone. It kind of wrecks my image, you know?\u201d He grinned, and Justine couldn\u2019t keep from smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly had girls buzzing around you while we were in school,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cExcept the one I really wanted.\u201d His deep-blue eyes held hers.</p><p>\u201cWho are you kidding? You could\u2019ve dated anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot you,\u201d he said, still watching her.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she said in shock. \u201cYou wanted to date me?\u201d</p><p>This had to be a joke, and not a funny one. She was about to say so when it suddenly occurred to her that he might be serious.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked in a weak voice.</p><p>\u201cI had the biggest crush on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once did you ask me out,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWould you have gone with me if I had?\u201d</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>\u201cYou saw me as a big dunce, and I don\u2019t blame you. Whenever I was around you, I got so flustered I couldn\u2019t speak. Anytime you were in the vicinity, I was in trouble. I couldn\u2019t say or do anything right. Then I\u2019d feel like such an idiot I\u2019d beat myself up about it for weeks afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a clue,\u201d Justine said faintly, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said with a chuckle. He returned his attention to the menu, as if he intended to say nothing more on this subject.</p><p>The waitress came with a basket of warm bread, promptly took their order and left. Justine reached for a slice of sourdough. Apparently Seth\u2019s \u201ccrush\u201d had long since faded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably be attending the reunion alone, too,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d He made that sound entirely implausible. \u201cI thought you and that Saget fellow are an item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are...sort of.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how to explain her relationship with Warren and decided it was best not to try.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating other guys?\u201d</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t think she wanted Seth to know she was available. His confession had a curious effect on her\u2014it left her with the almost overwhelming urge to laugh. All through high school, she\u2019d felt tall and awkward, on the very fringes of the popular crowd. She\u2019d been too smart and serious for social success as defined in high school.</p><p>Seth tore off a piece of bread and smiled sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You don\u2019t need to answer that. I\u2019ve made you uncomfortable, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d she reassured him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I never dreamed...You could\u2019ve gone out with any girl you wanted!\u201d She shook her head again. \u201cI didn\u2019t date much in high school. It was a bad time for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Jordan?\u201d</p><p>So few people mentioned her twin\u2019s name that it stunned her to hear it spoken. She waited for the shock to dissipate before answering. \u201cPartly. We were close, you know, and well, nothing was the same after he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, either.\u201d</p><p>Naturally Justine knew Seth and Jordan had been good friends, but she hadn\u2019t anticipated that her brother\u2019s death would\u2019ve made such a lasting impression on him.</p><p>\u201cI used to think if I\u2019d been with him that day, he wouldn\u2019t have drowned.\u201d</p><p>Until Seth said the words, Justine had forgotten that this very thought had passed through her mind the day of the accident. She felt tears stinging her eyes and looked away, blinking furiously.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be best if we didn\u2019t discuss Jordan,\u201d she finally said, still staring out the window, although the lights of Bremerton were an indistinct haze. \u201cThe accident was a long time ago.\u201d It had been the turning point in her life. She\u2019d lost not only her twin brother but her family, her security, her entire sense of self. Since the age of thirteen, she\u2019d staggered through life looking for purpose\u2014for something that would root her once again.</p><p>They were both quiet, as if caught in the memories of the past, then made a determined effort to move forward. By the time their meal arrived, they were chatting again, their conversation light and relaxed. They lingered over coffee, and he seemed as reluctant to leave as she was. When D.D.\u2019s closed at ten, Seth offered to show her his boat, the Silver Belle. Justine agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much.\u201d</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t expect that it would be; still, she was curious. They walked toward the marina. She hunched her shoulders against the cold drizzle that had begun while they sat in the restaurant. They stepped onto the floating concrete dock, which was slick with rain. The lights reflecting off the black water guided her as Seth skillfully led the way. He moved easily along the rocking walkway, and was several feet ahead of her before he realized that she lagged behind. When he noticed, he offered her his hand. She was amazed by the strength she felt in his fingers. His hands were those of a man who knew the value of physical work. This observation reminded her of what her mother had said. He\u2019s a hard worker, Justine, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.</p><p>During their dinner discussion, she\u2019d learned that Seth not only lived at the marina, but helped manage it in the winter months. In the summers, he flew to Alaska and fished on one of the huge commercial vessels there. His father and grandfather had been fishermen before him. As Seth put it, fishing was in his blood.</p><p>He stepped onto the twenty-two-foot sailboat and helped Justine onboard. As soon as she was secure, he led her belowdecks. His quarters were cramped but tidy.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d he asked, as he reached for the kettle.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve had enough, thanks.\u201d She didn\u2019t want him to go to the trouble, especially since she didn\u2019t plan on staying long.</p><p>He stood with his hands tucked in his back pockets, looking indecisive. The tour of his home had taken all of about one minute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll escort you back to your car,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Justine was grateful; she didn\u2019t relish walking back along the floating dock on her own. Once again Seth took her hand, and neither spoke until they reached her vehicle. Before unlocking the door, she turned to him. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cI enjoyed dinner and seeing your boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed spending the evening with you.\u201d He retreated a step. \u201cAre you going to any more of the planning meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, but I think so. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will as long as I\u2019m in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Seth would be in Alaska fishing at the time of the reunion. Suddenly the thought of his not being there dejected her. When she\u2019d first arrived at Lana\u2019s, she was so certain she had nothing in common with any of these people. She\u2019d been delighted to discover that she did. With one of them, anyway...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that?\u201d Seth stared down at her.</p><p>Justine nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Then, without giving her a chance to guess his intention, he drew her into his arms and slowly lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>Very much aware of what she was doing, Justine closed her eyes and raised her face to meet his kiss. His lips settled warm and moist over hers. Wrapped in his embrace, she was astonished to realize that she wanted this. Wanted it badly...</p><p>There was excitement in his kiss, and gentleness. She hadn\u2019t expected a man of his size to be so...tender, but then Seth Gunderson had been full of surprises all evening.</p><p>The George Washington was gone and without a word from Ian. The fact that he\u2019d left without notifying her was perfectly okay, Cecilia told herself bitterly. Their last meeting had been so horrible she didn\u2019t care if she ever saw her soon-to-be ex-husband again.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, kiddo?\u201d her father asked Saturday morning when Cecilia dropped in at the restaurant to pick up her paycheck.</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d he said, and held up his hands as though warding off trouble.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to growl at him, but lately her father had developed this irritating habit of trying to be her friend, her confidante, and she rejected both roles.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d he asked, obviously attempting to make conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhy the concern all of a sudden?\u201d she wanted to know. When she\u2019d first mentioned it, all the encouragement she\u2019d gotten was some offhand comment about how cool that was.</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d he said again. He turned away as if he regretted even asking.</p><p>Cecilia sighed, hardly understanding herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...I didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded.\u201d</p><p>Bobby stared at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you, kid? You\u2019ve been in kind of a bad mood the last couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, seemed about to protest, then shrugged. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been working late, then getting up early for school.\u201d A feeble explanation, but the most she was willing to give. Lack of sleep explained a lot, but not everything.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re still taking all those classes?\u201d He seemed to think she would\u2019ve lost interest by now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m still in school.\u201d And loving the challenge, despite the drain on her time and energy.</p><p>\u201cIan around these days?\u201d her father asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d she said, speaking in a nonchalant manner. \u201cThe George Washington left earlier this week.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as though she could ignore the fact. The media\u2014both the local paper and the Seattle dailies, plus the TV news\u2014had made a big issue of the repaired aircraft carrier departing for the second time within a month. Not only that, Cedar Cove had been full of talk about it.</p><p>\u201cYou speak to him lately?\u201d</p> <p>Cecilia noticed that Bobby stood several feet away from her. He seemed prepared to make a quick getaway if she snapped at him again.</p><p>\u201cIan and I are getting a divorce,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he was quick to tell her, \u201cbut I thought, you know, that you might be reconciling.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia had started to believe the very same thing. After the night they\u2019d gone to dinner, and the lovemaking, she\u2019d been hopeful. Excited. It was similar to the way she\u2019d felt when they\u2019d first begun seeing each other. Then, when he\u2019d left her apartment that night, everything had changed, and she couldn\u2019t understand why.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d work it out,\u201d Bobby told her, \u201cyou and him.\u201d</p> <p>Resentment swelled up inside Cecilia. \u201cI wish you and Mom had tried harder, too, but wishing doesn\u2019t do me a damn bit of good, does it?\u201d With that, she grabbed her paycheck and slammed out the door.</p><p>She was angry, without justification. Her father irritated her, her co-workers annoyed her\u2014everyone did lately\u2014and that wasn\u2019t like her. Bobby only wanted to be helpful and she\u2019d immediately found fault with him. Not since her pregnancy had Cecilia been so out of sorts. She didn\u2019t have that excuse this time; her period had showed up right on schedule\u2014thank God. Her bad mood was simply...a bad mood, she decided.</p><p>After depositing her paycheck, she went to the grocery store and picked up the few items she\u2019d need to see her through the week. Although it was an extravagance she couldn\u2019t afford, she purchased a bouquet of spring flowers\u2014for Allison. She hadn\u2019t visited her baby\u2019s grave in almost a month. Staying away was difficult for her. She\u2019d had to make a real effort not to visit the cemetery every day. In the beginning she had.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to be more than a good mother; she\u2019d wanted to give her daughter everything she herself had never had. Not material things, but attention and love and security. As it happened, she couldn\u2019t give Allison the most fundamental thing of all. Life itself. Her baby had been cheated from the first, and Cecilia, with all her good intentions, had failed. Rationally she knew she wasn\u2019t to blame, but emotionally...She couldn\u2019t get over the feeling that there must have been something she\u2019d neglected to do. Something she should\u2019ve done. The doctor had said that was a common reaction in such cases and had urged her to seek counselling. Cecilia hadn\u2019t been able to face it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t head for the cemetery until midafternoon. With tears in her eyes, she strolled along the pathway that led to the section of the cemetery with Allison\u2019s grave site. She stopped now and again to brush leaves or grass from a headstone, checking names and dates, wondering about each lost life.</p><p>When she arrived at Allison\u2019s grave, Cecilia noticed the bouquet of fresh flowers. Yellow daisies, which just happened to be Cecilia\u2019s favorite.</p> <p>Ian. It could only be Ian.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t called to tell her he was being deployed, but he\u2019d been to visit their daughter. Cecilia crouched down and placed her own bouquet next to the one her husband had left. She touched the daisies with one fingertip, wondering if this was a message to her.</p><p>No, she decided, steeling herself against any lingering emotion. Ian had made it plain that he didn\u2019t want her in his life. He\u2019d wanted her body but not her. That message had come through loud and clear. He\u2019d asked her to leave his hospital room in terms she couldn\u2019t possibly misunderstand. And he hadn\u2019t phoned to apologize. Fine, dammit! She didn\u2019t need his car, anyway.</p><p>The more Cecilia insisted she didn\u2019t care about Ian, the less she convinced herself. Not that she wanted to care. This depression and anger was all his fault. Once again she\u2019d allowed him into her bed...and her heart. And now she was suffering the consequences.</p><p>It hurt that he\u2019d left Bremerton without so much as a word to her. Not goodbye, not I\u2019m sorry, nothing. He\u2019d been rude and unreasonable, and this wasn\u2019t the first time, either.</p><p>Back at her small apartment, Cecilia tried to do her English homework but her mind repeatedly wandered away from the English Romantic poets and down paths she\u2019d prefer to avoid.</p><p>When the phone rang, she was jolted by the sudden noise. With an exaggerated sigh, she picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said in a dull voice.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d came a cheerful woman\u2019s voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but I figured it was time I introduced myself. I\u2019m Cathy Lackey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCathy Lackey, Andrew\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s friend. \u201cThey\u2019re deployed, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days ago. Ian didn\u2019t phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tried to sound unconcerned, despite the pain it\u2019d caused her.</p><p>\u201cThat coward! I\u2019d like to give him a swift kick in the behind,\u201d Cathy muttered.</p><p>For the first time all day, Cecilia grinned. \u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I realize we aren\u2019t even acquainted yet, but I\u2019d like it if we could be friends. Andrew and Ian are such good buddies and...well, we were only stationed here a few weeks ago, and I haven\u2019t met very many people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know a lot of people my age, either.\u201d Not unless she counted the women she worked with, and Cecilia had never truly fit in with the group at The Captain\u2019s Galley. Because she tended to be quiet and withdrawn, and her childhood had been so chaotic, she\u2019d always had trouble making friends. \u201cBut sure,\u201d she added, \u201clet\u2019s get together sometime.\u201d</p><p>Cathy would be able to tell her about Ian, too; that thought didn\u2019t escape her.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Cathy seemed pleased. \u201cAre you doing anything tonight?\u201d</p><p>It was one of those rare Saturday nights that Cecilia didn\u2019t have to work. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could rent a movie and make popcorn.\u201d</p><p>That was about all Cecilia could afford. \u201cI\u2019d like that. Do you want to come here or should I drive over to your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll join you, if that\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Cecilia glanced around the apartment to be sure it was clean. She\u2019d run the vacuum and straighten her books and papers; other than that, it was acceptable.</p><p>\u201cCan you drive me back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cDo you need a ride over here, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got Ian\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>The words struck her like a lightning bolt. Before she could react, Cathy was asking, \u201cIs six too early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she managed. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the keys and the insurance papers and everything then,\u201d Cathy continued.</p><p>\u201cThe...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Ian\u2019s car. He was supposed to call you, but when I didn\u2019t hear from you, I figured he\u2019d lost his nerve. Men!\u201d Cathy giggled and Cecilia found herself frowning, hardly making sense of all this.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he said I should use his car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe insisted on it,\u201d Cathy assured her.</p><p>Cecilia wanted to believe it, but wondered if she should. He\u2019d sucker-punched her once already and she wasn\u2019t up to another round. \u201cWas this before or after he went into the hospital?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter,\u201d Cathy said. \u201cHe gave me the keys himself and asked me to make sure you got the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cecilia said softly, and exhaled a long, slow breath. Despite her refusal to accept the use of his vehicle, he wanted her to drive it anyway. He did care. He did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at six. And I\u2019ll get a video on the way\u2014a comedy all right? What about Notting Hill? Have you seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I never did,\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>This latest recipe Charlotte had picked up\u2014chocolate-chip pecan pie\u2014was the best. She\u2019d got it at the funeral for her next-door neighbor\u2019s elderly father. There\u2019d been a good turnout, but that wasn\u2019t surprising since Herbert had lived in Cedar Cove for eighty-one years. The pie would make a perfect Easter dinner dessert. She\u2019d bake her usual coconut cake, too. Her family would demand that, although she was certain Olivia and Justine didn\u2019t really understand how much work went into that darn cake.</p><p>Charlotte believed in doing things the old-fashioned way. She wouldn\u2019t use a cake mix if her life depended on it. Oh no, she baked from scratch, just like her mother had. And her grandmother. The coconut cake took three days and started with fresh coconut, but the result was worth all the effort. Tradition had a strong hold on her.</p><p>Thursday morning, as was her habit, she went to the Senior Center and visited with her knitting group. Her dearest friends sat around the large table, each working on her current project. Some knitted for their grandchildren, and others worked on projects for foster children or for charity. There was nothing more comforting than a sweater or blanket created with loving hands and a loving heart.</p><p>\u201cHello, Charlotte,\u201d Evelyn greeted her. She was almost finished with the afghan she was knitting for her daughter. The pattern was a lovely one and it had already been completed by several others in the group.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Jack Griffin lately?\u201d Evelyn asked. Despite reassurances, she continued to have her suspicions regarding The Chronicle\u2019s editor. Evelyn was like that\u2014especially after she\u2019d learned how to log on to the Internet. She had doubts about practically everyone, and for the most part Charlotte chose to overlook her friend\u2019s lack of faith in others.</p><p>\u201cYesterday afternoon,\u201d Charlotte said conversationally. She\u2019d been putting in a lot of extra hours on the Seniors\u2019 Page and was pleased with her efforts. Jack had liked her ideas and suggested she write a weekly column for the paper. At first Charlotte had balked. She wasn\u2019t much of a writer, and she hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d find enough news or ideas to fill a weekly column. But Jack had such confidence in her she\u2019d decided to give it a try. Her first column had appeared on the Seniors\u2019 Page the week before and had included a recipe, some local history and a few recommendations, gleaned from Olivia\u2019s friend Grace, of new books available from the library.</p><p>\u201cI tried your recipe,\u201d Helen told her, needles flying. She was working on a sweater for her fifteen-year-old granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cThe cheddar biscuits?\u201d When it came to recipes, Charlotte was already three months ahead. Never lacking for new ones, she\u2019d found it difficult to decide which to print first. \u201cOh, ladies, just wait until I tell you about the chocolate-chip pecan pie I tasted this week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHerbert Monk\u2019s funeral?\u201d Bess asked.</p><p>\u201cI heard about it,\u201d Helen said. \u201cWord spreads when something really good is served at one of the wakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I ask is that someone make that broccoli lasagna for my wake,\u201d Evelyn tossed in. \u201cThen everyone will know I\u2019ve died and gone to heaven.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s your friend Tom?\u201d Helen put in.</p><p>Charlotte was beginning to feel guilty about Tom Harding. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him all week,\u201d she confessed. She\u2019d been so busy working on the Seniors\u2019 Page, she hadn\u2019t gone to the convalescent center.</p><p>On her last visit, Tom had been rather subdued. She\u2019d attempted to lighten his spirits, without success, although he sat and listened and occasionally responded. As always, Charlotte had chatted about all kinds of things. She told him she had his key in a safe place and he seemed reassured by that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing well,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>Laura was a woman in the know. With seven children living in the community, she knew more about what was happening in Cedar Cove than the mayor.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Charlotte hoped it wasn\u2019t serious. If so, she supposed Janet Lester would have called her.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to check on him yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to do that this very afternoon,\u201d Charlotte said, a bit annoyed that Laura had been the one to tell her about her friend. Really, though, Charlotte had no one to blame but herself. It was just that she\u2019d been so busy lately.</p><p>She stayed for an hour, visiting and knitting, then packed up her needles and headed for the convalescent center. Not bothering to stop at Janet\u2019s office, she went straight to Tom\u2019s room.</p><p>She\u2019d learned from Janet that Tom had originally chosen Cedar Cove. He\u2019d never indicated why. The storage unit remained a mystery. He hadn\u2019t explained that, and when she\u2019d attempted to ask him about it, he\u2019d pretended to fall asleep.</p><p>She\u2019d brought her latest column to read aloud, plus a slice of the pecan pie she\u2019d saved just for him. This would, she hoped, suffice as an apology for her lack of attention these last two weeks.</p> <p>To her surprise, Charlotte found Tom\u2019s room empty. There\u2019d been talk about getting him into physical therapy and she suspected that was where he\u2019d been taken.</p><p>Anxious about Tom\u2019s condition, she hurried toward Janet\u2019s office. Charlotte knocked politely at the half-open door.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d Janet immediately stood, averting her gaze. \u201cI should\u2019ve phoned you earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly should have.\u201d It was an embarrassment to find out from one of her friends that Tom wasn\u2019t doing well.</p><p>\u201cI do apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe it was another stroke.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte gasped. Poor, poor Tom. Another stroke would certainly compound his health problems.</p> <p>\u201cHow bad was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad?\u201d Janet asked, sitting back down. \u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>Charlotte shook her head, but she was beginning to get the feeling that this was worse than she\u2019d imagined. Pulling out a chair, she sat down, too.</p><p>\u201cTom died late last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDied?\u201d It shouldn\u2019t come as a shock, considering his age and his poor health. Nevertheless, Charlotte felt she\u2019d lost a good friend. \u201cI...didn\u2019t realize. I didn\u2019t...\u201d At this stage of her life, death was a common occurrence. She\u2019d buried her husband years earlier, and every day, it seemed, there was an obituary for someone she knew. Still, the death of this man hit her hard.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Janet asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Charlotte insisted, but she wasn\u2019t. Her hands trembled and she felt chilled.</p><p>\u201cI know he appreciated your friendship.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded, scrabbling inside her purse for a handkerchief to dab her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour visits meant the world to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks\u2014I should\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, you couldn\u2019t possibly have known,\u201d Janet said gently.</p><p>Charlotte knew that was true, but she couldn\u2019t squelch the feeling that she\u2019d let Tom Harding down. Before her work with the newspaper, she\u2019d stopped by at least once a week. Tom had been the first person to hear her initial column. She\u2019d read it to him herself and he\u2019d smiled and approved of her efforts. Jack Griffin, on the other hand, had taken his sharp red pencil to her work and cut away at it until she\u2019d barely recognized it as her own. Granted, she knew she wasn\u2019t an experienced writer, certainly not a professional, but it had wounded her pride. When she\u2019d complained to Tom, he\u2019d given her a sympathetic look, which was just what she\u2019d needed.</p><p>That was the last time she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>Janet reached for her phone and called down to the kitchen for tea. Five minutes later, one of the staff carried a tray into the office.</p><p>\u201cHe was a special man,\u201d Charlotte said, grateful for the hot, comforting tea. It helped ease the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYes, he was,\u201d Janet agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do now?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>Janet stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cWith the key? Remember he gave me the key to that storage unit?\u201d</p><p>Janet frowned. \u201cI guess the state will want it. You\u2019d better return it as soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Jack Griffin was strongly attracted to Olivia Lockhart, and that wasn\u2019t a good sign. Oh, hell, maybe it was. Still, pursuing this attraction meant losing emotional independence, and he wasn\u2019t sure he liked that. He couldn\u2019t help it, though\u2014he found himself making excuses to talk to her. To learn more about her.</p><p>After the fiasco of their first date, he hadn\u2019t made a point of asking her out again. Mostly, he was afraid she\u2019d turn him down flat and, frankly, he wouldn\u2019t blame her. He didn\u2019t want to give her any opportunity to reject him. Instead, he made excuses to be around her.</p><p>Jack Griffin spent many more hours at the courthouse than his job required. Plus, he made sure he was in the Safeway store every Saturday morning on the off-chance that he might run into her again. He had two or three times, and they\u2019d ended up having coffee. Damn, but he liked her. Judge Lockhart was down-to-earth, smart and sexy. What got him, what really got him, was that she didn\u2019t seem to know it.</p><p>Friday afternoon, on his way home, Jack stopped at the dry cleaner. He rushed from the parking lot through the pulsing rain, cursing the foul weather under his breath. The skies had been a depressing lead-gray all week, with intermittent showers. The only bright spot on the horizon\u2014so to speak\u2014was a story he was writing about the Annual Seagull Calling Contest, being held that night.</p><p>He raced into the dry cleaner and nearly collided with Olivia. The shock of seeing her destroyed any chance of being clever. Her name was all he could manage. \u201cOlivia.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was infectious. \u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised. I do get my clothes cleaned regularly, you know.\u201d Her purse sat open on the counter.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Now that was brilliant. He nearly rolled his eyes. With other women he was a witty conversationalist, but Olivia unnerved him.</p><p>Duck-Hwan Hyo, who\u2019d come from Korea in the 1960s, owned the dry cleaning shop. Jack had written an article about Duck-Hwan soon after he\u2019d started as editor, impressed by the hardworking immigrant family. As soon as Duck-Hwan saw Jack, he rushed to give him the fastest possible service, in the process ignoring Olivia.</p><p>Jack felt he should explain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she assured him, \u201cI\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d</p><p>Friday night and in no hurry. Jack reached for his wallet and paid his bill, the whole time wondering if Olivia\u2019s response was her way of telling him she didn\u2019t have any plans for the evening. It almost seemed she was hinting that he should ask her out. Could that really be the case?</p><p>With the hanger for his dry cleaning hooked around his index finger, he waited for Olivia.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re not going to the high-school theater?\u201d Jack had figured that a good portion of the town would be turning up for the event.</p><p>\u201cThe Seagull Calling Contest is tonight?\u201d</p><p>Before he could stop himself, he asked, \u201cWould you like to go? With me?\u201d He clarified his question so she wouldn\u2019t just assume he had an extra ticket he was willing to pass along.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, agreeing instantly.</p><p>Jack was tempted to ask if she was sure, especially after their last date, then decided not to sabotage his good luck. \u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s terrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for you to ask me out again,\u201d Olivia said casually, walking toward the door. \u201cWhat time should I be ready?\u201d</p><p>She was joking, she had to be, but rather than leap up and click his heels in sheer jubilation, Jack merely checked his watch. \u201cIs an hour too soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Since he\u2019d been lucky once, he was willing to try for twice. \u201cHow about dinner afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Taco Shack?\u201d</p><p>He could see she was teasing him, but he let it pass. \u201cIf you want. Otherwise I suggest D.D.\u2019s on the Cove or The Captain\u2019s Galley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m coming up in the world,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll let you decide.\u201d</p><p>What Olivia didn\u2019t know, because he didn\u2019t quite have the guts to tell her, was that dinner at local restaurants, including the more upscale places, was in exchange for advertising. The newspaper often traded advertising space for a restaurant credit; being able to take advantage of that was one of the perks that came with his job. The Taco Shack, for instance, owed the newspaper several hundred dollars and there were only so many tacos Jack could eat all by himself.</p><p>They parted outside the dry cleaner, and Jack hurried to his old Taurus, his step lighter than it\u2019d been in months. Years.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, he\u2019d showered, changed clothes, cleaned out his car and was driving to Olivia\u2019s. She was ready, dressed in jeans and a hand-knit sweater and didn\u2019t bother with an umbrella. This was something he\u2019d noticed living in the Pacific Northwest. Few people carried umbrellas. Anyone who did was automatically tagged as a tourist.</p><p>By the time they arrived at the high-school auditorium, the place was packed. Because he was with the newspaper, a pair of front-row seats had been saved for him.</p><p>No sooner had they settled down than Roy and Corrie McAfee walked over. Jack knew the couple from an article he\u2019d written earlier in the year. Roy was a retired Seattle policeman who\u2019d started his own detective agency; his background and experience made him a much sought-after private investigator. His wife ran the office and worked as his assistant. Roy and Jack had hit it off and gotten together a couple of times after that. Roy was an ardent hiker and Jack, who\u2019d never been much of an outdoorsman, wanted to give it a try.</p><p>Roy reacted immediately to the fact that Olivia was with Jack.</p><p>\u201cHey, Judge, what are you doing with the likes of Griffin?\u201d he teased her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHaving a great time. Hello, Roy. Corrie.\u201d</p><p>Corrie took the empty seat beside Olivia, and Roy claimed the single one next to Jack. Before long, the two women were involved in a discussion of some sort, and Roy was talking to Jack about state politics. This wasn\u2019t exactly how Jack had pictured the evening, but on second thought it took the pressure off him to be a brilliant conversationalist.</p><p>Just as Mayor Benson walked onto the stage, Olivia leaned toward Jack and whispered, \u201cIs it okay if Roy and Corrie join us for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Jack hesitated. \u201cIs it okay with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Apparently she didn\u2019t, because she leaned close to her friend and he watched Corrie nod.</p><p>As he suspected, the evening\u2019s competition was entertaining. Jack learned that it had begun as a way to bring some laughter to a wet, gray spring. The contest had been going for a number of years. The rules were simple: Young and old did their utmost to sound like the cantankerous seagulls that populated Cedar Cove. Jack laughed, shouted, cheered and booed with the rest of the audience.</p><p>The winner, a fourteen-year-old boy, astonished everyone with his mimicry and won easily. Jack and Olivia walked close together as they filed out of the auditorium. He placed his hand protectively on her back\u2014and wished he had the nerve to do more, to take her arm in his.</p><p>They met Roy and Corrie at The Captain\u2019s Galley a few minutes later. A sober-faced young woman who looked somewhat familiar led them to their table and gave them menus. Almost by rote, she wished them an enjoyable meal and departed.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes widened; she was signaling that she couldn\u2019t discuss this. Not until later did it hit him. Their hostess was the woman who\u2019d been in court the first day he\u2019d seen Olivia. The woman she\u2019d prevented from filing for divorce. He\u2019d written about her\u2014she was the Divorce Denied wife.</p><p>\u201cHow about a bottle of wine?\u201d Roy suggested.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be in agreement. Jack studied his menu and let Roy do the ordering. When the waitress arrived with the wineglasses, he declined.</p><p>\u201cJust one glass,\u201d Roy protested.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d He didn\u2019t drink and he didn\u2019t make excuses.</p> <p>The restaurant had an excellent reputation, and Jack\u2019s meal certainly lived up to it. He ordered the fried oysters and Olivia had seafood fettuccine. After a congenial dinner, Roy and Corrie headed home while Jack and Olivia stayed for a second coffee.</p><p>The young hostess wandered past their table and Olivia glanced at Jack. \u201cYou recognize her now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, feeling a surge of sympathy for the woman, who seemed barely out of her teens. He\u2019d sat in court and listened to a tragic yet all-too-common story. A story he knew well, about a marriage that couldn\u2019t weather a true crisis. A couple separated by grief. He didn\u2019t know what had happened since that day in court or whether they\u2019d gone ahead with the proceedings. What he could see, just by looking at her, was that Cecilia Randall was very unhappy.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she recognized you?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Olivia shook her head. Jack didn\u2019t think she had, either.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me wonder,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>Jack could tell she was upset. \u201cYou think you made the wrong decision?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugged and stared down at her coffee. \u201cThe poor girl looks like she\u2019s got the weight of the world on her shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe she just had a bad night,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Olivia echoed, but Jack could tell she didn\u2019t believe that and neither did he.</p><p>When Seth Gunderson left for Alaska in the first week of April, Justine was relieved. It was better this way. She thought about him far too often, treasured every minute they\u2019d spent together. She didn\u2019t want to become involved with Seth. Didn\u2019t want to care about him, and most certainly didn\u2019t want to fall in love with him, but that was exactly what was happening\u2014had already happened.</p><p>After their impromptu dinner date, she\u2019d refused his next invitation. She knew trouble when she saw it, and was well aware of her own weakness. He wanted her and she, God help her, wanted him. But Justine was too smart to give in to those yearnings. She wasn\u2019t a woman ruled by emotions.</p><p>Seth, however, wasn\u2019t a man easily dismissed. He opened an account at First National Bank, and found an excuse to come in at least once a week. He didn\u2019t pressure her, didn\u2019t argue with her, didn\u2019t do anything out of the ordinary; he was just there. And one day she simply couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.</p><p>She followed him outside. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she demanded, standing in the parking lot, the sun burning off a thick fog, threatening to break through at any moment. Justine felt like weeping, but she was too damned angry to let him know how much he\u2019d disturbed her.</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t deny his intentions, but he met her anger with a gentleness that nearly broke her heart.</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to stop, I will,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she cried, and marched back into the bank. A week later, after seven sleepless nights, she went in search of him. Not knowing exactly where to find him, she walked down to the marina.</p><p>He appeared almost immediately, meeting her out on the pier, wearing his heavy wool jacket, a knit cap on his head. She stood with her back against the railing, and Seth smiled and wordlessly pressed his warm hand to her cold cheek.</p><p>Justine resisted the urge to close her eyes and lean into his hand. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that Warren Saget is the perfect man for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Justine wanted to stamp her foot the way a child does. She wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d come\u2014to assuage her longing to see him? To end this once and for all? But now that she was here, she knew it was a mistake.</p><p>\u201cWarren is older, mature and wealthy, and you\u2019re none of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She hated it that he so willingly accepted her arguments. It made everything ten times worse. \u201cWarren\u2019s a respected businessman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a fisherman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she cried, more angry with herself than with Seth.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s me you want,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Refusing to answer him, she\u2019d vaulted from the dock and run back to work. She hadn\u2019t seen him since. The only reason she knew he\u2019d left for Alaska was that she\u2019d heard someone at the bank mention it earlier in the week.</p><p>Friday afternoon Warren phoned her at work. \u201cHow about dinner?\u201d He sounded sure of himself, sure of her answer.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, Warren.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, uncomfortable silence. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d Which was a slight exaggeration. She did have a headache, but nothing a couple of aspirin and a few minutes with her eyes closed wouldn\u2019t cure.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it when Justine turned him down. Warren was a man accustomed to getting his own way. \u201cYou\u2019re still mad about that class reunion, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d As of this moment, Justine decided not to go. Seth might be there, and he made her weak in ways she didn\u2019t want to consider. One kiss had ruined her. One stupid kiss. Now, every time Warren attempted to touch her, she ran in the opposite direction. Seth Gunderson had a great deal to answer for.</p><p>\u201cI have a killer headache,\u201d she told him, exaggerating in order to avoid another confrontation.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can get you?\u201d he asked, his voice soft, conciliatory.</p><p>\u201cNo. Have dinner without me and I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, sweetheart. You take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Justine intended on doing exactly that. After work, she headed straight to her apartment with a quart of her favorite gourmet ice cream and two rented videos.</p><p>When the doorbell rang and a deliveryman stood there with a huge arrangement of flowers, her first thought was that they were from Seth. Then she read Warren\u2019s name on the tag and started to cry for no discernible reason.</p><p>She dumped the flowers in the sink. Dressed in her oldest flannel pajamas, she sat cross-legged in front of her television, eating straight out of the ice cream carton.</p><p>Her doorbell ran again. Justine was in no mood for company. Stabbing her spoon into the ice cream, she shouted, \u201cGo away! I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>Whoever was on the other side refused to take no for an answer. Angry now, she set the ice cream aside and got awkwardly to her feet. Drunk on her misery, she staggered to the front door and defiantly threw it open.</p><p>Seth Gunderson stood on the other side.</p><p>Justine took one startled look at him and gasped.</p><p>\u201cJustine?\u201d</p><p>What an atrocious sight she must be. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d she raged. Then, throwing open the screen door, she grabbed him by the lapels with both hands and jerked him over the threshold. He stumbled into the apartment but she didn\u2019t give him time to speak before she hurled herself into his arms. Taken off guard, Seth lurched backward and nearly lost his balance before sliding his arms around her waist, locking her in his embrace.</p><p>Their kisses were full of passion and frenzy. Her lips were cold with ice cream; his were hot with longing. He was dressed for the outdoors; Justine was nude beneath the thin flannel pajamas. Her hands roved over his body; his hands pressed her close to his heart.</p><p>Struggling against him, Justine unfastened the big round buttons of his jacket and with clumsy movements peeled it from his arms. His shirt was next, but the buttons were more stubborn this time and she struggled, impatient and so damn hot she felt she was going to burst into flames if he didn\u2019t hurry and take her to bed. Her entire body pulsed with need. She wanted him as she\u2019d never wanted another man in her life.</p><p>\u201cJustine, no.\u201d Seth held her at arm\u2019s length, his chest heaving with the effort to break off their frantic kisses.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she cried in outrage. He\u2019d created this wild fire that burned inside her, and he could damn well quench the flames.</p><p>\u201cNot like this, when neither of us knows what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she challenged, her fists digging into her hips. \u201cAre you rejecting me?\u201d She noticed that her stance gave him a peek at her breasts and did nothing to shore up the gap in her pajama top.</p><p>Seth walked over to the sofa and sank wearily into the cushions while Justine fought to hold on to her shredded dignity. She put on a brave front, but she already knew she\u2019d done everything humanly possible to make a fool of herself.</p><p>\u201cIt would be the easiest thing in the world to haul you into that bedroom and spend the next two days making love to you,\u201d Seth told her in a low voice.</p><p>Her knees went weak, and she was almost\u2014almost\u2014reduced to begging.</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I love you. I\u2019ve loved you from the time we were kids and I will not give either one of us an excuse to screw this up.\u201d</p><p>Her bravado was slipping fast. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be having that problem at the moment,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Seth chuckled and said something under his breath that she didn\u2019t catch.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she demanded, afraid he was secretly laughing at her.</p><p>He smiled faintly. \u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p> <p>She did, but she wouldn\u2019t press the issue.</p><p>He heaved in a deep sigh and held her look, his eyes a brilliant blue. \u201cSo you\u2019ve missed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, damn you.\u201d</p><p>He looked far too pleased by her confession. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>She glanced away rather than meet his gaze.</p> <p>\u201cAre you still seeing Warren Saget?\u201d</p><p>Justine was grateful he couldn\u2019t see her eyes. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>Her response seemed to give him the incentive he sought. Seth stood up and scooped his jacket from the floor. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d She refused to be Seth\u2019s exclusive property, just as she\u2019d never belong to Warren. \u201cI\u2019ll see him any time I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The least he could do was argue with her instead of being so...so agreeable.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you before\u2014Warren\u2019s not right for you,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>He nodded matter-of-factly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Justine had heard enough and apparently Seth felt he\u2019d said everything she needed to hear. He walked over to the door and opened it. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019ve broken it off with Warren, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a long wait,\u201d she tossed out, furious with him and unwilling to make the slightest concession, to give the slightest bit of hope. And yet, she couldn\u2019t have. It was over with Warren, and Justine knew it despite her words to the contrary.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve learned anything about me at all, you should realize I\u2019m a patient man.\u201d And with that, he left.</p><p>Although Justine was convinced Seth had stayed in town, she didn\u2019t hear from him the rest of the weekend. Then on Sunday night, he phoned.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked, so grateful to hear his voice that she forgot to pretend she was angry.</p> <p>\u201cAlaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have called me while you were still in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice husky and tired. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been too easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always do things the hard way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, I hope not,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should thank you,\u201d she whispered, keeping her eyes shut and cradling the phone against her ear as she dropped onto a kitchen chair. Seth had prevented her from making an even bigger mistake than just throwing herself at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, his voice suddenly gruff. \u201cI\u2019ve kicked myself all the way back here. Next time I won\u2019t be so damned noble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Justine said softly, \u201cI won\u2019t give you the chance.\u201d</p><p>Grace carried two heavy bags of groceries into the house and set them on the kitchen counter. It was Monday afternoon, after a relatively good weekend. She never knew what to expect from Dan anymore. Some days he was down and some days he was up. Recently, though, his moods seemed to be on a more even keel.</p><p>Kelly and her husband had been to the house for dinner on Sunday and it\u2019d been a wonderful visit. The news of their daughter\u2019s pregnancy had brightened their lives. Grace longed for this baby; whatever was lacking in her marriage, she hoped to find in grandchildren.</p><p>The house was dark and still. She expected Dan home at any time. She\u2019d taken off an hour early for a doctor\u2019s appointment that had lasted only a couple of minutes.</p><p>Grateful for this chance to organize her kitchen, Grace started unloading the bags, then suddenly paused. Something wasn\u2019t right. She felt it. A sixth sense, a premonition, she wasn\u2019t sure which. Listening, she cocked her head to one side. Her first inclination had been to dismiss the feeling, but it refused to go away.</p><p>Drawing in a stabilizing breath, she walked into the bedroom, and stopped abruptly. The dresser drawers hung open; their contents dangled over the edge and spilled about the room. Her first thought was that an intruder had been in the house, but a quick inventory said otherwise. Strangely, nothing valuable appeared to be missing. Her jewelry was out in plain sight.</p><p>Moving into the living room, Grace threw herself into a chair and closed her eyes.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t coming home.</p><p>Again he\u2019d taken nothing with him\u2014only the clothes on his back. He\u2019d abandoned everything else. His clothes, his personal possessions, his marriage and family.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say how she knew, but she felt it with a certainty that was inexplicable.</p><p>She didn\u2019t contact Troy Davis or even Olivia; she wouldn\u2019t tell anyone until at least a few days had passed. Her husband had been furious with her the last time. He\u2019d pulled this horrible stunt, worried her to the point of physical illness and then been outraged that she\u2019d called the police. Dan had said she\u2019d embarrassed him. Not once had he taken into account what he\u2019d put her through. Two days of bitter, sullen silence had passed before they could speak to each other again. Now this.</p><p>Grace was right\u2014Dan didn\u2019t come home after work, nor did he show up that night. Despite a determined effort, she didn\u2019t sleep. Her mind played tricks on her until, too exhausted to do anything else, she drifted off an hour before the alarm buzzed. She was tempted to call in sick, but decided against that. Staying home, pacing and worrying about where her husband might be or with whom, wasn\u2019t going to help.</p><p>Tuesday afternoon, she walked hopefully into the house and found it cold and silent. Dan wasn\u2019t back. The phone rang and she nearly tore it off the wall in her eagerness to answer.</p><p>\u201cMom, I just want to thank you and Dad for having Paul and me over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was our pleasure,\u201d Grace said, doing her best to hide her fears.</p><p>\u201cDaddy was in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was.\u201d Grace closed her eyes in an effort to concentrate on the conversation.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d her daughter said cautiously, \u201cis everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course...I think so,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>The line went silent, then, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t know where else to turn, Grace told her daughter. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen your father in nearly two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Dad? But where is he?\u201d Kelly asked, anxiety sharpening her voice.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you call someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI phoned the police the first time and learned that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has happened before?\u201d Kelly cried. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter was upset with her, and that was the last thing Grace wanted. Not with Kelly pregnant. A risky pregnancy at that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way over,\u201d Kelly said adamantly.</p><p>\u201cKelly, no, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Maryellen know?\u201d</p><p>Grace released a shuddering sigh. \u201cI...I haven\u2019t told anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming over,\u201d her daughter insisted, and then slammed down the phone.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, both Maryellen and Kelly arrived. They stormed into the house like avenging angels.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Maryellen demanded. The two girls gathered around the very table where they\u2019d sat as children.</p><p>Grace told them everything she could remember.</p><p>\u201cWhere would Daddy go?\u201d</p><p>Grace forced herself to look away. Although she didn\u2019t want to admit the possibility, she had to let them know her thoughts. \u201cI think there might be another woman.\u201d</p><p>Both of her daughters vehemently rejected that idea.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Maryellen said first.</p><p>\u201cNot Daddy,\u201d Kelly chimed in. \u201cHow can you even suggest such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Dan had denied it, too. But he\u2019d been so emotionally detached from her lately, so remote and moody. Another woman was the only plausible excuse that would explain his behavior.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Maryellen insisted.</p><p>\u201cThen where is he?\u201d she cried.</p><p>Neither of her daughters answered.</p><p>\u201cThink,\u201d Kelly urged.</p><p>\u201cWhat could Daddy have been looking for?\u201d Maryellen asked. \u201cYou said it seemed like he was searching for something before he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t take anything.\u201d Grace had carefully folded all his clothes and placed them back inside the drawers. Apparently he\u2019d found whatever he\u2019d been seeking with such impatience, although she couldn\u2019t find a single thing missing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming back,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cOtherwise he would\u2019ve packed a suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s coming back,\u201d Maryellen agreed, as though it was a foregone conclusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will,\u201d Grace said. He had the first time, hadn\u2019t he? That gave her hope, although her heart told her something else.</p><p>They were all silent after that. There seemed nothing left to say. Grace reached for her daughters\u2019 hands and squeezed them, hoping to offer reassurance when she had damn little to give.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do next?\u201d Maryellen, the no-nonsense one, was determined to take some kind of action. Grace didn\u2019t know how to advise her. Maryellen was the daughter of her heart. She didn\u2019t favor one girl over the other, but her oldest child was most like her. Maryellen had married young and unwisely, and, after one year, divorced. Now in her mid-thirties, she didn\u2019t seem likely to repeat the experience. Grace had wanted a different life for her, but Maryellen, who managed a local art gallery, seemed content, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cWe should inform the police,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Grace explained what she\u2019d learned earlier. It wasn\u2019t against the law to disappear.</p><p>\u201cWe have to let the authorities know, anyway,\u201d Maryellen muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe can have posters printed up, too,\u201d Kelly suggested. She stood and started pacing.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Grace adamantly opposed that idea. If Dan was coming back, and she suspected that eventually he would, he\u2019d be furious if she allowed his face to be posted around town. \u201cYour father wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Then he shouldn\u2019t have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer to wait.\u201d Grace pleaded for time.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more day is all I\u2019m willing to give him,\u201d Maryellen said, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf your father hasn\u2019t returned in another day or two, we should probably contact the authorities,\u201d Grace announced, knotting a tissue in her hand. \u201cOther than that, I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s anything we can do. Your father has chosen to leave. He went of his own free will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d Kelly protested.</p><p>\u201cIt happened before,\u201d Grace reasoned. \u201cHe returned when he was ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he will again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait.\u201d Hard as it was, she couldn\u2019t see doing anything else.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where Dad is, but I\u2019m positive that he\u2019d never leave you for another woman,\u201d Maryellen said softly.</p><p>Grace hugged her daughters and reluctantly let them go. She stood on the porch, both arms wrapped around her as they drove off to their respective homes. She was alone now, totally and completely alone.</p><p>Her daughters refused to believe that Dan had found another woman, but she\u2019d suspected it for a very long time. She didn\u2019t want to believe it, either, but couldn\u2019t think of anything else to explain his disappearances.</p> <p>Olivia knew the minute they met for their aerobics class that Wednesday. Grace didn\u2019t need to utter a word.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded as they walked toward the gym.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I saw him was Monday morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo word since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>Olivia exhaled. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Grace bit her lower lip. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d Dan was determined to punish her for a list of sins she didn\u2019t even know she\u2019d committed. The last laugh, however, would be hers. Grace had no intention of continuing this charade of a marriage.</p><p>Dan\u2019s latest disappearing act was the end. She was getting out. Dan might well return, and when he did, she\u2019d have him served with divorce papers.</p><p>This was the end.</p> <p>Ten</p><p>Cecilia had never been prouder of anything. The test paper had a huge A scrawled on the front and Mr. Cavanaugh, her algebra professor, had written Well Done! in bright red pen across one corner. She\u2019d aced the test. After class Mr. Cavanaugh, who had to be in his late fifties, asked if she\u2019d talked to a counselor about her next quarter\u2019s classes. She told him she hadn\u2019t and he suggested she take more math courses, since she showed aptitude in that area.</p><p>Cecilia had been giddy with joy ever since. The first person she thought to tell was her father, who spent most of his time at The Captain\u2019s Galley, on one side of the bar or the other. She\u2019d see him soon enough, she decided. Cathy Lackey came to mind next, but it might sound as though she was bragging and Cecilia didn\u2019t want that. Feeling slightly deflated, she headed home, picking up her mail in the lobby.</p><p>She automatically tossed the envelopes down on the kitchen table and shrugged off her backpack. That was when she saw Ian\u2019s letter. Funny how a little thing like a letter could throw her for a loop. Cecilia stared at it a full thirty seconds before she reached for it and carefully tore it open.</p><p>April 12th</p><p>Dear Cecilia,</p><p>Andrew got a letter from Cathy this week and she wrote that the two of you recently got together. I assume you have the car by now and hope you aren\u2019t too stubborn to drive it.</p><p>Ian Randall was a fine one to talk, Cecilia mused. Her husband was more stubborn than any man she\u2019d ever met. But since she\u2019d been driving his car for nearly a month, she couldn\u2019t very well complain.</p> <p>I realize you\u2019re probably upset with me over the way I acted when you came to see me at the hospital. I don\u2019t blame you. My only excuse is that I was in a lot of pain. I was mad as hell about being so stupid. It was my own carelessness that caused the accident. Andrew should never have told you; it wasn\u2019t necessary for you to know.</p><p>Cecilia disagreed. She was his wife and he\u2019d been hurt. She was grateful Andrew had called her.</p><p>We\u2019ve had our differences the last few months, but after our \u201cdate,\u201d I had real hope we might look past all that. Then I had to go and blow everything. I\u2019m genuinely sorry, Cecilia.</p><p>It damn well took him long enough to apologize! Nor did it escape her notice that he hadn\u2019t mentioned the lovemaking. If he was willing to ignore it, then so was she!</p><p>I know you don\u2019t have a computer, but I\u2019m including my e-mail address at the end of the letter in case you find a way of contacting me. Hearing from you would mean a great deal.</p><p>Andrew said you and Cathy have become friends and started connecting with some of the other Navy wives. I\u2019m glad. The Navy isn\u2019t so bad, you know. There are a lot of good people here.</p><p>Cecilia regretted rejecting those potential friends earlier.</p><p>Tell me about school\u2014if you write me back that is. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re at the top of the class.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Ian</p><p>Randall-Ian-M HT2 &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt; P.S. About that night...is everything all right? You know what I mean.</p><p>He was asking if she\u2019d gotten pregnant. He should be concerned. They\u2019d been stupid and this wasn\u2019t the first time, but she swore it would be the last.</p><p>Cecilia read the letter through again. Her overwhelming reaction was pleasure. It wasn\u2019t a long letter, but she knew Ian had agonized over every word. The apology had been hard for him. Well, she deserved one. She was gratified that he\u2019d asked about school; it was almost as though he knew she\u2019d gotten the A on her final.</p><p>Cecilia left for work a few minutes early that afternoon and drove to the library. Fortunately, one of the computers was free. Cecilia slipped into the seat and logged on to the Internet. Her message was brief and to the point, because she didn\u2019t have a lot of time and because she wasn\u2019t entirely sure it would go through, anyway.</p><p>April 16th</p><p>Dear Ian,</p><p>Your letter arrived this afternoon. Apology accepted. I miss you.</p><p>Cecilia</p><p>P.S. Rest assured all is well.</p><p>Curiosity got the better of her the following day, and she returned to the library and was thrilled to find an e-mail waiting for her from Ian.</p><p>April 17th</p><p>Dearest Cecilia,</p><p>I was really happy to hear from you. What did you mean, you miss me? Is it true? I don\u2019t care if it is or isn\u2019t, I\u2019m taking it at face value. Andrew and Cathy e-mail each other nearly every day and she wrote about inviting you to the \u201cgirls\u2019 night out.\u201d I\u2019m glad you\u2019re making friends.</p><p>Life on an aircraft carrier is a whole lot different than a submarine. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to like it, but it\u2019s all right, I guess.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Ian</p><p>P.S. Is all really well?</p><p>April 18th</p><p>Dear Ian,</p><p>My final grades are posted for the Algebra and English classes and I got a 4.0 in both. I\u2019m so THRILLED! Mr. Cavanaugh suggested I take an advanced Algebra class, and I am. I\u2019m still working weekends, filling in as a cocktail waitress and am putting aside my tip money for school.</p><p>I know you got the transfer to the George Washington because of Allison, and because of me. I appreciate what you did, but Ian, it was too late. If you want to transfer back to the submarine, then that\u2019s what you should do.</p><p>I have to hurry to work. Sorry, I wish this could be longer. I will write you a real letter soon, I promise. School starts up again in two weeks.</p><p>Think of me.</p><p>Cecilia</p><p>April 19th</p><p>Dear Cecilia,</p><p>You asked me to think of you\u2014that was a joke, right? I think of you all the time. You\u2019re my wife, no matter what the attorney tries to tell me. Are we still getting the divorce? God, I hope not. I never wanted it. You know how I feel about that whole issue. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to harp at you about that. I\u2019ll live with whatever you decide.</p><p>You said something about me transferring from the Atlantis, and why I did it. This might come as a shock, but I didn\u2019t do it for you. Not entirely. I did it for me, too. When we were deployed that last time before Allison was born, you and I never suspected you\u2019d have the baby while I was away. Neither of us had the slightest warning of what would happen. When I returned, our daughter had already been buried. You were hurting so badly, and I realize now that I wasn\u2019t much help to you, mainly because I was dealing with my own pain. I guess I really didn\u2019t know how to help. You hated the Navy, and I felt as though you hated me, too. It wasn\u2019t a good time for either of us. I never told you\u2014perhaps if I had, we might not have gone down the path we did\u2014but after my last tour on the Atlantis, I tried to get out of the Navy. My baby was dead and my marriage was falling apart and I was about as low as I\u2019ve ever been in my life. I\u2019m not blaming you, I swear it. My CO talked to me and arranged a transfer to the George Washington. The paperwork said it was for psychological reasons.</p><p>Congratulations on your classes! I\u2019m proud of you. We\u2019ll celebrate when I\u2019m back home. It\u2019s less than five months now. That seems like a lifetime, but the weeks will go fast. I love you and that\u2019s not going to change.</p><p>Ian</p><p>P.S. Don\u2019t freak out over me telling you how I feel. I haven\u2019t mentioned my feelings for you in a long time, because it didn\u2019t seem you wanted to hear. You still might not, but I\u2019m hoping you do.</p><p>April 22nd</p><p>Dear Ian,</p><p>I had to wait until the library opened to e-mail you back\u2014that\u2019s why the long delay. Cathy told me there are places I can go other than the library and after having to wait all weekend to contact you, I\u2019m going to do it. I was so frustrated! Other than that, I had a good weekend.</p><p>I had my best tip night ever on Saturday. I know you don\u2019t like me working the bar. I don\u2019t much care for it myself, but it\u2019s the only way I have of getting ahead financially. The tips are decent and Bobby\u2019s around, so I don\u2019t have to put up with harrassment from customers. Believe it or not, he\u2019s keeping an eye on me. He even threatened to throw a guy out last week! Hardly seemed like my peace-loving father.</p><p>That\u2019s my little confession\u2014I wanted to tell you about staying on at the bar after you explained about the transfer from the Atlantis to the George Washington. You\u2019re right. It would have helped if we\u2019d communicated.</p><p>I know you love me, Ian. Through everything, I\u2019ve always known how you felt, but sometimes loving someone just isn\u2019t enough. You asked about the divorce. I don\u2019t know how I feel about it anymore, but at the same time I don\u2019t know if I want to stay married, either. One thing I\u2019m sure of\u2014I don\u2019t ever want another child. This latest scare made that very clear to me. I can\u2019t believe we took such a risk again. The most profound lesson I came away with, after Allison, is that I was never meant to be a mother.</p><p>You deserve to be a father.</p><p>Considering that, you might not want to talk to me again. The choice is yours.</p><p>Always,</p><p>Cecilia</p><p>Charlotte Jefferson waited patiently until her daughter was finished with court for the day. Twenty minutes after the last case was heard, she knocked on her chambers door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Olivia sounded distracted, which meant she was probably reading briefs and preparing for her next session.</p><p>Charlotte turned the knob and peeked inside. Coming to her daughter with her own needs was not an easy thing to do. Olivia was a busy professional, and Charlotte tried very hard not to be a hindrance to her children.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Frowning, Olivia stood up behind her desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had hoped to disguise her tears. She\u2019d been feeling depressed\u2014that was the only word for it\u2014ever since she\u2019d heard about Tom Harding\u2019s death. He\u2019d been gone for more than a month now, and it hadn\u2019t gotten any better and she didn\u2019t feel she could delay this task any longer. Janet had already asked about the key; Charlotte knew she\u2019d have to return it soon. But she\u2019d already let Tom down once and she couldn\u2019t do it again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dabbing at her eyes, Charlotte came into the room. Olivia walked from her desk and placed her arm around Charlotte\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSit down, Mom,\u201d she advised gently.</p><p>Charlotte complied.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Blowing her nose, Charlotte took a moment to compose herself. \u201cI need your help.\u201d She sniffled, hating the tears that streaked her face, yet unable to keep them at bay. This emotion was difficult to explain, considering how many of her friends she\u2019d buried.</p> <p>\u201cDoes this have to do with Tom Harding?\u201d Olivia asked, taking her own seat.</p><p>Charlotte nodded and wiped her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cYou miss him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but, Olivia, it\u2019s more than just missing him. I feel I was a sorry disappointment to Tom. We\u2019d gotten to be such good friends. I know you probably don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, with him not being able to speak....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a single doubt that you meant a great deal to one another.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was nothing romantic between us.\u201d Charlotte wanted that understood. The one and only love of her life was Clyde Jefferson, the dear man who\u2019d been her husband.</p><p>\u201cYou were friends,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cGood friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s what Tom believed, but I fear I failed him. I got so involved with my work on the newspaper that I let myself get distracted.\u201d What distressed her most was thinking of Tom waiting to see her, waiting and waiting, and her being so caught up with her fifteen seconds of fame that she hadn\u2019t bothered to visit him at their usual time...or any other. She\u2019d been too full of her own importance to spare him a couple of hours. And now it was too late.</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m sure Tom understood,\u201d Olivia said with such compassion, Charlotte had to resist the urge to openly weep.</p><p>\u201cI hope he did.\u201d She wadded the linen handkerchief in her hand. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a burial service. I never had a chance to say goodbye....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you needed my help?\u201d Olivia reminded her.</p> <p>For a moment, Charlotte had almost forgotten. \u201cOh yes, the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Olivia said, sitting straighter in her chair. \u201cTom gave you a key, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to a storage unit. I want you to go there with me, if you would.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hesitated. She took her role as a duly elected judge far too seriously, in Charlotte\u2019s opinion. She could see that her daughter was weighing the possibility of any conflict of interest. \u201cIs it nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, right here in Cedar Cove. Apparently he\u2019s had it for some time.\u201d This had surprised her, since he was transferred to the convalescent center from Seattle. The poor man must\u2019ve had some connection with the area, some reason for choosing Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cWhen would you like to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do it now?\u201d</p><p>Olivia closed the files on her desk. \u201cThat should work out fine. Do you want me to drive or should we meet there?\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte wanted Olivia to drive. As emotional as she was about Tom, she wanted the company. Besides, she was finding it difficult to turn and look behind her when using Reverse. Lately she\u2019d been parking in spaces that didn\u2019t require backing up. Looking over her shoulder caused cramping in her neck. If she mentioned it to Olivia, however, her daughter might suggest it was time to stop driving and Charlotte couldn\u2019t give up her independence.</p><p>Olivia drove out on the highway, along the waterfront. The storage unit was off Butterfield Road on the way into Belfair, across from the drive-in theater.</p><p>\u201cDo we need to check in?\u201d Olivia asked, stopping in front of the office.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Charlotte said. It didn\u2019t look as though anyone was there. \u201cI have the key and the receipt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go directly to the unit.\u201d Olivia pulled forward until they located the number written on the receipt.</p><p>\u201cThis must be it.\u201d Charlotte climbed out of the car, taking her time. She didn\u2019t move as quickly as she once did, nor did she move as gracefully as she would have liked. It was especially difficult getting in and out of cars.</p><p>Olivia was waiting for her. The unit looked much bigger than Charlotte had anticipated. Olivia took the key from her and inserted it in the lock. The door swung upward. Inside the darkened space was one large trunk surrounded by assorted furniture. A sofa and chair, a saddle and what seemed to be a painting of some sort, covered by a blanket.</p><p>The painting interested Olivia and she lifted the blanket. Charlotte glanced at it; when she saw that it was a movie poster of a 1940s cowboy film, she quickly dismissed it.</p><p>Then, almost against her will, her gaze swung back to the poster. The man, on a rearing stallion with lightning flashing in the background, looked vaguely familiar. He should, she realized when she read the name. Tom Houston was \u201cThe Yodeling Cowboy,\u201d one of the most popular of the trick riders and cowboy film stars of the era. Many a schoolgirl afternoon had been spent in the theater, watching the wild horseman dash across the screen.</p><p>\u201cTom Houston.\u201d Olivia read the name aloud. \u201cHave you ever heard of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You mean to say you haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom,\u201d Olivia said and released the blanket. It floated down over the poster.</p><p>That old movie poster must be worth something these days. It was a collector\u2019s item, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cShall we open the trunk?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d A thought struck Charlotte and she returned her attention to the poster. Throwing back the blanket, she took a second look. When she did, her knees started to shake.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Olivia was at her side instantly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the old trunk, Charlotte pointed with one hand at the poster while the other covered her mouth. \u201cThis can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Tom Harding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? The man in the poster?\u201d</p><p>Was her daughter dense? \u201cTom Harding is...was Tom Houston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Olivia clearly didn\u2019t appreciate the significance of her discovery. Charlotte took a deep breath. \u201cTom Houston was as popular as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. He was as well-known as Gene Autry in his time. Oh my, I can\u2019t believe my own eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be a relative of your Tom,\u201d Olivia suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s him...Oh my, he really was Tom Houston! You used to watch his television show when you were a little girl,\u201d Charlotte informed her. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? On Saturday mornings...Tom had his own television series for a couple of years in the nineteen-fifties, and then he faded from the scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom Houston,\u201d Olivia repeated softly as though tugging at childhood memories. She shook her head and then it seemed to come to her all at once. \u201cTom Houston,\u201d she cried. \u201cThat Tom Houston?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte saw that Olivia was truly excited now. A moment later, though, she frowned. \u201cOh, Mom, this has to be some kind of joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s Tom. Oh, he was decades older when I met him, but it\u2019s the same man, I\u2019m convinced of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we open the trunk?\u201d Olivia asked obviously a little hesitant.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Charlotte was adamant about that now. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll find some evidence of family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said Tom didn\u2019t have any family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the state knows of,\u201d Charlotte corrected. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any.\u201d Everyone had family.</p><p>Olivia had a bit of trouble undoing the lock, but the struggle was worth it once they were able to pry open the trunk. Inside was a virtual treasure trove of memorabilia.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Charlotte whispered, staring at the contents. The first thing she noticed was Tom Houston\u2019s signature white outfit. The good guys always wore white, and Tom was very definitely a good guy. His guns were there, too, along with a number of old television scripts that appeared to be originals. She also saw World War II medals, and remembered that he\u2019d served in the military.</p><p>\u201cThis stuff must be worth a fortune,\u201d Olivia said in awe.</p><p>Filled with purpose, Charlotte straightened. \u201cThis is why he wanted me to have the key.\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced at her as if she didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cHe never gave you a hint about who he was, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even one. He obviously didn\u2019t want me to know while he was alive.\u201d Charlotte was beginning to understand. Tom must have sensed that he could trust her. He must have realized she would do whatever was necessary to get these things\u2014this legacy\u2014to the people who were entitled to it. She might have let him down earlier, but by heaven, she wouldn\u2019t again.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Olivia apparently recognized this look.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s entrusted me with his most precious items for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Olivia frowned. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte frowned back. \u201cI\u2019m going to track down his people and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat people? Even if he\u2019s got family, where are they? Why was he a ward of the state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But Janet told me Tom was transferred to Cedar Cove at his own request\u2014it was his original choice. My guess is he\u2019s got family in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why didn\u2019t Tom contact them himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Charlotte said again.</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cHe trusted me,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cTom wanted me to make sure all of this is properly distributed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d she continued, cutting Olivia off, \u201che knew he could count on me.\u201d That, as far as she was concerned, said it all.</p><p>From this point forward, Charlotte was a woman on a mission. She\u2019d figured out how to make up to Tom for neglecting him the last few weeks of his life. As a woman of honor, she swore she\u2019d do everything within her power to find Tom Houston\u2019s family. She wouldn\u2019t give up, nor would she rest until his legacy was passed to those who had the right to own it.</p><p>On her way home from the library, Grace collected the day\u2019s mail. That used to be Dan\u2019s task because he generally arrived at the house before she did.</p><p>It was three weeks to the day since his disappearance. Three hellish weeks, in which she\u2019d been confronted by all the unanswered questions, by doubts and guilt and mounting frustration.</p><p>The little everyday things distressed her. Taking out the garbage, bringing in the mail, fixing the leaky faucet in the bathroom. All the things Dan used to do. Her fear and resentment intensified with each task.</p><p>At first Dan\u2019s employer refused to believe he\u2019d simply walked away from his life. Grace could hardly believe it herself, but all the evidence pointed toward the likelihood of exactly that. Dan was gone. No one had come up with any reason for it, any hows or whys. Grace had questioned Bob Bilderback, Dan\u2019s boss at the tree service, at least five times, certain that he had some clue\u2014even if he didn\u2019t immediately recognize its significance. Bob was as bewildered as Grace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Walking into the house, Grace quickly dispensed with the mail. Two bills went into a pile to join the others on Dan\u2019s old desk. Money was tight. Bob had mailed her Dan\u2019s last check made out to her. Frankly she was surprised Dan hadn\u2019t collected that when he left, but then he had his credit cards.</p><p>Credit cards.</p><p>Grace hadn\u2019t even thought to look at the VISA bill until now. She raced into Maryellen\u2019s old bedroom, which had been turned into a den, and shuffled through the stack of unpaid bills on the desk until she reached the VISA statement still tucked inside the envelope.</p><p>Her hand shook as she tore it open and quickly scanned the list of charges. They all seemed to be in order with the exception of one. When she saw where the card had been used, her legs gave out. Bracing her back against the wall, she sank to the floor.</p> <p>How long she sat there, staring at nothing, Grace couldn\u2019t guess. She finally gathered the courage to call Olivia.</p><p>\u201cCan you come over?\u201d she asked. Her voice, which sounded scratchy, must have conveyed her urgency.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>Less than ten minutes later, her friend was at the front door. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe son of a bitch,\u201d Grace cried, so furious she could barely contain herself. \u201cLook at this!\u201d She thrust the VISA statement at Olivia.</p> <p>Olivia glanced at it and raised questioning eyes to Grace. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBerghoff Jewelers in Bremerton. I didn\u2019t buy myself any jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d Grace raged.</p><p>\u201cWhat would Dan buy there for 250?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little trinket for his girlfriend, no doubt,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s find out.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was always sensible. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to Grace to contact the store. She hadn\u2019t cancelled the credit card, either, which was a mistake she planned to rectify first thing in the morning.</p><p>While Grace paced the living room, Olivia found the phone number and dialed. When she\u2019d finished, she handed the receiver to Grace.</p><p>Anger shot through her. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, doing her best to sound calm and reasonable. \u201cMy name is Grace Sherman and I have my credit card statement here in front of me.\u201d She went on to explain the charge. \u201cThey\u2019re looking up the receipt now,\u201d Grace said, covering the mouthpiece with her hand.</p><p>In thirty-five years of marriage Dan hadn\u2019t once bought her a piece of jewelry. He considered it frivolous. She wore a plain gold band\u2014the same ring he\u2019d placed on her finger the day of their wedding. Over the years, the band had worn thin and should have been replaced, but never was. Her husband didn\u2019t wear a wedding band at all, not after he got out of the military. Working with heavy equipment made it dangerous for a man to wear any sort of ring.</p><p>The woman from Berghoff\u2019s returned with the requested information. \u201cMrs. Sherman,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Grace was instantly alert.</p><p>\u201cThe VISA charge is for a ring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d This was as strange as everything else about her husband\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>\u201cA ring. I\u2019m sorry, but it doesn\u2019t say what type.\u201d</p><p>Grace felt as if the wind had been knocked out of her. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. Thank you for your trouble.\u201d Quickly she replaced the receiver, then collapsed into a chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Olivia was at her side.</p><p>Grace stared down at the thin gold band on her left hand. She\u2019d suspected for a long time that there was another woman; now she had proof. \u201cHe bought a ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ring?\u201d Olivia said. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Grace cried. \u201cThat\u2019s why he left me his last paycheck,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to pay for the ring?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently so.\u201d This was just like Dan and his twisted sense of honor. He thought nothing of walking out on her, without a word of explanation, turning her life into a living hell. Yet he made sure the last charge on their VISA account, one that had apparently paid for another woman\u2019s ring, had been covered.</p><p>\u201cThe other day,\u201d Grace whispered, struggling to hold on to her inner strength, \u201cI came home from work and had the oddest sense that Dan had been in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou changed the locks, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maryellen and Kelly had talked her out of that. Both of them were convinced their father would return soon and explain everything. In the beginning Grace had thought so, too, but no longer. She didn\u2019t want him back. But if Dan ever did return, she wanted the distinct pleasure of telling him to his face that she was divorcing him.</p><p>\u201cYou think Dan was in the house?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost positive....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething was missing?\u201d</p><p>If so, Grace couldn\u2019t detect what it was, although she\u2019d torn through every room, searching. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen how did you know?\u201d Olivia persisted.</p><p>\u201cI could smell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking with trees all day, he often came home smelling like a freshly cut Christmas tree. The scent was there, I swear it, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell the girls. They\u2019re upset enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sat across from her. \u201cHave you thought about talking to Roy McAfee? He has an excellent reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA private detective?\u201d That sounded outrageously expensive, and living on one income was already stretching her budget.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to consult with him and find out what he\u2019d charge to find Dan.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. Olivia was right.</p><p>The following day, Grace scheduled an afternoon appointment with the investigator. She\u2019d met Roy a couple of times, and Corrie was a regular library patron.</p><p>Corrie was polite and friendly when Grace arrived, immediately putting her at ease. She led her into Roy\u2019s office and brought each of them a cup of coffee before gently closing the door.</p><p>\u201cI understand Dan is missing,\u201d Roy said, getting directly to the point.</p><p>Grace could be equally blunt. Her patience with the situation was gone, especially since she\u2019d learned about the ring. \u201cHow much would it cost to find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on how long it takes.\u201d</p><p>Grace glanced down at her folded hands. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where he might be?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I suspect he\u2019s with another woman.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, looking directly into her eyes. \u201cHow badly do you want to find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I mean, I don\u2019t want him back.\u201d Sadness settled over her. \u201cI\u2019d just like to see him long enough to slap the divorce papers in his hand.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Cecilia had dreaded this day for weeks. May first. Her wedding anniversary. A year ago, on this very day, she\u2019d stood with Ian before a Justice of the Peace and they exchanged heartfelt vows. In a matter of minutes, they\u2019d joined their lives for what she\u2019d believed would be forever.</p><p>The pregnancy was just beginning to show, and Cecilia had felt it was silly to wear white. Instead she\u2019d chosen a lovely soft-pink dress and made a matching veil herself.</p><p>Her mother had flown to Washington for the ceremony, brief though it was, and taken them both out for dinner afterward. Bobby had slipped a fifty-dollar bill in Cecilia\u2019s hand. Ian had insisted they have a honeymoon, and despite their lack of extra money, he\u2019d found a way. They\u2019d spent two glorious days on the Washington coast, the Long Beach peninsula. They\u2019d explored the beach and the small historic towns, like Oysterville and Seaview. At night, they\u2019d cuddled together in front of the fireplace in their rented cottage and discussed the future. Everything had seemed so perfect then. It was on their honeymoon that they\u2019d decided on names for their unborn child and talked about Ian\u2019s Navy career and Cecilia\u2019s role as a Navy wife. She hadn\u2019t understood everything that would require, but had been willing to follow her husband to the ends of the earth.</p><p>She\u2019d followed him to the end of her sanity. Cecilia couldn\u2019t possibly guess that within a few months their child would be dead. She couldn\u2019t have known that all joy and purpose would disappear from her life.</p><p>A year later, May first was just another workday. Nothing special. Nothing out of the ordinary. As much as possible, she intended to ignore its significance, the same way she\u2019d been ignoring Ian.</p><p>For a while, they\u2019d been e-mailing back and forth\u2014until she\u2019d faced up to the reality of their situation. They remained legally bound, but they were no longer husband and wife, despite her lapse in judgment when they\u2019d made love. Their separation had lasted longer than their marriage. What she\u2019d said to him was true; he deserved to be a father. But as she\u2019d told him in her last e-mail, he needed to accept the fact that she would never again risk that kind of heartache.</p><p>Ian\u2019s return e-mail had suggested she was overreacting. He\u2019d said she would feel different eventually, that she\u2019d want to have another child. He didn\u2019t understand. She didn\u2019t try to explain, because any response would\u2019ve been an invitation for him to argue\u2014and to continue their correspondence. So she\u2019d stopped e-mailing him, stopped going to the library, stopped caring.</p><p>Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d managed to rid her thoughts of Ian. It\u2019d been a mistake to write him, a mistake to get involved with him again, even through that series of short e-mails. No, her decision was made. As soon as she could afford it, she was going ahead with the divorce, which would be the best thing for both of them. In time Ian would see that, and in time, he\u2019d find it in his heart to forgive her.</p><p>When she\u2019d worked all of that out, she\u2019d parked his car, refusing to drive it again.</p><p>Knowing what the future held for her and Ian, Cecilia couldn\u2019t allow the significance of May first to distract her. She headed for her advanced algebra class early that morning, driving her own car, determined to make the best of the day. This was the next level of algebra and far more challenging than her first course. It helped that Mr. Cavanaugh was teaching this one, too. She liked him a great deal.</p><p>Despite her efforts to concentrate during class, her mind drifted in various unsettling directions, finally landing on the very subjects she\u2019d wanted to avoid. Ian, her dead baby and the hopelessness of ever getting an education one course at a time. When she finally graduated with any kind of useful degree, she\u2019d be old enough to collect Social Security.</p><p>Feeling depressed, she waited to talk to Mr. Cavanaugh after class. Holding her books tightly against her, she walked to the front of the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, Cecilia,\u201d he said, giving her his attention.</p><p>\u201cI...I thought you should know I\u2019ve decided to drop out of class.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reveal any overt disappointment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. Is there a particular reason?\u201d</p><p>Several, but none she could mention. Hanging her head, she shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where I\u2019ll use this knowledge. I\u2019m a restaurant hostess, not some brainy type who\u2019ll have a career in math.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKnowledge is never wasted. You\u2019re right, of course, you might never again have the opportunity to use the quadratic formula, but there\u2019s a certain satisfaction in being able to do so. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He reached for his books and placed them inside his briefcase, then left the room.</p><p>Cecilia walked with him. Part of her had hoped he\u2019d try to talk her out of quitting. \u201cI did want to thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your other class? What was it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness English,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to drop out of that, too?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, clutching her books tighter than ever. The school would refund a portion of the course fees if she pulled out before the end of this week.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cecilia,\u201d he said again.</p> <p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d she whispered, even more miserable now.</p><p>\u201cGive it to the end of the week, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed, but her mind was made up. She would use the money from the classes to pay for another appointment with Allan Harris. She\u2019d ask him to try to get the prenuptial agreement overturned. He\u2019d mentioned that they could appeal Judge Lockhart\u2019s decree, and with Ian out at sea, that was her only option.</p><p>After her classes, Cecilia drove her clunker back to the apartment, hoping to nap before work. Normally she started in on her homework, tackling it with enthusiasm, but not today. Not when there was a very real possibility she wouldn\u2019t be returning to Olympic College after Friday.</p><p>The light on the answering machine was blinking. Reluctantly Cecilia pushed the button.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cathy,\u201d came the cheerful voice of her friend. \u201cA bunch of us are getting together tonight for dinner. Are you interested? It\u2019s a potluck at my place. I hope you\u2019ll come. Give me a call either way. I\u2019d really love to have you here.\u201d Cathy had become a friend, a good friend, and they made a point of seeing each other every week. Sometimes with the other Navy wives, more often not. They\u2019d scouted out garage sales, gone to an occasional movie, met for Sunday brunch.</p> <p>But Cecilia couldn\u2019t go tonight, not when she was working the dinner shift at the restaurant. Cathy knew her hours and had invited her anyway, making a point of including her. Cecilia hated having to explain, since it should\u2019ve been obvious that she couldn\u2019t get away.</p><p>Cathy answered immediately. \u201cCecilia,\u201d she cried, sounding really pleased to hear from her. \u201cSay you\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working and it\u2019s far too late to find a replacement.\u201d That was true enough.</p><p>Cathy heaved a sigh of disappointment. \u201cMaybe we should all come down and see you. You know that old saying\u2014if Mohammed won\u2019t come to the mountain...\u201d She didn\u2019t finish the statement, but laughed as though she\u2019d said something clever.</p><p>Cecilia didn\u2019t join in. \u201cMaybe next time,\u201d she said in a dull voice.</p><p>Cathy hesitated. \u201cIs everything all right? No, don\u2019t answer that. I can tell it isn\u2019t. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>Rather than tell Cathy the whole truth, she opted for the abridged version. \u201cI\u2019m dropping out of school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! You love your classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a loan.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia was shocked that a friend of such short acquaintance would make an offer like that. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any money, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can get some...I think. Don\u2019t worry, if worse comes to worst, I\u2019ll take up a collection when I see the rest of the women tonight. We need to stick together, you know? If we can\u2019t give one another emotional support, who will? With our men at sea, all we have is each other.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia\u2019s spirits rose, but that was unavoidable with Cathy, whose optimism and generosity always made life seem more promising, somehow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you,\u201d Cecilia told her. Then, despite her mood, she sat down with the algebra book and began working on her assignment. When she looked up, it was past time to leave for work. She tore around the apartment, changing her clothes, and rushed out the door, arriving at The Captain\u2019s Galley just as her shift was starting.</p><p>As usual, Cecilia poked her head into the lounge to say hello to her father.</p><p>He raised his hand and called out \u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d No use explaining her depression to him. He wouldn\u2019t know what to say if she did.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Cecilia hadn\u2019t been at work more than an hour when a deliveryman arrived with a huge bouquet of fresh flowers. Yellow daisies, her favorite, and big pink tulips and a variety of others. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Cecilia Randall,\u201d he said, reading the tag.</p><p>Taken aback, Cecilia said nothing for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIs there a Ms. Randall here?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cecilia Randall,\u201d she told him.</p><p>The young man, probably a high-school student, thrust the vase filled with flowers into her arms and left. She didn\u2019t need to unwrap the cellophane and read the card to know they were from Ian. This was exactly the kind of low, underhanded thing he did just so she\u2019d feel guilty. Well, dammit, that wasn\u2019t going to work. She refused to let it.</p><p>Setting the flowers down next to the cash register, she removed the plastic and dropped it into the nearby trash can. Then she reached for the card.</p><p>Happy First Anniversary. I love you. Ian</p><p>Her stomach cramped, and Cecilia feared she was about to be sick. Biting into her lower lip, she waited for the sensation to pass.</p><p>\u201cWho are the flowers for?\u201d her father asked curiously, walking into the restaurant.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cMe, from Ian,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cReally. Any special reason?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s...supposed to be our anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Tears slid down her cheeks. When her father noticed them, he patted her on the back and returned to the bar.</p><p>Justine sipped her wine and pretended to be listening intently to Warren as he babbled on. She\u2019d lost track of what he was saying, but a response from her wasn\u2019t required. Any comment, other than praise or social small talk, wasn\u2019t welcome. Justine knew her role and it was that of a social accessory. This hadn\u2019t bothered her in the past and didn\u2019t really bother her now. She understood Warren, understood the terms of their arrangement.</p><p>\u201cMore wine?\u201d Warren asked, lifting the bottle and replenishing her glass.</p><p>Dinner at this five-star Seattle restaurant was in celebration of some multimillion-dollar contract Warren had landed. Such celebrations happened every two or three months.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, gazing expectantly at her, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink?\u201d Warren didn\u2019t date her for her brains and wasn\u2019t really interested in her opinions. They never talked about her job; in fact, he avoided dealing with her bank.</p><p>He blinked hard. \u201cJustine, weren\u2019t you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s the wine. I get kind of sleepy. I\u2019m sorry, darling, what were you saying?\u201d Announcing that another man had been on her mind was not likely to garner his sympathy.</p><p>Thoughts of Seth Gunderson consumed her day and night, but she\u2019d have to be a complete moron to drop Warren for a man who lived on a sailboat. Seth infuriated her. He could have slept with her, would have if she\u2019d had any say in the matter. Every time she thought about that night, Justine felt so angry and humiliated, she wanted to bash her head against the wall. Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!</p><p>In her weakness she\u2019d encouraged him, and that had been a dreadful mistake. Seth believed she was leaving Warren for him. She couldn\u2019t. Warren needed her, and in her own way she needed him.</p><p>\u201cI was talking about us,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>The conversation was about to become awkward. Justine could feel it.</p><p>\u201cOh, Warren, do you really think this is the time?\u201d She pouted very prettily at him.</p><p>\u201cYes. Tonight\u2019s a celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>He beamed her a smile and leaning across the table, clasped her fingers. Stroking his thumb over the back of her hand, he held her gaze. \u201cYou know how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>She did indeed. Justine might be a lot of things, but she wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>\u201cMove in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Warren.\u201d Two or three times a year he pressured her to make that decision. So far, she\u2019d always managed to change the subject, cajole him out of his insistence on \u201ctaking the next step.\u201d Dating Warren was one thing; living with him was an entirely new scorecard. She\u2019d never intended their relationship to go that far.</p><p>\u201cBefore you answer,\u201d he said, \u201ctake a look at this.\u201d He broke eye contact long enough to reach inside his pocket and bring out a jeweler\u2019s velvet case.</p><p>\u201cWarren?\u201d</p><p>So the pressure was about to intensify. It didn\u2019t matter. She wasn\u2019t willing to surrender her freedom, regardless of what he offered.</p><p>\u201cBefore I show you this, I want to explain.\u201d He took her hand once again, his eyes serious, then looked down at the table. \u201cYou never ask for more than I can give,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>By that he meant she accepted his inability to perform sexually. Actually, she didn\u2019t mind, even preferred the lack of a physical relationship. Justine kept his secret; she owed him that. She suspected very few people knew of Warren\u2019s problems. Apparently they were of a kind that a small blue pill wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cI like my freedom,\u201d she reminded him sweetly, not wanting to offend.</p><p>\u201cYou can have your freedom, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it would,\u201d he argued. \u201cIn fact, you can have your own room if you insist.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d suggested that the last time he\u2019d brought up the subject. She hadn\u2019t been interested then, and she wasn\u2019t now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of your mother, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Warren asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d She knew it would be easy to lay the blame at her mother\u2019s feet. She was a judge, an important member of the community, but Justine was her own woman. What she did with her life shouldn\u2019t be any reflection on her mother\u2019s career.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning me down?\u201d He wore the little-boy expression that might have been cute twenty years ago, but at his age left him looking merely pathetic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You know I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He gave her a wide grin and flipped open the lid of the velvet case.</p><p>Justine gasped. It was the largest solitaire diamond she\u2019d ever seen in her life, a good three or four carats. She brought her hand to her mouth, speechless.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She could only nod.</p><p>\u201cI want us to get married, Justine. This is your engagement ring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarried?\u201d The room started to buzz and she felt a little dizzy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful and a classy woman. When men see you with me, I feel like a million bucks. We make a good couple, baby.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. His insensitivity was almost laughable. He was trying to persuade her to become his wife by telling her she enhanced his image. That was supposed to induce her to marry him?</p><p>\u201cYou told me once you don\u2019t want a family,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that works for both of us, then.\u201d</p><p>Justine swallowed hard.</p><p>He glanced around him, then lowered his voice. \u201cIf you want to maintain separate bedrooms after we\u2019re married, that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Warren.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d he said. \u201cTake the ring. Try it on.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked, simply because she wanted to see what a four-carat diamond looked like on her finger. A man with romantic inclinations would have taken the opportunity to slip the ring on her finger himself. Seth would\u2019ve\u2014she was sure of it\u2014but there was no way he could afford a diamond of this size...now or in any other lifetime.</p><p>The ring glided onto her finger as if it\u2019d been designed for her. It was the most fabulous piece of jewelry she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWear it for a while,\u201d Warren urged. \u201cIt\u2019s insured.\u201d</p><p>Justine gazed at the diamond, then reluctantly removed it from her finger. \u201cI\u2019m going to think very seriously about your proposal,\u201d she told him, and she meant it.</p><p>\u201cListen, if it\u2019s your parents that worry you, I\u2019ll talk to them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI make my own decisions, Warren.\u201d She shuddered at the thought of Warren confronting either of her parents. It wouldn\u2019t be a meeting of minds, that much she could guarantee.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you have an answer?\u201d he asked, ever the businessman. He wouldn\u2019t allow her to keep him dangling long.</p><p>\u201cNext week,\u201d she told him. Even if she did reject his proposal, nothing about their relationship would change. Warren knew it and so did she.</p><p>Seth phoned Justine from Alaska the following night. She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. He always seemed to know when she least wanted him to call.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said. His clear voice sounded as if he were across the street rather than a thousand miles north.</p><p>\u201cHello, Seth.\u201d</p><p>A short pause followed her greeting. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem happy to hear from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny reason for that?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and sighed. She might as well tell him. The sooner Seth knew, the better\u2014for both of them. \u201cWarren asked me to marry him last night.\u201d</p><p>Another brief hesitation, then, \u201cHave you accepted his proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you tempted?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t, but letting Seth think otherwise was a sure way to get him out of the picture. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue with her or try to persuade her to reject the other man. Nor did he say she\u2019d be a fool if she agreed to marry Warren. Instead he asked, \u201cDo you love him?\u201d He kept his tone conversational, as though her answer was a matter of indifference to him.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided that yet, either.\u201d She was fond of Warren, but compared to the fire that surfaced whenever she was with Seth, fond was a bland emotion.</p><p>\u201cAre you waiting for me to make your decision for you?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounds like to me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed loudly. \u201cI only mentioned it because I thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>He snickered, irritating her even more.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your boyfriend how you practically dragged me into your bed?\u201d</p><p>That was a low blow, and Justine had no intention of responding.</p><p>\u201cWarren knows about you.\u201d She wasn\u2019t absolutely sure if that was true, but she had her suspicions. Most likely, her being seen with Seth was what had prompted the marriage proposal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he does.\u201d Seth\u2019s anger had vanished as soon as it appeared. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, apparently bored with the subject, \u201cI guess you have an important decision to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me when you\u2019ve made it.\u201d</p><p>Justine sensed that he was about to hang up, and perversely, she didn\u2019t want their conversation to end, not like this. And yet, she was helpless to do anything but agree. \u201cI will,\u201d she whispered, miserable and furious at the same time.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought,\u201d he said, and she could practically hear his scorn, \u201cdon\u2019t bother. We both know what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d Having said that, he broke the connection. Justine was left holding the telephone receiver, which buzzed insistently in her ear.</p><p>The sun reflected off the bright green water of Puget Sound as the ferry pulled away from the Bremerton dock and moved smoothly through Rich Passage on the hour-long journey to Seattle. Standing at the railing, with the wind ruffling her dark hair, and breathing in the salty tang of the sea, Olivia turned to smile at Jack.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so beautiful this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he joked, \u201cI ordered it just for today.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is no joke,\u201d he insisted, with a look so serious she was tempted to laugh outright. \u201cI said, \u2018God, I\u2019ve got this important date Sunday afternoon and I\u2019d appreciate a little cooperation from you in the weather department.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned back to the railing, leaning her elbows on it, and waited impatiently for a glimpse of the Seattle skyline. Jack\u2019s son, Eric, was picking them up at the ferry terminal and the three of them would have dinner on the waterfront. This would be the first time Olivia had met Eric, and Jack seemed more nervous about it than she did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken several vacations in the past few years,\u201d Olivia told him, \u201cand traveled in a number of different countries, but I\u2019ve never found any place more beautiful than Seattle when the sun is shining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lush and green, all right,\u201d Jack said, grumbling, \u201cas it should be after three months of drizzle and rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it time for you to sit under a happy light?\u201d she asked, posing the question to him that she\u2019d once asked her children. Whenever the day was especially gloomy and they\u2019d argued and complained about being unable to play outside, Olivia had made them sit under a lamp and read. James had dubbed it the happy light because he\u2019d figured out that until he smiled, she wouldn\u2019t let him leave the chair.</p><p>\u201cHappy light?\u201d</p><p>Olivia explained, and they joked for several minutes. When they fell silent, she noticed how tense he seemed. He left her at the rail and paced the length of the ferry, drank three cups of coffee to her one and fidgeted during the entire ride from the Kitsap Peninsula into Elliot Bay.</p><p>Olivia recognized Eric as Jack\u2019s son the instant she saw him. He was as tall as his father, with an athletic build, and other than his choice of clothing, they looked very much alike.</p><p>\u201cHello, Eric,\u201d Olivia said, extending her hand.</p><p>\u201cThis is Olivia Lockhart.\u201d Jack introduced her, sweeping his arm in her general direction.</p><p>Father and son didn\u2019t hug or exchange handshakes. Since Stan was quite demonstrative, it struck her as odd.</p><p>\u201cHow was the ferry ride?\u201d Eric asked as they started walking along the waterfront.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Jack said enthusiastically, as though they\u2019d just stepped off a cruise ship instead of a one-hour Puget Sound crossing.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Eric asked next.</p><p>\u201cFamished.\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced at father and son, surprised by the awkwardness she continued to sense.</p><p>Eric told them he\u2019d chosen a restaurant before their arrival and made reservations. \u201cI hope you like crab,\u201d he said, leading the way.</p><p>\u201cLove it,\u201d Olivia assured him.</p><p>Eric turned to his father. \u201cI\u2019m game,\u201d Jack muttered.</p><p>Apparently Eric wasn\u2019t acquainted with his father\u2019s tastes. That, too, seemed odd. The restaurant Eric had chosen specialized in freshly cooked crab, served on newspaper-lined tabletops. Each patron was supplied with a wooden mallet and a bib. By the time they finished cracking the steaming Dungeness crab and dipping the pieces in melted butter, they were talking with ease, bursts of conversation punctuated by laughter.</p><p>Everything about the meal was wonderful. When they\u2019d washed up, Eric walked them back to the ferry. Once more he appeared rather formal, and the conversation, which had flowed so comfortably throughout the meal, suddenly seemed stilted. Jack\u2019s hands were buried inside his raincoat pockets.</p><p>\u201cI had a good time,\u201d Eric announced. Was it Olivia\u2019s imagination or did he sound a little shocked by that revelation?</p><p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Eric didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. \u201cWould you like to meet again sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that very much,\u201d Jack said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Eric smiled charmingly at Olivia. \u201cIt was nice meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Eric.\u201d</p><p>The cars started to leave the Bremerton ferry and it was time to walk onboard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Jack said, steering Olivia toward the terminal and the ticket booth for walk-on customers.</p><p>Eric raised his hand in farewell and eased away, taking small steps backward.</p><p>Jack purchased their tickets, and as they boarded the ferry, he said, \u201cThat went well, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>She could feel his relief and found his reaction\u2014his entire attitude toward his son\u2014a bit puzzling. Still thinking about it, she followed him up the steps to the main deck. Jack hurried ahead of her toward the back railing and stood there, the wind in his face as he looked out over the Seattle waterfront.</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d Jack called. He placed his finger between his lips and let out a piercing whistle.</p><p>Eric jerked around, saw them and waved once more.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a well-adjusted young man,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe credit for that goes to his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t part of his life while he was young?\u201d That would explain the awkwardness between them.</p><p>\u201cI was around but...I wasn\u2019t much of a father.\u201d</p><p>Olivia understood what he was saying. Between law school and everything else that\u2019d been crammed into the early years of her own children\u2019s lives, Olivia suffered her share of regrets. She\u2019d longed to be a good mother, still did, but there were only so many hours in a day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud to be his father.\u201d</p><p>It was probably the best compliment a father could give his son, but unfortunately Eric hadn\u2019t been there to hear it.</p><p>\u201cDo you see him often?\u201d she asked, attempting to gauge the relationship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe try,\u201d was all Jack would admit. \u201cHowever, we have a lot of issues\u2014\u201d he grimaced at the word \u201c\u2014that we need to work through.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at his distaste for what he called psychobabble. He\u2019d told her more than once that he preferred plain speaking.</p><p>\u201cBut you and Eric are both making the effort,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cYes, we are.\u201d Then, as though searching for a way to turn the subject from himself, he asked, \u201cAny word from Justine?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia wanted to groan aloud. Her daughter was her main source of concern just now. Although Justine hadn\u2019t said anything to Olivia, word had filtered through town about her and Seth Gunderson. Olivia felt like cheering. Seth was exactly the kind of man she pictured for her headstrong daughter.</p><p>Then Seth had left for Alaska, and all of a sudden the gossip was about Warren Saget ordering a huge diamond ring from Berghoff Jewelers. Warren had purposely chosen a local jeweler, and the whys of it didn\u2019t escape Olivia. He wanted her to know. Coward that he was, Warren Saget didn\u2019t have the courage to confront Olivia face-to-face. He left the broadcasting of his intentions to the gossipmongers of Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Jack gave a nonchalant shrug. \u201cDid she say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d It hurt to admit that her only daughter hadn\u2019t even discussed a marriage proposal with her mother.</p> <p>\u201cIf she says yes, what will you do?\u201d Jack asked, watching her closely.</p><p>\u201cDo?\u201d As if Olivia had a choice. \u201cWhat can I do? I\u2019ll grin and bear it, but I\u2019ll have a hell of a time calling Warren my son-in-law, especially since we\u2019re almost the same age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Seth Gunderson aware of the...proposal?\u201d</p><p>That was the mystery of the hour. \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d she said grimly.</p> <p>Jack threw his arm around her shoulder. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to work out, just wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Olivia tried to think positive thoughts, but she wondered if Jack was referring to her situation, or his own.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Charlotte believed with all her heart that Tom Harding had entrusted her with his most precious keepsakes for a reason. She was to find an heir or, failing that, make sure these things were properly displayed in a museum. It was a task she took seriously. Seriously enough to flirt with breaking the law.</p><p>For days she mulled over what to do. Because Tom had been a ward of the state, her biggest fear was that the saddle, guns, poster and television scripts would be confiscated and sold at auction in order to recoup the money spent on his care. According to Washington State law, Tom was only allowed two-thousand dollars\u2019 worth of property. At least, that was how Olivia had explained it.</p><p>\u201cCan the state take all this away?\u201d she\u2019d asked her daughter the day of their discovery.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>Charlotte knew what that \u201cwell\u201d signified and, despite the risk, took action behind her daughter\u2019s back. And the state\u2019s...If it meant she was about to be hauled off to the clinker, then so be it.</p> <p>Since then, Olivia had been preoccupied with court issues, but Charlotte\u2019s innate honesty made it impossible not to tell her daughter what she\u2019d done. She decided to pay a visit to the judge\u2019s chambers one Monday at noon. It wasn\u2019t likely that Olivia would have her own mother arrested.</p><p>Charlotte peeked inside and was instantly welcomed by the smell of old books and lemon oil. Looking up from her desk, Olivia frowned. \u201cHello, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d</p><p>Deep in thought, Olivia took a moment to focus before answering.</p><p>\u201cIn case another time would be better, I want you to know I\u2019ve been back to Tom\u2019s storage unit and have taken some of his things. I couldn\u2019t put it off any longer. Janet wanted that key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Olivia cried, covering her ears. Her daughter always did have a certain dramatic flair. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have them in my safekeeping. We both know what\u2019ll happen once Social Service discovers Tom had anything of value.\u201d Charlotte simply couldn\u2019t allow that to happen.</p><p>Olivia stood, stared at her, then promptly sat down. She sighed. \u201cWell...there\u2019s a case, weak though it is, for claiming that the items weren\u2019t of any real value until after his death.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like an argument an attorney would make, but still...an excellent justification, Charlotte thought with a satisfied nod. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t as though Charlotte had cleared out the storage unit. She\u2019d left the furniture, shabby and worn but still usable. She\u2019d taken only what she felt Tom wanted her to save from obscurity. Only the things that should go to his family\u2014if she could find anyone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI have everything under control.\u201d It worried her that Olivia had so little to say. Perhaps there were more legal ramifications than she understood, whole laws she didn\u2019t even know she\u2019d broken.</p><p>\u201cYour having control is what frightens me,\u201d Olivia said acerbically. Charlotte let that pass. \u201cHave you tracked down any family members?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...not yet, but I will. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mother, this is a huge responsibility.\u201d</p><p>As though Charlotte needed reminding. \u201cI feel it\u2019s my duty.\u201d Straightening, she decided she might as well confess everything. \u201cI want you to know I\u2019ve hired Roy McAfee to search out any heirs Tom might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t have a problem with her hearing, so Charlotte left the question unanswered.</p><p>Olivia sighed again. \u201cWhat did Roy tell you?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s fingers tightened around her purse, which was balanced on her knees. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually spoken to him yet. When I phoned for the appointment, Corrie and I spoke. I explained why I need Roy\u2019s help. I\u2019m seeing him this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, please don\u2019t tell anyone else what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not to worry. I won\u2019t mention how you went with me that first time, either.\u201d</p><p>Olivia groaned. \u201cThat would be appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to let you know what Roy finds out?\u201d She had the impression Olivia would rather not be kept informed. The way her mind was all caught up with legalities, that was probably for the best. Charlotte often felt astonished by how frequently the courts abandoned common sense. \u201cNever mind,\u201d Charlotte said, getting to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll fill you in later.\u201d</p><p>Olivia seemed decidedly relieved. \u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>The course of her action already determined, Charlotte walked out of the courthouse. Troy Davis nodded at her, and Charlotte quickly looked away, certain the chief of police would guess she was a felon on the run. Thankfully he didn\u2019t and merely strolled past. Really, it was a wonder that guilty people didn\u2019t give themselves away.</p><p>Later that same afternoon, Charlotte arrived at Roy McAfee\u2019s office a full thirty minutes before her scheduled appointment. She had her knitting with her and sat in his waiting room, her needles clicking at a furious pace. Illegal activities were one thing, but confessing them to a former policeman\u2014well, that really tried her nerves.</p><p>Corrie was busy on the phone and apologized when she\u2019d finished. \u201cRoy won\u2019t be back for another twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m early,\u201d Charlotte returned. Olivia would protect her from the long arm of the law\u2014or so she assumed\u2014but she had no such guarantee with Roy. Well, so be it. Her resolve bolstered her spirits, although she didn\u2019t exactly savor the possibility of jail.</p><p>\u201cFiddlesticks,\u201d Charlotte muttered. It was a chance she had to take.</p><p>Corrie glanced up. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Charlotte said with a sigh. Roy arrived five minutes before her appointment time, and by then Charlotte had worked herself into a frenzy of worry. Corrie was aware of the reason for the visit, but Charlotte eluded her questions, preferring to speak to Roy alone.</p><p>Perhaps a minute later, Corrie announced that he was ready to see her. Stuffing her knitting needles and yarn back into her quilted bag, Charlotte stood up.</p><p>Roy sat behind a large oak desk littered with files. His computer was off to one side, and what files weren\u2019t on his desk were stacked around him on the floor. Charlotte had no idea a private investigator would have this much business, especially in a town the size of Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Roy asked in a crisp, professional tone.</p><p>Now that she was here, Charlotte wasn\u2019t sure where to start\u2014probably not by confessing she\u2019d recently committed a felony, if indeed that was what she\u2019d done. \u201cDid you ever watch Saturday cowboy shows as a boy?\u201d</p><p>Roy grinned. \u201cYou bet.\u201d He held up his index finger and blew on it as though it were a smoking gun barrel.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember Tom Houston?\u201d she asked next.</p><p>\u201cThe Yodeling Cowboy?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte brightened. \u201cYes. Well, you\u2019re going to be surprised to learn that until his death last month, Tom lived right here in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Roy leaned forward and his eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said, beaming with pride that she knew this fact before anyone else. \u201cWe were good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Tom Houston?\u201d Roy looked impressed.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She released a deep sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was Tom Houston at the time. He went by the name of Tom Harding.\u201d She explained the circumstances that had led up to their meeting and everything that had happened since his death. Including her raid on the storage unit.</p><p>\u201cYou have all the memorabilia at your home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She\u2019d avoided mentioning Olivia\u2019s name, but she could see that Roy had several questions. \u201cI realize that what I did is flirting with civil disobedience,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had trouble remembering all those fancy legal terms. \u201cBut...\u201d Then she decided that if he wasn\u2019t worrying about the illegality of her activities, she wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Charlotte had thought that should be obvious. \u201cI need to find out if Tom has any living heirs. Can you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can. Did you see anything in Tom\u2019s things that gave his Social Security number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can get it.\u201d Janet Lester was sure to have it in the accumulated paperwork she had for Tom. She frowned, wondering exactly how to ask. As much as she liked and trusted the social worker, Charlotte hadn\u2019t told Janet any of this, including the fact that she\u2019d taken things from the storage unit. No need dragging her friends to jail with her, if it came to that.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone else know Tom\u2019s true identity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly Olivia.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded approvingly. \u201cKeep it that way until you hear from me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It hadn\u2019t been easy staying quiet about all this, but Charlotte feared that once the story became public, long-lost relatives would be popping out of the woodwork, all eager to claim their inheritance.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d Charlotte asked. Now that she\u2019d officially hired Roy, she was ready for results.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise you a definite time line,\u201d Roy told her. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to make an appointment for two weeks from now, I\u2019ll give you a progress report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just look it up on the computer?\u201d she asked, waving her hand in the direction of his monitor.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll start there.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had taken a basic computer class last summer. Using Olivia\u2019s old computer, she\u2019d typed up her columns for Jack\u2014because he\u2019d insisted on it. But the best part about a computer was playing games such as solitaire, although the contraption made it impossible to cheat. What fun was that?</p><p>She planned to buy a new computer soon, with the money she\u2019d earned from her contributions to the Seniors\u2019 Page. She had all kinds of ideas for future columns; once this was all settled, she might even write about meeting Tom....</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks, then?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>As Charlotte walked out, she felt as though a great burden had been lifted from her shoulders.</p><p>Cathy laughed at Cecilia\u2019s caricature of a ditzy hairdresser. Cecilia was going to help her add do-it-yourself highlights to her hair on this rainy Wednesday afternoon. Since that first video-and-popcorn evening they\u2019d found reasons to get together often. Neither one could afford much, so they took turns having each other over for various kinds of low-budget fun\u2014like movies or dinner. Gradually Cathy had drawn Cecilia into a circle of other Navy wives. On the night of her wedding anniversary, the whole group had shown up at The Captain\u2019s Galley. Last weekend, Cecilia had met Carol Greendale, another Navy wife who\u2019d had a baby girl the same month as Allison. She\u2019d found it hard\u2014more than hard\u2014to see Carol with her daughter. She\u2019d made excuses to leave, but despite her vague protests and paper-thin excuses, Cathy had patiently convinced her to stay. In the end, Cecilia was glad she had.</p><p>Cathy headed for the bathroom to wash her hair while Cecilia read through the package directions. \u201cDid you bring a crochet hook?\u201d she asked when Cathy reappeared with a bathroom towel wrapped around her head.</p><p>\u201cNo. Do we need one?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia wasn\u2019t sure the small plastic hook included in the kit would work as well. \u201cNever mind, we\u2019ll manage with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I make a run over to K mart? I could pick up another package to do your hair, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot this time, okay?\u201d Cecilia shook her head. \u201cLook\u2014I have to draw strands of hair through the holes in this plastic cap....\u201d She frowned as she studied the paraphernalia that had come with the kit.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Ian lately?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia shook her head. It\u2019d been almost three weeks since their anniversary, and she hadn\u2019t thanked him for the flowers, hadn\u2019t even acknowledged getting them. She hadn\u2019t contacted him in any way. Ian hadn\u2019t written her, either. Apparently her message had been received and understood.</p><p>\u201cAndrew says they\u2019re putting into port soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustralia?\u201d</p><p>Cathy gave an exaggerated sigh and propped her chin on one knee. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to visit the South Pacific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his last letter, Andrew wrote about the night sky,\u201d Cathy said in a soft voice.</p> <p>Cecilia stopped rereading the directions to listen. Ian loved the stars and was actually quite knowledgeable about the planets and constellations. She remembered the clear summer night he\u2019d pointed out Cassiopeia and recounted the ancient Greek legend about its formation. Cecilia had been enthralled\u2014and she\u2019d learned something new about her husband.</p><p>\u201cAndrew said there are a billion stars out at night,\u201d Cathy was saying. \u201cAt first he was disappointed because there seemed to be a thin cloud cover that obscured his view.\u201d She paused and laughed softly. \u201cThen Ian told him the cloud cover he was complaining about was actually the Milky Way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAndrew said he\u2019d never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia looked at her friend and was surprised to find tears in her eyes. \u201cYou miss him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cathy bit her lip and nodded. \u201cCecilia,\u201d she whispered and reached for her hand, gripping it hard. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>The again was what threw Cecilia. Andrew and Cathy didn\u2019t have children.</p><p>\u201cI miscarried the first two pregnancies,\u201d Cathy explained in a voice that trembled with emotion. \u201cI...don\u2019t know if I can go through that agony a third time.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia glanced toward her bedroom and the single photograph she had of Allison. It was a dreadful photo taken shortly after her daughter\u2019s birth. Allison had been so small, her skin so pallid. The hospital had stuck a tiny pink bow in her hair and someone had snapped the shot. It proved to be the only one she would ever have, and Cecilia treasured it.</p><p>Looking embarrassed, Cathy wiped her eyes and said, \u201cI knew you\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively they hugged. The damp towel slipped to the floor, and Cathy buried her face in Cecilia\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI figure it happened when the George Washington returned for repairs.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia was fortunate not to be in the same predicament herself. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell Andrew?\u201d</p><p>Cathy frowned. \u201cHe\u2019ll just worry. He\u2019s half a world away, and there isn\u2019t a thing he can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want children?\u201d</p><p>Cathy nodded, but the admission seemed to cause her pain. \u201cMore than anything. Andrew, too. When I miscarried the first time, we were upset, but when I lost the second pregnancy, it devastated us both. I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019ll happen if I miscarry this time....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do the doctors say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat everything looks normal and healthy, but we were told the same thing before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there a medical reason for the miscarriages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s what makes it so frustrating. They couldn\u2019t find anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cathy...\u201d Cecilia didn\u2019t know what to say that would ease her friend\u2019s fears.</p><p>\u201cNo one can figure it out. Twice now, and I can\u2019t seem to stay pregnant for more than three months.\u201d She gnawed on her lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m about nine weeks along and I\u2019m so scared.\u201d As if she were suddenly cold, Cathy folded her arms tightly. \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but when I first found out, I actually considered terminating the pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia said nothing. Cathy needed to confide in her, and this was not the time to be judgmental or to argue with her friend.</p><p>\u201cI kept thinking I\u2019d rather lose the baby early than build my hopes up. Now I realize how ludicrous that kind of thinking is.\u201d She drew in a deep breath. \u201cNo one else knows I\u2019m pregnant, not even my parents. I didn\u2019t want to say anything until I\u2019m in my fourth month...if I make it that far.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia could understand the fear and the doubt. It wasn\u2019t only her own hopes Cathy didn\u2019t want to dash. She was considering those of her husband and her family, as well. Cecilia knew what a difficult burden that was. And she knew that such a burden only grew heavier if you couldn\u2019t share it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise you that this pregnancy is going to be different from the first two,\u201d she said solemnly, holding Cathy\u2019s gaze. \u201cNo one knows what the future will bring. But I can promise that whatever happens, I\u2019ll be there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cecilia, you don\u2019t know how much that means to me.\u201d Cathy wiped her cheeks with her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m so emotional when I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia\u2019s laugh was poignant. \u201cYou and me both.\u201d The first few months she was pregnant with Allison, she\u2019d wept at the flimsiest excuses. A sentimental television commercial could reduce her to a sniveling, tissue-packing blob. The bouts sometimes lasted for hours.</p><p>Cathy touched Cecilia\u2019s arm. \u201cAre you afraid to have another baby, too?\u201d</p><p>The mere thought resulted in stark terror. \u201cI...won\u2019t. Ian knows how I feel.\u201d Cecilia stopped just short of confessing that this was one of the reasons she felt compelled to follow through with the divorce.</p><p>\u201cGive it time,\u201d Cathy advised, and they hugged once more. \u201cGood grief,\u201d she said, forcing a laugh. \u201cMy hair\u2019s dry already.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing the plastic hook, Cecilia held it up. \u201cI\u2019m ready to torture you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember I get my turn later.\u201d</p><p>The afternoon passed in a whirl of giggles, chatter and popcorn, and by the time Cathy left, Cecilia was tired but exhilarated. The blond streaks were a success. But far more important, their friendship had become stronger and deeper because of what Cathy had shared. Cecilia understood why she\u2019d confided in her. Cathy knew that, of all the women in their small group, Cecilia was the only one who could identify with the trauma and the recriminations that followed the loss of a child. It didn\u2019t matter that Cathy was only a few months pregnant when she miscarried. Her unborn children had laid claim to her heart.</p><p>As she readied for bed that evening, Cecilia stared at the one picture she had of Allison. The dried bouquet from her wedding had been fashioned into a heart-shaped frame.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re from your daddy,\u201d she whispered to her daughter.</p><p>Then, because she was weak and because her heart ached, Cecilia reached for a pad and pen.</p><p>May 16th</p><p>Dear Ian,</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to write you again. I probably shouldn\u2019t now. Nothing has changed. Nothing will. Still, I find that you\u2019re on my mind and I hope we can at least be friendly toward each other.</p><p>I spent the day with Cathy Lackey. Don\u2019t tell Andrew, but his wife is partially blond now, thanks to me. While she was here, Cathy mentioned that the George Washington would be docking in Sydney Harbour this week. You always said you\u2019d see the Southern Cross. Is it as incredible as you hoped? I imagine it is.</p><p>I was going to drop out of school. Really, I couldn\u2019t see the point of sticking it out. At the rate of two classes a quarter, it\u2019ll take me a hundred years to get a degree, but then I decided that it didn\u2019t matter if I ever got one. I like school, and as Mr. Cavanaugh said, knowledge is never wasted. I really like Mr. Cavanaugh. He\u2019s the kind of person I wish my father was, although I have to admit Bobby tries. He does. When the flowers arrived for our anniversary and I started to cry, he patted my back\u2014and then walked away. Oh, well...But later he confessed that every year on the anniversary of his divorce, he gets drunk. I think that was supposed to comfort me. In some odd way, it did.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a very long letter and I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019ll mail it. Basically, I wanted to thank you for the flowers and tell you Happy Anniversary, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All my best,</p><p>Cecilia</p><p>May 26th</p><p>My dearest Cecilia,</p> <p>I\u2019ve hardly ever been as excited as I was this morning at mail call. I\u2019d given up on hearing from you. Andrew said my shout was heard three decks below. Thank you, thank you and thank you again for mailing that letter. You have no idea how badly I needed to hear from you.</p><p>I\u2019m glad you got the flowers. Happy Anniversary, Sweetheart. It\u2019s been one hell of a first year, hasn\u2019t it? From here on out, it\u2019ll be better. You feel it, too, don\u2019t you?</p><p>I did see the Southern Cross, and it was even more exciting than I\u2019d dreamed. That experience could only have been improved in one way\u2014having you beside me when I found it.</p><p>I can\u2019t write much. I\u2019m on duty in five minutes and I want to mail this as soon as I can. There\u2019s only one more thing I want to say. You mentioned that your father gets drunk on the anniversary of his divorce. He obviously has more than a few regrets. Don\u2019t make the same mistake he did, Cecilia. We need each other. I love you. There\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t work through. Not one damn thing. Remember that, all right?</p><p>Ian</p> <p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Kelly asked hopefully as she slid into the booth at the Pancake Palace. The restaurant was a local favorite, where the food was good and the portions hearty. Sunday mornings, the lineup to get a table often stretched out the door.</p><p>Grace\u2019s daughter had phoned earlier in the week, and they\u2019d agreed to meet Friday after work. With no reason to hurry home, Grace was free to have dinner out. Yet she felt an unaccountable urge to rush back to the house on Rosewood Lane. It was just habit, she decided. Thirty-five years of habit.</p><p>\u201cNo news,\u201d Grace answered.</p><p>\u201cMom, he can\u2019t have dropped off the face of the earth. Someone must know something.\u201d</p><p>If that was the case, no one had bothered to tell her. One thing Grace did know was that she could no longer afford Roy McAfee\u2019s services. He\u2019d made some suggestions to help her track down her missing husband, but Grace had run into a solid row of dead ends. Discouraged and defeated, she\u2019d given up trying. Even if she did manage to locate Dan, what could she possibly say? It wasn\u2019t as though she intended to beg him to come home.</p><p>The waitress brought them menus and Grace chose a chef\u2019s salad and coffee, while Kelly ordered a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would Daddy do something like this?\u201d Kelly asked\u2014as she\u2019d already asked dozens of times.</p><p>If Grace knew the answer to that, she could stop listening to the voices in her head. Besides her own emotions, she had those of her children to consider. Maryellen had reacted with outrage and anger. Kelly was more hurt. The younger of the two girls, she\u2019d always been closest to her father. Even as a child, Kelly had followed Dan around; while she was a teenager, she and Grace had constantly been at odds. Yet even through the worst of her rebellion, Kelly had steered clear of any major confrontation with her father.</p><p>Grace waited until they\u2019d finished their meals before she broached the subject she wanted to discuss. \u201cYour father\u2019s been gone six weeks now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kelly said, sounding exasperated. \u201cMom, I\u2019m so worried about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d Although she was more worried about what she\u2019d do once she found him. \u201cI want you to know I\u2019ve seen an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared at her as if she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cAn attorney can help you find Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve decided to file for divorce.\u201d</p><p>Kelly reached for her water glass. She took a sip and Grace could see that her daughter was struggling to hold on to her composure. \u201cMom, don\u2019t! Please don\u2019t. Dad\u2019s coming back. I know he is\u2014and when he does, we\u2019ll discover what this is all about. There\u2019s a logical reason he had to leave the way he did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this to punish your father. It\u2019s for legal reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegal reasons,\u201d Kelly repeated, frowning.</p><p>She told her about the need to cancel all their credit cards and her responsibility for half of any debts he assumed. What she didn\u2019t mention was that Dan had used the VISA to purchase a ring for another woman. Every time she thought about her husband doing such a thing, knowing full well that she\u2019d investigate the charge, she nearly broke down and wept.</p><p>\u201cYou still think Daddy\u2019s got a girlfriend, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Grace heard the challenge in her daughter\u2019s voice. She wanted to protect her children, hide the truth from them, but the charade had become too much for her. Dan wasn\u2019t concerned about protecting her. He\u2019d left her open to ridicule, speculation and embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t honestly think he\u2019d do that,\u201d Kelly insisted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I think,\u201d Grace said without apology. \u201cEverything leads me to believe he\u2019s involved with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook her head so hard her earring flew across the table. \u201cNot Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to believe it, either,\u201d Grace said quietly as Kelly retrieved the earring. \u201cDo you think it gives me any pleasure to tell you I\u2019m seeking a divorce? Your father and I have been married for thirty-five years. This isn\u2019t a decision I\u2019ve made lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Kelly pleaded.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Financial ruin? Dan could accumulate all kinds of expenses and as she\u2019d explained, she\u2019d be legally responsible for half the debt. A divorce would protect her from that.</p><p>\u201cWait until after the baby\u2019s born,\u201d Kelly whispered, her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Maryellen know you want to divorce Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to her last week.\u201d She\u2019d delayed mentioning it to Kelly for exactly this reason. No matter what Dan was guilty of doing, Kelly would find an excuse for him.</p><p>\u201cThe baby doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the divorce,\u201d Grace said firmly. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s beautiful blue eyes clouded with tears. \u201cGive him more time. It\u2019s only been six weeks.\u201d</p><p>Six hellish weeks. The six longest weeks of Grace\u2019s life. Her daughter apparently didn\u2019t understand what Dan\u2019s disappearance had done to her. It was difficult to hold up her head in public. Difficult to meet library patrons with a smile when it felt as though her life had been ripped in half. Grace saw the pitying looks in their eyes. She heard the whispers and knew they were talking about her.</p><p>\u201cThis baby deserves to be brought into a whole family,\u201d Kelly said stubbornly.</p><p>Grace wondered if it\u2019d do any good to point out that she wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d splintered the family unit. Dan had walked out on her, not the other way around.</p><p>Then, as if she\u2019d been waiting to deliver the final punch, Kelly reached for her purse and removed a shiny piece of rolled paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cA picture of your grandchild.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s heart started to pound faster. \u201cYou had your ultrasound?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cHere\u2019s your grandbaby, Mother.\u201d</p><p>This technology hadn\u2019t been available when Grace was pregnant with the girls. She studied the circular array of lines and squinted, barely able to make out the baby\u2019s form.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d Grace whispered, awed by the sight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Dad\u2019s grandbaby, too,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Grace\u2019s heart sank.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019ll wait before you file for divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Grace sighed. \u201cAll right, but just until after the baby\u2019s born. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Kelly gave her a relieved smile. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Olivia Lockhart left the Boeing 767 and stepped off the jetway. She was just returning from San Diego and a one-week visit with her son, his wife and their new baby. Isabella Dolores Lockhart was born in the wee hours of May eighteenth. The following morning, unable to stay away a moment longer, Olivia had boarded a plane for California. In seven short days, she\u2019d fallen completely in love with her first grandchild.</p><p>Collecting her luggage, Olivia glanced around, wondering if Justine was late. Her daughter had volunteered to pick her up at Sea-Tac Airport and was normally punctual. Her suitcase in hand, unsure what to do, Olivia walked over to the bank of phones.</p><p>\u201cLooking for a familiar face?\u201d a man asked from behind her.</p><p>Olivia knew the sound of her ex-husband\u2019s voice as well as she knew her own. \u201cStan! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else? I came to collect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Justine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked her to let me do the honors.\u201d</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t help feeling surprised. She rarely saw Stan and they didn\u2019t speak all that often. At fifty-six, he was still vital and handsome, and she smiled as he kissed her cheek, then relieved her of her bag. She\u2019d vowed to love this man all her life\u2014and despite the divorce, still did. It was a love that continued to this day because of everything they\u2019d once meant to each other. Because of what they\u2019d had\u2014and what they\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cI thought this would give you an opportunity to tell me about the baby. How\u2019s James?\u201d</p><p>After her visit, Olivia felt reassured. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much,\u201d she told him. \u201cI have pictures of the baby. Oh, Stan, she\u2019s adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re turning into one of those silly grandmas with a purse full of pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat. I\u2019ve waited a long time for this.\u201d Most of the friends they\u2019d once shared were grandparents several times over by now.</p><p>Together they headed toward the short-term parking on Sea-Tac\u2019s lower level. Olivia told him about the baby as they went, barely paying attention as Stan paid for parking and led the way down the escalator. They walked along the row of parked cars until he suddenly stopped in front of a red convertible.</p><p>Olivia did a double take. Stan in a BMW? A convertible, no less. Leave it to her ex-husband to buy a convertible in a city that had three solid months of rain every year!</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get this?\u201d she asked, not even trying to disguise her amusement.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolutely love it! You\u2019ll put the top down, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling as he slid into the front seat. He started the engine and made a real production of lowering the top. When he\u2019d finished, they were both laughing. \u201cThis reminds me of that beat-up old convertible you had in college,\u201d Olivia said between giggles. \u201cRemember when the top got stuck halfway up?\u201d</p><p>They talked comfortably throughout the drive. As they waited at a light, Olivia showed her ex the first photographs of their granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cBorn May 18th,\u201d Stan reminded her. \u201cThat\u2019s the day Mount Saint Helens blew, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>As if either one of them was likely to forget. They\u2019d driven to Portland for the weekend. Stan was attending some engineering conference and while he went to meetings, Olivia had taken the three children over to Lloyd Center. The shopping mall, with an ice-skating rink in the center, had fascinated eight-year-old Jordan. Olivia had tried to shop, but with three children constantly underfoot, it\u2019d been an impossible task and she\u2019d finally given up. After renting skates for herself and the kids, she\u2019d spent a delightful day. Then early Sunday morning, when they were to drive home, Mount Saint Helens had the first of several volcanic eruptions. Plumes of hot gasses, ash and rock had shot sixty thousand feet into the sky. The falling ash had made the drive back to Cedar Cove nerve-wracking. For several hours, they\u2019d been trapped on the Interstate with three whiny, frightened children in the back seat. Olivia had been no less terrified. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do remember May 18th, 1980, don\u2019t you?\u201d Stan asked.</p><p>In response, Olivia shuddered elaborately. She\u2019d never been happier to get home. The drive had been a nightmare, but time had a way of erasing the sharp edges of that memory. In later years, whenever the trip was mentioned, it was done with drama and lots of laughter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Stan said, staring at the color photos while they waited for the light to change.</p><p>\u201cJames is happy, and Selina\u2019s perfect for him. She\u2019s just the kind of wife he needs.\u201d As the youngest, James had been badly spoiled\u2014even more so after the death of his brother.</p> <p>Stan had worried about their son. She knew that, but James was an adult now and made his own decisions. Often Olivia disagreed with what he chose, such as joining the military. Without a word to either one of them, he\u2019d enlisted. Now he was married and a young father. This, too, had been accomplished without consulting either parent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d Stan did sound relieved.</p><p>Olivia had liked her daughter-in-law instantly. They\u2019d talked on the phone several times, but those brief conversations hadn\u2019t given her a clear picture of her son\u2019s wife. Selina belonged to a large extended and well-to-do family who\u2019d welcomed Olivia with the same enthusiasm that they had James and the new baby. There were dinners and celebrations every night of her visit. James was genuinely happy. He and Selina lived in a suite of rooms at his in-laws\u2019 home and amazingly, the arrangement seemed to be a success. Olivia was impressed by the amount of Spanish he\u2019d learned since he\u2019d met Selina. She\u2019d quickly realized that Selina\u2019s family had been part of the attraction for her son. James had been only ten at the time of the divorce, and although both Olivia and Stan had tried hard to make the split as amicable as possible, their son had suffered. Every child did. Olivia saw the results of divorce every day in family court.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Justine doing?\u201d Stan abruptly changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What did she say when you talked?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>He seemed worried about their daughter. \u201cShe still seeing that Saget guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asked her to marry him.\u201d By now, everyone in town knew about the diamond ring Warren had purchased. Justine, however, had yet to mention the proposal.</p><p>Stan cursed and swerved into another lane. \u201cIs she going to do it?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugged. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t confide in me when it comes to Warren Saget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk her out of it,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cYou\u2019re her mother\u2014she\u2019ll listen to you a hell of a lot more than she will me. Marrying Saget would be a disaster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but convincing Justine of that isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stubborn, just like her mother.\u201d</p><p>Stan was joking and Olivia grinned, but his amusement didn\u2019t last long. \u201cMarge\u2019s son is getting a divorce. She\u2019s pretty upset about it.\u201d</p><p>They rarely if ever talked about his wife.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat one of the most difficult aspects of being a parent is watching your child make what you know is a mistake and not being able to do a damn thing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Marge\u2019s son,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really too bad,\u201d Stan told her. \u201cHe\u2019s got two small children and he\u2019s leaving them for some gal he met in his office.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wondered if her ex-husband saw the irony of the situation. Marge had divorced her husband and abandoned her children for Stan, and now history was repeating itself.</p> <p>\u201cI will talk to Justine,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t communicate well. But we\u2019ve raised her to think for herself and make her own decisions, and we have to trust her to do so wisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s harder than it sounds.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t need him to tell her that.</p><p>By the time they hit the Seattle freeway, the sun had come out from behind the clouds. The wind and the traffic noise made conversation difficult. The hour\u2019s drive through Tacoma and over the Narrows Bridge passed quickly, especially when Stan plugged in a sixties rock-and-roll CD\u2014music they\u2019d danced to in their college days. Olivia was soon lost in happy memories.</p><p>She felt almost disappointed when he pulled onto Lighthouse Road.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She reacted with surprise when she noticed Jack\u2019s clunker parked outside her house behind Justine\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cSomeone you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin. He\u2019s the editor of The Chronicle.\u201d</p><p>Stan darted a glance in her direction. \u201cIsn\u2019t he the one you had a date with the night I phoned? Is he a...boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hardly. Jack\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Justine said when I first asked her about Saget,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe next thing I know, he\u2019s pressuring her to get engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to worry about me marrying Jack,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He parked at the curb and cut the engine and then said the oddest thing. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Good? He didn\u2019t want her to remarry? What a strange reaction, considering that he\u2019d been married to Marge for fourteen years. Before she could ask him about it, her front door opened and Justine stepped onto the porch\u2014with Jack right behind her.</p><p>He smiled and raised his hand in greeting, but his gaze slowly shifted away from her. Stan and Jack locked eyes.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home,\u201d Justine called, oblivious to the tension between the two men. She ran down the porch steps to greet her.</p><p>Olivia hugged her daughter, and with her arm wrapped around Justine\u2019s waist, walked toward her home. She was much too old to get excited about the attention of two men, she told herself. But then\u2014was she really?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to be back,\u201d she said, leaving Stan and Jack to follow if they chose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying to hear all about the baby. You didn\u2019t mind Dad picking you up, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d If anything, Olivia had enjoyed it too much.</p><p>Charlotte Jefferson could hardly wait for her daughter to return from California. She had so much to tell her. Although she knew Olivia would be exhausted from the trip, Charlotte couldn\u2019t delay talking to her another minute.</p><p>The last thing she expected when she arrived at Olivia\u2019s was a houseful of company. Anyone might\u2019ve thought she was having a garage sale.</p><p>Naturally she recognized Justine\u2019s SUV, and the Taurus looked like the one Jack Griffin drove, but the red BMW had her baffled.</p><p>Olivia answered the doorbell and relaxed noticeably when she saw her. \u201cMother.\u201d After a quick hug, Olivia brought her into the house. A pizza delivery box lay open on the table and a bottle of red wine was there, too.</p><p>\u201cAnything left for me?\u201d she joked.</p><p>\u201cGet your grandmother a wineglass,\u201d Olivia instructed Justine.</p><p>\u201cStan!\u201d Charlotte was delighted to see her ex-son-in-law. She\u2019d always been fond of him. The divorce had been as hard on her as it\u2019d been on her daughter and the children. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that red convertible belongs to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d He set his wineglass next to the pizza box. \u201cI hate to eat and run, but I\u2019ve got to get back to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d Charlotte would have dearly loved a chat.</p><p>\u201cAnother time,\u201d he promised. He bent down and kissed Charlotte\u2019s cheek, then hugged Justine, who was busy pouring a glass of wine. The two men exchanged brief handshakes and Olivia escorted him to the door. Charlotte soon realized that Stan had picked up Olivia from the airport. She realized something else, too. The two men had not taken a liking to each other. Now, that was interesting.</p><p>\u201cI should be leaving, too,\u201d Justine announced. She gave Charlotte a half-full goblet and a kiss, then promptly disappeared.</p><p>That left Jack, who showed no sign of departing in the near future. Well, Charlotte needed to talk to her daughter, so she intended on waiting him out. \u201cTell me all about the baby,\u201d she said, settling in for a long visit. \u201cDid James and Selina like the blanket I knit?\u201d Then sighing, she added, \u201cI do hope you brought back pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure did. Oh, Mother, she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you Wednesday?\u201d Jack asked, sounding a little dispirited.</p><p>Olivia hesitated a moment, then nodded. Apparently she\u2019d just agreed to a date, which cheered Charlotte immensely. She didn\u2019t want Olivia to be alone the rest of her life, and she liked Jack Griffin.</p><p>\u201cI should be heading out, too,\u201d Jack said reluctantly\u2014as though he wanted Olivia to ask him to stay.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. One look from Jack told Charlotte he wanted to be alone with Olivia, but she wasn\u2019t budging.</p><p>Soon enough he\u2019d departed. Privacy at last. Charlotte released a deep sigh. Olivia sat down next to her with a glass of wine, feet propped up on the coffee table. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, too,\u201d Charlotte said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cYou heard from Roy?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte grinned widely. \u201cYes, and guess what? Tom has a grandson living right outside Purdy.\u201d The town was only a few miles down Highway 16 from Cedar Cove. Charlotte was thrilled with the news. In her heart of hearts, she\u2019d known Tom had chosen to spend his last days in Cedar Cove for a reason.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Cliff Harding. Ever heard of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have.\u201d Olivia rubbed her eyes, and Charlotte could tell that her daughter was tired.</p><p>\u201cHe raises quarter horses.\u201d Roy had told her that, along with the other information he\u2019d unearthed. Cliff was a Boeing engineer who\u2019d opted for an early retirement. He\u2019d moved to the Kitsap Peninsula five years earlier.</p><p>\u201cI suspected Tom had family in the area.\u201d Charlotte felt downright proud of that.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be intrusive, so I wrote Cliff to ask him to get in touch.\u201d The letter had gone out the very day she\u2019d heard the news, but to her disappointment, she hadn\u2019t heard back from him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too.\u201d She finished her wine, and then, because it was obvious that her daughter wasn\u2019t in the mood for more company, Charlotte decided it was time to leave.</p><p>After a quick peek at the pictures, she gathered her things. Olivia made a token protest, then escorted her to the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you had a good trip. And I\u2019m thrilled about James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Olivia hugged her. \u201cDid you feel this elation when you first became a grandmother?\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been so long ago that Charlotte had forgotten. \u201cTwins, no less. That was one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d Olivia told her, but a sadness came over her, a sadness Charlotte felt, too, as they remembered Jordan and the happy, carefree boy he\u2019d been.</p><p>On her drive home, she thought about Cliff Harding. He would certainly have received her letter but for some reason had either put off answering, or\u2014worse\u2014decided not to answer at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perhaps she should have called, instead.</p><p>Yes, that was what she should\u2019ve done, all right.</p><p>Unable to resist, as soon as she walked into the house, Charlotte located his number, which Roy had given her.</p><p>The phone rang four times before the receiver was abruptly lifted.</p> <p>\u201cHarding,\u201d said a gruff male voice.</p><p>\u201cJefferson,\u201d she returned in the same clipped tones. \u201cCharlotte Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m phoning to see if you got my letter,\u201d she explained. She knew he most likely had but that seemed the easiest way to introduce her subject.</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte paused, wishing she\u2019d thought this through more carefully. \u201cPerhaps right now is a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as good a time as any. Basically, I\u2019m not interested in anything to do with my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte frowned in disapproval. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to reconsider when you see what I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Mrs. Jefferson, I realize you mean well, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you aware that your grandfather recently died right here in Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour letter said as much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Harding, I have risked a great deal to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ungrateful, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do jail time for what I\u2019ve done and at seventy-two, I don\u2019t intend to spend the rest of my life rooming with someone named Big Bertha.\u201d</p><p>He howled with laughter. How dared this young man be amused when she was dead serious?</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly did you do to risk facing Big Bertha?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte told him, sparing none of the details. \u201cI have everything under my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably the first place the police will look, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte suspected he was still mocking her\u2014a little bit, anyway\u2014but she gave him a straightforward reply. \u201cI did think of that, but my knees are too tired to be traipsing up and down the basement stairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy suggestion is that you give it all back to the state. Let the authorities sell it and recoup whatever expense they put out on my grandfather\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean that!\u201d Charlotte was outraged. \u201cMy dear boy, this was your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was as much a grandfather to me as he was a father to my dad. In other words, not at all. Dad saw him a grand total of three times in his entire life. I never had the pleasure nor would I have cared to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to learn what you can about him now,\u201d Charlotte argued.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t care. So what if he was a movie and TV cowboy from the forties and fifties. The \u2018Yodeling Cowboy,\u2019\u201d he added scornfully. \u201cWell, my dear Mrs. Jefferson, I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his blood that runs through your veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather it didn\u2019t. Like I said, he wasn\u2019t any kind of a father or grandfather, and I sincerely doubt he cared about me in the slightest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d Normally Charlotte wasn\u2019t this argumentative. But she refused to let this...this arrogant whelp turn his back on his heritage. \u201cYou have a great deal in common with your grandfather, young man.\u201d</p><p>Cliff snickered softly. \u201cI doubt that. And I\u2019m not so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you raise quarter horses?\u201d This was part of the information Roy had given her. \u201cWhere do you think that interest in horses came from?\u201d she asked grandly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her question. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Harding, please. Considering the risk I\u2019ve taken, the least you can do is look at what I\u2019ve rescued. There just might be something here you\u2019d want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like a Yodeling Cowboy lunch bucket? No, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean like his saddle and his six-shooter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a saddle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Charlotte suspected that was probably the one thing that might interest Tom\u2019s grandson.</p><p>\u201cI understand it\u2019s a federal crime to steal a gun.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte bristled. \u201cAre you trying to frighten me?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in response. \u201cAll right, listen,\u201d he said as if making a big concession. \u201cI\u2019m willing to look over all this junk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt most certainly is not junk.\u201d She could think of several museums that would leap at the opportunity to display some of the items she had under her bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a matter of opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come into Cedar Cove or do you want me to find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI avoid inviting known burglars into my home.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was not amused. \u201cThen you\u2019ll just have to drive to Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mrs. Jefferson. I can see you\u2019re not a woman who takes no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this instance, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Grace enjoyed her job as head librarian. Per capita, there were more library cards issued in Cedar Cove than in any other city or town in the entire state. She took real pride in that.</p><p>The Cedar Cove Library, with the mural painted on the outside of the old brick building, was one of the most attractive structures in town. For the one-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the township, the Chamber of Commerce had commissioned several murals to be painted on civic buildings around town. The waterfront library had been among those chosen; the artists had created an 1800s scene of a waterfront park with people in period dress enjoying a summer\u2019s afternoon\u2014children and dogs cavorting, families picnicking and, of course, people reading.</p><p>The downtown community was a lot like a family, Grace often thought. The business owners looked out for one another and encouraged the Cedar Cove population to shop locally. These days, when large conglomerates were moving into small towns and destroying independent businesses, Cedar Cove\u2019s downtown thrived. This was thanks in part to the library, the marina and the brand-new city hall, which was the most prominent building in Cedar Cove, rising from the steep hill above the waterfront like a protective angel standing guard over the town. The bells chimed on the hour; some people loved them and others cursed the constant interruption.</p><p>With Dan missing for almost two months now, Grace was more grateful than ever for her job. Aside from financial reasons, she valued the fact that it helped distract her, helped keep her mind from the constant wondering and worrying about her missing husband. At least it did for eight hours a day.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Sherman.\u201d Jazmine Jones, a five-year-old with a precocious wit and two missing front teeth, stepped up to the front desk and placed both hands on the counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re here for storytime,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>Jazmine nodded. \u201cAre you reading today or is Mrs. Bailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, but...\u201d Then, as if she didn\u2019t want to hurt Loretta Bailey\u2019s feelings, little Jazmine glanced over her shoulder and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re a better reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Grace whispered back conspiratorially.</p><p>Tuesday afternoons were often slow, and while Loretta entertained the children, Grace handled the front desk. She was busy doing some paperwork concerning interlibrary loans when the glass door slammed open and Maryellen rushed in.</p><p>At the unexpected noise, Grace glanced up from the desk and discovered her daughter flushed and breathless.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d The first thing that came to Grace\u2019s mind was Kelly and the baby.</p><p>Breathing hard, Maryellen staggered toward the desk. She placed her hand over her chest as though her heart needed to be held firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d she managed, barely able to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Grace had already come out from behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d This was unbelievable. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marina.\u201d</p><p>Grace was halfway out the door, with Maryellen stumbling behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou saw him?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen shook her head. \u201cJohn Malcom did.\u201d</p><p>Even as she raced out the library parking lot toward the waterfront, Grace was trying to remember who John Malcom was. Then she remembered. John and Dan had worked together years ago. John was another logger whose career had been wiped out in the controversy involving the spotted owl. Entire forests had been closed to cutting in an effort to save the endangered species, destroying the livelihood of certain communities in the shadow of the Olympic rainforest.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Grace cried.</p><p>\u201cDown by the foot ferry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he get on the ferry?\u201d Panting, she could hardly get the question out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Maryellen shouted, gaining on Grace. As luck would have it, Grace had worn high heels that morning and they made running nearly impossible. Maryellen had on flats and was much faster, but Grace wasn\u2019t any slouch. She took that aerobics class precisely to experience the benefits. Her adrenaline surging, she pounded down the sidewalk, putting everything she had into reaching Dan before he disappeared again. Suddenly she stumbled, then tripped over a water hose. She went down hard on the sidewalk, scraping her knees. Grace didn\u2019t give herself the luxury of checking her injuries.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. Go! Go!\u201d Ignoring the pain, she picked herself up, paused only long enough to remove her shoes and then started running again, limping as she went. By the time she reached the foot ferry, Grace felt as though her legs were about to collapse.</p><p>John was there, pacing back and forth. He came toward them as soon as he heard Maryellen\u2019s shout. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Maryellen cried. \u201cYou said you\u2019d stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d John\u2019s sober gaze refused to meet Grace\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, really sorry. He was here, and I kept an eye on him like you asked me to. About five minutes ago, a pickup drove to the curb and he climbed in and there was no way I could stop him.\u201d</p><p>Grace fell onto a park bench, her knees throbbing and her legs trembling.</p><p>\u201cStart at the beginning,\u201d she pleaded, barely able to talk. The frustration and anger were almost more than she could stand. Dan was that close, taunting her, daring her to find him, mortifying her in front of the entire town.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it was my dad?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>John nodded. \u201cI\u2019m positive. I worked with him for years. I know what Dan Sherman looks like, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get involved in this?\u201d Grace asked her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI just happened to take a late lunch today. I closed the gallery and decided to walk down to Java and Juice for a latte,\u201d Maryellen said.</p><p>\u201cI heard about Dan turning up missing and all,\u201d John went on. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk down at the Pelican\u2019s Nest about what might\u2019ve happened to him.\u201d</p><p>The local watering hole was one of the most popular drinking spots in town. \u201cHave you been drinking, John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Grace! I swear it was Dan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Maryellen interjected, \u201cand he was halfway to the library to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d want to know,\u201d John said, looking miserable. He shoved his hands in his coverall pockets and stared at the pavement.</p><p>\u201cThat was when he saw me,\u201d Maryellen explained.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter said she\u2019d get you and sent me back to keep an eye on Dan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom, your knee!\u201d</p><p>Blood trickled down Grace\u2019s leg; the nylons were already soaked.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Tell me about the pickup.\u201d Grace wanted as much information about Dan as she could get. She\u2019d take care of her knees later.</p><p>John hung his head. \u201cI should\u2019ve gotten the license plate number, but it happened so fast I didn\u2019t think to look.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you see who the driver was?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen sat down next to Grace, both hands over her face, and hunched forward.</p><p>Grace placed a comforting arm on Maryellen\u2019s back. Caught up in her own misery, she\u2019d failed to see how upset her oldest daughter was by Dan\u2019s disappearance. Kelly had been much more forthcoming about her emotions, and Grace had assumed Maryellen was taking the situation in stride. As far as anyone could...</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am about all this,\u201d John Malcom said again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see who was driving?\u201d Grace asked one final time.</p> <p>John shook his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anyone I recognized. Not from around here, leastways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale or female?\u201d</p><p>John hesitated and looked away. \u201cFemale.\u201d</p><p>Grace bit her lower lip to keep it from trembling. John wasn\u2019t telling her anything she didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Cecilia would forever be grateful that she hadn\u2019t given in to the impulse to drop out of her community college classes. The day of her wedding anniversary, she\u2019d been feeling depressed and regretful. She thought now that her desire to quit was a way of punishing herself\u2014by taking away the very thing in life that brought her joy. She couldn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d wanted to do such a thing. Thankfully, Mr. Cavanaugh had been kind enough to reason with her. He hadn\u2019t tried to pressure her or talk her out of it, but he\u2019d been sensible and matter-of-fact.</p><p>She loved her classes, especially advanced algebra. On a Sunday afternoon when she was free to go anywhere and do anything she wanted, Cecilia chose to work on problems in her textbook. Problems that hadn\u2019t even been assigned. That said a lot. Recently one of the other students had flippantly called Cecilia the teacher\u2019s pet. She didn\u2019t believe it since Mr. Cavanaugh wasn\u2019t the sort of teacher who played favorites. But afterward Cecilia had smiled all day. Never in her life had she experienced anything like this sense of approval and success.</p><p>She enjoyed telling Ian how well she was doing. They were back to e-mailing and writing. Yesterday, she\u2019d received a postcard from Australia. He hadn\u2019t chosen one with a picture of the famous opera house, the outback or even the Barrier Reef. No koalas or kangaroos, either. Instead, Ian had mailed her a photograph of the night sky. It showed the Milky Way and what looked like millions upon millions of stars. His message on the back was full of praise for her high marks and the promise of a celebration once he got home.</p> <p>Cathy was still keeping the news of her pregnancy from Andrew. It was all Cecilia could do not to tell Ian. Every day that Cathy remained pregnant was a triumph. She\u2019d miscarried the first pregnancy at eight weeks, and the second at twelve. Already this pregnancy had lasted longer than the first two, but Cathy couldn\u2019t trust that all was well\u2014not yet, anyway. Cecilia was the only person she\u2019d told. Not even her mother knew, and Cecilia regarded the news as sacred information.</p><p>At a little after one, she decided it was time for lunch. With the radio on in the background, she was opening a can of soup, when a news bulletin interrupted the Top 40 song that was playing.</p><p>\u201cThis is a KVI news bulletin. There\u2019s been an explosion aboard the George Washington, the Bremerton-based aircraft carrier. Details are just coming into our newsroom now. At this early hour we have no idea as to the cause of the explosion. The possibility exists that this is the work of a terrorist group. There has been loss of life, but how many casualties and the extent of damage to the aircraft carrier is unknown at this point. We\u2019ll keep you updated.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia gasped and dropped the soup can. The contents spilled out over the counter, dripping onto the floor. Unrolling some paper towels, she started wiping it up when the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she nearly shouted as she grabbed the receiver.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear?\u201d It was Cathy.</p><p>\u201cJust now. What do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing...just about the explosion. I called the ombudsman, but she\u2019d just heard it herself. The Navy has set up a meeting area on base for husbands, wives and family members to wait for news. We\u2019ll get information there more quickly than we will at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d Cecilia didn\u2019t waste time worrying about the appropriateness of being on base. Although she hadn\u2019t lived with Ian in many months, she was still his wife.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I phoned,\u201d Cathy said, her voice faltering. \u201cCould you swing by for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as fast as I can.\u201d Then it hit her. \u201cCathy, is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Cathy released a sob. \u201cI think so...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCath? You\u2019d better tell me.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia heard her friend struggle not to cry. \u201cI...I\u2019ve started spotting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d It might be more important to drive Cathy to the hospital first.</p><p>\u201cNot bad\u2014much lighter than the first two miscarriages.\u201d Cathy made it sound like a foregone conclusion that she would lose this baby, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cecilia, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d The tears were back in her voice.</p><p>Dumping everything in the sink, Cecilia didn\u2019t change clothes or bother with her hair or makeup. She refused to think of what might be happening to her husband half a world away. If there was one thing she\u2019d learned this past year, it was that she couldn\u2019t take anything for granted. She could only hope for the best.</p><p>Cathy was sitting on the front porch steps outside her rental house, waiting for her. As soon as Cecilia approached, Cathy stood. She looked shaken and deathly pale.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything else?\u201d Cecilia asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. You?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia had turned on the all-news radio station on the drive over. \u201cJust what was on the local news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA number of...deaths have been reported.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia couldn\u2019t bear to think about that. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have to find out what I can about Andrew first,\u201d Cathy said. \u201cIf we go to the hospital, it\u2019ll take hours and they might keep me. I need to know if Andrew\u2019s all right. Then I\u2019ll go, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still bleeding?\u201d</p><p>Cathy shook her head. \u201cNo, thank God.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia headed toward the Bremerton Navy base and joined the cars streaming toward the checkpoint at the entrance. It seemed that every spouse, parent and sibling of each enlisted man and woman sought information. A large hangar was set aside for the purpose; hundreds of chairs had been brought in, along with drinks and snacks.</p><p>Women, older men and children gathered together in small groups. Cecilia was astonished by the speed with which rumors started to circulate. By three that afternoon, word arrived of five confirmed deaths. Then Cecilia heard ten had died and with every hour the number grew. The truth remained unknown, lost amid all the speculation.</p><p>An officer announced that the explosion had been due to human error and was not a terrorist attack as first suspected. Terrorists were prominent in everyone\u2019s fears, Cecilia suspected, especially after what had happened to the USS Cole. Australia was a friendly port, but one could never be sure.</p><p>Next, they learned that the explosion had occurred in the munitions area, which sent gasps of horror rippling through the room. Three known dead, the officer said, but in such a volatile spot on the ship, that left a lot of uncertainty regarding the number of injuries.</p><p>By nightfall they were told that everything was under control. The fires were out; the aircraft carrier was secure. At last came the moment they\u2019d all been waiting for. The base commander moved to the front of the room to read a list of those who\u2019d been injured. \u201cLieutenant Wayne Van Buskirk. Ensign Jeremiah Smith. Chief Petty Officer Alfred Hussey. First Class Gunner\u2019s Mate Gerald Frederickson. Third Class Gunner\u2019s Mate Charles Washington. Seaman Janet Lewis...\u201d Cathy and Cecilia clung to one another. Each name echoed through the room like a bomb-shell, followed by a gasp or a cry of alarm. And then Ian\u2019s name was called out. Cecilia heard her own shout of panic; her legs went slack and she slumped into a chair.</p><p>\u201cIan.\u201d She wasn\u2019t prepared, wasn\u2019t ready to deal with this. Cathy gripped her hand and Cecilia squeezed so hard, her fingers lost feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you here,\u201d Cathy told her.</p><p>Until that instant, Cecilia didn\u2019t realize any other instructions had been given. Cathy hugged her and explained that she was to proceed to the front of the room and speak to the Information Officer.</p><p>Weaving her way through the crowd of Navy family and friends, Cecilia seemed to be walking in slow motion. She heard the sounds of conversation and weeping and occasional nervous laughter as though from a great distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cecilia Randall,\u201d she told the officer. She gave him Ian\u2019s name and rank, and showed her military identification card.</p><p>He directed her to another officer. By then, Cecilia was nearly at the point of passing out. This all seemed so unreal. It couldn\u2019t be happening. Not to Ian. Not to her. She\u2019d already lost her daughter. Surely life wouldn\u2019t be so cruel as to claim her husband, too. Clenching her hands at her sides, Cecilia held her breath and waited.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Randall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Instantly alert, Cecilia stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019m the wife of Ian Randall.\u201d</p><p>The officer smiled reassuringly. \u201cYour husband has sustained cuts and bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\u2014Is he hospitalized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He tore off a sheet and handed it to her. \u201cThe reason we ask to speak to all the relatives of those injured is to inform you that you can talk to your loved one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk?\u201d She didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWe have a bank of phones in the other room. If you\u2019ll go over there, your name will be called shortly. Give the officer this sheet.\u201d</p><p>She was going to be able to talk directly with Ian. Cecilia resisted the urge to sob with joy and relief. Waiting in the inner room with several other wives, she realized how fortunate she was that her husband had only minor injuries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before her name was called. She reached for the telephone and cried out, \u201cIan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetheart. I\u2019m fine. I really am.\u201d He briefly relayed what had happened and said it looked like he had a couple of cracked ribs. \u201cI\u2019m tough, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d she joked through her tears.</p><p>\u201cHow did you hear about the accident?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI had the radio on while I was studying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlgebra, I\u2019ll bet,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYeah. Guess what?\u201d she added. \u201cMr. Cavanaugh suggested I take an accounting course next quarter. I\u2019d never thought about doing any bookkeeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that interest you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d But the more she thought about it, the better she liked the idea.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve only got a couple of minutes,\u201d Ian said. Obviously someone had told him to hurry it up.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She\u2019d been warned about the time limitations. \u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t badly hurt.\u201d An understatement if ever there was one.</p><p>\u201cI am, too. I\u2019m missing you something fierce. Don\u2019t stop writing me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised. She looked forward to hearing from him, too. It felt almost as though they were dating again, only this time their dates came in the form of e-mails and postcards. Their communication was comfortable and yet intimate and helped remind her of all the reasons she\u2019d fallen in love with him.</p><p>A minute or so later, it was time to end the conversation, long before Cecilia was ready.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d her husband told her.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Her words were followed by a short silence. Then, \u201cSay it again, Cecilia. I need to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ian Randall.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia was feeling warm and safe when she returned to the main room, where Cathy waited for her. Her friend watched her anxiously. \u201cHe\u2019s got two cracked ribs and is in a lot of pain, but he\u2019s okay.\u201d Even though Ian had done a good job of disguising his discomfort, she knew he was hurting.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to head to the hospital?\u201d Cecilia asked.</p><p>Cathy nodded. She wore a look of serenity. \u201cWe can go,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I have a strong feeling that everything\u2019s just fine. Somehow, I had this sense, when I found out Andrew wasn\u2019t one of the injured, that I had nothing to fear.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia sincerely hoped her friend was right.</p><p>Grace wasn\u2019t sure why she looked inside the drawer on Dan\u2019s nightstand. She sat up in bed reading and for no obvious reason she found herself staring at it.</p> <p>Moving slowly, she set aside the latest John Lescroart hardcover and stretched across the bed. Dan\u2019s nightstand was exactly as he\u2019d left it. A crossword puzzle book lay open, the spine bent. The glass jar where he tossed his loose change was untouched.</p><p>She frowned, pulling open the drawer. Inside were a deck of cards, some receipts and a paperback novel he hadn\u2019t finished. Then she saw it. There in the corner. His wedding band.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t worn it in years. After he started working in the forests, he\u2019d removed it and worn it only on special occasions. The last time he\u2019d put it on, the ring had been tight; it had barely fit. She picked it up and held it with two fingers. She gazed at the ring as though this inanimate object could reveal her husband\u2019s secrets.</p><p>Why had he come back to Cedar Cove? Why risk being seen? Then again, perhaps that was what he wanted. To taunt her, to humiliate her. So he\u2019d come here with another woman.</p><p>Grace gritted her teeth and studied the wedding band, comparing it to her own, which was thin and worn. After all these years his ring still looked brand-new, as if when he accepted it, he\u2019d had no intention of honoring his vows.</p><p>Anger boiled up inside her. Suddenly, she rolled onto her back and with every bit of strength she possessed, hurled the ring across the room. It hit the wall and tumbled across the carpet. Her labored breathing continued for several moments as the rage held her in its grip. Finally she managed to calm down.</p><p>Reaching for the novel, she repositioned herself against the pillows, but quickly realized she wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate on her book. The fierce anger returned. She struggled to regain her composure, but it was like trying to avert a windstorm by holding out her arms.</p><p>Not knowing what to do, she slid off the bed and stood barefoot in the middle of the bedroom. Her hands were so tightly clenched her nails bit into the soft flesh of her palms.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you show up in Cedar Cove with her,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Her daughters refused to believe Dan had another woman, but Grace knew. She\u2019d known for months. There was someone else and, she thought now, that someone else had been in his life for a very long time.</p><p>Kelly had insisted there\u2019d be some evidence, but Grace had all the evidence she needed. It\u2019d started years ago. The emotional distance and the wild mood swings had been going on for so long, she couldn\u2019t remember when they\u2019d begun. Evidence, she realized, of someone dealing with guilt and remorse.</p><p>By God, she\u2019d prove it. Not to her daughters but herself. Dan had left some evidence; he must have. It was right here in this room\u2014where else could it be? After years of reading mysteries, she should\u2019ve thought of this sooner. The evidence she sought was probably something ordinary, something right in front of her eyes. Something tangible...Proof that Dan was living with another woman.</p><p>She banged open the sliding closet door and jerked a shirt free of its hanger. The force of her rage left the wire hanger swinging like a pendulum. She checked the pocket, tossed the shirt aside and reached for another one.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He\u2019d been too smart for her, or so he thought, destroying all the evidence. But Grace wouldn\u2019t be foiled, not this time.</p><p>The second shirt joined the first one on the carpet. Soon the floor was heaped with Dan\u2019s clothes. Her shoulders heaving, she grabbed as many as her arms could carry and hauled them through the house, dumping everything at the front door. Staring at the heap, she unlocked the dead bolt and threw open the door with a fury that made it crash against the opposite wall. Then, standing on the top step, she flung her husband\u2019s clothes into the night. Trip after trip, she repeated the action, until his half of the closet had been stripped bare and every bit of clothing Dan owned was sprawled across the porch and the sidewalk.</p><p>Then, nearly tripping over her cotton nightgown, she kicked a dress shirt on the top step, and sent it soaring into the darkness. A pair of work pants went next as she got caught up in a frenzy of kicking, hurling his clothes one piece at a time.</p><p>Sobbing now, she sank onto the porch step and covered her face with both hands.</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d she screamed. \u201cWhere are you? WHERE ARE YOU?\u201d</p><p>Only silence answered. Her rage hadn\u2019t brought him back, nor had her love. All that was left were her tears. The emotion poured out of her until she was spent and weak.</p><p>Wiping the tears from her face, she staggered back into the house, not bothering to lock the door. If someone wanted to break in and kill her, she\u2019d welcome death. It was better than this nightmare that had become her life, better than having to walk into an empty house every night and acknowledge that the man she\u2019d loved no longer wanted to be with her.</p><p>What was it Dan had told her? His idea of hell was spending the last thirty-five years living with her. Right to her face he\u2019d said such a thing, not caring how that made her feel. Not caring that his words were as brutal as any weapon.</p><p>\u201cI hate you...\u201d she whispered as she crawled back into the bed. \u201cOh, God, I hate you.\u201d Curling into a fetal position, she began sobbing again, until there were no tears anymore.</p><p>Grace woke at first light. She didn\u2019t move, but remained in the same curled-up position, her knees tucked against her stomach. The memory of the night before flooded her mind. She\u2019d been like a wild woman, purging her life of Daniel Sherman.</p><p>A sound came from the front room. Dan? It\u2019d be just like him to appear now, she thought wryly. Just like that bastard to show up and behave as if there was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>\u201cMom? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen and Kelly. Dear God, not her daughters. Grace didn\u2019t want them to find her like this.</p><p>Maryellen stepped into the bedroom, and sobbing openly, Grace covered her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d Maryellen leaned forward, and wrapping her arms around her, pressed her cheek against Grace\u2019s hair. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Don\u2019t cry, Mom, please don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s eyes burned, and even after sleeping for what must have been several hours, she felt as though she hadn\u2019t rested a single moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kelly begged. \u201cTell us what happened.\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t know how to explain that the clothes strewn across the front yard had been the result of a temper tantrum. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Vessey phoned,\u201d Maryellen explained. \u201cShe woke up and saw all Dad\u2019s clothes outside and was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear from Dad?\u201d Kelly pressed, and it killed Grace to hear the eagerness in her child\u2019s voice. With all her heart, Kelly believed that Dan loved them all. Soon, any time now, he\u2019d return with a perfectly logical explanation of where he\u2019d been and why.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Dad is?\u201d Maryellen asked gently.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy...where...are...you?\u201d Kelly raged. She started to sob.</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t have any answers for her daughter. All she could say for sure, as she caught a glimpse of gold on the other side of the room, was that when Dan had left, he hadn\u2019t bothered to take his wedding band with him.</p><p>Justine couldn\u2019t concentrate on banking. Already she\u2019d made two mistakes and it was only eleven o\u2019clock. This was not the way she wanted to start her work week. The problem had to do with her class reunion. The planning committee had gotten together Friday night for an informal dinner and discussion. Everything had been set in motion weeks earlier and the reunion was less than a month away.</p><p>Justine had never intended to get this involved. She blamed Lana Rothchild for being so eager to enlist her help. And she blamed her mother for encouraging her. Before she could back out, Lana had her collecting the money and paying the bills. At the last meeting, Justine discovered she was also expected to be part of the decorating committee. Now it would be impossible not to attend.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only the reunion that was getting her down. Seth was on her mind constantly, although she hadn\u2019t heard from him since the night Warren proposed. Not one word. For a man who claimed to be so crazy about her, he did damn little to show it.</p><p>She\u2019d thought...She\u2019d hoped...The hell of it was, Justine didn\u2019t know what she thought anymore. Not about Seth and certainly not about Warren.</p><p>She and Warren weren\u2019t getting along, either. It\u2019d serve Seth right if she did accept Warren\u2019s proposal. Even as that idea went through her mind, she knew it was the worst thing she could possibly do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got company,\u201d Christy Palmer whispered as she walked past Justine\u2019s desk.</p><p>Seth. It had to be Seth. Her head shot up with a smile she couldn\u2019t restrain.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t Seth who strolled into the bank, but Warren. He carried a huge bouquet of fresh flowers in a glass vase. Every eye in the room turned to him as he headed directly for her office.</p><p>If Justine could have slid out of her chair and hidden beneath her desk, she would have. She\u2019d promised an answer to his proposal, and the deadline had come and gone, and still she didn\u2019t know what to do.</p> <p>\u201cHello, baby.\u201d Warren greeted her loudly enough to ensure that everyone in the bank heard him.</p><p>\u201cHi, Warren,\u201d she returned without emotion.</p><p>\u201cI came to invite you to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, fighting the urge to be flippant, \u201cbut I have a noon meeting.\u201d That was true enough, but she didn\u2019t mention it was a meeting with one of the tellers and would take all of five minutes. If that.</p><p>Warren sighed. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201d She closed the file she was working on.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t given me your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Justine said impatiently, lowering her voice, \u201cthat if you pressure me, the answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I figure we might as well get married, seeing that all we\u2019ve done lately is argue. Is that what you want? What\u2019s happened, baby? We used to be close and now all of a sudden, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d How could she explain something she didn\u2019t fully understand herself?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that high-school reunion of yours, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Justine didn\u2019t know how many times she\u2019d had to tell him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s not it, then it has to be that old boyfriend you met up with.\u201d</p><p>Seth wasn\u2019t an old boyfriend. \u201cI never went out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not when she was in high school, at any rate. The problem was a more recent one.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Warren said urgently.</p><p>\u201cWarren,\u201d she began, doing her best not to show her frustration, \u201cI can\u2019t just take off in the middle of the day because you want to chitchat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could if you married me\u2014you wouldn\u2019t have to work.\u201d</p> <p>Justine narrowed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t say another word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d He held up one hand, smiling. \u201cCome on, this\u2019ll only take a moment.\u201d He set the flowers on the corner of her desk and pleaded with his eyes.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like Warren to be humble. She realized this must be important, at least to him. Normally he went out of his way to act arrogant.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, motioning for him to sit down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather do it someplace more private,\u201d he whispered, glancing over his shoulder.</p><p>Justine darted a look at her watch. \u201cListen, I have an appointment in ten minutes. I can leave after that. Would you like to meet outside? We could talk there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Justine thought he seemed relieved.</p><p>Sure enough, Warren was waiting for her when she left the bank. He was leaning against his car and straightened when she stepped outside. Hurrying around to the passenger side of the car, he held the door and Justine climbed inside. He didn\u2019t need to tell her that the engagement ring was stored in the glove box.</p><p>\u201cI only have a few minutes,\u201d she reminded him when he slid into the seat beside her. \u201cI\u2019ve got meetings all afternoon.\u201d A slight exaggeration, but in a good cause.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you can\u2019t get away for lunch?\u201d</p><p>She answered him with a hard look.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d</p><p>Warren gazed out the side window. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about us getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know the reason you can\u2019t make up your mind.\u201d</p><p>Great. If he had any insight into that, she\u2019d gladly listen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the hots for Seth Gunderson.\u201d</p><p>For one moment she was too breathless to respond. Breathless with embarassment\u2014and chagrin. \u201cI most certainly do not! That you\u2019d even say such a thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t get mad. The least you can do is hear me out before you get all riled up.\u201d He clenched the steering wheel with both hands\u2014the only outward evidence of tension.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said curtly. This was what got her about Warren. As insensitive and blind as he could sometimes be, every now and then he had the uncanny ability to know her better than she did herself.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide the way you feel about Seth.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms irritably. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you the things a woman wants. Jewels, gifts, status.\u201d</p><p>Justine rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what a woman wants? You sure, Warren?\u201d</p><p>In response, he leaned across her and opened the glove compartment, withdrawing the ring box. He flipped open the lid and she nearly gasped, seeing all four gorgeous carats of the diamond in the full light of day. It sparkled like nothing she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman meant to wear a ring like this.\u201d</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t argue with him. He was right; this was an incredible diamond and any woman would feel beautiful with it on her finger.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>She gave a long, drawn-out sigh, conceding. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d she asked. \u201cI need to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the ring, and I want you to have it, but you\u2019re still hesitating and I think I know why.\u201d</p><p>Justine said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI can give you all the things you deserve in life, but we\u2019re both aware that there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out. You want Seth Gunderson. You\u2019re young and healthy, and hell, I\u2019m not blind.\u201d He held her look, then pointedly slid his gaze past her. \u201cBut I can be.\u201d</p><p>Justine frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Warren slid his arm along the back of her seat. \u201cBaby, you want sex. What woman doesn\u2019t? So go ahead, with my blessing. Screw his brains out if that\u2019ll make you happy, and then come home to me.\u201d</p><p>The crudeness of his words made her gasp. \u201cYou\u2019re sanctioning an affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not Seth, then someone else. You pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of marriage I want!\u201d</p><p>He spoke as though he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cThe only thing I ask is that you tell me who it is.\u201d</p><p>Justine couldn\u2019t believe they were having this conversation or that Warren would suggest something so...so reprehensible. \u201cI\u2019m not like that, Warren.\u201d</p><p>He grinned with the amusement of a man who\u2019d seen it all. \u201cYou never know, Justine. You just never know.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>As a single man, Jack Griffin didn\u2019t make a habit of turning down dinner invitations, especially ones that came from Bob and Peggy Beldon. Peggy was an extraordinary cook, and meals at their bed-and-breakfast were the stuff of culinary legend.</p><p>Jack had been friends with Bob for more than ten years; Bob and Peggy had owned Thyme and Tide for seven. It was on Lighthouse Road, a mile or so from Olivia\u2019s house. The two-story white structure with the black wrought-iron fence had been called the Mansion before Bob and Peggy bought it. A Navy Commander was said to have built it in the early 1900s. It had turrets, one at either end of the house, and the larger of the two had a widow\u2019s walk.</p><p>The B and B had been successful from the outset, due in no small part to the Beldons\u2019 skill as hosts\u2014and of course, to Peggy\u2019s cooking.</p><p>Jack arrived with a bouquet of flowers and a healthy appetite.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Peggy said as she opened the door and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cWe don\u2019t see nearly enough of you. Our guests aren\u2019t scheduled to arrive until late, so we\u2019re free to relax for a few hours.\u201d Her eyes crinkled in a smile. \u201cI always enjoy the opportunity to feed someone who appreciates my cooking as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite me to dinner any time you like,\u201d he said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear the doorbell?\u201d Bob walked in and the two men exchanged handshakes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of these flowers,\u201d Peggy said and left the room.</p><p>Jack followed his friend onto the patio behind the house. Its location granted a full view of the cove, with the Bremerton ferry in the distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got the cribbage board set up and ready to go,\u201d Bob told him. \u201cHow about a glass of iced tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>While Bob hurried into the kitchen for the tea, Jack inspected Peggy\u2019s herb garden. It was lovely to behold, a delight for all the senses. Even Jack, who liked to say that he had \u201ca green thumb\u2014green with mold,\u201d derived real pleasure from Peggy\u2019s garden. Many of the fresh herbs were used in her prized recipes, and he wondered what she\u2019d serve tonight.</p><p>Bob returned with two glasses of iced tea. \u201cThis retirement is for the birds,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt looks like the house is going to need painting this summer, and Peggy thinks I should be able to do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Bob sank down on one of the lounge chairs. \u201cCan you believe it\u2019s the middle of June already?\u201d He sat upright with a startled look.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Bob glanced away and seemed embarrassed, as though he\u2019d said something he shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said, shaking off the question. \u201cJust another one of life\u2019s regrets. Let\u2019s not discuss it.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned, but if there was anything he understood it was regrets.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014you\u2019ve been here almost a year,\u201d Bob said casually, reaching for his tea.</p><p>Jack nodded. A year. Well, it would be in October. Busy as he was with the newspaper, the months had flown by. It seemed only a few weeks ago that he\u2019d sat in Olivia\u2019s courtroom that first time.... He was shocked to realize that six months had passed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Cedar Cove now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jack said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s my kind of town.\u201d Bob and Peggy had been raised in Cedar Cove. They\u2019d graduated from high school together, and then Bob had been drafted and gone off to fight in Vietnam. He\u2019d come home haunted by demons\u2014memories and experiences he could scarcely speak of, even now. Those demons had led him to look for oblivion in the bottom of a bottle. Jack had faced his own demons from Nam and they, too, had led him to the deceptive gratifications of alcohol. He\u2019d met Bob in a rehab center, and they\u2019d struck up a friendship that had grown over the years. Although he had ten years\u2019 sobriety now, the consequences of those hard-drinking years still lingered. Only now had Eric begun to trust him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d eat out on the patio tonight,\u201d Peggy announced, joining the two men.</p><p>That suited Jack just fine. After a week of intermittent rainfall, the evening was clear and warm. A soft breeze came off the water, and with it the faint scent of the sea.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Peggy said, taking the wicker chair next to Bob. \u201cHow\u2019s the paper doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s thriving.\u201d Jack was proud of that. He\u2019d made a lot of changes in the last eight months, added a second edition each week and followed his instincts. One of his most popular innovations had come from Charlotte Jefferson. Her Seniors\u2019 Page had become a huge hit with the community. Olivia\u2019s mother was a natural. Her chatty column every Wednesday was full of tidbits about local happenings. If Mrs. Samuel\u2019s grandson was visiting, Charlotte reported the news. If the Robertsons\u2019 dog had puppies, she wrote about them, guaranteeing the litter good homes. She passed on recipes and some great old-fashioned household hints. Who would\u2019ve guessed vinegar had so many uses? She wrote about the past, discussing local history, especially events that took place around World War II. And she threw in bits and pieces of her own wisdom.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Peggy asked. \u201cAre you thriving, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sane and sober, and that\u2019s about as good as it gets for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Olivia?\u201d Bob asked.</p> <p>His buddy would ask the one question he didn\u2019t want to answer. Jack shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of answer is that?\u201d Peggy scolded. \u201cA few weeks ago, you had lots to say about the judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in love with her ex-husband,\u201d he said bleakly. He\u2019d seen it the day Olivia returned home from her trip to California. Since then he\u2019d only heard from her once, when she called to break their date for the following Wednesday. There\u2019d been no contact between them after that. He sighed, remembering how she\u2019d come back from the airport with her ex, the top down on a fancy red convertible, music blaring. They\u2019d had eyes only for each other. Anyone looking at them would think they were lovers. Jack wasn\u2019t a man who walked away from a challenge, but he was smart enough to avoid a losing proposition\u2014like falling for a woman still involved with her ex.</p><p>\u201cI thought Stan remarried,\u201d Bob said, turning to Peggy.</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the way Olivia feels about him,\u201d Jack insisted.</p> <p>\u201cDid you ask her about it?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. More than willing to move on to another subject, he said, \u201cWhat do you hear from the kids?\u201d Bob and Peggy had two children; Hollie, their oldest, lived in Seattle and their youngest, Marc, was in Kansas.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both fine,\u201d Peggy told him. \u201cWhat do you hear from Eric?\u201d</p><p>His son didn\u2019t make any effort to keep in touch with Jack, which he supposed was fair. For a good portion of Eric\u2019s life, Jack had been absent, if not in body, then in spirit.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Jack confessed.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you talked to him?\u201d</p><p>Jack had to think about that. After their dinner with Olivia, he\u2019d phoned to invite Eric to Cedar Cove, but his son had refused, offering a convenient excuse. He had a date. This wasn\u2019t the first time Eric had mentioned the girl he was seeing. Shirley or Shelly\u2014her name was something along those lines. It seemed Eric might be serious about this one, and Jack had made the mistake of saying so. He\u2019d suggested it was time Eric thought about marrying and settling down. His son had nearly snapped his head off.</p><p>There was a reason for Eric\u2019s reactions. He couldn\u2019t father children, due to the massive doses of drugs he\u2019d been given as a child, and had never gotten around to telling Shirley...or Shelly, who apparently wanted a family. The conversation had ended on that sour note, and Jack hadn\u2019t called him since.</p> <p>He would soon enough, but he needed to give Eric time to forgive him for his careless remark. He longed to forge a path to his son, not destroy the fragile groundwork that had painstakingly been laid.</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in half an hour,\u201d Peggy said, leaving the two of them. She returned a moment later, carrying out a large salad.</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Peggy waved aside his offer. \u201cYou two play cribbage. Bob\u2019s been looking forward to it all day.\u201d</p><p>Jack was more than willing to comply. Bob had the cribbage board set up on the table, and Jack sat down opposite him, his back to the sea. He didn\u2019t want to be distracted. Bob was a good player, quick and decisive, and Jack needed all his wits about him.</p><p>\u201cIs Peggy all right?\u201d Jack asked after Bob had dealt the first hand.</p><p>Bob put aside the deck and reached for the seven cards. \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t sure. Peggy was as warm and welcoming as ever, but he sensed that something was troubling her.</p><p>Although he appeared to be studying his cards, Bob had the look of a man deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d Jack teased.</p><p>Bob frowned in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThe cards,\u201d Jack explained.</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d His smile seemed forced.</p><p>Jack set his cards aside. \u201cEverything\u2019s all right with you and Peg, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, his voice worried.</p><p>\u201cAfter thirty-two years, it should be, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know.\u201d He desperately wanted evidence of one solid marriage, just to prove it was still possible in these days of easy divorce. One marriage that could survive a crisis...He thought of his ex-wife\u2014and he thought of Olivia. He\u2019d never wanted a woman with the intensity he wanted her. He\u2014</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Bob\u2019s voice broke his concentration.</p><p>He glanced up.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stare at your cards all night or are you going to discard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Bob grinned, obviously a man capable of reading all the signs. \u201cLike Olivia.\u201d</p><p>Jack gave an exaggerated shrug. \u201cThat readable, am I?\u201d</p><p>Bob chuckled. \u201cNo more readable than Peg and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong, is there?\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to belabor the point, but the thought of problems between Bob and Peggy depressed him. They were the one couple he knew who\u2019d found happiness and clung to it through all the years, both good and bad.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, just a bit disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded, and nothing more was said.</p><p>They finished the first game, and by then Peggy had dinner dished up and ready to serve. Good food and good friends. It was the best meal he\u2019d had in weeks, but Jack decided that the company was even more satisfying than the food.</p><p>The accident aboard the George Washington made headlines on the national news for several days. Cecilia was in daily contact with Ian. Some days she couldn\u2019t get to a computer, so she wrote out her thoughts. These letters would take a week or longer to reach him, but Ian said he enjoyed hearing from her in any form.</p><p>With finals in only two classes, Cecilia had one day in which she didn\u2019t have to be in school. Since she wasn\u2019t scheduled to work until late afternoon, she decided to celebrate and made plans to spend the morning with Cathy.</p><p>After examining her at the Navy Hospital, the attending physician had told Cathy that the pregnancy was safe but suggested she quit her job as a cashier at the local grocery. Being on her feet for an eight-hour shift wasn\u2019t good for her or the baby. Not wanting to take any chances, Cathy had immediately handed in her notice.</p><p>When Cecilia arrived at her friend\u2019s duplex, she discovered that Carol Greendale had stopped by, too. Cecilia almost changed her mind and turned around. Almost. Carol\u2019s little girl was just a day or two older than Allison would have been. Cecilia dreaded seeing the baby and was drawn to her in equal parts.</p><p>\u201cHello, Carol,\u201d she said in a friendly voice, pretending she was at ease with the other woman. Little Amanda was toddling happily around the apartment, examining everything in sight, reaching for books, trying to grab knickknacks, pulling at the curtains.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Amanda,\u201d Carol urged, holding out her arms for her daughter. The child immediately lurched toward her mother, shrieking with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Cathy said, gripping Cecilia\u2019s hand tightly as if to let her know she understood.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about the George Washington,\u201d Carol explained, bouncing the child on her lap.</p><p>\u201cCarol came by with the latest news,\u201d Cathy said.</p><p>\u201cI just heard they\u2019re heading back,\u201d Carol squealed.</p><p>\u201cThe George Washington\u2019s coming back to the shipyard in Bremerton?\u201d Cecilia wanted to make sure there was no misunderstanding. Where the aircraft carrier would go for repairs had been undecided.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d No one could doubt Cathy\u2019s excitement.</p><p>\u201cWhen will they get here?\u201d Sheer joy raised Cecilia\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia felt hopeful about her marriage, especially after the last few weeks. Ian had communicated with her practically every day. In the beginning, most of what they\u2019d exchanged had been ordinary, everyday information. Facts more than feelings. But as the weeks went on, they\u2019d both felt ready to venture into more dangerous territory\u2014their daughter and her death.</p><p>In the process, Cecilia realized that she\u2019d heaped too much of the blame on Ian\u2019s shoulders. She hadn\u2019t meant to, but trapped in grief and pain, she\u2019d lashed out at him. It wasn\u2019t fair, she\u2019d known that even at the time, but she hadn\u2019t been able to prevent those reactions. Dealing with his own shock, Ian hadn\u2019t been much help to Cecilia. Almost a year had passed now, giving each of them a new perspective on the role they\u2019d played in nearly destroying their marriage.</p><p>\u201cLet me get the baby a cracker,\u201d Cathy said, moving into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Carol told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I want to.\u201d</p><p>Cathy looked pointedly in Cecilia\u2019s direction. \u201cCome and give me a hand,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Cecilia jumped up with alacrity.</p><p>Carol seemed confused and a little affronted. Cecilia felt bad about that, but Cathy obviously had something important to tell her.</p><p>\u201cAndrew knows about the baby,\u201d Cathy whispered the minute they entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him. I had to. He wanted to know why I quit my job. I tried to edge around the truth, but we made a promise never to lie to each other and so I...I explained that I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Cathy stared down at the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid, just like I am, and kind of hurt that I hadn\u2019t told him sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder all of that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Cathy nodded. \u201cI know he is. We both want this baby so much.\u201d</p><p>Cathy seemed about to dissolve into tears and might have if little Amanda hadn\u2019t let out a frustrated cry. Cathy hurriedly found a soda cracker and brought it into the living room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol was busy picking up toys. \u201cIt\u2019s time I went home,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou just got here,\u201d Cathy protested.</p><p>\u201cI know...it\u2019s just that...\u201d She glanced at Cecilia, as if to say that now Cathy\u2019s other friend had arrived, she was obviously less welcome.</p><p>Ever sensitive, Cathy shook her head. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me for being so rude, but I needed to tell Cecilia something. I didn\u2019t mean to exclude you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Carol said. She reached for Amanda, who eluded her mother\u2019s arms and waddled toward Cecilia. The baby stumbled and Cecilia instinctively thrust out her arms. Drooling as she smiled, Amanda gazed up at Cecilia, her eyes wide with interest. Cecilia froze, unable to stop looking at the baby girl who in other circumstances might have been her own.</p><p>Little Amanda returned her look, then smiled and raised her arms, wanting Cecilia to pick her up.</p><p>The decision was automatic. Cecilia leaned over and lifted the child. Then Amanda, as though she understood the significance of the moment, wrapped both chubby arms around Cecilia\u2019s neck. Cecilia knew she was being fanciful, but she felt that this child, this year-old baby, recognized all the love stored in her heart for Allison. The daughter she\u2019d never hold again, or sing to, or kiss good-night.</p><p>Cathy and Carol paused for breathless seconds, watching Cecilia\u2019s reaction to Amanda.</p><p>Tenderly Cecilia brushed the wispy hair from the child\u2019s forehead, kissed her there, then set her back on the floor, where Amanda teetered, recovered herself and walked unsteadily to her mother\u2019s side.</p> <p>\u201cCarol, I\u2019m going to tell you, too,\u201d Cathy said. \u201cI...you know I recently quit working. Well, there\u2019s a reason for that. I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Her smile faded when she realized that neither Cathy nor Cecilia seemed completely delighted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, glancing from one to the other. \u201cAren\u2019t you happy?\u201d</p><p>Cathy was quick to assure Carol she was pleased. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I miscarried the first two pregnancies, and I\u2019m scared to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be, too.\u201d Carol handed Amanda the soda cracker; the little girl was content to sit on the floor, gnawing it. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cathy. I can\u2019t even imagine...\u201d She turned to Cecilia. \u201cWeren\u2019t you in the hospital about the same time as me?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>Cecilia nodded. \u201cMy little girl was named Allison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. I always wanted to tell you how bad I felt, but you...well, you didn\u2019t seem to want to talk to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI regret that now,\u201d she said. \u201cI could\u2019ve used a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use one myself,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>The military might have its heroes, but the wives were the backbone of the Navy, Cecilia reflected. These women\u2014and she was now one of them\u2014supported their husbands, their country and each other.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how this pregnancy will go,\u201d Cathy told them, \u201cbut I do know that Andrew and I will be able to deal with it, no matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>No matter what happens, Cecilia mused. If her friend could be this brave, then she could, too.</p><p>Hurry home, Ian, she prayed. Please be safe and hurry home.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>If not for Olivia, Grace would\u2019ve dropped out of the Wednesday-evening aerobics class ages ago. But since Dan\u2019s disappearance, she\u2019d found that working out was a great stress-reliever. Never had she sweated so much or breathed so hard. Every movement was done with enthusiasm and energy. Before, she\u2019d always been the one who lagged behind; now she led the class.</p> <p>\u201cKeeping up with you is going to kill me,\u201d Olivia complained as she followed Grace into the shower room. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you lately?\u201d</p><p>As if Olivia didn\u2019t know. \u201cYou have to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I understand you\u2019re upset about Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the half of it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wiped her face with a hand towel. \u201cHave you had dinner yet?\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head. With only herself to cook for, it was easier to toss a frozen entr\u00e9e into the microwave. Wednesdays she generally skipped dinner altogether. By the time she got home from aerobics, she was too tired to eat.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to meet at the Pancake Palace?\u201d Olivia suggested.</p><p>Grace wasn\u2019t hungry, but it beat walking into an empty house. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She took her time showering and changing into her street clothes. She hadn\u2019t done more than chat with her friend in several weeks, and she was looking forward to a real conversation. Sure, they saw each other, but there was rarely an opportunity to say more than a few words in passing.</p><p>Olivia had already secured the booth when Grace arrived. She slid in across from her and reached for the menu tucked, as always, behind the napkin canister.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t this our booth back in high school?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Grace had to think about that. Was it? \u201cI don\u2019t remember, but it might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember how Kenny Thomas broke up with me right here in the Pancake Palace?\u201d Olivia reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThe rat fink.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met and they smiled, chasing memories. But Grace\u2019s amusement faded as she recalled how often she\u2019d met Dan here during their high-school days. How different her life might have been if he\u2019d broken up with her, or she\u2019d had the courage to return his high-school ring. Even then, while she was still a teenager, Grace had sensed that they didn\u2019t bring out the best in each other. Deep down, Dan had known it, too. Then, just before graduation, Grace had discovered she was pregnant. Dan had wanted to marry her and she\u2019d managed to convince herself it was the right thing to do.</p><p>\u201cKelly and I met here for dinner not long ago,\u201d Grace told her, breaking off her thoughts before she fell into the abyss of self-pity. It was the night Kelly had persuaded her not to file for divorce. She\u2019d promised to wait until after the baby was born, but she\u2019d regretted that decision ever since.</p><p>\u201cI envy your relationship with your daughters,\u201d Olivia admitted.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you and Justine getting along?\u201d</p><p>Olivia gave a slight shrug. \u201cWe don\u2019t argue, if that\u2019s what you mean, but we don\u2019t talk openly. I heard through the grapevine that Warren\u2019s asked her to marry him, but she hasn\u2019t even mentioned his proposal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she knows what you\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes turned thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019ve vowed not to be negative, but it isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>One thing Dan\u2019s disappearance had done was bring Grace closer to her daughters. They talked at least once a day, mostly to encourage and support each other. After the latest episode, they\u2019d decided they could no longer bear not knowing where Dan was. The girls were willing to help with the expense of the private investigator; they felt as desperate for answers as Grace did.</p><p>\u201cI hired Roy McAfee again last week.\u201d Grace had talked to him soon after Dan\u2019s disappearance, and decided after his initial investigation that she couldn\u2019t afford his services anymore. As the weeks crept by, she\u2019d come to understand that neither she nor the girls could afford not to hire him. They had to know what had happened to her husband, and there seemed to be no other way. \u201cThe frustration is driving me insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the girls approve?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who talked me into it. They want answers as badly as I do. Badly enough to help foot the bill.\u201d Hiring a private detective was expensive, but as Maryellen had said\u2014only half joking\u2014the medical bills for a nervous breakdown would be far higher.</p><p>Something inside Grace had snapped the night she cleared out Dan\u2019s closet. She should probably have checked herself into a psychiatric ward. She\u2019d reached her limit, and her daughters had immediately recognized it even if she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Roy say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave him what information I could, and he promised to get back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him about your suspicions?\u201d</p><p>Grace sighed and picked up her fork, squinting at the water spots. \u201cHe didn\u2019t agree or disagree with me. But I have faith that if there\u2019s another woman, he\u2019ll find out who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Olivia said, leaning forward, \u201cwhat proof were you able to give him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d Grace had searched through everything Dan owned and come away all the more confused. How careful he\u2019d been, how clever. Not a shred of evidence remained\u2014at least, nothing tangible she could hand over to Roy.</p><p>\u201cBut gut instinct tells you there\u2019s someone else?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cAs I think back, I see more and more clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Dan. He didn\u2019t care much about appearances, but recently I started remembering little things about the first time he went missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat morning was the same as always, but I realized later that he\u2019d combed his hair and shaved. Dan usually shaved at night. He altered his routine that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was meeting her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this time?\u201d</p><p>Grace had reviewed their last morning together a hundred times or more. \u201cI can\u2019t remember exactly, but I think so.\u201d What she did recall was the faint scent of his aftershave as he collected his lunch bucket from the counter and headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cI remember a year ago I asked him if he felt guilty about something because he was acting kind of...furtive.\u201d That incident had played back in her mind, too. Dan had shot her a stricken look as though she\u2019d caught him red-handed. Naturally he\u2019d denied everything, and because she\u2019d wanted to believe him, she had.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything from Roy yet?\u201d</p><p>Grace wadded up the paper napkin in her fist. \u201cHe phoned this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Olivia\u2019s eyes widened with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cNothing. He said that if Dan does have another job, he\u2019s not using his social security number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the woman? Did Roy give you any ideas on who it might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s asked around, put out feelers in Seattle and beyond, but he hasn\u2019t come up with a single lead. Whoever it is, I suspect they\u2019ve been meeting for years. She probably got tired of Dan\u2019s inability to make a decision and told him it was either her or me.\u201d Although Grace spoke without emotion, plenty of it churned inside her. It had become more and more apparent that Dan had been under pressure. He wasn\u2019t by nature a cruel man, although at times he was capable of saying and doing cruel things. Whoever this woman was, Dan must have loved her very much.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like he disappeared off the face of the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Grace stared down at the table. \u201cAll I want is an answer,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know it might be hard to believe, especially after everything he\u2019s put us through, but I want Dan to be happy.\u201d She\u2019d never been able to fill the emptiness inside him. It\u2019d been worse after Vietnam. Then Kelly had been born, and it was as though this second daughter had renewed his purpose. For a few years they\u2019d been happy. Dan had encouraged Grace to get a college education, and was an invaluable asset with the girls. They\u2019d been a team, a family. Now he was gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t get those answers?\u201d Olivia asked gently.</p><p>Grace had considered that, too. It was a very real possibility. Dan didn\u2019t seem willing to tell her why he\u2019d left\u2014not to her face, at any rate. Perhaps that was the reason he\u2019d decided to make a brief appearance in Cedar Cove. He\u2019d wanted to be seen. Perhaps he was telling her he\u2019d gotten on with his life and now she should do the same.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t get any answers, I\u2019ll deal with it just as I have everything else.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head admiringly. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave woman, Grace Sherman.\u201d</p> <p>Grace didn\u2019t view herself that way but accepted the compliment. \u201cHey, when are we going to get some service around here?\u201d</p><p>Olivia placed two fingers in her mouth and gave a low piercing whistle. She\u2019d always been proud of her ability to do that\u2014and it had certainly impressed her sons.</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d the sixty-year old waitress shouted from the other side of the restaurant. \u201cI\u2019ve only got two hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame ol\u2019 Pancake Palace,\u201d Grace laughed. Some things never changed, and for that she was grateful.</p><p>The last week of June, Olivia suddenly realized she hadn\u2019t heard from Jack Griffin in more than a month. Not since she\u2019d returned from California. It wasn\u2019t until she started planning her mother\u2019s birthday celebration that she noticed it\u2019d been so long. Between her work in family court, the problems with Justine, James\u2019s new family, her mother\u2019s obsession with Tom Houston and Grace\u2019s troubles, Olivia had been caught up in everyone else\u2019s life. She\u2019d nearly forgotten she had one of her own.</p> <p>Home from court early on a Monday afternoon, Olivia was in a rare domestic mood and prepared a batch of her favorite breakfast muffins, a family staple.</p><p>Since Jack hadn\u2019t seen fit to phone her, she decided to call him. It wasn\u2019t her habit to contact men, but this time she had a perfectly good excuse\u2014an invitation. She didn\u2019t have a home number, so she called him at the office.</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin,\u201d he snapped, answering as soon as the receptionist had rung through.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014Olivia.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as if she\u2019d knocked him off-balance. \u201cI guess you weren\u2019t expecting me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d His voice softened.</p><p>It was probably best to get to the point right away. \u201cHave you got plans for the fourth of July?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her to answer before he offered his own suggestion. \u201cThere\u2019s an article I\u2019ve been meaning to write about a nudist colony out by Home. Are you interested in tagging along?\u201d</p><p>Her laugh was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He muttered in a resigned voice, and Olivia laughed again.</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s my mother\u2019s birthday on July fourth,\u201d she said, \u201cand I was planning a small surprise party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow small?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, me and Mom.\u201d Justine had been invited, too. She would likely make an appearance without Warren, but Olivia doubted her daughter would stay long.</p> <p>\u201cCan I get back to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d They ended the conversation soon after that, and Olivia hung up with a sense of disappointment. Perhaps she\u2019d offended Jack, although she couldn\u2019t imagine when or how. She\u2019d had to cancel their last date, because of a Bar Association meeting, but he\u2019d sounded almost relieved and she hadn\u2019t heard from him since.</p><p>Five minutes later, the doorbell chimed. When Olivia answered, she was astonished to see Jack Griffin leaning against her doorframe, doing his damnedest to look like Cary Grant in His Girl Friday.</p><p>\u201cJack? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it over,\u201d he said, grinning sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019d love to come to your party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to invite me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course.\u201d She moved aside and he stepped into the house, following her into the kitchen, where she\u2019d brewed a fresh pot of coffee. The muffins were just out of the oven.</p><p>\u201cThis is a family recipe,\u201d she told him as she set a warm muffin on a plate. \u201cMom frequently reminds me how good bran is for the older person.\u201d She rolled her eyes on the word older.</p><p>\u201cBran apple muffins? Your mother included the recipe in one of her first columns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very ones.\u201d Olivia reached for a muffin herself and joined him at the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called,\u201d Jack told her. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve phoned me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI, uh, wasn\u2019t sure that was such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked, her tone forthright.</p><p>He hesitated again, weighing his words. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been divorced a long time, but it seemed to me\u2014and I could be wrong\u2014that you and your ex are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s gaze held hers. \u201cMore than friends,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you still in love with him, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>It was a question she didn\u2019t need to consider long. \u201cStan and I had three children together. We\u2019ll always be linked through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I asked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She wished she could explain what she felt for her ex-husband, but her feelings were complex and something of a mystery even to her. She took a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re right, we\u2019re divorced. I do love him, but it isn\u2019t the same kind of love we had as husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked away as if he didn\u2019t understand the answer. Or perhaps he did understand, but didn\u2019t like what he\u2019d heard. Olivia felt her words were woefully inadequate. The bond between her and Stan was more than the children they\u2019d brought into the world, more than the child they\u2019d buried. It was everything they\u2019d shared. There were things they knew about each other that no one else could possibly know.</p><p>Legally they were separate. Stan had a new wife and a new family, but a court decree hadn\u2019t completely divided their hearts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really get it,\u201d Jack said, his face darkening. \u201cBasically I\u2019m wondering, seeing how you feel about your ex, if there\u2019s room in your life for someone else.\u201d He straightened and threw back his shoulders. \u201cActually, I should be a little more specific. Is there room for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be such a difficult question to answer,\u201d Jack muttered, when she didn\u2019t speak right away.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d she tried to assure him. \u201cI\u2019d very much like there to be.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed. She found Jack Griffin smart and funny and in some ways almost childlike in his enthusiasm, his sense of adventure. She loved the spontaneity she saw in him.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He beamed at her. \u201cI like you, too. A lot. It\u2019s probably not good strategy to admit it at this early stage, but what the hell do I know about strategy anyway?\u201d Having said that, he leaned forward and kissed her.</p><p>Olivia was sure his original intention had been a friendly peck, a short kiss to seal this new understanding. However the moment their lips met, moist and warm with freshly brewed coffee, the kiss became...real. Passionate. Jack wove his fingers into her hair and he rose to his feet to lean closer. Olivia reached for him.</p><p>The intensity of the kiss heightened as his mouth expertly molded against hers. It\u2019d been years since a man had touched her like this. She\u2019d ignored that sensual part of her, let it grow dormant, and now Jack had brought it back to life.</p><p>A discordant sound drifted toward her, and Jack abruptly broke off the kiss. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>Olivia jerked back and nearly fell off her chair. \u201cJustine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi.\u201d Justine stood framed in the kitchen doorway. She looked sharply from Olivia to Jack. \u201cI\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Olivia shouted. \u201cI mean...\u201d She glanced at Jack and\u2014damn it all\u2014blushed.</p><p>To her surprise, her daughter laughed. \u201cHonestly, Mom, it\u2019s no big deal. If you two want to continue whatever you were doing, go ahead, with my blessing. I\u2019ll come back at a more convenient time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should leave,\u201d Jack said. He kissed Olivia\u2019s cheek. \u201cSee you on the fourth. Do you want me to bring anything?\u201d</p><p>Her mind a blank, Olivia shook her head. For the life of her she couldn\u2019t remember what they were doing on the fourth. Oh, yes, her mother\u2019s birthday.</p><p>Jack sidled past Justine, and whistling a catchy tune, let himself out of the house.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d her daughter said, arms folded. \u201cI\u2019m shocked.\u201d Her delight was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so amused. I\u2019m not as old as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Justine assured her, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t sure you were aware of it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stood on feet that felt a little unsteady. Jack\u2019s kiss had shaken her more than she cared to admit. She walked over to the coffeepot and refilled her cup, then automatically poured one for her daughter. What had prompted this visit, Olivia couldn\u2019t even guess.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you and Jack been involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was at the house when you returned from California, remember?\u201d Justine reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d She hated the way these questions flustered her. Nothing had been settled between her and Jack. Not really. Okay, so they\u2019d agreed to start seeing each other, but it was too early to know how significant their relationship would become.</p><p>\u201cI asked Jack then, and he claimed you were only friends. Foolish me, I believed him.\u201d</p><p>Justine certainly seemed to be enjoying this.</p><p>\u201cWe are friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d her daughter teased.</p><p>\u201cJustine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends and then some.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cAll right, if you must know...this is a recent development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow recent?\u201d</p><p>Olivia peered at her watch. \u201cTwenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d And Olivia felt good about it. Optimistic. No way of knowing what would happen, of course, especially as they hadn\u2019t yet defined their relationship. But she couldn\u2019t help wondering where the kissing would\u2019ve led if they hadn\u2019t been interrupted.</p><p>\u201cEnough about me,\u201d Olivia said abruptly. \u201cTo what do I owe this unexpected visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Justine said, sinking down in the chair recently vacated by Jack, \u201cI came to see what you had planned for Grandma\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><p>That was only an excuse; Justine could easily have asked over the phone. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have a small picnic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaterfront Park?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t decided where, but that sounds like a good idea.\u201d Her mother\u2019s home was within walking distance of the waterfront area, and there\u2019d be a lot of festivities there on the fourth. \u201cCan you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be able to drop by for an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>Not looking at Justine, she reached for her muffin. \u201cWill Warren be with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but we\u2019re still seeing each other.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia was afraid of that. More than anything she wanted to ask her daughter what the future held for her and Warren, but she dared not say anything that would upset the delicate balance of her relationship with Justine.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, Warren and I haven\u2019t been getting along lately.\u201d</p><p>In one way, Olivia was glad to hear that, although she chastised herself for such an ungenerous reaction; in another way, she was distressed by Justine\u2019s evident unhappiness. If Warren was what she really wanted...\u201cAny reason?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Justine exhaled sharply. \u201cWe\u2019re different people.\u201d</p><p>Different generations, too, but Olivia didn\u2019t mention that. \u201cYou might want to remember what attracted you when you first started seeing each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot lately.\u201d Her hands cradled the coffee mug. \u201cI was drawn to him right away\u2014he was so polished and successful. I\u2019d dated other men and they were always pressuring me, wanting more from the relationship.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s probably an oversimplification.\u201d Lifting her mug, she stared at the coffee and then lowered it to the table without taking a drink. \u201cActually, I was the one to blame for past dating failures. I don\u2019t want a long-term committment or a family.\u201d She stared at Olivia. \u201cI\u2019ve told you that before. I know it upset you, and I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren\u2019s already been married,\u201d Olivia said, wanting to keep Justine talking, hoping that as her thoughts emerged, she\u2019d gain insight into her daughter\u2019s emotions.</p><p>\u201cActually, he\u2019s been married three times.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had only known about two of his former marriages, but wisely refrained from comment.</p><p>\u201cHis children are raised.\u201d</p><p>From what she\u2019d heard, Warren Saget had a daughter four years younger than Justine.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, he wouldn\u2019t be interested in starting a second family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you could say that.\u201d</p><p>Olivia merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cWarren represents safety and security to me,\u201d Justine said in a low, serious voice. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable being with him. It seemed that everything I objected to in other relationships isn\u2019t a problem for him. He\u2019s always been good to me and I didn\u2019t need to worry about...you know.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t sure she did, but again she held her tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re looking sad.\u201d Reaching over, she stroked the side of her daughter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI am sad,\u201d Justine repeated as though this was a revelation. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I am.\u201d</p><p>Olivia searched for something comforting to say, some wisdom she could pass on to her daughter. Unfortunately her mind was a blank. Every day she sat in court and issued judgments that would alter the way families lived their lives. But when it came to her own child, Olivia was at a loss.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided to break it off?\u201d</p> <p>It was the wrong thing to ask. Justine instantly bristled. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019d like, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia responded, sorry now that she\u2019d said a word. \u201cWhatever happens between you and Warren is your business. It\u2019s obvious that you care for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Sometimes he irritates me, and then sometimes he\u2019s so kind and thoughtful.... I know what you think, Mom, what everyone thinks, but Warren\u2019s got his insecurities, just like most people. And in his own way, he loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Justine stood and deposited her coffee cup in the sink, as though preparing to leave. \u201cThanks, Mom, I feel better.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was good, but Olivia felt confused. She had no idea what the visit had been about; she only knew she didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cIsn\u2019t your class reunion coming up shortly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext month,\u201d Justine mumbled, reaching for her car keys. \u201cI doubt Seth will be there in case you\u2019re wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Olivia lied. \u201cBut...why not?\u201d she asked, surprised that her daughter had voluntarily brought up the other man\u2019s name. Generally Justine went out of her way to avoid the subject of Seth Gunderson.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Alaska, and this is his busiest time of year. He won\u2019t be able to take four or five days off and fly home for a class reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Olivia agreed mildly.</p><p>Then out of the blue, Justine looked her square in the eye and blurted out, \u201cFalling in love with Seth would be a terrible risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom, think about it. I have nothing in common with him. He\u2019s just the type of man I want to avoid. He\u2019s a fisherman\u2014that\u2019s a dead-end career if there ever was one. Besides, he lives on a boat. I have more tablecloths than he has dishes. We just don\u2019t...mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re attracted to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes me crazy.\u201d She clamped her mouth shut and folded her arms tightly across her chest.</p><p>\u201cLoving him is a risk,\u201d Olivia repeated her daughter\u2019s words back to her.</p><p>Justine groaned. \u201cI know that, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Justine,\u201d she whispered, hugging her daughter. \u201cThink about it. Everything of value in life involves risk.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter pressed her forehead against Olivia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOh, Mom, I wish I knew what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll lead me straight to Seth.\u201d</p><p>Olivia patted her back gently, but found it impossible not to smile.</p><p>June 25th</p><p>Dearest Cecilia,</p><p>I know it\u2019s probably a shock to get a letter from me. I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of sending e-mails because they\u2019re convenient and easy, and so much faster. Today, however, e-mail just seems too impersonal. It doesn\u2019t feel right to sit down at a computer. Not today, June 25th.</p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything, but I\u2019m sure Allison Marie has been on your mind. If she\u2019d lived, we\u2019d be celebrating her first birthday. And this year, just like last year, her daddy\u2019s out at sea.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if there are words enough to tell you how much I regret not being with you when Allison was born. I would\u2019ve done anything, given everything I possess or ever will, to have the opportunity to hold my little girl just once. There\u2019s an ache inside me that will never go away, knowing that not only could I not be with you, but I was denied the one opportunity I had to see my daughter.</p><p>Your getting pregnant when you did last year wasn\u2019t a real surprise. A part of me was looking for it to happen, I think. I was crazy about you from the moment we met, and despite the separation, that hasn\u2019t changed. Allison Marie was a gift from God. I don\u2019t know why she had to die or what purpose her life served, but I do know I have no regrets about us marrying. Not a single one. Together we created a beautiful baby and together we loved our child. We still love her. The key word here is together, Cecilia. And that\u2019s the way I want us to stay.</p><p>After the accident on the George Washington, you told me you love me. Oh, honey, you don\u2019t know how good it was to hear you say it. My ribs hurt like hell, otherwise I would\u2019ve been shouting loud enough for you to hear me all the way in Cedar Cove.</p><p>Let\u2019s not do anything foolish\u2014like get that divorce. When the George Washington pulls into Bremerton shipyard, I hope you\u2019ll be there with all the other wives, waiting for their husbands. I don\u2019t want this to be the end of our marriage, but the beginning of our lives together. I think Allison would approve of her mommy and daddy celebrating her birthday, don\u2019t you? After all, she brought us together, didn\u2019t she? It\u2019s time we put away the pain and celebrated her life, short as it was. Because of Allison, you\u2019re my wife and I\u2019m your husband and that\u2019s how we should remain.</p><p>I love you so much.</p><p>Ian</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Charlotte was fast losing patience with Cliff Harding. He\u2019d assured her he\u2019d come to town to look over the things she\u2019d taken from Tom\u2019s storage unit, but that was more than a month ago. Cliff continued to delay the meeting. Although his excuses sounded plausible, Charlotte could see that this simply wasn\u2019t a high priority for him.</p><p>That distressed her, but she wasn\u2019t sure what to do about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d drive out and see him myself,\u201d her friend Laura told her on the Monday following her birthday.</p><p>Charlotte was with her knitting friends at the Senior Center. A few weeks ago she\u2019d casually mentioned talking to Tom\u2019s grandson, but hadn\u2019t told them everything involved. She wasn\u2019t about to admit, even to her nearest and dearest friends, that she\u2019d committed a felony.</p><p>\u201cI would, too,\u201d Evelyn added. \u201cFrom what you said, it isn\u2019t that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll mean driving on the highway.\u201d Any road with more than two lanes terrified Charlotte. Cars whizzed past, and no matter what lane she was in, she seemed to annoy the other drivers, especially if she followed the posted speed. What did these people think the speed limit was, anyway? A suggestion? Everyone seemed to be in such an all-fired hurry these days. She\u2019d drive over to see him if she had to, but she wouldn\u2019t like it and she\u2019d make darn sure Cliff Harding heard about it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is with young people today,\u201d Helen muttered, jerking on her yarn with unnecessary force. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect their elders the way we were taught to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d This came from Bess, who nodded emphatically.</p><p>\u201cYou were his grandfather\u2019s friend. One would think he\u2019d welcome the opportunity to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t escape my notice,\u201d Helen said, leaning toward Bess, \u201cthat he didn\u2019t visit his grandfather, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to phone him again,\u201d Charlotte said, decision made. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll let him know when he can expect me.\u201d She\u2019d put it off for nearly five weeks already. Cliff Harding always had an excuse. There had been that business trip, and last week there was a brief message on her answering machine\u2014one of his horses was about to foal and he couldn\u2019t leave. Charlotte could only imagine what his excuse would be this week. And the next. No, Laura was right, it was time to take matters into her own hands.</p><p>When Charlotte returned home, she tucked away her knitting, made a fuss over Harry, and then, filled with determination, headed toward her phone.</p><p>Tom\u2019s grandson answered, sounding far more congenial than he ever had before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is Charlotte Jefferson,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Jefferson, I\u2019ve been meaning to get in touch with you.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte just bet he had. Probably with another of his lame excuses. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble you again, but seeing that you\u2019ve been unable to keep your appointment with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was what I planned to discuss with you. Would this afternoon be convenient?\u201d</p> <p>The indignation that had been bolstered by her friends\u2019 well-meaning advice was suddenly unnecessary. \u201cThis afternoon would be fine,\u201d she muttered, feeling deflated and, truth to tell, a little disappointed. She\u2019d been ready to blast him; she\u2019d even worked out some very effective remarks about family duty on the drive home. Now she wouldn\u2019t be able to use them.</p><p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s a bit disconcerting to be sleeping with a gun under your bed.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte heard the teasing in his voice and decided to ignore it. \u201cActually, I moved the gun to my underwear drawer.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that she\u2019d wrapped it in an old girdle.</p><p>\u201cYour underwear drawer?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Again, she\u2019d amused him, but this time she couldn\u2019t fathom why. That was a clever hiding place in her opinion. No one breaking into the house, if they got past her overprotective cat, would think to search for anything of significance in a drawer of cotton panties. Anything that was the least bit important in Charlotte\u2019s house invariably ended up there. Her savings passbook was tucked inside her support panty hose. No thief was going to catch her off guard.</p> <p>\u201cWhat time will you be here?\u201d she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIs around four okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be perfect.\u201d Charlotte gave him directions to her home and they ended the conversation. Then, because she wanted to be hospitable, she baked cookies. The recipe had been given to her three years ago at a seniors\u2019 potluck and it always went over well. Men, especially, seemed to like these cookies, which were thick with chocolate chips, coconut and pecans.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished scraping the last of the batch from the cookie sheet when the doorbell rang. Charlotte hurried toward the front door, picking up Harry to keep him from escaping. Her cat purred in her ear as she turned open the three locks. The last one had been installed only recently. Charlotte wasn\u2019t going to make a thief\u2019s job easy for him, no sir. She couldn\u2019t afford one of those fancy security systems, but she had her own safeguards.</p><p>The man who stood on the other side of the threshold was a good six feet tall with a small paunch. He wore a cowboy hat and boots, blue jeans with a brown jacket and a string tie.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Jefferson?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. You must be Cliff Harding.\u201d She unlocked the screen door and held it open for him. \u201cCome in, please.\u201d</p><p>He stepped into her modest home and sniffed appreciatively. \u201cYou been baking cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to be neighborly,\u201d she said, inviting him to take a seat on her sofa. She was ready. The silver service was set up, the pot filled with fresh coffee. The service was used only on rare occasions, but she wanted to make a good impression on Tom\u2019s grandson. The cookies were still warm from the oven.</p><p>Charlotte noticed that she didn\u2019t need to urge Cliff to help himself. She sat down across from him.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you know about your grandfather?\u201d she asked, pouring for them both.</p><p>Cliff leaned forward and accepted the delicate china cup. \u201cOnly what my father told me.\u201d This was said with a scowl. \u201cAnd frankly, it wasn\u2019t complimentary. Tom Harding was a scoundrel and a womanizer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I wouldn\u2019t know. I only knew him during the last few months of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you aware that he abandoned his family in order to pursue his film career? My grandmother and father lived on charity and died in poverty while Tom Houston, The Yodeling Cowboy, lived the high life. If I have no interest in his effects, I\u2019m sure you can understand why.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte found it difficult to think badly of Tom. This wasn\u2019t the man she knew. \u201cBy the time I met Tom, he\u2019d suffered a stroke and had lost his ability to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he requested to be transferred to Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d Charlotte reached for a cookie. She should avoid the unneeded calories, but these were simply too good to ignore.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I was the reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d Charlotte didn\u2019t doubt it for a moment. \u201cWhat you said about your grandfather may very well be true. I can\u2019t possibly know, nor is it important that I do. But I can tell you about the man who became my friend. He wanted to meet you, I\u2019m convinced of that, but I think he was afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe moved to Cedar Cove because it was the closest facility to where you lived. It makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem convinced.</p><p>\u201cI understood Tom. Don\u2019t ask me how or why, but the two of us bonded. Some days it was almost as if we could talk. I understood what he wanted to say and he appeared to understand me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father said he always did have a way with the ladies.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stiffened, then decided Cliff was probably right. She wouldn\u2019t take offense, although that was her first instinct. \u201cYour grandfather never had the chance to tell you he loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved me?\u201d Cliff flared. \u201cHe never even met me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course, but you were his only living relative. He\u2019d obviously kept track of you. Otherwise, how would he have known where you were living or that you raised horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he knew that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he did. The same way I\u2019m confident he wanted you to have the things I took out of his storage unit. He wasn\u2019t able to be part of your life. Perhaps he felt he didn\u2019t have the right to intrude on you. But it\u2019s his blood that runs through your veins. He was proud of you\u2014I know it. Proud to be your grandfather. This is all he had to give you.\u201d</p><p>Cliff Harding set down his coffee and stood. Staring out the window, he turned his back to Charlotte. \u201cI came this afternoon to thank you for your efforts on my grandfather\u2019s behalf and to tell you I wanted nothing to do with the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very persuasive woman, Mrs. Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll take his things home with you?\u201d She hoped he would. And more importantly, she wanted him to examine each piece and discover the man Tom Harding had been. She feared Cliff would pack everything away without learning about his heritage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll carefully study what your grandfather left you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ve made a wise decision.\u201d Sighing deeply, Charlotte knew she\u2019d put in a good day\u2019s work. Somehow, she\u2019d accomplished what Tom had wanted her to do. And on a more personal note, she\u2019d be glad to remove the gun from her girdle.</p><p>Justine bought a slinky blue dress for her ten-year class reunion, but she didn\u2019t know who she was hoping to impress. Her one consolation, as she headed out the door for the festivities, was that Seth Gunderson wouldn\u2019t be attending. She should know. As the treasurer for the reunion, Justine had compiled a list of who\u2019d signed up and who\u2019d paid. Seth had done neither.</p><p>She felt humiliated arriving without a date, but why should this night be different from any other high-school function? Justine had been an outsider all through those years. She was the class brain, the valedictorian and the girl voted most likely to succeed. With several scholarships offered, she\u2019d dutifully chosen a prestigious East Coast school and followed the course set out for her, but she was never truly happy.</p><p>She hated life on campus, hated being away from Cedar Cove. After her graduation, she\u2019d taken a job at First National. In the years since, she\u2019d been promoted steadily. Now she was the youngest branch manager in Cedar Cove history, and one of the bank\u2019s youngest senior employees. Justine loved the challenge of her job and enjoyed playing an active role in financing the growth of her community. But she considered her personal life a dismal failure.</p><p>Warren would have attended the reunion with her if she\u2019d pressed him. She hadn\u2019t, afraid her former classmates would assume he was her father or, even worse, an old teacher they couldn\u2019t quite place.</p><p>The high-school gymnasium looked great, if she did say so herself. The decoration committee, of which she was a part, had worked hard and done a fabulous job. Fresh flowers were everywhere, on the tables and in huge rented vases along the walls.</p><p>The band was already playing, and almost involuntarily Justine tapped her foot to the music as she waited in line to collect her badge and sign in. Everyone around her was talking; she was surrounded by squeals of recognition and \u201cdo you remember when\u2019s.\u201d Just as she had in high school, she remained the outsider, listening in, smiling and pretending she felt at ease when she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Attending this reunion was a bad idea. Her instincts had told her that months earlier, and she should\u2019ve heeded them.</p><p>\u201cJustine!\u201d Lana Rothchild hurried around the sign-in table and hugged her as though it\u2019d been years since they\u2019d seen each other. Actually they\u2019d worked on the decorations together that very morning. \u201cI love your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The metallic-blue dress had short sleeves and a deep V in front. Knee-length, it clung to her trim figure. She\u2019d bought the dress on impulse and had decided not to think too hard about it.</p><p>\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d Justine asked, looking for a way to appear busy and needed and part of the group.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s under control. You just enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Justine wondered if that was possible.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for all the help you gave us,\u201d Lana said as she handed Justine a badge.</p><p>With no further excuse to linger, she walked into the main part of the gymnasium. A few couples were dancing, a clump of women had gathered on one side, a group of men on the other\u2014not all that different from the high-school dances she\u2019d attended. Thinking a glass of wine would relax her, she found the bar and ordered a zinfandel, then stood by herself on the outskirts of the dance floor. It had been the same ten years earlier.</p><p>\u201cHello, Justine.\u201d</p><p>Seth Gunderson stood directly in front of her, deeply tanned, his hair so blond it was almost white. His eyes had never looked bluer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI graduated the same year as you, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...\u201d She found it difficult to think. \u201cAren\u2019t you...I thought...well, of course we graduated the same\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI flew home for the reunion,\u201d he said, answering the question she couldn\u2019t seem to get past her teeth.</p><p>\u201cI realize that...what about...\u201d Rather than continue making an idiot of herself, she simply stopped talking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprised to see me. Actually, I surprised myself by deciding to fly down at the last minute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surprised was an understatement, as far as Justine was concerned.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop staring at him. No man on earth had a right to look this good. Refusing him would have required more effort than she could possibly muster. Oh, yes, she wanted to dance with him. Wanted to slide into his arms, be held by him...</p><p>Rather than attempt to respond verbally\u2014at the rate she was going she hadn\u2019t a clue what might actually come out of her mouth\u2014she nodded and put her wineglass on a nearby table.</p> <p>Seth led her onto the dance floor and turned her into his embrace. Naturally\u2014fittingly\u2014the band was playing a slow dance and she lifted her arms as he held her loosely. Justine was amazed at how well-suited they were physically. At five-ten and in heels, she was taller than most of the men, but Seth still had several inches on her. She rested her head against his shoulder and breathed in his clean, outdoor scent.</p><p>This was the first time she\u2019d ever danced with him.</p><p>\u201cYou came alone?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The music was mesmerizing and it was all she could do not to close her eyes and give herself completely over to it. That couldn\u2019t happen, especially with Seth. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to be trapped in the magic of the moment. She refused to let her guard down, certain that as soon as she did, Seth would ask her about Warren, or the engagement.</p> <p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d he said after a minute. \u201cCame here alone, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hand around hers and brought it to his chest. Justine felt the solid, steady beat of his heart. It seemed to travel through her hand and the pulse in her wrist, directly to her own heart. His eyes held her, and with their steps in unison, this was the most sensual, seductive moment of her life.</p><p>When the love song ended, Seth released her. She moved away from him and clapped politely.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a table yet?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cLana asked me to sit with her and Jay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jay invited me to sit with him and Lana,\u201d Seth told her, eyes twinkling.</p> <p>So the Rothchilds were involved in a little matchmaking. Just now, it was very easy to forgive them.</p><p>\u201cThe buffet isn\u2019t until nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, wondering if he was inviting her to dance again. If so, he didn\u2019t need to ask. When the music started, they moved toward each other as though magnetically drawn.</p><p>Other than the few times they stopped to talk to friends, Justine and Seth danced every dance. Soon the buffet table was ready and a line of revelers straggled around the gym floor. Seth bought them each a glass of wine and sat next to her at the table for eight.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before Justine fell into conversation with the others. Soon pictures of her classmates\u2019 children were passed around and she found herself looking at the cherubic faces and listening to stories full of love and pride. Justine carried a small photograph of her newborn niece and showed it to Seth.</p><p>\u201cJames is married? When did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier in the year. Isn\u2019t Isabella beautiful?\u201d Justine had made a firm decision not to be a mother, but as she studied the photographs she was handed, she felt an intense and unexpected longing. It would eventually pass; she recognized that, even as she struggled to deal with a slew of unwelcome emotions.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said, getting to her feet. Instead of heading for the ladies\u2019 room, Justine walked outside, out the front door, letting the cool air revive her. She leaned against the flagpole and closed her eyes, breathing in the night air and with it the return of her rational self. She wasn\u2019t like those people back inside the school. She never had been. She was separate, different. Not above them, just not one of them. She\u2019d known it in high school and felt it even more profoundly ten years out.</p> <p>\u201cJustine?\u201d Seth joined her. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She was quick to assure him that everything was fine, but he wasn\u2019t fooled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t explain to Seth, of all people, that she\u2019d come outside in order to clear her head and put her life back in perspective.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to cry,\u201d Seth commented.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d She turned away, but Seth caught her hand and drew her gently into his arms. She could have resisted at any time\u2014but didn\u2019t. She knew he intended to kiss her even before his lips claimed hers. This wasn\u2019t their first kiss, but Justine had conveniently forgotten what this man was capable of doing to her resolve.</p><p>The effect of his kisses was like putting a match to lighter fluid, each one hotter and more explosive. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d Justine cried, tearing her mouth from his, her breathing labored.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d Seth agreed, but it was clear he was teasing her as he brought his mouth to hers. He held her head between his hands, but Justine wasn\u2019t struggling. She submitted fully to the kiss, starved for his touch.</p><p>\u201cWe have to stop,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cThe reunion...\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes...yes, we should get back.\u201d Justine broke away and hid her face against his collarbone as her shoulders heaved.</p><p>Seth held still, arms around her waist, until his ragged breathing slowed.</p><p>\u201cThis really isn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d Justine finally said, and broke free from Seth entirely.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to like the answer,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to say you\u2019ve decided to accept Warren\u2019s proposal, after all?\u201d</p><p>She attempted a smile, one that would show him she was confident in her decision. \u201cActually, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to marry Warren Saget?\u201d The question sounded incredulous.</p><p>She lowered her eyes and nodded.</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t say anything for several seconds, then exhaled slowly. \u201cIf that\u2019s your choice, I\u2019m obliged to honor it. I only want the best for you, and if that\u2019s Warren as your husband...I won\u2019t try to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>He spun on his heel and returned to the reunion alone.</p><p>Dan had been missing for over three months now, and as the weeks drifted by, Grace had become almost accustomed to living alone. She\u2019d adopted a routine of sorts, which helped her forget that the man she\u2019d been married to all those years had abandoned her and their two daughters. She couldn\u2019t understand why he hadn\u2019t stayed long enough to see their first grandchild. Kelly had convinced herself that her father would be back before the baby was born, but Grace held out no such hope.</p><p>Roy McAfee continued to give her biweekly updates on his progress, but so far he had nothing of significance to report. There\u2019d been no more sightings of Dan in town after that one time. Grace suspected there wouldn\u2019t be. Her husband had come to deliver a message and Grace had received it loud and clear. He hadn\u2019t been to the house again, either.</p><p>Thursday evening after she\u2019d closed the library for the night, Grace walked toward her car, which she\u2019d left near Waterfront Park. Concert on the Cove\u2014a summertime music series sponsored by the downtown merchants\u2014was on tonight. This was exactly the kind of social gathering Dan hated; in all the years the performances had been offered, Grace hadn\u2019t attended a single one.</p><p>Families came with their children, senior citizens brought their own chairs, teenagers hung out in groups. Most people brought a take-out dinner. The blend of young and old drew the community together.</p><p>As she reached her car, Grace heard sixties rock-and-roll and sang along with an old Diana Ross hit. All at once it dawned on her that there was nothing to keep her away. There hadn\u2019t really been a good reason in the past, and there wasn\u2019t now.</p><p>Dan would never have told her she couldn\u2019t attend, but she hadn\u2019t wanted to go alone. She was alone now, with no reason to hurry home. She could stay or leave as she wished; it was entirely up to her. How odd that this insight should give her such a profound sense of freedom. It felt as if shackles had been unlocked and the weight she\u2019d carried had fallen from her shoulders. She was free\u2014free to attend the concert. Free to enjoy life without catering to Dan\u2019s likes and dislikes. Free to do what she wanted.</p><p>Walking over to the park, Grace stopped long enough to pick up an order of chicken teriyaki from the Japanese restaurant across the street.</p><p>Most of the seating had already been taken. Grace stood and watched, delighting in the fact that so many people were enjoying the concert. A trio of women cavorted on the bandstand. Dressed in miniskirts, pageboy haircuts and pink feather boas, The Blondells performed the old Supremes hits from the \u201860s, and Grace found herself smiling at their energy and high-spirited fun.</p><p>\u201cGrace!\u201d Charlotte Jefferson raised her arm in order to attract Grace\u2019s attention. Her best friend\u2019s mother sat on the outer edge of a semi-circle of lawn chairs, with a blanket spread in front of her.</p><p>Grace made her way over to Charlotte, maneuvering slowly through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cSit here with me,\u201d Charlotte invited. \u201cI have something I want to discuss with you later, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Grateful for the invitation, Grace sat down on the blanket and leaned against one leg of Charlotte\u2019s chair. Her back would start to ache soon, but she would enjoy this as long as she could.</p><p>\u201cThis is such good music,\u201d Charlotte announced when the intermission was announced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fabulous,\u201d Grace agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I was just thinking of you the other day,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked it over with Olivia, and she thinks it\u2019s a good idea. Exactly what you needed, she said.\u201d</p><p>Grace was intrigued.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine, a good friend, has a wonderful companion, and well, she\u2019s moving to a retirement complex and needs to find a home for Buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cButtercup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s been such a loyal friend, and seeing that you\u2019re alone, I thought...\u201d Charlotte looked uncertain. \u201cI did plan to ask you first, but as I recall you\u2019ve had dogs in the past.\u201d</p><p>Dan had loved his dogs, and throughout their marriage they\u2019d had a number of family pets. Two years ago, their small cocker mix had died peacefully in his sleep and Dan had decided they wouldn\u2019t have any more animals.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog is Buttercup?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA golden retriever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a dog,\u201d Grace said decisively. \u201cI really would.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte rubbed her hands together. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased. Olga\u2019s been terribly worried about finding a good home for her dog. I knew you were the right person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to take Buttercup over to visit Olga now and then, if that would put her mind at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grace, what a thoughtful gesture. Olga would be so appreciative.\u201d</p><p>That weekend, the golden retriever became part of Grace\u2019s life. She wasn\u2019t sure how well the dog would adapt to a new environment, but the moment Grace brought her into the house, it was as if Buttercup recognized it as her home and prepared to settle in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, Buttercup,\u201d she said, releasing her from the leash. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>With her tail wagging, the golden retriever examined each room, paused in the middle of the living room and then jumped into the old recliner that had been Dan\u2019s chair. Dark eyes watching Grace, she rested her chin on her paws.</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t help it; she burst out laughing. Of all the places for Buttercup to claim as her own, she\u2019d chosen Dan\u2019s chair. Somehow she\u2019d instinctively known that space was available.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be good friends, aren\u2019t we, Buttercup?\u201d Grace murmured to the dog.</p> <p>This, too, Buttercup appeared to understand.</p><p>Grace poured herself a cup of coffee, reached for a crossword puzzle book and settled down in the chair next to that of her newfound friend and companion.</p><p>Life continued without Dan. He\u2019d apparently found someone else and\u2014Grace smiled over at Buttercup\u2014so had she.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Olivia felt good. Better than good. She felt confident, successful, at the height of her powers. She\u2019d put in a fabulous day in court, and, since summer was now apparently in full bloom, she intended to enjoy what remained of her afternoon.</p> <p>This was perfect weather for sitting at a caf\u00e9 along the waterfront and enjoying a bottle of wine and some delectable Hood Canal shrimp. She could think of no one she\u2019d enjoy doing that with more than Jack Griffin.</p><p>He\u2019d proved to be delightful company. In the three weeks since the Fourth of July picnic, they\u2019d attended a political rally, on which Jack had written an article. Then she\u2019d tagged along while he interviewed the lady who crocheted beautiful tablecloths for the Saturday Farmers\u2019 Market. That article had appeared in Wednesday\u2019s edition of The Cedar Cove Chronicle. Last Friday night, Jack had taken her to dinner at Willcox House, a B-and-B in Seabeck that Bob and Peggy Beldon had recommended. The house boasted a room Clark Gable had once stayed in, and the food was incredible. Once again, Jack was writing an article. It was high time they went out just for pleasure, she decided, instead of combining it with business.</p><p>Leaning back in her office chair, she reached for the phone and punched out his number. \u201cHi,\u201d she said when he picked up.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself. To what do I owe this pleasure?\u201d He sounded genuinely pleased to hear from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to make you an offer you can\u2019t refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds interesting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promise you it will be.\u201d Olivia loved the banter between them.</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cI can hardly wait. What do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d she whispered seductively. \u201cThink of sitting out on the Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I with anyone?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cNaturally. You\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s important.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed in mock annoyance. The teasing was all part of the Jack she enjoyed most. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve got on a sleeveless top and walking shorts, a big sun hat and dark glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you in dark glasses. They make you look mysterious.\u201d</p><p>She laughed; there wasn\u2019t a thing mysterious about her\u2014certainly not her growing attraction to him.</p><p>\u201cNext, consider the background music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDire Straits? Guns n\u2019 Roses? Red Hot Chili Peppers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a beleaguered sigh. \u201cI was thinking more along the lines of Neil Diamond, Barry Manilow, Henry Mancini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarry Manilow? Please, not Barry Manilow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to like Barry Manilow,\u201d she chided.</p><p>Now it was his turn to sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s hope for this relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll compromise on the music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like Manilow, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Eric Clapton,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cBob Dylan\u2019s better. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. May I continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he urged, as if she\u2019d been the one holding up the proceedings.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re together on the Cove watching the sun set, music is playing softly in the background and we\u2019re sipping glasses of wine.\u201d She hesitated, certain he was about to launch into a discussion regarding the wine. \u201cDo we need to argue about the wine, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he assured her, \u201cyou choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. A nice fruity Gew\u00fcrztraminer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Isn\u2019t that a little sweet? Are you sure you wouldn\u2019t be interested in something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t going to argue about the wine. You can drink what you want and I\u2019ll drink what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine with me.\u201d He was certainly amicable all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cA waiter appears with a menu,\u201d she went on.</p><p>\u201cIf the menu\u2019s got tassels, I can\u2019t afford to eat there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo tassels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jack said immediately. \u201cNow, did the waiter bring the bread basket yet? I\u2019m getting hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush him, we\u2019re still enjoying our wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re drinking the wine, I want the warm bread and butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making this difficult, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, continue, but I should tell you I worked through lunch today, so if you\u2019re going to start listing the specials of the day, I\u2019ll have to make a run to the candy machine.\u201d</p><p>Olivia heard drawers opening and closing. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019m looking for something to eat.\u201d A grumbling sound followed his explanation. \u201cThe best I could come up with was a roll of Tums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby. I guess that means you don\u2019t want to hear about the seafood fettuccini, dripping with spicy shrimp, seared scallops and bits of lobster, stirred together in a creamy Alfredo sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a cruel woman, Olivia Lockhart.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed delightedly. \u201cYou just wait until I show you how cruel I can be.\u201d</p><p>Jack sucked in his breath. \u201cI love it when you talk dirty.\u201d</p><p>Olivia growled.</p><p>\u201cWhen, where and how long will it take me to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight at seven.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI...can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, eight, but that\u2019s really kind of late for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about tomorrow night?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a judicial committee meeting. Why can\u2019t you go to dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He was certainly being cryptic about it. \u201cJack, have you got another date?\u201d she asked, half laughing as though it was a joke. Neither of them had made any promises. He was free to date someone else, just as she was. But she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He paused before answering. \u201cNot exactly,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she echoed. What the hell did that mean? \u201cAre you doing something illegal?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust secretive,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Again the pause. \u201cIf you want to put it that way.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hated secrets. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, not bothering to hide her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019d love to have dinner with you, but you\u2019ll have to choose some other night.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was a woman whose life was open to scrutiny; she disliked the way he chose to keep parts of his life hidden. If he had some dark secret, she\u2019d rather know now.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey, it\u2019s not that big a deal, is it?\u201d</p><p>Honey. Now she was his honey.</p><p>\u201cAnother evening, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly but with conviction. \u201cIt isn\u2019t all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me make sure I\u2019m getting this,\u201d Jack said after a long pulsing silence. \u201cYou\u2019re angry because I can\u2019t go to dinner with you at the drop of a hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jack, that\u2019s not it at all.\u201d She straightened in her chair. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry. It seems I\u2019ve been reading more into our relationship than warranted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she countered. He wanted everything on his terms, which meant that any relationship could only be a surface one. He had his secrets, and she was just supposed to overlook that.</p><p>\u201cOlivia...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t make it for dinner,\u201d she said, interrupting him a second time. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it another night.\u201d Maybe ten years from now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up that phone!\u201d Jack shouted.</p><p>She was too stunned to react.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re going to do. The next time I call and suggest we get together, you\u2019ll have a reason you can\u2019t. The time after that, it\u2019ll be the same, until I\u2019ve got the message. Dammit, Olivia, I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be up front with it. Jack, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to continue seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I can\u2019t go to dinner with you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said swiftly. \u201cBecause I was married to a man who chose to keep secrets from me. I\u2019m not willing to get involved with anyone who can\u2019t be open and honest.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she pressed. \u201cYou\u2019re a man with secrets.\u201d</p><p>It took him forever to answer. \u201cIf it gives you any pleasure, then I\u2019ll say it. You\u2019re right\u2014I have my secrets.\u201d</p><p>He replaced the receiver, and Olivia listened to the buzz droning in her ear. Jack should\u2019ve known her better than that. She derived no pleasure from being right.</p><p>The instant Grace pulled into the driveway, Buttercup bounded out the doggie door at the back of the house and raced to her side.</p><p>\u201cHello, girl,\u201d Grace said as she stepped out of the car. She leaned down and scratched the dog\u2019s ears, then the two of them walked to the mailbox to collect the day\u2019s offerings.</p><p>Along with a couple of magazines and a few odd bills, Grace got the Bremerton Sun.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for your dinner?\u201d she asked Buttercup, unlocking the door that led to the kitchen.</p><p>The golden retriever dutifully walked to her water bowl and lapped up a drink, then waited patiently while Grace opened the closet door and brought out the large bag of dog food. She filled the dog\u2019s dish, then settled down to glance at the mail.</p><p>Nothing important.</p><p>She set the magazines on the table and as she did so, noticed that the message light was flashing.</p><p>\u201cGrace, it\u2019s Roy McAfee. Give me a call when you get home.\u201d</p><p>Dan.</p><p>Roy must have learned something about Dan. Her hand trembled as she looked up Roy\u2019s number and immediately returned the call.</p><p>Corrie, Roy\u2019s wife and assistant, connected her right away.</p><p>\u201cRoy, this is Grace Sherman. Have you located Dan?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, but I got the report from the Assets Check and thought you might be interested in what I found out.\u201d</p><p>After running into nothing but dead ends, Roy had suggested they request a computer check for assets, but Grace had balked at forking over the extra two hundred-dollar fee required for the search. Learning that Dan held title to a piece of land wasn\u2019t going to help her locate him. In a community property state, any bank records would be open to her without cost.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. The report listed a license application Dan made last June.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You didn\u2019t tell me you two owned a travel trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to state records, Daniel Clayton Sherman residing at 204 Rosewood Lane, Cedar Cove, Washington, applied for a license for a travel trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Grace asked. \u201cExactly when?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJune sixteenth of last year.\u201d</p><p>The date was meaningless, and Grace felt numb. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know about any travel trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called the private party who sold it to him and discovered he paid cash. It\u2019s a twenty-four footer. The other person wasn\u2019t likely to forget, since Dan arrived with the money in fresh one-hundred-dollar bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the seller, thirteen-thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash?\u201d They didn\u2019t have thirteen-thousand dollars in cash. Any extra money had been invested. Nearly everything they\u2019d managed to save over the years was in stocks and bonds.</p> <p>\u201cThe man made quite a point of telling me it was all one-hundred-dollar bills. Actually, he was quite shaken when he was handed that much cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would Dan get that kind of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that,\u201d Roy told her.</p><p>Neither could she. \u201cDan couldn\u2019t have taken out an equity loan without my knowing, could he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Roy said. \u201cNot according to the bank records I have.\u201d</p><p>And surely she would\u2019ve received some sort of statement for any other kind of loan.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d But then, very little of what Dan had done in the last year was logical.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know anything about this travel trailer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a thing. Do you think Dan\u2019s traveling around the country?\u201d she asked, searching desperately for answers.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know. Haven\u2019t come across any evidence of that\u2014no credit card charges, for instance. None in his name, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s he using for money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he had thirteen-thousand dollars in cash you knew nothing about, there\u2019s no way of knowing how much money he had squirreled away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere could he have kept this money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a safety-deposit box?\u201d Roy answered her question with his own.</p><p>\u201cYes...no. I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d They did have a box at some point, but she hadn\u2019t seen the renewal application in years.</p><p>\u201cTell me this,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWho brought in the mail every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Another possibility is that Dan has a post office box you know nothing about.\u201d</p><p>All the secrets Dan had kept from her. Grace didn\u2019t know how she could have lived with him for more than thirty years and not known the man who was her husband.</p><p>\u201cThe report didn\u2019t show a safety-deposit box?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but if Dan has one strictly in his name, the bank isn\u2019t legally obligated to report it. Some banks will as a matter of course, and others only if a court order is issued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we need a court order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll face that when we come to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>As if she understood that her new mistress was feeling anxious, Buttercup walked over to the phone and stood next to Grace. She leaned down and stroked the dog\u2019s head, which calmed both of them.</p><p>She spoke with Roy for a few more minutes. When she hung up, Grace experienced a new sensation. Considering the range of emotions she\u2019d already become familiar with, she wouldn\u2019t have thought that was possible. Since Dan\u2019s disappearance, she\u2019d felt disbelief, shock, grief and outrage. Lately she\u2019d discovered a certain peace that came with resignation and acceptance. Roy\u2019s latest news didn\u2019t infuriate her. Instead, she was left feeling stupid.</p><p>Sitting at the table, she leafed through the latest issue of Sunset Magazine. Something must be wrong with her, she mused. Her life was falling apart and she was reading a chicken enchilada recipe.</p><p>The phone rang and for an instant Grace hesitated, uncertain she wanted to talk to anyone. But it was bound to be one of her daughters, and if she ignored the call they\u2019d both worry.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Grace was right. \u201cHello, sweetheart. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant,\u201d Kelly complained. \u201cSix weeks to go.\u201d</p><p>The time had passed quickly for Grace, but she doubted her daughter would feel that way.</p><p>\u201cAny news on Dad?\u201d</p><p>Grace was always astonished by the way her daughters seemed to sense any new developments regarding Dan.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Kelly pressed.</p><p>\u201cCan you get your sister on three-way calling?\u201d Kelly had the option on her phone, whereas Grace didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou learned something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet Maryellen on the line and I\u2019ll tell you both at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Grace was accustomed to the procedure. She was put on hold while Kelly dialed her sister\u2019s phone number, and then once Maryellen was connected, Grace would be able to speak to both her daughters at once. She closed her eyes, her mind spinning as she waited.</p><p>In the beginning, Grace had wanted to protect her children from what Dan had done. Her reaction had been instinctive, but it\u2019d also been wrong. Maryellen and Kelly were entitled to know. Furthermore, they might be able to provide an answer. For all Grace knew, Dan might have said something to one of the girls that would give her\u2014or Roy McAfee\u2014some kind of clue.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both here,\u201d Kelly said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Mom?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was time for honesty. \u201cRoy discovered that your father purchased a twenty-four-foot travel trailer last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad bought a trailer?\u201d The question came from Kelly.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he keep it?\u201d</p><p>That was a question Grace hadn\u2019t thought to ask. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m discovering that I knew very little about your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Again it was Kelly who asked. Kelly who was so close to her father and so confident he\u2019d return before her baby was born.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said reluctantly. \u201cHe paid cash for the trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>\u201cThirteen thousand,\u201d Grace said. \u201cIn fresh one-hundred-dollar bills.\u201d</p><p>Kelly gasped.</p><p>Maryellen said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue where he got that much money,\u201d Grace told her daughters. It was as much a mystery as his disappearance.</p><p>\u201cMom, do you think the other woman might have bought the trailer for him?\u201d Maryellen asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThen why not register it in her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she wanted you to find out about it,\u201d Maryellen suggested.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Kelly shouted. \u201cThere is no other woman. Dad wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrow up,\u201d Maryellen said sharply. \u201cWhen are you going to quit looking at Dad like he\u2019s some kind of saint? He didn\u2019t just leave Mom, you know. He walked out on you and me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Kelly cried, breaking into huge sobs. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ll never believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls, please...\u201d Grace felt close to tears herself.</p><p>\u201cDo you still think Dad\u2019s going to magically reappear before your baby\u2019s born?\u201d Maryellen asked. \u201cGet a grip! He doesn\u2019t care about either one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen, stop.\u201d Grace refused to allow her older daughter to continue. This was hard enough without the two of them turning against each other.</p><p>An awkward moment passed, then Maryellen whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kelly. I was upset and I took it out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cFor you and Mom. One day we\u2019re all going to discover the truth about Dad. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s doing this or where he is, but there\u2019s a perfectly logical explanation for his disappearance.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter had said this many times before, and Grace let her say it again. Neither she nor Maryellen challenged what they both saw as a fantasy. They understood that Kelly needed to believe it.</p><p>Justine had been downright miserable since the reunion. She\u2019d announced to Seth that she intended to marry Warren, but she hadn\u2019t gotten around to mentioning it to Warren himself.</p><p>Friday night, Warren planned to take her to dinner at D.D.\u2019s on the Cove, and she thought she\u2019d tell him then, as long as he understood she wanted a long engagement. Eventually they\u2019d ease their way into marriage.</p><p>\u201cYou look fabulous,\u201d Warren said, kissing her cheek when he picked her up after work. The bank was open until six on Friday nights and after a ten-hour day, Justine was tired. Warren might think she looked good, but that wasn\u2019t how she felt.</p><p>Because they were close to D.D.\u2019s, Justine suggested they walk over to the waterfront restaurant.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s drive.\u201d</p><p>It seemed ridiculous to drive to a restaurant less than two blocks from the bank, but Justine didn\u2019t want to start the evening with an argument.</p><p>Warren held open the car door for her and she discovered a small wrapped package on the passenger seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOpen it and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot another gift. Warren, please, this isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d he joked. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can prove to you that I\u2019ll be a generous husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, no pressure.\u201d Chuckling, he hurried around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>Justine waited until he was seated before she opened the jeweler\u2019s box. Inside was an oblong-shaped black pearl in a gold oyster clasp; it was suspended from a fine gold chain. The pearl was exquisite.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine picked that up for me in the South Pacific,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to wear diamonds and pearls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Warren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the restaurant. I could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>Justine enjoyed a glass of wine now and then, but she wasn\u2019t a heavy drinker. Warren often overindulged and when he did, she drove them both home and spent the night in his spare room. She knew what people thought and was content to let their assumption stand. Warren appreciated her discretion. Evenings of this kind happened often enough that she kept a spare set of clothes at his house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The parking lot at D.D.\u2019s was already almost full, and they were fortunate to find a space. Instead of requesting a table for dinner, Warren led her into the cocktail lounge, where they sat at a circular booth overlooking the water.</p><p>Warren had two double scotches in quick succession. He\u2019d just ordered his third when Seth Gunderson walked casually into the lounge.</p><p>Justine\u2019s shocked gaze clashed with his. She\u2019d had no idea he was still in town. The last place she\u2019d expected to run into him was here.</p><p>Seth looked slowly from Justine to Warren, a disgusted expression on his face.</p> <p>Since it would be rude to ignore Seth completely, she attempted a smile. He acknowledged her briefly by inclining his head in her direction, then made for the bar. He took a seat with his back to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Warren asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she assured him, staring out over the waterfront and the marina.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Warren asked, glancing at Seth and then, as if he\u2019d figured it out, he reached for his drink and tossed it down in one swallow. \u201cDamn,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Warren. I\u2019m with you, not Seth.\u201d Agreeing to marry Warren right then and there would reassure him, but she couldn\u2019t make herself do it.</p> <p>\u201cYou want him, though. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d How easily the lie came to her lips.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think you\u2019re kidding?\u201d Warren said scornfully. \u201cIt\u2019s written all over both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d She repulsed Seth. Everything he did told her as much. He sat at the bar with his back to her, letting her know that he couldn\u2019t bear the sight of her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take your eyes off him,\u201d Warren commented and oddly, he sounded amused.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clear the air here and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Warren, no.\u201d She tried to grab his arm as he slid out of the booth, but he was too fast for her.</p><p>Horrified, Justine watched as Warren walked over to the bar. She could only speculate about what he said, but he appeared to be inviting Seth to join them. Seth declined, and obviously Warren persisted, encouraging him. Justine wanted to crawl under the table when Seth finally gave in, picked up his beer and followed Warren back to their booth.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Warren said jovially.</p><p>Seth hesitated. The option was to sit next to Warren or to slide into the booth beside her. He chose to sit by her, so she was trapped between the two men. She noticed that Seth was as far removed from her as he could possibly be and still remain in the booth. Warren moved closer to her and wrapped one arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI understand you two know each other from high school.\u201d</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t seem too interested in answering.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends even before that,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cDid you enjoy the reunion?\u201d Warren asked, directing his question to Seth.</p><p>\u201cParts of it.\u201d His gaze burned into Justine\u2019s. \u201cI understand congratulations are in order. Justine told me she\u2019s agreed to be your wife.\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s arm tightened around her shoulders, as if to tell her how pleased he was. Then\u2014pretending he knew\u2014he said expansively, \u201cThat\u2019s right. As you can imagine, I\u2019m a happy man.\u201d He threw Justine a bold smile.</p><p>\u201cA lucky one,\u201d Seth added without emotion.</p><p>\u201cBut not a selfish one,\u201d Warren said, not quite under his breath.</p><p>Justine pressed her hand against his arm, fearing what he seemed about to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren, I think it\u2019s time we had dinner,\u201d Justine said, eager to end this conversation.</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d he said a little more firmly. \u201cI can see what\u2019s happening between you two,\u201d Warren went on.</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing, I can assure you,\u201d Seth informed him stiffly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019m not here to judge. I know how Justine feels about you, Gunderson. She\u2019s got the hots for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Seth frowned, his face darkening.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t any better at hiding your feelings than she is,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cWell, more power to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine\u2019s already agreed to marry you,\u201d Seth reminded him.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but we both know she\u2019s more woman than an old guy like me can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Never in all her life had Justine been so humiliated, so embarrassed. She tried to leave the booth, but with Warren on one side and Seth on the other, she couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>Seth leapt out of the booth as if it\u2019d suddenly caught fire. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough of this conversation to know I\u2019m unwilling to listen to any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be hasty,\u201d Warren said with a congenial laugh. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to show you both how open-minded I am. If you want Justine, you can have her with my blessing.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s earlier look of contempt didn\u2019t compare to the one he cast Justine now. Contempt...and pity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d he said, slamming down his beer. \u201cI have no interest in Justine.\u201d Then he walked out of the lounge, not sparing her so much as a backward glance.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Cecilia felt the joy, anticipation and excitement as Navy wives and families crowded the pier, awaiting their husbands and fathers. She had truly become one of those wives. She stood with Cathy, who was obviously pregnant now. They held on to each other, fearful of being separated in the large group. In some ways, Cathy was like the sister she\u2019d never had. She hoped that the bond they\u2019d built in the past months would continue for a lifetime. Her friend had taught her so much about courage and hope. Lessons Cecilia had carried with her ever since the accident on the George Washington.</p><p>\u201cI think I see Andrew,\u201d Cathy shouted.</p><p>Andrew Lackey stepped off the gangplank and peered expectantly around. Cathy shrieked and ran toward him, arms flung wide. Andrew caught her around the waist and half lifted her from the ground. As they kissed, Cathy threw her arms around her husband\u2019s neck.</p><p>Feeling a bit awkward watching them, Cecilia looked away, hoping to catch sight of Ian. Her heart sank; he wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. Glancing back at her friend, Cecilia felt tears in her eyes as Andrew flattened his hand against Cathy\u2019s belly. Standing where she was, Cecilia could feel his relief and his sheer happiness that this pregnancy was secure. The most dangerous months had passed, and although there were no guarantees, a miscarriage was far less likely now. The doctors were pleased with the way the pregnancy was progressing.</p><p>Then all at once Cecilia saw Ian. He paused at the top of the gangplank and scanned the crowd, searching for her.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d she shouted and her arms shot into the air to attract his attention. \u201cHere! I\u2019m here.\u201d She took off running toward her husband, ducking and weaving through the crowd, and literally flew into his embrace.</p><p>Cecilia had thought she was ready for this moment, but nothing could have prepared her for the wild burst of happiness. When Ian returned shortly after Allison\u2019s burial, she hadn\u2019t come to the base to meet him. At the time, she couldn\u2019t. She just couldn\u2019t. But everything had changed, and now Ian was home and they were beginning a new life together.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey.\u201d Her husband\u2019s hands were in her hair and they kissed frantically, straining against each other, eager to give and receive, holding back nothing.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home.\u201d As long as her arms were around his neck, she didn\u2019t care if her feet dangled inches off the ground. \u201cHow are your ribs?\u201d she asked, afraid all this hugging might hurt him.</p><p>\u201cThey burn like hell, but I\u2019d rather put up with the pain than not hold you.\u201d He kissed her again. The passion between them was back, the way it had been at the start.</p><p>Tears welled in Cecilia\u2019s eyes. She hadn\u2019t expected to cry, but it felt so...so good to be with Ian. The months he\u2019d been at sea had been a time of healing for them both.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered over and over.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Ian had proved it in more ways than she could count. She was grateful for his patience and his refusal to give up on her or their marriage. If it hadn\u2019t been for his repeated attempts to resolve their differences, she was sure they would\u2019ve been divorced by now. Neither Ian nor the judge had made divorce an easy option and Cecilia was truly thankful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a decision,\u201d she told him as they walked toward the car, their arms locked around each other. Now that he was home, any separation, even that of a few inches, seemed too much.</p><p>\u201cI hope it involves living with you again,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d Actually Ian was in for a surprise. With Cathy\u2019s help, she\u2019d moved her husband\u2019s things back into their small apartment. Some of his stuff was still on base, but everything he\u2019d left with the Lackeys had been brought to their home.</p><p>\u201cI want my wife with me.\u201d He stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want another baby, Ian.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it. The words came straight from her heart.</p><p>His steps faltered and he stopped abruptly. \u201cI thought...you said...\u201d</p><p>She knew he was confused and could hardly blame him. \u201cYou can thank Cathy and Andrew for my decision.\u201d If her friend could face a third pregnancy with hope and a positive attitude, then Cecilia, too, could learn to let go of her pain and look toward the future.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? Because I\u2019ve made up my mind to leave it entirely up to you. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, I want a family, but it\u2019s more important to me that you feel you can go through with another pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia leaned her head against his shoulder as they resumed walking. \u201cI\u2019ve given this a lot of thought in the last few months. I\u2019d like to continue with my schooling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should, Cecilia. You\u2019re very intelligent, and you show real ability with numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want a family, too. Our family. I\u2019d like to wait a couple of years, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d been this agreeable a few months ago,\u201d she teased, then changed her mind. He\u2019d been stubborn, all right, but she\u2019d been no less so.</p><p>\u201cSomeday soon I want to go back and visit that judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had the courage to tell us to stay together. She didn\u2019t say it in so many words, but that was her message. I want to thank her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Ian said. And he gently kissed the top of her head.</p><p>The telephone woke Grace out of a sound sleep. Heart pounding, she jerked upright and automatically groped for the receiver.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d her son-in-law said.</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2019s in labor?\u201d Grace was already out of bed, holding the telephone to her ear, turning on lights, looking for clothes. The digital clock-radio told her it was three-fifty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe contractions are five minutes apart, and we\u2019re on our way to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there. Do you want me to call Maryellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. She\u2019s the next name on the list.\u201d</p><p>After throwing on a pair of sweats, phoning Maryellen and making herself a cup of instant coffee, Grace was ready to head out the door in less than fifteen minutes.</p> <p>\u201cButtercup!\u201d She called her dog, needing to let her out in the backyard before she left.</p><p>The golden retriever ambled slowly out of the bedroom, obviously not pleased to have her sleep interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it,\u201d she promised, and then because she was just so excited, she announced loudly, \u201cI\u2019m about to become a grandma!\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was at the hospital\u2019s birthing center by the time Grace arrived. They met in the waiting area. Paul\u2019s mother, Margaret, was there with her camera and cross-stitch project.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through this before,\u201d she explained, settling down in a chair and taking out skeins of embroidery thread in various colors.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this,\u201d Maryellen muttered, cradling a cup of convenience-store coffee in her hands. \u201cI haven\u2019t been up this early since drill team in high school.\u201d That comment was followed by a huge yawn.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019re Paul and Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack there.\u201d Maryellen waved absently toward a set of double doors.</p><p>Grace was approaching the nurses\u2019 station to ask for news when Paul appeared. \u201cKelly\u2019s getting checked now to see how far she\u2019s dilated. She\u2019s doing great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Paul nodded excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m ready for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks he is,\u201d Paul\u2019s mother teased.</p> <p>\u201cYour life is going to change forever,\u201d Grace told him.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know that. Kelly and I very much want this baby.\u201d</p><p>Before he left, Grace hugged her son-in-law, grateful to Paul. He\u2019d been a wonderful help in the months since Dan\u2019s disappearance. Grace knew he\u2019d given Kelly unwavering comfort and support, as well as commonsense advice; she herself had leaned on him many times when something around the house needed fixing. Not once had he complained. She\u2019d gradually become stronger, braver, more determined to get on with her life, but she didn\u2019t think Kelly felt that kind of resolve yet\u2014or resignation.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think Kelly\u2019s going to deal with Dad not being here?\u201d Maryellen asked, as if reading Grace\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t answer that. Kelly had clung to the hope that her father would reappear as soon as her baby was born, absolutely refusing to accept that he\u2019d abandon her at this crucial time.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t coming,\u201d Maryellen whispered, leaning forward. \u201cDad\u2019s not going to walk through that door and there isn\u2019t going to be a joyous reunion, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Grace agreed. \u201cKelly will deal with it in her own way. Right now, though, she has enough to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Maryellen muttered.</p> <p>Grace leaned back in the hard plastic chair and closed her eyes, fighting off the urge to sleep. A part of her wanted to be with Kelly, but she also recognized that this special time was reserved for Paul and she didn\u2019t want to intrude. Maryellen, long-divorced, had shown no interest in motherhood, nor had she revealed any desire to marry again. Grace sometimes wondered if Maryellen had put her emotional life on hold while concentrating on her professional life. Grace\u2019s only concern was that Maryellen have no regrets about the choices she was making.</p><p>At seven-thirty, Kelly was ready to deliver. Paul brought them that update and then dashed out of the waiting room at lightning speed. Maryellen, Grace and Margaret gathered in the hallway outside the delivery room. Not long afterward, their tension was broken by the cry of an infant.</p><p>Paul appeared a few minutes later. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d came his jubilant shout. \u201cA boy!\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t know Margaret Kelso very well, but all of a sudden Maryellen and Grace were hugging Paul\u2019s mother as if she were their closest friend. Tears of joy crept down Grace\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Maryellen chided. \u201cJust look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a right,\u201d she laughed, wiping the tears from her face. \u201cI\u2019m a grandmother!\u201d</p><p>At nine that morning, while Kelly slept, Grace sat in the rocking chair with this precious new life cradled lovingly in her arms. \u201cWelcome, little Tyler Daniel Kelso,\u201d she whispered, rocking gently. The commotion had died down. Margaret had taken her pictures and returned home to her husband. Maryellen had gone into the art gallery, refusing to allow a little thing like becoming an aunt\u2014and getting hardly any sleep\u2014to keep her away. Grace, however, was in no hurry to leave.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Kelly whispered from her bed. Grace glanced up to find her daughter watching her. \u201cHe\u2019s so perfect, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious child.\u201d Grace kissed Tyler\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind that we named him after Dad, do you?\u201d</p><p>Grace assured her she didn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t know where your father is,\u201d she told her, \u201cand there are no guarantees I ever will, but I\u2019m sure of one thing. He loves you and he\u2019d be very proud to know that little Tyler is his namesake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that with all my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mom,\u201d her daughter whispered, then closed her eyes.</p><p>Grace continued to rock her grandson, holding this much-loved child close to her heart. Dan was gone. His leaving had torn a gaping hole in her life. She\u2019d lived with her husband\u2019s disappearance all these months, struggling to find answers, knowing that might never happen. But just now, holding this grandchild, she felt as though none of that mattered.</p><p>In confronting her doubts and fears, Grace had learned something vital. Everything she needed for happiness lay deep within herself. Her grandson, this perfect little boy, gave her the inspiration and courage to go on. She wished her husband well, wherever he was, and whoever he was with. Then, eyes closed, Grace released Dan, mentally and emotionally. She was ready to let go even without the answers.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy, but Justine couldn\u2019t leave things as they were between her and Seth. She hadn\u2019t seen him since that horrible night when Warren had confronted him at D.D.\u2019s on the Cove. Never in all her life had she been so humiliated. She supposed she should be grateful because that night had opened her eyes to what she\u2019d become.</p><p>Seth was back in town, although Justine didn\u2019t know for how long. Realizing she\u2019d lose her courage if she thought about this too much, Justine went over to the marina.</p><p>Seth was busy working on his boat, stripping paint. He seemed oblivious to her. Her footsteps were heavy with shame and dread as she walked down the dock toward him. She stood in front of his slot. Not sure what to do with her hands, she tucked them in the hip pockets of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cHello, Seth.\u201d</p><p>He stopped his work and slowly turned to face her. His mouth was set and tight. \u201cHello, Justine.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem receptive to her presence. But then, he didn\u2019t have any reason to be. \u201cI imagine you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019m doing here,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his lack of welcome. \u201cI wanted to apologize for the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, it\u2019s forgotten.\u201d He returned to his task, as if everything had already been said. He certainly wasn\u2019t eager to talk with her, which made this even more difficult than it already was.</p><p>\u201cDo I...disgust you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He paused, glancing in her direction. \u201cWhat I think of you or Warren shouldn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does because...because, dammit, Seth\u2014oh, never mind.\u201d She bolted and got maybe half a dozen steps down the dock when she stopped abruptly. She had the horrible feeling that if she walked away from Seth now, she\u2019d regret it for the rest of her life.</p><p>When she turned back, she was surprised to find he\u2019d leapt onto the dock and was only a step or two behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou care what I think?\u201d he demanded, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Her voice deserted her; she simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cFine, then hear me out.\u201d Everything about him told her he was angry. His stance was confrontational, his fists clenched, his eyes narrow and hard. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool if you marry Warren Saget, and I don\u2019t suffer fools gladly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried. \u201cI broke it off with him that night.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s head reared up. \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing Warren anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention any of the things Warren had said and done to win her back, but there weren\u2019t enough gifts in the world to accomplish that.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he took the news sitting down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had trouble believing me, but he\u2019ll accept my decision in time.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t have any choice.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>The answer was completely up to him, but Justine couldn\u2019t tell him that, so she shrugged. A heartfelt shrug, conveying uncertainty...and hope.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cThat shrug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just letting you know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me once that I should come to you when I broke it off with Warren\u2014and well, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m just going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ve got news for\u2014\u201d He stopped. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cWhen? Just now? I said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, exhaling slowly, \u201cI didn\u2019t quite give you time to ask, but what I said was yes. Meaning I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>Her answer appeared to confuse him further. He stared at her for the longest moment and, still unsure of his reaction, Justine said nothing. He started toward her, then halted, then walked directly past her. He\u2019d gone four or five feet before he turned back. \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d he asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get a marriage license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, the most wonderful smile she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in long engagements.\u201d</p><p>Justine threw back her head and laughed. \u201cAs it happens, neither do I.\u201d</p><p>The front door of 16 Lighthouse Road was open. Olivia sat out on the porch with her needlepoint in her lap, the portable phone at her side. The wicker rocking chair had been her mother\u2019s and she loved spending summer evenings right here, enjoying the view and watching the sun set over the Olympics. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone rang, disturbing her solitude, and Olivia answered without giving it a chance to ring again.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s me\u2014Justine,\u201d her daughter said. \u201cOkay, listen. I have some news and I don\u2019t want you to be angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, because\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Olivia heard someone arguing with her in the background. \u201cJustine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d her daughter cut in, \u201cI\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>The needlepoint project fell off Olivia\u2019s lap as she bolted upright. \u201cMarried?\u201d So Warren had finally worn her down. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said, doing her best to sound enthusiastic. She\u2019d always said that if her daughter chose to marry Warren Saget, she\u2019d smile and welcome him to the family.</p><p>\u201cHere, talk to Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, did I forget to mention that I married Seth Gunderson?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Olivia was too shocked to respond.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Lockhart, it\u2019s Seth. I know you\u2019re probably upset\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Reno, for heaven\u2019s sake?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Justine explain.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter got back on the phone. \u201cAre you upset with us, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised...but delighted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth doesn\u2019t believe in long engagements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor in a long courtship, it appears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...what happened is this\u2014We decided to get married and it just made sense that we get the license at the courthouse and have you or even Pastor Flemming marry us, but that would\u2019ve taken three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Washington State law,\u201d Olivia reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t have three days.\u201d</p> <p>This was getting more interesting by the minute. \u201cAnd why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth has to be back in Alaska by Sunday night and he won\u2019t be available for almost five weeks, and it was either now or wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t, Mom! I just couldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want to wait, either. I know this is probably the most impulsive thing I\u2019ve ever done, but I know marrying Seth is the right thing. I\u2019m sure of it. Oh, Mom, I love him so much and please don\u2019t be upset with us. We can have a second ceremony with you and Grandma and Dad later on, can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Oh, Justine, I\u2019m so happy for you and Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I think the world of Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I have to go now. We\u2019re phoning Seth\u2019s father next. And then Dad. After that, we\u2019ve only got about twenty hours before we have to drive back. I\u2019m happy, Mom, happier than I\u2019ve been in my entire life.\u201d She paused. \u201cOh, would you call Grandma for me?\u201d</p><p>Olivia swallowed the lump that had formed in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, too,\u201d she said again. \u201cAnd of course I\u2019ll call your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>They ended the conversation, and Olivia walked inside in a daze. She went into the bedroom and sat on the edge of her bed. She needed a few minutes to absorb what she\u2019d just learned. Her daughter was married. To Seth Gunderson. Oh, this was wonderful, wonderful news!</p><p>Her first instinct was to phone Stan, but she decided against it. Justine would tell her father, and he\u2019d call once he\u2019d heard. So, both of their children had chosen to marry without either parent there. She wondered if that meant anything.</p><p>She phoned Charlotte, who wasn\u2019t home; she left a message, saying simply, \u201cCall me when you get in.\u201d</p><p>Then she returned to her needlepoint project. Feet propped up on the porch railing, she continued her stitching, grinning every now and then. Who would\u2019ve believed Justine would do something so spontaneous?</p><p>When a battered blue Taurus parked in front of the house, she strained to see if it was who she thought. It was.</p><p>Jack climbed out of his vehicle and stood on the sidewalk, watching her nervously. Did he expect her to walk inside and bolt the door? Or to offer him an invitation? She did neither.</p><p>He walked to the bottom of the steps. \u201cHello, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful afternoon, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She was cordial, but not excessively so.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d She didn\u2019t think this was a social call.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Since there was only the one chair, which she occupied, he climbed the stairs and sat on the top step. \u201cAre you still angry with me about that dinner date?\u201d</p><p>Men! He seemed incapable of understanding a concept like mutual trust and respect. \u201cNo.\u201d A one-word reply should satisfy him, without leading into a dead-end conversation.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still unwilling to go out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered honestly. She hated to admit how much she missed his company. Maybe she\u2019d been expecting too much, but she couldn\u2019t tolerate the fact that he\u2019d created secrets between them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He looked out over the Cove, its sparkling, distant water tinged by the pink of a slowly setting sun.</p><p>\u201cI moved to Cedar Cove to start a new life,\u201d Jack told her. \u201cBut the past has a way of catching up with people, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded; she saw the evidence of that every day.</p><p>\u201cBob\u2019s advice is that I simply tell you\u2014that I should have months ago. But I was afraid if you knew, you wouldn\u2019t want anything more to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore secrets, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just the reason I couldn\u2019t go to dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary, Jack.\u201d He\u2019d made his decision and so had she, although she had to confess to being curious.</p><p>\u201cI think it is,\u201d he countered. \u201cIf you and I are to continue, at any rate, and I want that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have this thing about secrets. I detest them.\u201d She realized that a lot of her feelings were tied to her long-dead marriage. Stan had been unfaithful before the divorce, if not physically then emotionally. After the crisis of Jordan\u2019s death, it\u2019d been another woman who\u2019d helped Stan deal with the loss. Another woman he\u2019d confided in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a recovering alcoholic, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She paused, certain she\u2019d recently seen him with a drink in his hand. No, she thought. That was at Willcox House, and he\u2019d had sparkling water while she\u2019d had wine. He\u2019d said it was because he had to drive....</p><p>\u201cThe reason I couldn\u2019t go to dinner with you was because I had an AA meeting to attend. I have ten years of sobriety. It\u2019s been ten long years but not a day goes by that I don\u2019t think about booze. I\u2019m one beer away from destroying everything.\u201d</p><p>It took a lot of courage to tell the truth. Olivia rose from her rocking chair and sat on the porch step beside Jack and reached for his hand.</p><p>He wrapped his fingers around hers. \u201cI\u2019ve stood before a lot of judges in my time, but I\u2019ve never dated one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, I wasn\u2019t sure how you\u2019d feel about seeing me once you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it explains a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell...I figured there had to be a logical explanation for why you don\u2019t like Barry Manilow.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cAre you saying only a drunk wouldn\u2019t appreciate him?\u201d</p><p>Olivia threw back her head and laughed.</p><p>\u201cMy mind was pickled for twenty years, but thankfully I\u2019ve managed to keep my sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing. You\u2019re going to need it living here in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Jack raised her hand to his lips. \u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very best kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t press your luck.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m free tonight for that dinner, if you\u2019re so inclined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, I do have a reason to celebrate. I\u2019ll tell you about it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb the sunset. Oh, Jack, isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he whispered, slipping his arm around her, bringing her close to his side.</p><p>As the sun set over Cedar Cove, Olivia rested her head on Jack\u2019s shoulder. This had been a good summer. Both her children were married now, and James was a father. Justine sounded genuinely happy. Her mother\u2019s health continued to be good. Her dearest friend had suffered a blow, but Grace had accepted what she couldn\u2019t change; she was refashioning her life, and Olivia was proud of her.</p><p>And Olivia herself...Olivia was with Jack, and their relationship was secure. She didn\u2019t know what the future held for them, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling it was positive.</p><p>The sun sank below the Olympic Mountains. Its deep-pink glow fell across the water and spilled onto 16 Lighthouse Road. It crept through the town of Cedar Cove and gently touched the house at 204 Rosewood Lane. Grace Sherman looked out her window and smiled. </p> </body></html>"]
