Rowdy Mackay steered the Harley into its parking spot before lifting his glasses from his face and facing the demon sprite as she moved from the wood bench to stand on the sidewalk in front of him.</p><p>She was wearing one of those short, snug little T-shirts she liked so much. At least it wasn\u2019t one of his bigger shirts. He had lost two more on this trip home and he knew who to blame. She had been stealing his shirts since she was sixteen\u2014when her mother married his father, bringing his favorite bit of trouble right into his home.</p><p>And he had been running from her ever since. Seven years of running.</p> <p>He turned and tucked the sunglasses into the side of his Marine-issue duffel bag strapped on the back of the Harley before he bent his leg on the gas tank and watched her silently. Dawg and Natches were supposed to be here soon. Dawg was driving Natches over so he could take the Harley back, but they weren\u2019t here yet. There was no one to distract him from the hunger driving him crazy.</p><p>She was twenty-three and her kisses were soft summer rain. They slid over a man\u2019s senses and drew him in, inviting him to get all wet and wild with her, inviting him to give her his worst. And in Rowdy\u2019s case, his worst might be a hell of a lot more than she could handle.</p><p>She stepped from the sidewalk. The low rise of her jeans didn\u2019t even come close to the tempting shadow of her navel. She made him sweat in the middle of damned winter. But it wasn\u2019t winter now, it was summer. A hot, Kentucky summer evening, and he was leaving again.</p><p>And this time, he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he wouldn\u2019t be able to walk away again. This was his last year away from home, he figured. Each year without even touching her, without taking her or tasting her kiss, she made him feel things he didn\u2019t expect.</p><p>His chest tightened at that knowledge. At the effort it was going to take to walk away from her again.</p> <p>\u201cYou left without saying good-bye.\u201d She stopped beside the Harley, her dove gray eyes staring back at him with a shadow of hurt. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get to see you this time.\u201d</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t. He had stayed as far away from his dad\u2019s home as possible, spending the six weeks he was back on the boat he kept at the marina.</p><p>A playful breeze caught at the long curls of her golden brown hair and tugged at the lush waves of silk he dreamed of wrapping around his body. He had dreamed of her while he spent those lonely nights on the boat. Dreamed of touching her, kissing her, dragging her beneath his body, and taking her until neither of them could breathe for the exhaustion filling them.</p><p>Other women hadn\u2019t even figured into his lust. His stubborn body rejected them. He wanted Kelly.</p><p>His mouth was watering. He could feel the need to pull her to him, to wrap himself around her, nearly getting the best of him.</p><p>\u201cRowdy?\u201d Her voice was filled with a young woman\u2019s hope, her dreams, and all the passion he knew burned inside her.</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here, Kelly.\u201d He sighed as he gave in to the impulse to reach out, to use the excuse of pushing her hair back to touch the soft warmth of it.</p><p>He really wanted to crush it in his hands, pull her head back, and devour her. Damn, he could do it too. She would let him. He could see it in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even say good-bye.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just hurt in her voice then, there was anger.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to say good-bye, I might not have left,\u201d he finally sighed. He was a man; he knew better than this. Kelly might be twenty-three, but she had no damned clue what she was getting into with him.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her three years before. Pinned her against the trunk of a tree and took her lips like the sweet drug they were. He had marked her because he couldn\u2019t help himself. He had made certain no one was dumb enough to think they could have Kelly. And his cousins would make sure it stuck while he was gone. While the Marines took their final year of this tour and he decided what the hell he was going to do about Kelly.</p><p>\u201cYou could have said good-bye,\u201d she whispered again.</p><p>\u201cI could have been shot by my own father for the things I\u2019d have done to you if I had just a measure of a chance.\u201d He tried to smile, but he was too busy trying to keep his hands off the soft curves of her ass instead.</p><p>She was making him crazy. But hell, this was Kelly; she had been making him crazy for most of her life in one way or the other.</p> <p>\u201cI would have come to the boat\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laid his finger over her lips when he wanted to lay his own lips over them. Take them, lick at them, feel her open to him as she had that night at the lake.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re here now.\u201d He had known she would be. Prayed for it.</p><p>He lifted his finger from her lips as he lowered his head. He didn\u2019t kiss her lips, he couldn\u2019t trust himself to rein in his hunger, his lust. It was impossible. He had a plane waiting on him, a job to finish, and he\u2014</p><p>Sweet merciful God have pity on him. Her head turned, her lips touched his, and he was a goner. His hands slid over the ripe curves of her ass and he clenched, lifting her into the cradle of his thighs as his hunger overruled all common sense.</p><p>His head tilted, his lips slanting over hers, and he swore he saw stars as the sweet taste of her exploded against his senses. Blood began to pound in his veins as his thighs tightened, his dick thickened, and everything but the taste of Kelly receded beneath the force of his lust.</p><p>Pure, raw pleasure. That was what she was. She made him hard, made him primal, made him want to show her all the reasons why he should have never touched her the first time.</p><p>But she was his. His woman. His sweet, hot taste of paradise, and he could do nothing but beg for more. She was his drug, and God help them both, he was afraid the addiction might well kill one of them. He knew for a certainty it was going to drive him crazy.</p><p>Male catcalls and raucous voices had him finally dragging his lips from hers as he glanced up to see several servicemen watching him enviously. Son of a bitch. Here he was in the damned parking lot of the airport ready to tear her clothes from her body.</p><p>Glancing down, he watched her eyes drift open, saw the passion that clouded her gaze as she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget me, Rowdy,\u201d she whispered as he set her back from him.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t let go of her. His hands clasped her hips as his forehead settled against hers.</p><p>\u201cForget you?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cBaby, you\u2019re in every dream that drifts through my head. How the hell am I supposed to ever forget you?\u201d</p><p>And that sucked. He couldn\u2019t forget her anymore than he could have her. Sweet, little, virgin baby, she had no idea what she was getting into.</p><p>ONE</p><p>One Year Later</p><p>So that was what had happened to that third shirt. Rowdy Mackay leaned against the kitchen doorway, tilted his head, and watched in amusement as Kelly shuffled over to the refrigerator and opened the door to peer into the interior.</p><p>The long, gray Marines T-shirt swallowed her slender frame and hung well past her thighs. A pair of his matching gray socks covered her small feet, and gray sweatpants hung from her hips. Not his, he thought in amusement\u2014obviously hers but loose enough to make a man wonder why the hell she was suddenly hiding that curvy little body he knew she possessed. Especially when she had never bothered to do so in the past.</p><p>This outfit was a far cry from the snug shorts and T-shirts she used to don for summer sleepwear. Long, honey brown curls fell from the crown of her head to the middle of her back, the loose ringlets tousled and still a bit tangled from sleep, and damn if she didn\u2019t look like she had just dragged herself from a lover\u2019s bed.</p><p>He knew better, of course. His father\u2019s rules were strict. Rowdy might live under his roof during the brief times he was home, but he didn\u2019t bring his women here for the night, and he knew damned good and well Kelly wouldn\u2019t bring a man here.</p><p>The treasured princess of the house might be spoiled beyond bearing, but she respected her mother and stepfather. So dragging herself out of a lover\u2019s arms before making her way to the kitchen for a snack wasn\u2019t a scenario that was likely to happen here.</p><p>It was one of the reasons he had stayed away as much as possible since she had come of age. One of the reasons he had taken that last tour with the Marines. Some things a man just knew he was too weak to resist, and he had accepted long ago that he was too weak to resist Kelly.</p><p>That realization had come along about the time she grew breasts and he began noticing those breasts. Somewhere around the time that she started teasing him with innocent smiles and brushing against him, and he began enjoying it.</p><p>It was then he joined the service just to get the hell out of the house, to get away from her. College wasn\u2019t providing him the escape he needed. She was still there, and so was he, too often. And he was weak. Weak men were dangerous creatures. A twenty-two-year-old man had no damned business touching a sixteen-year-old, and he had known it. The only other option had been leaving. So Rowdy had left.</p><p>His time in the Marines had taught him self-control, finished his education, and brought him into manhood. But his greatest weakness was still his greatest weakness. Kelly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna cook.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked at the early morning grumpiness in her voice. She was talking to herself. Some things never changed. The sun would rise in the east and set in the west, and Kelly would always mutter to herself when she was irritated.</p><p>And the sound of her sweet, husky voice would always make his dick threaten to burst the zipper in his jeans.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s cereal in the cabinet.\u201d Rowdy expected her to turn with a smile bright enough to rival the sun. His arms were ready to open for the handful of woman barreling toward him. He wasn\u2019t expecting what he got, though.</p><p>Kelly screamed. The refrigerator door slammed closed hard enough to rattle the contents as she turned to dart through the opposite doorway.</p><p>Her face had gone paste white; her wide gray eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Who had she been expecting?</p><p>She was poised to run but fighting to stand still. Conflicting emotions ran across her expressive face as her eyes met his, and the room filled with a tension that had never been there before.</p><p>Fear filled her eyes.</p><p>Rowdy narrowed his eyes on her, his body stiffening. No, it wasn\u2019t fear. For a moment, there had been pure, shocking terror. A woman aware that she was alone with a man, that she was weak, that her security wasn\u2019t assured. He\u2019d seen it overseas in the eyes of a thousand women, and he saw it now.</p><p>\u201cRowdy?\u201d Her voice was high, thin, her hands bunching in the front of her shirt, fisting the material as she shuddered. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>The husky, fear-laden voice twisted at his guts and had pure, unbridled fury simmering in his mind. What had happened to Kelly?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s home, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He had been ready to catch her as she ran at him. She always ran to him, throwing her arms around his neck, pressing her tight little breasts against his chest, and slapping a kiss to his cheek. For eight years, he could count on Kelly\u2019s greeting. Until today. He wondered in which direction the sun would rise now. Some things should just never change.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d She nodded, her eyes darting around the room before a nervous smile tilted her soft pink lips, trembled there for a moment, then disappeared. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting you. Did you tell Mom and Ray you were coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never do.\u201d His battle instincts were humming now. This wasn\u2019t normal. It was so far from normal that he knew with a clench of his gut that he wasn\u2019t going to like whatever the hell had been going on here.</p><p>Suddenly, nearly a year of his father\u2019s discomfort when they talked on the phone rose within his mind. Every time he had asked about Kelly, Ray Mackay\u2019s voice had tightened. When Rowdy asked to talk to her, he was given excuses.</p><p>The letters he had received from Kelly had changed, too. She no longer sent pictures, no longer filled the exchanges with innuendo or teasing comments. She had still written, but it was different, a difference he couldn\u2019t put his finger on, couldn\u2019t explain. He had felt it, though. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re always sneaking up on us.\u201d There was that nervous smile again, the way her eyes darted around the room.</p><p>Rowdy held himself where he was, leaning against the doorway, arms crossed over his chest. He could be a patient man when he had to be. But he had also learned that sometimes, there was no choice but to forge ahead and confront whatever enemy waited in the dark. He\u2019d learned to forge ahead just as well as he had learned to wait.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Kelly?\u201d He straightened from the doorway, dropped his arms, and tucked his thumbs in the waistband of his low-slung jeans.</p> <p>His chest was bare, the cooling breeze from the air conditioner drying the sweat that had dampened his flesh. He\u2019d been cleaning the Harley, polishing his baby and getting her ready for her first ride in over a year. He\u2019d dumped his duffel bag in his room and headed straight for the garage, knowing his father and stepmother would be at the marina, and figuring Kelly would be there as well.</p><p>The fact that she wasn\u2019t was interesting. Her reaction to him even more so.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on.\u201d That damned quick, nervous little smile was starting to get on his nerves.</p><p>She was scared of him, and it was eating a hole in his soul. Kelly had never been scared of him, not once, he had always made certain of it. Now she was watching him as though she were terrified he was going to jump her any second.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lousy liar, baby,\u201d he grunted, heading for the fridge and watching as she edged out of his way.</p> <p>She kept her eyes on him, watching him suspiciously as he opened the door and grabbed a bottle of water. Uncapping it, his gaze locked with hers, he brought it slowly to his lips.</p><p>Now there was a glimmer of the girl he had left eight years ago. Shyly watching as he drank from the bottle, her little tongue flicking out to swipe over her own lips, as though she were thirsty. A hungry little gleam filled the soft depths of her eyes, darkening them, making them appear stormy, cloudy as it mixed with the fear.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d She crossed her arms over her breasts, tearing her gaze from his. \u201cDo Mom and Ray know you\u2019re home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He recapped the bottle and set it on the kitchen isle as he continued to watch her. \u201cI had Dawg pick me up from the airport this morning. We pulled in here about seven.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, a jerky little movement that had his fingers tightening as he watched her. The suspicion growing in his mind sent black anger swirling through him. Something had changed her, something dark and ugly, and he could see it in her eyes, in the regret and the anger and the fear that filled her expression.</p><p>The girl he had loved nearly all her life was terrified of him. She wasn\u2019t wary, or nervous, she was flat out scared. This was the same girl he had held as a child when her father died. He\u2019d been a scrawny teenager, she had been too young to understand the sudden death that had rocked her world, and had sought out the boy who ruffled her hair, teased her about her skinned knees, and protected her from the bullies.</p> <p>This was the same girl he\u2019d taken to her senior prom when her date had stood her up. The one he had danced with on the dance floor and had to hide his erection from because he knew he couldn\u2019t touch her, couldn\u2019t have her. The girl he had kissed one night when he\u2019d had too much to drink, the one he had touched too intimately before he headed back to base four years before. She was his girl, and suddenly, she was terrified of him.</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s my hug?\u201d He leaned against the middle counter, watching her closely.</p><p>What little color had returned to her face, drained. Her eyes jerked to his, then away, her throat working as she swallowed tightly.</p><p>\u201cI have to get dressed. I have to get to work.\u201d She turned on her heel, moving for the doorway.</p><p>\u201cKelly.\u201d Knowing he was making a mistake, feeling that knowledge to the soles of his booted feet, Rowdy reached out to catch her wrist.</p><p>His fingers touched her, curled around the bare skin when she shrieked, turning on him with a flash of fear as she jerked away from him, her body tightening defensively.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She gave it a good fight. She tried to cover her reaction, but the way she suddenly backed away from him and the fear on her face gave her away. There was no hiding the fact that his touch had terrified her. \u201cKelly, where\u2019s Dad?\u201d He kept his voice cool. But fury was racing through him. Only one thing could cause a reaction like this, only one thing would have changed the teasing, tempting little minx he had known into a terrified, scurrying little rabbit.</p><p>\u201cThe marina.\u201d She licked her lips again, her gaze jumping away from him, her expression warring between fear and frustration. \u201cI have to get dressed. I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll be down later.\u201d</p> <p>She ran from him. As quick as that she turned tail in those sloppy, ill-fitting clothes she was wearing and moved from the kitchen to the staircase in the entryway and rushed upstairs.</p><p>She left him alone in the sunlit kitchen, his fists clenched, anger surging in his gut, and his suspicions all but confirmed.</p><p>He turned abruptly and stalked to the phone, ripping it from its base, and punched in the marina\u2019s number.</p><p>He waited through four rings impatiently, one hand propped on his hip, the other clenched around the phone with a force that should have shattered it.</p><p>\u201cMackay Marina.\u201d His father\u2019s booming voice suddenly came over the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Rowdy kept his voice calm, controlled.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rowdy, not too bad.\u201d Ray Mackay chuckled. \u201cHow did you get to call so early? That CO of yours sleeping on the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d he drawled. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for another tour, Dad.\u201d He had planned to, had every intention of doing so until his last birthday passed and he realized that running from some things wasn\u2019t working. \u201cI\u2019m home. Showed up about seven this morning.\u201d Tension suddenly sizzled across the line.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home?\u201d His dad\u2019s voice was deliberately bland, the tone mild. But Rowdy knew his dad, sometimes too well.</p><p>\u201cYep. Saw Kelly too.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a fool, but even if he had been the muttered curse that came across the line would have warned him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way home.\u201d Ray confirmed his worst fears. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy hung up the phone, stared around the kitchen, then breathed out heavily.</p><p>Damn. He came home to court his favorite girl, to settle down, to stop fighting what he knew was a losing battle. Had he come home too late?</p><p>Kelly let the hot water from the shower flow over her, wash away her tears, though it couldn\u2019t wash away the feeling of hands holding her down, of fetid breath on her face and hard, wet lips covering hers.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t drown out the rage and anger, or the fear. The water turned her skin pink from the heat and stung her tender flesh, but it couldn\u2019t ease the need that lay just below the memories of a night she feared had changed her life forever.</p><p>Rowdy was home. All six feet, four inches of hard, muscled flesh and teasing sea green eyes. He was home after more than a year away, a man full-grown, mature, and sexy as hell.</p><p>She wiped at her tears again, her breath hitching in her throat as she remembered one of the few nights she had followed him to the lake. The houseboat was Rowdy\u2019s pride and joy, and it was his escape. And she knew where he would head, to the Point, a serene cove where he and his buddies gathered on the weekends to drink, fish, let off steam, and party out the excessive energy they always seemed to have.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019ll kill me.\u201d He had been just a little drunk, and way too sexy. His sea green eyes had darkened, his expression growing heavy with desire as he pressed her against a tree.</p><p>They had been hidden in the shadows from the rest of the group, sheltered. The heat of summer and lust had wrapped around them. He had been a man, and she had been too innocent, too uncertain in how to contain the need that pulsed in every cell of her body.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell him,\u201d she had whispered, her palms smoothing up his chest, feeling the prickle of the light growth of body hair that spread over his torso as his hands gripped her hips, pulling her against his thighs.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll know I touched you.\u201d His lips had quirked into a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re like pure, raw liquor, Kelly. And you go to my head faster.\u201d</p><p>She had fought to breathe, to contain the explosion of satisfaction and joy that rushed through her bloodstream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving again tomorrow, baby.\u201d At first the words hadn\u2019t made sense. \u201cI took another tour. Damned good thing, because sure as hell I\u2019d end up doing this, and fuck us both up for good.\u201d</p><p>Agony had washed over her body even as pleasure had exploded into fragmented, flickering rays of sensation. His lips had covered hers, his tongue teasing her as he sampled her kiss then tasted the tears that fell from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOne kiss, baby. Just this. Damn, you\u2019re going to break my heart.\u201d</p><p>He had kissed her as though he were starved for her. One hand had curled in her long hair, the other had cupped her breast, his thumb rasping over her engorged nipple, their moans blending together as the summer night enfolded them.</p><p>The hard length of his cock had pressed between her thighs. Even through the heavy material of his jeans she had felt the throb of his erection, the length of it, the promise of passion and satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d she had whispered as he drew back from her. \u201cDon\u2019t go, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll ruin us both forever...\u201d He had set her from him, staring down at her, his eyes raging with lust. \u201cDon\u2019t forget me, darlin\u2019, because sure as hell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget you.\u201d</p><p>He had never touched her again. He had taken her back to the shore and walked her the short distance to the small parking area above the Point. He had put her in her car and sent her home. And the next morning, he was gone. And he had not touched her since. She had lived on fantasy and dreams, because Rowdy made certain there was no chance of a repeat performance. And she had plotted and planned for his return. She had moved out of her mother\u2019s home into a small apartment in town. She had begun monthly visits to the local spa where she was plucked, waxed, toned, and lotioned on a regular basis. For too short a time.</p><p>Within three months of moving out all her dreams had turned to ashes and fear had taken their place. Her own foolishness had led to her downfall, and pulling herself from the shadows of the terror she had experienced was taking all her strength. She didn\u2019t know if she could survive dealing with Rowdy and her need for him, on top of it.</p><p>She leaned her head against the shower wall, her breath hitching as she fought back tears. He knew something was wrong. There was no way to hide it. She looked at him now and she didn\u2019t just see the man she had been in love with since she was a kid. She saw someone she couldn\u2019t fight, couldn\u2019t struggle from if she needed to. She saw a threat.</p><p>Her fists clenched as she pressed them against the tile, anger building in her chest until she wondered if she would be able to hold back the screams that pressed at the back of her throat.</p><p>She loved him. She had loved him forever. Dreamed of him, ached for him, waited for him. And now she was too damned scared to even welcome him home.</p><p>Are you my good girl, Kelly?</p><p>She flinched at the memory of the scratchy voice at her ear as a hard male body held her down, as the slickened fingers of the other hand probed between her buttocks, ignoring her struggles, her muted screams through the gag over her mouth.</p><p>She had been bleeding from the numerous cuts he had made on her body after he tied her spread-eagle on her bed. The wounds had burned like fire as they bled, the adrenaline pumping through her making the blood race and pour from the cuts. It had made her weak, made it hard to think, to work the hastily tied gag loose enough for one piercing scream as she felt him attempt to penetrate her rear.</p><p>God, she hated the memory of it. Hated the feeling of helplessness that followed her, even now. She had been unable to fight; unable to protest anything he did to her. And the nightmares that alone brought left her shaking in the darkest hours of the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had been terrified of Rowdy knowing. Fearing he would blame her.</p><p>But even more, she had feared for Rowdy. He would have never stayed on duty if he knew what was going on at home. He would have left, with or without permission, and returned for vengeance. Rowdy protected those he cared about, and Kelly knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he would have come racing home, even if it meant going AWOL.</p><p>But now Rowdy was home. And Kelly knew, once he learned the truth, he would never let it rest. He would find the stalker tormenting her, or he would die in the effort. And the fear of his death overshadowed even the fear of the threat she faced herself. Because life without the promise of seeing Rowdy, of hearing his laughter and the dark promise of passion in his voice, was a life Kelly didn\u2019t want to contemplate. A life she knew she didn\u2019t want to face.</p> <p>TWO</p><p>At fifty-seven, Ray Mackay was still a powerful man, with hazel eyes and hair that still retained much of its raven black color. His weathered face was starting to crease with deep laugh lines at the sides of his eyes. Eyes that were usually cheerful, always warm and friendly, were now somber.</p><p>Rowdy was waiting on the front porch of the two-story white and red farmhouse when his dad pulled into the driveway, the dark green Jeep Laredo parking beside Rowdy\u2019s Harley.</p><p>Maria Mackay was out of the jeep before Ray turned the engine off, rushing up the cement walkway, her gray blue eyes concerned as she met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cIs Kelly okay?\u201d Maria Salyers Mackay was still slender for her forty-seven years of age. The summer shorts and crisp, white cotton shirt showed off her tanned legs and arms attractively.</p> <p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she be?\u201d He leaned against the railing, watching her with narrowed eyes. \u201cAnd why do I have a feeling that if I had warned ya\u2019ll I was coming home, that I might have found my way barred?\u201d</p><p>He could see it in her face, in his father\u2019s heavyset expression. They hadn\u2019t expected him, and they weren\u2019t comfortable with him being there alone with Kelly. And that just pissed him off. Whatever the hell was going on, one thing should have been set in cement in their heads, and that was the fact that he would die before he hurt Kelly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never bar you from your own home, Douglas.\u201d</p><p>He winced. Maria was the only person who called him Douglas, and the snap in her voice when she said it now was as sharp as a knife. No one called him Douglas, ever. But hell, she had taught him in school and breaking her of the habit wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest, staring down at her intently as she stepped onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check on Kelly.\u201d She moved for the door.</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He didn\u2019t move; he didn\u2019t intend for his voice to lower warningly, or his body to tense as he watched a main source of information attempt to escape. But he wanted answers, and she wasn\u2019t running off until he had them.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Maria.\u201d Ray stepped up behind her, his large hands settling on her shoulders as he gave them a comforting squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Rowdy. We\u2019ll be in soon.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at Rowdy, worry and regret shimmering in her eyes before she turned to her husband, kissing his cheek gently before moving into the house.</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s attention fixed on his father, watching as he swiped his fingers through his hair before burying his hands in his jeans pockets.</p><p>\u201cWas she raped?\u201d Rowdy lifted the bottle of water to his lips, taking a long sip as he watched Ray\u2019s eyes darken with pain.</p><p>Ray breathed out roughly, his shoulders shifting as he lowered his head.</p><p>\u201cAttacked,\u201d he finally muttered. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t raped. But she was cut up pretty bad, traumatized.\u201d He lifted his head and Rowdy wondered if his father could see the pure murder burning inside him now.</p><p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d He kept his voice even, cool nonetheless.</p> <p>Ray shook his head slowly, his expression heavy.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t see his face; there were no leads on who he was or why he attacked her.\u201d</p><p>The water bottle crumpled in Rowdy\u2019s hand, water sloshing over his fingers before he realized what he had done. Forcing himself to release the plastic, he set it on the railing and focused on his father.</p><p>\u201cWhere did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe moved out right after your last visit,\u201d Ray sighed roughly. \u201cNice little apartment in town, next to one of her friends. Few weeks later she started getting crank calls. Caller ID couldn\u2019t trace them. We put new locks on her doors and windows, but you know how she was.\u201d Ray shook his head wearily. \u201cLiked sleeping with her window cracked. She thought she was safe. Thought she would hear it if someone snagged the fire escape ladder. But she didn\u2019t. Her neighbor\u2019s boyfriend heard her screams and knocked the door down, but he\u2019d already hurt her. The attacker got out the window before the boy could catch him.\u201d</p><p>Short and to the point. And he was hiding something, Rowdy could feel it. He stared back at his father, silent, probing, knowing he would tell him eventually. Rowdy wouldn\u2019t give him a choice.</p><p>Ray glanced back at him, then away. His teeth clenched, rage glittered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a normal attack,\u201d he finally muttered.</p><p>Rowdy felt a chill race up his spine.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d He had to force the words past his throat.</p><p>Ray coughed nervously. \u201cHe meant to rape her anally. He almost managed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker! God. Damn!\u201d Rowdy flung himself across the porch, his hands running over his head before he gripped the back of his neck in fury. \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d His abdomen tightened as he fought to hold back a howl of pure rage before jerking back to stare at his father. \u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell Rowdy, what could you do?\u201d Ray snapped, anger suffusing his face. \u201cShe begged us not to tell you. You were clear across the world with no hope of coming home anytime soon. There was nothing you could have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d he snarled. \u201cThey would have let me come home or dealt with the consequences. That\u2019s no excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d His father\u2019s face flushed with anger. \u201cYou would have gone AWOL to come home, and caused even more of a mess for that kid. Do you think we didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on before you left the first time? You couldn\u2019t keep your eyes off her and she was just a fucking kid. Four years later you were back for three months and it was worse. She didn\u2019t need that. The attack was too brutal and she was too damned vulnerable. I opted to wait till you returned, and I stand by that decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Rowdy pushed his fingers through his hair before rubbing at the back of his neck with an edge of violence. \u201cSon of a bitch, Dad. Who would do that to her?\u201d</p><p>Ray shook his head. \u201cThere was a rash of rapes last summer. Several girls in surrounding counties were attacked, all anally. No one caught the bastard and the sheriff has no leads. She\u2019s finally coming out of it, Rowdy, getting a grip on herself. But it was bad for a while. Bad enough that we wondered if she would ever leave this damned house again.\u201d</p><p>And no one had told him.</p><p>\u201cLook, Son,\u201d Ray finally breathed heavily. \u201cI know how it was with you the last time you were home. With her.\u201d He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI know about the games you, Dawg, and Natches get up to. And so does Kelly. Don\u2019t expect anything from her. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy stared back at his father in surprise. Damn, this was just what he needed right now.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d he asked his father softly.</p><p>Ray shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to say anything, Son. I want you to let Kelly come to you. She\u2019s been scared to death of your return, and I don\u2019t know why myself. I know you wouldn\u2019t hurt her, but I know for a fact she knows about some of those little affairs you and your cousins have participated in.\u201d</p><p>And his father suspected she was scared of him now. Rowdy could see it in Ray\u2019s eyes, feel it in the air around them.</p><p>And he was probably right. God help the bastard that touched her, because if Rowdy ever found him, he would turn him into dog meat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head to the boat.\u201d Rowdy breathed in roughly. He needed time to think, time to figure this one out.</p><p>Ray blinked several times, his expression twisting in emotion as he turned quickly away from Rowdy and headed to the house. Pausing at the door, he turned back to his son and said, \u201cDid I ever mention how proud of you I am, Boy?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy snorted. \u201cStop calling me a boy, Pop. You\u2019re going to kill my rep, you know.\u201d</p><p>His throat tightened with emotion as well. He knew what his father was saying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud, Boy,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDamned proud.\u201d</p><p>And Rowdy felt like a failure. He had failed to protect the only woman who had ever held his heart because he was too damned busy running from her. He should have been home, he should have been holding her in his bed, loving the hell out of her. If he had staked his claim, she wouldn\u2019t have been in that damned apartment.</p><p>He breathed in roughly before turning to the door himself. His duffel bag was in his old room. Not that he stayed at the house much when he was home in the summers. He had thrown the bag in there for convenience; now he was going to have to collect it.</p><p>Rowdy jerked the door open, stalking into the house before coming to an abrupt stop. Kelly stood at the top of the landing, her face paper white, her long, damp hair hanging over that fucking shapeless T-shirt, her hands clenched in front of her.</p><p>Her lips were trembling, her eyes big and dark and filled with tears.</p><p>Rowdy glanced away, fighting for control before he turned back to her and began to walk steadily up the steps. The tears gathered in her eyes, until one dropped as she stepped back, allowing him to stand beside her.</p><p>God, he wanted to wipe that tear away, wanted to erase the shattered pain he saw in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, her voice ragged. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He asked the question softly, aware of her mother standing farther up the hall, his father in the entryway.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t careful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She flinched as he snapped the word out. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry for that, baby. That wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d His arms hung limply at his side, his own world lying broken at his feet, and he couldn\u2019t even hold her. Couldn\u2019t comfort her. It was ripping his guts to pieces. \u201cI\u2019ll be at the boat if you need me. I\u2019ll always be here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>And for now, that was all he could give her. Right now, it was all he had. He moved away from her, turning and stalking to his bedroom, ignoring Maria\u2019s whispered \u201cDouglas?\u201d as he pushed the door open.</p><p>His duffel bag was still on his bed, unpacked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the rest of my stuff later.\u201d He picked up the Marine-issue bag and turned to face his father as the other man followed him into his room.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you\u2019re home for dinner,\u201d Ray growled, his voice rough. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you have family here at the house too.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy forced a smile to his lips as he jerked the duffel bag from the bed and headed to the door.</p><p>\u201cDinner for sure. Tomorrow.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI have things to do tonight.\u201d</p><p>He paused outside the door, staring at Kelly where she stood on the landing, her eyes wide with pain.</p><p>\u201cCome down to the boat whenever you need to,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cAnytime baby.\u201d</p><p>He came back for her. He wasn\u2019t hiding that, not from his father and not from her.</p><p>A glimmer of surprise filled her eyes as a little flush moved beneath her pale skin. At least she didn\u2019t look terrorized anymore. It didn\u2019t mean he had recovered though. Rage was eating a hole into his gut and pounding through his bloodstream with enough force to make him wonder exactly how good his control was now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted to kill the bastard who had hurt her. He wanted to wipe away the memory of her pain and fill it with pleasure. And until he got a handle on himself, he didn\u2019t have a hope of doing either.</p><p>THREE</p><p>An hour later, Kelly pulled her car into the parking lot of the marina and stared out at the boats lined at the end of the docks. The Nauti Boys were all there. The Nauti Buoy, Nauti Dawg, and Nauti Dreams. She could see Rowdy on the upper deck, dressed in cutoffs, bare chested and looking like a sun god as he straightened and stared out at the parking lot.</p> <p>She had to talk to him.</p><p>She laid her head on the steering wheel and closed her eyes as she felt her heart thumping erratically in her chest. Fear or excitement? Both, she admitted to herself.</p><p>The knowledge that he was back sent heat rushing through her even as fear shadowed the arousal. She was a virgin, but she wasn\u2019t ignorant. She knew what the tension between her thighs was, and it was stronger than it had ever been. She grabbed her purse before opening the door and stepping out onto the parking lot. She looked around, feeling the snaking fear that always followed her when she left the house. Squaring her shoulders, Kelly turned and headed toward the docks. Her head lifted as her gaze locked on Rowdy. He was watching her, standing beneath the rays of a sun that lovingly painted his hard, muscular body. He made her breathing hard, made her mouth water and her hands shake with nerves.</p><p>Pulling her gaze away, she moved onto the floating walkway, heading for the back edge of the docks. There were half a dozen rows of docking slots on this quarter of the marina. They were the least expensive slots, and the farthest away from the marina\u2019s office.</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s, Dawg\u2019s, and Natches\u2019s boats were in the last three slots, and incidentally where the majority of the ducks tended to congregate. Dawg was notorious for feeding them throughout the day.</p> <p>As she neared the Nauti Buoy, the sliding deck door opened and Rowdy stepped out. Dark gold flesh gleamed with sweat as he leaned against the doorway, his thumbs tucked into the pockets of his ragged cutoffs as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cPermission to come aboard?\u201d A nervous smile trembled on her lips.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d His deep voice raced across her nerve endings, sending frissons of heat to lick at her flesh.</p><p>He moved back into the interior of the houseboat, his lashes lowering over his brilliant eyes as he watched her.</p><p>Kelly stepped onto the small deck, trying to ignore the shaking in her knees as she crossed it and entered the main section of the craft.</p><p>She had known for four years that when he came home for good, he would claim her once and for all. She had waited for him like an immature child, weaving dreams and fantasies of what would happen when he came home at last. Somehow she had known that would be his last tour, despite his threats to reenlist. A year ago, she had felt it. Something had changed in him, the way he watched her, the tension that emanated from him whenever they were together.</p> <p>As it was now. She could feel it tightening in and around her body, reminding her of all the desires and explicit fantasies that had tormented her through the years.</p><p>\u201cThirsty?\u201d He moved to the low fridge, opening it to pull out a beer and lift it to her in invitation.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head as she pushed her hair from her shoulder and faced him awkwardly.</p><p>God, she had no idea what to say to him.</p><p>He continued to stare back at her intently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sighed; she didn\u2019t know what else to say. \u201cIt was my fault Ray didn\u2019t tell you what happened.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked as he lowered his head, hiding the hurt she knew he must have been feeling.</p><p>He finally shrugged as he lifted his gaze. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let him?\u201d</p> <p>She blinked furiously at the tears that threatened to fill her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d She shrugged heavily. \u201cYou were a world away, Rowdy. You weren\u2019t free. I didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at that. \u201cI would have come home, Kelly. I could have come home without repercussion.\u201d</p><p>And that was what had scared here.</p><p>She breathed in roughly. \u201cI\u2019m doing okay. I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist and she\u2019s really helped. It\u2019s just, sometimes, I still get scared.\u201d She shrugged helplessly. \u201cI feel like such a wimp.\u201d</p><p>And she felt watched. Stalked. Not that she had told Ray or her mother how she felt. Her therapist assured her it was normal, under the circumstances. But it eroded her confidence, kept her awake long into the night. His eyes darkened as he moved slowly toward her.</p><p>She stepped back instinctively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared to death of me,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She could hear the dark torment in his voice, see it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of you.\u201d She fought the trembling of her lips as she stared up at him, fought to stand in place rather than running as she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you scared of?\u201d He reached out, his fingers running down a long curl that fell over her shoulder. \u201cWhy are you trembling, Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always made me tremble.\u201d She bit her lip at the admission. \u201cNow...\u201d She stared back at him miserably. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of you, Rowdy, but forgetting...sometimes, I can\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>His thumb smoothed down her cheek, nearly taking her breath with the latent sensuality of his touch.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep running, Kelly?\u201d he asked then. \u201cYou knew if you told me what happened I\u2019d come home. You knew I would have never stayed away. What couldn\u2019t you handle about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t come home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he growled. \u201cI would have found a way back to you, you knew it. But you swore my dad to secrecy and, it seems, my cousins as well. You were scared of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d She shook her head again, desperate to make him believe her now.</p><p>\u201cYou knew what I wanted from you, Kelly.\u201d He turned away, stalking across the room before turning back to her. \u201cYou knew I wanted you in my bed. You knew what was going to happen when I came home. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew.\u201d She couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I\u2019d try to take you while you were raw from an attempted rape?\u201d Disgust filled his voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d She couldn\u2019t let him believe that.</p><p>Moving across the room, she gripped his arm, holding him in place when he would have moved from her.</p><p>\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t, Rowdy,\u201d she cried fiercely. \u201cI know you would never, ever hurt me. I can\u2019t help it. You don\u2019t know how long I waited for you to come home, how much I needed you to touch me, and now I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to make sense of any of it.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, desperate for him to understand, on the edge of crying and knowing the tears would do her no good.</p><p>\u201cWhat you made me feel has always scared me,\u201d she finally admitted, her voice trembling. \u201cHow much I needed your touch always terrified me. And now, it\u2019s like all the fears are swirling together until I can\u2019t make any sense of any of it.\u201d</p><p>His expression twisted into a grimace of raw pain as his arms came around her. Slowly. Powerful, naked, sun-heated, he pulled her against him as her hands clutched at his waist as the scent of him infused her senses.</p><p>\u201cKelly. God, baby, do you have any idea of what it did to me to realize I wasn\u2019t here to protect you?\u201d he whispered against her hair, one big hand holding her head against his chest as the opposite arm wrapped around her back. \u201cIf I had been here, I would have been in your bed that night. No one would have touched you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d she snapped, her head lifting, a frown tightening her brow as she glared back at him. \u201cI knew you were going to think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it, I know it,\u201d he growled, holding her tighter, pressing his hips against her lower belly as she felt the breath slam out of her chest.</p><p>His erection, impossibly large, hot even through the denim, pressed against her as he stared down at her with heavy-lidded arousal.</p><p>\u201cI know, Kelly.\u201d His hands moved to her hips as she felt the familiar weakness sweeping through her body. \u201cThere\u2019s not a damned thing that could have kept me away from you. Why the hell do you think I spent so much time in the Marines? I stayed away because I couldn\u2019t keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>His hands were on her now, clasped at her hips as hers flattened against his bare chest and she stared back at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cI want you until I can\u2019t breathe for it,\u201d he whispered then. \u201cBut I would never hurt you. And I would never take what you can\u2019t give me, Kelly. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Rowdy,\u201d she cried, the aching need and shadowed fears that rose inside her clenching in her chest. \u201cI never thought you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to hold you this morning.\u201d His hands smoothed over her back, her hips. \u201cI wanted to pull you in my arms and put myself between you and the world to keep anything, everything, from threatening you ever again.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. God, what was she going to do? He wasn\u2019t even concerned with what his father had said, the fact that he had been thrown out of his home. He wasn\u2019t angry with her or with Ray. He was angry with himself for not being there.</p><p>Kelly stared back at him, dazed, uncertain. Rowdy\u2019s expression was fierce, arrogant, equal parts frustration and determination mixed with pure, hot lust.</p><p>\u201cRowdy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to take all the fear out of your eyes, Kelly,\u201d he whispered, his head lowering, his eyes holding hers. \u201cI want it gone. I want to see all that fire and arousal and need that\u2019s always been there. That I see now.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in roughly, fighting to find reality, to make sense of the influx of sensations racing through her body.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you, Kelly.\u201d Her lips parted.</p><p>Beneath her hands, his heart raced, just like hers. A hard, rushing throb that transferred to her veins, her nerve endings, and washed through every cell of her body.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss me, Kelly?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her vision was filled with his lips. Sensually full, a treat she had dreamed of for too many years, had ached for with everything in her woman\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cNo. Keep your eyes open.\u201d He stopped as her lashes drifted closed. \u201cWatch me, baby. See me. It\u2019s just Rowdy. Just my kiss, remember how much you liked my kiss?\u201d</p><p>She loved his kiss. Her lips parted in anticipation, but perhaps she hadn\u2019t fully remembered what being kissed by Rowdy meant. Somehow, she must not have remembered just right, exactly how it felt that night on the lake.</p><p>Because this was nothing like that brief, hungry kiss four years before. This was seduction. It was coercion on its most basic level. The whisper of his lips against hers as his heavy-lidded eyes stared back into hers, darkening, flaming with need as his mouth possessed hers with devastating sensuality. Rough silk caressed her lips, stroking over them as he denied her the deeper, darker possession she was craving. This wasn\u2019t a hungry consummation, it was a dream washing over her, easing her from the shadows haunting her and pulling her inexorably into a steadily building whirlwind of sensation.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he whispered against her lips, sipping at them, making her ache for more. \u201cThere you go, just watch me, Kelly. Watch me and feel.\u201d</p><p>A whimpering moan tore from her throat as she felt his hands lift the hem of her shirt, felt his hands, calloused and hot against the bare flesh of her back. Curling her fingers against his chest she allowed herself to settle into his body, her head falling back as one hand cupped the nape of her neck and his kiss became deeper.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes open.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open as he pulled back, her breathing becoming jerky at the hunger in his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWatch me, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s too good.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dilated at the admission.</p><p>\u201cWatch me, or it stops,\u201d he growled firmly. \u201cSee who\u2019s touching you, baby. It\u2019s me. You\u2019ve been mine forever, Kelly. We\u2019re just going to ease into it now. Let me show you what I\u2019ve dreamed about for the last eight years.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking in his grip, but not from fear. Hunger was consuming her as his lips covered hers again, and she struggled to keep her eyes open, to keep her senses from drowning beneath the full-lipped kiss that threatened to dissolve the strength in her knees.</p><p>Twining her arms around his neck, she arched against him, barely retaining enough thought to keep her eyes open. If she closed them, then the incredible pleasure tearing through her would be gone. His lips on hers, his tongue stroking along her lips as hers licked back, desperate for more.</p><p>Her hips tilted to him, arching as his knees bent enough to tuck his erection at the notch of her thighs.</p><p>Oh, that was good. She whimpered as she twisted against him, feeling the heavy rasp against her clit as he lifted her to him, turning her and bearing her to the counter behind them.</p><p>\u201cThere. No need to worry.\u201d He stepped between her spread thighs, pressing firmly against her as her back arched and her hands clenched at his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSee how good it feels.\u201d His hips moved, dragging a ragged cry from her throat as his lips covered hers again.</p><p>Oh yes, it felt good. It felt as though tiny electrical charges were exploding across her flesh, sensitizing her.</p><p>His hard, bare chest pressed against her breasts, the lacy material of her bra scraping over her hard nipples, making them ache for a harder, firmer touch. This part of her hunger for Rowdy had always frightened her. The part that refused to accept a gentle touch, that ached, screamed out for more.</p><p>Powerful, possessive, Rowdy\u2019s kiss consumed her, but his hands didn\u2019t touch her. They were flat on the counter beside her, despite her need for them on her body.</p><p>\u201cRowdy,\u201d she gasped as his head lifted.</p><p>\u201cSee how sweet it can be, baby?\u201d he crooned. \u201cSo sweet and easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head fiercely. \u201cTouch me. I need you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>There were no shadows of fear now. The overriding hunger Rowdy filled her with left no room for fear, no room for shadows. There was nothing but the demand for his touch, and that demand was rising by the moment.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he whispered the question against her lips. \u201cWhere do you want me to touch you, Kelly? Show me, baby.\u201d</p><p>His powerful biceps flexed at her side as he held back. She shuddered, realizing the demand in his voice and the fact that whatever she wanted, she was going to have to initiate.</p><p>Her lips curled at the corners in amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou think I won\u2019t do it?\u201d Her body was humming with need now.</p><p>\u201cI think you could make me lose my mind if you wanted to try.\u201d Heavy-lidded eyes, his lips full and sexy, he stared back at her with wicked intent. \u201cBut will you?\u201d</p> <p>The muscles of his chest twitched; the blood pulsed in his neck. A small rivulet of moisture rolled from his neck, drawing her gaze and her hunger. Leaning forward, she moved her tongue against his skin, licking at his flesh and drawing in the salty male taste.</p><p>The groan that rumbled from him had a shiver racing up her spine.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she whispered against his neck, her teeth raking over the hard column.</p><p>\u201cShow me where.\u201d His voice was tight, dark with lust. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Up to her. She breathed in deeply.</p><p>\u201cI want your lips on my nipples.\u201d Her breathing grew harder as she let him hear the words, words she had only whispered in her dreams. \u201cThen your teeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet mercy.\u201d The heavy groan tore from his lips. \u201cOh, baby, the things I\u2019m going to do to those tight, hard little nipples. Lift that shirt for me, baby. Give me those pretty breasts.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fell to the hem of her shirt, lifting it as she leaned back to stare into his eyes, wanting to see the lust and need flaming in the green depths.</p><p>As the shirt cleared her belly and began edging over her bra, a shockingly familiar voice drawled from the doorway. \u201cThe door\u2019s open; does that mean I can join you?\u201d</p><p>Laced with amusement, heavy with interest, Natches\u2019s voice had Kelly jerking the shirt down and staring back in shock at the deepened lust in Rowdy\u2019s eyes.</p><p>There was no anger that Natches had invaded the moment, there was added arousal, a deepening flush of lust on his hard face.</p><p>\u201cEver been watched?\u201d he whispered, his expression heavy with dark desire.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Kelly stared back at him. She wasn\u2019t shocked, she realized. She had heard too much about the Nauti Boys. Too many tales of their sexual excesses, their uninhibited immersion into their sensual games.</p><p>She swallowed tightly, staring back at him as the flames between her thighs began to burn with insistent demand.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d She shook with indecision. She had guessed over the years that the day would come when she would face this choice. That she would run headlong into the hungers the three men shared; she just hadn\u2019t expected it nearly this soon.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I would love this,\u201d Natches sighed, \u201cand I surely would love it, I just came to let you know Uncle Ray is headed this way. And he has that bulldog look on his face for sure.\u201d</p><p>Was it relief or regret that raced through her mind? Whichever it was, there was no doubt her body was howling in protest.</p><p>\u201cWell hell.\u201d Rowdy dropped a quick, hard kiss to her lips as he stepped back, his hands gripping her waist as he sat her gently on the floor. \u201cGuess the cavalry is going to rescue you, baby.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need rescuing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo talking needed, baby.\u201d He shook his head as he sighed wearily and tucked her hair behind her ear, then ran his fingers gently down her cheek. \u201cGo on to the marina. I\u2019ll check in later. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, baby.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMe and Dad don\u2019t have a problem here. He\u2019s just being who he is, that\u2019s all. And who he is means he\u2019s going to worry about the little lamb staying too long with the big bad wolf.\u201d And that was her fault. She had been so hysterical over Rowdy knowing about the attack that she knew Ray was now worrying about her being alone with Rowdy at all.</p><p>She had sworn his cousins to secrecy, begging them to hold their silence on the attack, pleading with them not to tell him. Reluctantly, they had agreed. And now Kelly knew why the reluctance had been so thick. They knew Rowdy, and they knew he\u2019d be angry with all of them. And he was. He was hiding it well, but she saw the flash of it in his eyes, mixed with the hurt. Being kept in the dark never had sat well with him. He was the type of man who faced the monsters and fought them back however much it took. He wasn\u2019t a man that appreciated being protected or deliberately left out.</p><p>\u201cI better go,\u201d she sighed, glancing at the door. \u201cWill you be at the house tonight for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he promised easily, reaching up to tuck her hair behind her ear. \u201cWear something pretty for me.\u201d</p><p>Something pretty. She hadn\u2019t done that for a year.</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d She moved away from him slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it, baby.\u201d He leaned against the counter, his gaze heavy lidded, his body hard, aroused as she slid past the doorway.</p><p>Her heart was racing in excitement, drumming with latent fear, but for the first time in a year, she felt alive again. Rowdy was home now. A smile edged at her lips. He was home, everything would be fine now.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>The Nauti Boys were together again. Rowdy finished off his beer as he stared at the other two men who had followed him topside later that evening.</p><p>Natches, the youngest of them at twenty-nine, tossed the pizza box on the table and moved into one of the chairs that set beneath the awning. Dawg, the oldest at thirty-one, flipped on the CD player he had carried up and set it on the spare chair. The better to drown conversation. They had learned young to watch their discussions here at the marina and on the lake. Sound carried on the water, and they had learned more than one secret eavesdropping themselves.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pissed.\u201d Dawg sprawled back in his chair as he stared at Rowdy through narrowed, green eyes.</p><p>Rowdy took his own chair and stared back at the two men. They had run wild through town and the Marines together, though Dawg and Natches had gone reserves after their first tour rather than staying in longer. Dawg managed the lumberyard his father left him, while Natches had opted to permanently distance himself from his parents\u2019 thriving restaurants and owned a garage of all things. His dad stayed elbows deep in flour and Natches was a grease monkey. The family fights over that one had been interesting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed.\u201d Rowdy shrugged, knowing there wasn\u2019t a damned thing he could do about it.</p><p>Uncapping another beer from the cooler beside him, he stared at his cousins soberly, wondering if he would have made the same choices.</p><p>They were the bad boys of the county. The three of them had been the terror of Somerset, Kentucky, when they were young. Fathers locked their daughters up at night in fear of the three of them. They hadn\u2019t exactly gained a good reputation where women were concerned.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Rowdy, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d Dawg shook his shaggy head, his raven black hair reflecting the lights of the marina. \u201cEven pissed, it\u2019s a hell of a sight better than dealing with this without you.\u201d</p><p>Natches sipped at his beer, his own black hair not nearly as shaggy as Dawg\u2019s but longer. It was pulled back in a ponytail at his nape, giving his features a harder, more savage appearance.</p><p>They knew why they were there.</p><p>Rowdy turned back to Dawg.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me when you picked me up,\u201d he informed his cousin, his lips flat, anger tightening his skull.</p><p>Dawg shook his head, lowering it briefly before sighing.</p><p>\u201cSome things you just don\u2019t know how to tell a man.\u201d Dawg grimaced. \u201cI figured you\u2019d get a hint soon enough. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s the same girl she was last year.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy bit back the angry response burning on his lips, but hell, this was Dawg. When Rowdy hadn\u2019t been around to watch out for Kelly\u2019s skinned knees and the bullies who liked to pick on her, then Dawg had been there.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve pulled all the info on this that we can find, Rowdy.\u201d Natches straightened in his chair and reach for the pizza. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on it since it happened, trying to figure out who the bastard was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d If anyone could figure it out, it was Dawg and Natches.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Natches admitted. \u201cWe\u2019ve had four other rapes in surrounding counties over the last two years. All anal rapes, beatings, cuts, much more severe than Kelly\u2019s. She got lucky. Her neighbor\u2019s boyfriend heard the single scream she was able to get out. The boyfriend was a tough guy, broke in and tried to apprehend the bastard, but once he caught sight of Kell he let the guy go to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this shit going on at home and neither one of you were good enough to tell me what the fuck was happening?\u201d Rowdy snapped.</p><p>He had talked to both of them over the past year and never realized that the distance he had felt had been something they were hiding rather than his own impatience to finish his tour.</p><p>\u201cWhat could you have done, man?\u201d Dawg tilted his head to the side and stared back at him questioningly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the trouble of hiding an AWOL Marine the rest of our natural lives and didn\u2019t figure Kelly needed that on top of everything else. We took care of her until you could get home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWere there any rapes after Kelly?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing with the same M.O.\u201d Dawg shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s like the son of a bitch just disappeared. I\u2019m hoping he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay keeps us up-to-date on Kelly though,\u201d Natches sighed. \u201cAnd we take turns being here at the marina when she\u2019s working. She\u2019s retreated so far into herself that sometimes I\u2019ve wondered if we could find the girl she used to be. The closest I\u2019ve seen was when you had her backed into the counter this afternoon.\u201d Natches\u2019s lips twitched at the memory. \u201cShe looked real comfortable there, Rowdy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Rowdy grunted.</p><p>Rowdy stared at the other two men as he wiped his hand over his face and considered the situation for long moments.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gone,\u201d he finally sighed. \u201cI want to believe he is, I really do. But I can feel it. He\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two free?\u201d He looked at them and knew they would be, whatever it took. \u201cWe\u2019re free. We made sure of it.\u201d Natches nodded firmly. \u201cHow do you want to play it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need one of you watching our back whenever we\u2019re away from the house. I can feel that bastard watching her. I felt it today when she was on the boat, like a damned itch just under my skin.\u201d</p> <p>Dawg frowned at that. \u201cThere\u2019s been no sign of him, Rowdy. We\u2019ve been watching her every second that we\u2019ve been able to. No phone calls, no strange accidents. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy clenched his jaw at Dawg\u2019s argument.</p><p>\u201cRowdy\u2019s right,\u201d Natches muttered over the music. \u201cI\u2019ve felt it all evening, especially since we came up here. That\u2019s a feeling you never forget, Dawg. I\u2019ve had a bead on me in the service enough times to know the feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, and here I was hoping it was just my overactive imagination,\u201d Dawg grunted. \u201cBut if he\u2019s watching, it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s watched close. I\u2019ve only had the willies once or twice since all this hit the fan.\u201d</p><p>The willies. It was the perfect description for that odd, warning tingle at the back of the neck, the knowledge that something, or someone, intended to take your head off if they had the right chance.</p><p>\u201cDawg and I made sure we were both fairly free this summer,\u201d Natches stated. \u201cWe\u2019re staying on the boats. We\u2019ll watch for unusual movement or watchers. We haven\u2019t seen anything so far, but with crazies like this, who the hell knows what set them off.\u201d</p> <p>They knew each other too well sometimes, Rowdy thought. His cousins had already anticipated what he would need.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Dawg said, his voice graveled, suspicious, \u201cwhoever he is, he has to know her. Kelly\u2019s not a creature of habit. She\u2019s impulsive, unpredictable, and never where you expect her to be. He knew she would be home. He knew she liked to crack her window at night. You can\u2019t tell it\u2019s cracked from the street. He had to have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe studies his women,\u201d Natches said. \u201cGets to know them somehow. We\u2019ve been talking about this.\u201d He nodded to the others. \u201cPlaying it out. I think he\u2019s local.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rapes are in a four-county radius around Somerset. Until Kelly, Somerset hadn\u2019t been hit. She fits the profile of the other girls, though. The others he\u2019ll call every now and then from what the detectives on the case told me, and ask if they\u2019re being \u2018good girls,\u2019 but he hasn\u2019t called Kelly. The only reason he wouldn\u2019t call her, is because he\u2019s close enough to watch her,\u201d Natches pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThe guy lost it when he was interrupted. The others\u201d\u2014Dawg cleared his throat, fury flashing in his eyes\u2014\u201che made them beg. First to live, and then for him. Kelly wouldn\u2019t beg\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was interrupted\u2014Shit!\u201d Rowdy ran his hands over his head.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s still a \u2018good girl,\u2019\u201d Natches pointed out. \u201cWhen she stops being a good girl, what will he do?\u201d</p> <p>Rowdy felt his stomach pitch at the thought of that. This was why Ray was so pissed at his son\u2019s return. Because he knew Rowdy had returned to claim Kelly, which was most likely the one thing guaranteed to push her stalker over the edge.</p><p>\u201cThe redneck code, cowboys,\u201d Natches drawled. \u201cYou don\u2019t fuck the good girls unless you mean it. He doesn\u2019t rape them normally, he takes them anally. He\u2019s not serious \u2019bout them. And he\u2019s not going to \u2018dirty\u2019 a \u2018good girl.\u2019\u201d</p><p>It was sickening, and the truly horrifying part was it all made sense. There were unwritten rules sometimes, a code, a way of dealing with women. Good girls versus \u201cbad\u201d girls and the rules of engagement. This rapist was twisting those rules. Perverting them in ways guaranteed to give a sane man nightmares. He was targeting good girls, or his perception of a good girl.</p><p>And Kelly gave the impression of the perfect good girl. But she was his naughty girl. He had seen it in her eyes eight years ago; he saw it there now. She wasn\u2019t a fool, and she might very well be a virgin, but Rowdy knew that his naughty girl was in there, waiting for him. And he was going to claim her, love her, protect her.</p><p>No matter what it took.</p><p>\u201cRowdy, you start fooling with her and the bastard is going to come after her stronger,\u201d Natches pointed out. \u201cWe can control it if we use it, control him and take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only if he thinks Kelly isn\u2019t a \u2018good girl,\u2019\u201d Dawg injected. \u201cGood girls can tame the bad boys. Unless he thinks Rowdy is up to his past games with Kelly, it might not push him over the edge in time.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy stared back at his friends. He heard the question in Dawg\u2019s voice, the suspicion. He leaned forward, bracing his arms on the gas tank as he watched them. He ignored the tightening, low in his stomach, the vague disquiet he felt at the thought of sharing Kelly. Of allowing his cousins to touch her, to hold her. He had waited for six years, ever since she turned eighteen, for the chance to show her just how much pleasure he could give her when he took her to his bed. He refused to remember the arousal she inspired two years before that. You didn\u2019t lust after babies, and sixteen-year-old, wide-eyed virgins were just that. Babies. But the minute she turned eighteen, he had known his days of freedom were numbered.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t changed.\u201d He stared back at them with an edge of humor, of determination, as he ignored the odd, unfamiliar tightening in his chest. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Snorts of wry amusement met his question.</p><p>\u201cYeah right, and pigs started flying over the lake when it happened.\u201d Natches laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting on you, Rowdy, you know that. You think that little girl would have stayed unclaimed if any of us had changed over the years?\u201d</p><p>They were unique, maybe. Sexual fulfillment and pleasure wasn\u2019t a game. It was something they took seriously, something they worked at. They all cared for Kelly, in different degrees. She was Rowdy\u2019s life. But the others, hell, they loved her too, and they always would.</p><p>Loving Kelly himself didn\u2019t change that. He\u2019d kill any other man who dared touch her, but he hoped, prayed, he wasn\u2019t wrong about Kelly and the fact that her needs would mirror his own.</p><p>The need was an enigma, even to the three men. Maybe they were too close, left on their own too much as teenagers\u2014who the hell knew. They didn\u2019t question it, they didn\u2019t fight it. If Kelly didn\u2019t want it, then it was a no-go, but he had a feeling about Kelly. She was a little sex kitten waiting to purr, and they were ready to stroke her.</p><p>So why was he suddenly tensing at the thought of Dawg and Natches inspiring that pleasure, that need within her?</p><p>He nodded slowly. She was his; there was no contest there. He would fight any man for her, even a friend. But here, there was no need to fight. Dawg and Natches didn\u2019t own her heart, Rowdy did. And the pleasure he knew the three of them could bring her outweighed the subtle warning shifting through his chest.</p><p>\u201cWill she agree?\u201d Dawg asked the hardest question to answer.</p><p>\u201cBefore the attack, I would have said yes.\u201d Rowdy sighed roughly. \u201cNow, who knows?\u201d He shook his head before wiping his hand over his face in a gesture of frustration. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. It will have to be her decision.\u201d</p><p>They nodded in reply.</p><p>\u201cWe get her over the attack first, take care of the attacker, then see where we go from there,\u201d Rowdy said. \u201cShe\u2019s not ignorant of the rumors, she suspects what\u2019s coming. But\u201d\u2014he swallowed tightly\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s going to be scared now. And for that alone, I\u2019ll kill the bastard.\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Ray stepped into the bar the next evening, several hours after Rowdy called to say he wouldn\u2019t be home for dinner after all, with the excuse that he had to take care of business. Ray feared that somehow Rowdy felt he couldn\u2019t come home. And he wasn\u2019t having that. That was Rowdy\u2019s home, no matter what was going on, and he needed the boy to know that.</p><p>Ray hadn\u2019t been in a bar in over ten years. Not since he started dating Maria. He had known her forever. She and her husband had been regulars at the marina, their boat docked close to the office. Hell, during their younger days, when pleasure had been all that mattered, he and James, Maria\u2019s husband, had shared Maria at one time. Once, long ago, Maria should have belonged to him, but his own ignorance had been Ray\u2019s downfall.</p><p>That was how Ray knew his son had come by his darker passions naturally, how he knew what awaited Kelly if she became his son\u2019s lover. And yeah, he knew Rowdy would never hurt her, but he also had seen the horror the girl had been through. Kelly was a warm, vibrant girl, just as her mother was, with a capacity to love that would humble any man. The thought of Rowdy tarnishing that love with his games, as Ray had once tarnished Maria\u2019s love for him, scared the hell out of him.</p><p>Ray\u2019s first wife, Layne, had been an aloof woman. He\u2019d cared for her though, loved her in a lot of ways, and the child they had together was a fine man. Ray knew that. But he was a man, in every sense of the word.</p><p>Ray stared around the smoky establishment, looking for the boy. Rowdy was sitting alone at a far corner, a beer bottle between his hands, his head lowered. The weight of the world was settled on his son\u2019s shoulders, and Ray understood why. Rowdy came home expecting open arms and found a mess instead.</p><p>Ray stopped by the bar and purchased a bottle of Jack Daniels, snagged two glasses, and made his way across the room. It was time to talk man-to-man, with no shame. That called for an iron backbone. Or plenty of whisky.</p><p>He slammed the bottle on the table as Rowdy lifted his gaze. Deep green eyes spat with fury, blazing from a sun-darkened, roughly hewn face. Yep, the boy was pissed off, clear down to his bones, and Ray didn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>He pulled out a chair and sat down.</p><p>\u201cSome things just call for a good drunk,\u201d he said heavily, uncapping the whisky and pouring two small glasses full. \u201cChildbirth. Your son\u2019s first date. Your daughter\u2019s near rape.\u201d His throat tightened with the pain as he tossed back the dark liquid and poured another shot of courage. \u201cAnd when a man screws up because he feels helpless, and hurts the people he loves the most.\u201d</p><p>He stared straight into Rowdy\u2019s dark eyes, feeling his son\u2019s pain as though it were his own.</p><p>Ray sighed. \u201cI swore to her I wouldn\u2019t tell you. And it\u2019s weighed bad on me ever since. While she was all doped up on the pain medication, and hysterical, she told her mom about what happened at the airport with you before you left that last year. She loves you. Always has. We\u2019ve known that.\u201d He swallowed tightly. \u201cAnd I knew how bad you wanted her.\u201d He paused, glancing away for a long second before pulling his gaze back to his son\u2019s. \u201cI never told you how much pride I had in you when you walked away, did I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He saw his son\u2019s surprise.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t figure you knew why I\u2019d left.\u201d Rowdy leaned back in his chair before picking up the whisky and throwing it back. He grimaced but held the burn of it.</p><p>\u201cI knew.\u201d Ray sighed heavily. \u201cI knew when you were twenty-two and as though overnight, she turned from a clumsy little urchin into a woman-child. I saw your face the day you realized it.\u201d</p><p>He watched the flush that rose over Rowdy\u2019s face, the discomfort.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a kid.\u201d He cleared his throat uncomfortably. \u201cShe\u2019s not a kid anymore, Dad. She\u2019s twenty-four, and a grown woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were and still are a man.\u201d Ray shook his head wearily before sipping at the whisky. \u201cA good man. One any father could be proud of. You didn\u2019t touch her, you did what you had to do and didn\u2019t make any excuses or cast any blame. Though you could have. You left your home because of the girl\u2014many men would have resented her. You would have been well within your rights to have protested how much Maria and I spoiled her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me that then,\u201d Rowdy grunted. \u201cShe kept stealing my damned shirts. She still does it. I should have made you throw both Kelly and Maria out.\u201d</p><p>A grin tugged at his son\u2019s lips. Ray shook his head. Rowdy was willing to forgive, no questions asked. And Ray didn\u2019t know if he could have been as gracious if someone had hid something so important from him.</p><p>Ray cleared his throat again.</p> <p>\u201cI should have told you.\u201d He rolled the glass between his fingers, staring at it rather than his son. \u201cBut I knew you\u2019d get home one way or the other and I wasn\u2019t sure Kelly could face that. She needed time to put the attack into perspective before she faced what was between the two of you.\u201d Damn, he needed another drink.</p><p>He poured another, aware of the way his son watched him, his eyes narrowed, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cHunger like that goes beyond lust, Dad,\u201d Rowdy finally sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve fought it for too long. I don\u2019t know what it is yet. I don\u2019t know how deep it goes. I know I came back for her.\u201d He shook his head when Ray started to speak. \u201cHear me out. I had no intentions of living in that house, of breaking so much as one of your rules, but that bastard\u2019s still out there.\u201d Ray\u2019s gut clenched. \u201cI\u2019ll camp outside her bedroom window if I have to, but you won\u2019t keep me away from her.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy leaned forward, his arms braced on the table, his fists clenched. Ray looked away from his son for long moments, wondering what he was supposed to say. Hell, he felt tired and helpless and not sure how to defend those he loved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been checking into it?\u201d Ray knew he had. Rowdy had spent the afternoon at the police department before he met up with his cousins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been checking into it.\u201d Rowdy poured himself another shot. \u201cI talked Betty Cline into letting me see the hospital records, and the sheriff gave me everything they had on the other girls. He\u2019s calling them. He doesn\u2019t call Kelly. He\u2019s local, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>For a second, fear sliced through Ray. If the bastard was local, then he wouldn\u2019t have to call Kelly. He could watch her. Anytime, anywhere.</p><p>Then pride suffused Ray. Hell, that was his boy. Hard-eyed, determined, and ready to fight. He was more man than Ray had ever imagined. Rowdy wasn\u2019t drinking himself silly because Kelly had been attacked, but instead, he was plotting and planning justice. It was enough to make a father proud.</p><p>Ray breathed in hard. He had discussed this with Maria earlier, knew what he was about to do was hard on her; it would be harder on Kelly.</p><p>\u201cCome back home, boy,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m a damned fool when I get riled and we both know it. That\u2019s your home. As much as it is mine. And you\u2019re my kid. I want you there.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cThe duffel bag is still on the bike. I was coming back tonight anyway.\u201d</p><p>Ray cleared his throat again. \u201cI trust you, Son.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s face changed then. If Ray thought it was hard before, it was more so now. Rowdy leaned forward, his eyes meeting Ray\u2019s straight on.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine, Dad.\u201d He kept his voice low, fierce. \u201cAny other time I would have never disrespected your rules or your home. But I won\u2019t pull back now. I won\u2019t lose her because some bastard tried to destroy her. And I won\u2019t play footsie under the table because of your sensibilities. Do you understand that?\u201d</p> <p>Anger flared in Ray. He rubbed his hand over his lower face before breathing out roughly. \u201cHell. Fine. Whatever. But\u201d\u2014he glared back at the boy\u2014\u201cyou don\u2019t play with that girl, Rowdy. You better be damned serious before you end up having sex with her. Son or no son, I taught you respect. She\u2019s not one of those little tramps you, Natches, and Dawg screwed with when you were younger.\u201d</p><p>It was a warning he\u2019d made when he first realized how sexual his son was. Good girls were solid gold. A good girl understood responsibility, values, and herself. A woman like that wasn\u2019t a toy, she was a partner.</p><p>\u201cI know how to treat a woman, Dad,\u201d Rowdy grunted. \u201cAll women. Not just Kelly.\u201d</p><p>Unlike Ray\u2019s generation, Rowdy didn\u2019t differ how he treated women in regards to their sexuality. One didn\u2019t deserve less respect, or more, for the amount of experience they had in bed. Rowdy had argued that with his father many times. But love...that made a difference, and Ray knew it. And he knew his son was learning it.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll come home?\u201d Ray\u2019s throat was tight with emotion. Damn, he hated that. Hated knowing there was more he should say and not knowing how to say it.</p><p>Rowdy looked over at him, his expression somber, his eyes, that deep sea green, serious and thoughtful. \u201cI missed you too, Dad,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>If that knot in his throat could have gotten tighter, it would have. Ray swallowed, then tried again. \u201cI love you, boy.\u201d His voice was so rasping he was ashamed of it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m damned proud of you. Damned proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Dad.\u201d That was his boy. Equal parts hellion and warrior but never afraid to say the words. \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of you, too.\u201d</p><p>He poured the glasses full again; they toasted each other and settled down for a serious drunk. Hell, Ray had been waiting on this day for nearly thirty years. There just wasn\u2019t anything like having that first good drunk with your son, and knowing it meant something. Meant something damned fine.</p><p>Kelly heard the Harley coming up the drive with her stepfather\u2019s truck as the clock flipped over to two in the morning. Her mother had been pacing the house, muttering to herself, worry creasing her brow.</p><p>Maria turned to Kelly, her eyes dark as she watched her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Maria asked, her voice soft, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake.\u201d Kelly felt like snarling the words. \u201cMom, have you and Ray lost your minds?\u201d Sometimes Kelly thought the attack had been more traumatic on them in a lot of ways. Kelly was never really certain how she felt about it. Frightened, yes. Terrified sometimes. Knowing her attacker was still out there kept her nerves on edge.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always wanted you.\u201d Maria had never been comfortable with that. Kelly had known it, though they never talked about it. Just as her mother knew Kelly had always wanted Rowdy. It was like some odd fact of life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a little girl anymore,\u201d she sighed, curling up on the sofa, watching her mother pace the living room as the vehicles shut off. \u201cYou know they\u2019re both drunk, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>One of Rowdy\u2019s friends had called from the bar. He hadn\u2019t been too sober himself, warning them that the two men were heading home, thankfully being driven by friends rather than driving themselves.</p><p>\u201cRay hasn\u2019t been drunk since before we got married.\u201d A smile curved her mother\u2019s lips, and Kelly swore she looked a little too sensual to suit her. A daughter shouldn\u2019t see things like that, she thought with a burst of humor.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s drunk now.\u201d She winced as it sounded like a load of bricks fell on the porch.</p><p>\u201cHell boy, I thought you were holding me up.\u201d Ray\u2019s voice drifted into the house.</p><p>\u201cThought you were holding me up.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s laughter was muffled.</p><p>Maria moved for the doorway and pulled it open with a quick jerk as Kelly rose from the couch to stand just inside the living room.</p><p>The two men were attempting to hold each other up as they paused in the doorway to get their bearings. Rowdy\u2019s expression was relaxed, his gaze a little heavy lidded and so darned sexy he took her breath.</p><p>As her eyes met his, a slow, sexy smile curved his lips and made her knees weak. He gripped his dad\u2019s arm tighter and led him inside the house. Neither of them were too steady on their feet.</p><p>\u201cMaria, he\u2019s a lousy drunk,\u201d Rowdy grunted as his father threw his arm over Maria\u2019s shoulder and planted a loud, smacking kiss on her cheek. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even make it through the first bottle.\u201d</p><p>Kelly wrapped her arms across her chest, a smile tugging at her lips as Rowdy winked at her.</p><p>\u201cHe never did, Douglas, you just keep forgetting,\u201d her mother chastised him firmly.</p><p>Rowdy winced. \u201cThat\u2019s not my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what your birth record has. I didn\u2019t see a Rowdy there anywhere, Douglas.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy gave her a mock glare. \u201cYou\u2019re not being nice to me, Maria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my job,\u201d she pointed out calmly. \u201cNow move your big feet out of the way so I can get him upstairs. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be ashamed later,\u201d Ray piped in as she led him to the stairs. \u201cHell. We had fun, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d Maria laughed softly.</p><p>Their voices lowered as they moved away, and finally disappeared. A few minutes later the door at the back of the hallway closed and everything was silent.</p><p>Kelly watched Rowdy. His hair was still too short. The spiked military cut suited him, but she had loved his long hair when he was younger. The way it framed his face, emphasized his green eyes. He looked like a fallen angel come to tempt mortal women when his hair was long. Short, he looked like the warrior she knew he had to be. A fighter, a Marine. Tall and tough and hard.</p><p>He turned to her, placing his hand over his chest, the dark blue material of his cotton shirt stretching across his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cKelly, darlin\u2019, you look like an angel standing there.\u201d His smile was a tad goofy and too damned sexy.</p><p>Unfortunately, she knew better. She was wearing another of his shirts, one she had stolen the last time he was home. A pair of loose sweatpants and socks that bunched at her ankles. She looked messy and frightened, and she knew it.</p><p>She licked her lips nervously. Facing him after what had happened at the boat earlier wasn\u2019t easy. She wasn\u2019t ashamed, but neither was she comfortable with some of the feelings Rowdy caused to burn inside her. \u201cI missed you, Rowdy,\u201d she whispered, trying to still the trembling of her lips. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>His expression sobered as he moved toward her slowly. She forced herself to stay still, not to retreat. But he was so big, and powerful. Strong. The memory of hard hands holding her down, a rough voice muttering in her ear as her face was pressed into the pillow, haunted her.</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s my hug?\u201d He stood in front of her, his arms at his sides, his eyes dark and glittering with hunger.</p><p>He still wanted her. She could see the memories of the heated exchange they\u2019d had earlier in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She swallowed tightly, glancing away as her hands tightened on her arms. God, what was wrong with her. She had nearly bared her breasts for him, but now she felt as uncertain, as frightened as she had the moment she stepped into the houseboat.</p><p>\u201cJust a hug, Kelly-baby?\u201d He whispered the words, his lips quirking gently. \u201cI dream of your hugs, darlin\u2019, just as much as I dream of your kiss.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared back at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d He reached out, his arm lifting slowly, his fingers reaching out to lift a strand of curls from her shoulder.</p><p>She glanced quickly at where he held her hair, biting at her lower lip as she tried to still the pounding of her heart. She had dreamed of his touch for so long, waited for him, longed for him. Oh God, this isn\u2019t fair, she wailed silently. She had waited for this for so long, now her own insecurities were eating her alive. It didn\u2019t matter that her therapist had warned her to expect this. She felt as frightened, as off balance as she had the first months after the attack.</p> <p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d Her throat tightened as she fought herself, the fear and need warring inside her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s real easy, baby,\u201d he crooned, his dark velvet voice washing over her. \u201cYou just lift your arms and put them around my neck.\u201d He let go of her hair, fingers curling around her wrists as he lifted her arms, urging them up until they curled around his neck. \u201cThen you come up real close to me, so I can hug you back.\u201d His arms went around her, slowly, so slowly, pulling her against him until her head rested on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThere we go.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking, but was it fear or something more? She didn\u2019t know what she was feeling, didn\u2019t know how to assimilate the sensations and emotions washing through her.</p><p>\u201cI came home for you, Kelly,\u201d he reminded her, his breath caressing her ear as she jerked against him. \u201cI came home to touch you, to taste you, to claim you. Do you know what I would have done if I had known you were home when I pulled in yesterday morning?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, a jerky movement as a small whimper left her lips. He felt so good. A man shouldn\u2019t feel this good, powerful yet protective, hot and so blessed sexy.</p><p>\u201cI would have come to your room and kissed you awake. I would have seen your pretty eyes opening, knowing it\u2019s me beside you, my lips touching yours. I want that real bad, Kelly. Even though I know if Dad caught me he\u2019d skin me alive.\u201d He breathed in roughly; the feel of his chest rasping against her breasts sent a shudder racing through her. \u201cNow,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI really don\u2019t care if he does skin me.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened against him, needing to draw away, needing to get closer to him. God, she hated this. Hated the fear holding her back, hated not knowing, not understanding the emotions raging through her mind and body.</p><p>\u201cRowdy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He stilled her protest as he rubbed his head against hers. \u201cJust settle here against me, baby. Let me hold you for a minute; let me know you\u2019re okay. Just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not okay.\u201d Her hands clenched in the fabric of his shirt as she finally admitted it to herself. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Rowdy. I\u2019m so scared.\u201d She pressed her head against his chest, the words slipping free after nearly a year of burying them. She was terrified.</p> <p>\u201cI know, baby.\u201d He kissed her head, his hands running over her back. \u201cBut I won\u2019t let you be scared of me.\u201d</p><p>She heard the pain in his voice, felt it tighten her chest. No, Rowdy would never hurt her, but fear was an insidious disease, and fighting it took more courage than she thought she had.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to take this nice and easy,\u201d he crooned. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go upstairs and you\u2019re going to sleep, baby. I\u2019m going to lie right beside you so you know no one can get to you, no one can hurt you as long as I\u2019m there. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my bed?\u201d She jerked back, staring up at him. \u201cRay will skin us both alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad will deal with it.\u201d His expression hardened, determination glittering in his eyes. \u201cHe already is. You\u2019re not sleeping; you\u2019re not eating. We\u2019re going to change that, starting tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are we now?\u201d The high-handedness in his voice pricked at her.</p><p>\u201cKelly.\u201d He tilted his head, staring down at her, a smile quirking at his lips. \u201cAre you going to fight me, baby? Really? Remember the last fight we got into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put another snake in my drawer, and I\u2019ll start calling you Douglas,\u201d she sniped. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d threaten me like that.\u201d</p> <p>He smirked, his gaze drowsy, his expression so sensual it was enough to make her panties damp. And they were damp. Yeah, she was scared spitless at times at the thought of touching him, having him touch her, but he could make her so wet, so fast, that it wasn\u2019t even surprising anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to lie beside you, that\u2019s all,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep, then I\u2019ll lie on the floor. But I\u2019ll be there, Kelly. Will you trust me enough to let me be there? Remember yesterday morning, baby? You trusted me enough to almost bare those pretty little nipples for me. Keep trusting me, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>She was breathing roughly; the realization of it forced her to try to regulate it. She hated this weakness, this fear. Even the sessions with the psychologist hadn\u2019t been able to erase it.</p><p>\u201cI would trust you with my life, Rowdy,\u201d she whispered, knowing she did.</p><p>\u201cCome on then.\u201d His arms wrapped around her as he led her to the stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s go on up and see if we can get some sleep. I don\u2019t know about you, Kelly, but I\u2019m dead tired.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had nightmares in months, she thought as he turned out the lights and led her upstairs. She wasn\u2019t sleeping well, but when she did sleep, she wasn\u2019t waking screaming as she did in those first months. It should be safe. She could have something she had always dreamed of. Rowdy in her bed, sharing his warmth with her. Maybe even holding her. Surely she could handle that?</p><p>SIX</p><p>Kelly wasn\u2019t really surprised when Rowdy stopped at his bedroom to get a pair of soft, gray cotton sweats similar to her own. He slept in the nude, so the concession he was making wasn\u2019t lost on her.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d He led her to her bedroom door, opening it carefully before stepping in ahead of her.</p><p>Kelly drew in a deep, sustaining breath, battling the confusing emotions racing through her. She had waited for Rowdy for so long that she wasn\u2019t certain how to adapt to this abrupt shift between his careful distance and his sudden closeness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she answered as she stepped in behind him, noticing the tension in his body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change in the bathroom.\u201d He closed the door behind her.</p><p>Kelly fisted her hands in her T-shirt as she bit her lip, fighting to hold back her nerves as Rowdy disappeared into the other room. She gazed around her bedroom, taking in the frilly curtains over the dark shades, the white lace of her comforter. It wasn\u2019t exactly a man\u2019s room.</p><p>Yet, Rowdy hadn\u2019t flinched at it. He had filled it, overpowered it, and pulled all focus toward him. Not that she had expected anything less.</p><p>She was still standing in the middle of the room when he came from the bathroom long minutes later. She couldn\u2019t stop her gasp, couldn\u2019t help the leap of her pulse at the sight of him.</p><p>He was obviously aroused. In those pants, there was no way to hide just how well-endowed he was either. She swallowed nervously as her gaze moved over hard, flexing abs, sun darkened and powerful, to a wide chest and an expression blazing with hunger.</p><p>She took a step back, watching as his eyes narrowed on her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby. We passed this point.\u201d His voice was rough, deep, a rasp of black velvet across her raw senses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her hands knotted in the material of the shirt as she felt the flesh between her thighs heating further, dampening.</p><p>And her breasts. They felt heavy, swollen, her nipples almost painful with their sensitivity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can sleep with you, Rowdy.\u201d She fought to keep her breathing under control. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can stand it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue with her. He stepped over to the bed and pulled back the blankets before staring back at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never hurt you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCome on, get into bed. Surely you\u2019re not going to let something like a hard-on scare you off, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t just a hard-on. It was Rowdy\u2019s hard-on, and she was dying for it with the same intensity that she was terrified of it. Not because she was afraid he would hurt her, but because she was afraid of her own emotions, her own desires.</p><p>But when he extended his hand to her, she was helpless. Flushed, uncertain, she moved to the bed, crawling into it stiffly and lying down as he moved in beside her and reached over to turn out the small bed lamp.</p><p>And there he was, lying on his side beside her as she stared up at the ceiling, fighting to keep from touching him, from begging him to touch her.</p><p>\u201cI told Dad I came back for you, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to his eyes, barely making out the glittering depths in the darkness of the room as she felt his hand move, felt it as it moved gently to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d She couldn\u2019t breathe. His hands was like a flame through the material of the shirt she wore, pressing against her stomach as she felt her womb spasm with need.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice and dark,\u201d he whispered then. \u201cLike a sweet, warm dream. Your dream, Kelly. What would you do in your dreams? What would I do to you?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the tiny moan that fell from her lips. She had many, many dreams of what she wanted Rowdy to do to her, with her. The things she would do to him, if she only knew how.</p><p>\u201cThis is dangerous.\u201d Her voice sounded strangled in the darkness around them as her hand gripped his wrist.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d The question had her breath catching on a sob.</p><p>\u201cWith my life,\u201d she answered readily. And she did.</p><p>\u201cTrust me to touch you. To bring you pleasure, Kelly. Let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved, his fingers bunching in the shirt to drag it over her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll hear me.\u201d Her hands clenched harder around his wrist. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you do to me, Rowdy. You can\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I want to do to those pretty breasts?\u201d He shocked her to silence again. \u201cI want to take this shirt off you, Kelly. I want to bare them and touch your hard little nipples with my fingers, then with my mouth. I want to show you how good just a touch can be.\u201d</p><p>The material of her shirt began to rise as she tried to draw enough oxygen into her lungs to protect the incredible sensuality of his statement.</p><p>\u201cBut you might get loud,\u201d he whispered with a thread of amusement. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019d like you loud, Kelly. I want to hear you screaming in pleasure, begging me for more and more until you know you can\u2019t take more, but you want it anyway. And that\u2019s when you need a harder touch, more sensation. That\u2019s when pleasure becomes almost painful and when the pain becomes ecstasy.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered as his hand moved against bare flesh and the shirt rasped over her hard nipples as he drew it slowly from her.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he crooned. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you naked before the night\u2019s out, baby. I\u2019m going to hold you against me and feel the sweet, sleek warmth of your body. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped the hard swell of her breast as her breath rocked from her body and she arched, jerking against the touch as a million sensations began to riot through her.</p><p>She had to bite her lip to keep from crying out.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty,\u201d he sighed, looming over her, his gaze on her face despite the warmth of his fingers caressing the globe of her breast. \u201cWhat will you do when I get my fingers on those tight little nipples? Or my mouth between your soft thighs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowdy, please\u201d\u2014her voice was a breath of sound as she shuddered beneath him\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. Just lie here with me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet me feel you come for me. Just here in a bit, baby. Let me touch your sweet body and show you how good it can feel. Then you can sleep, right here against me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Let her come for him? He was going to make her come? Here? In her bed?</p><p>Then she almost did come. His finger began to circle her nipple, drawing an incredible circle of fire around it as his head lowered, his lips barely touching hers.</p><p>\u201cGet ready,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s see how much you like this.\u201d</p> <p>His thumb and forefinger gripped the violently sensitive peak and exerted just enough pressure to throw her into a maelstrom of sensations. Fire tore from her nipple to her clit, surging to her womb as she felt it flex in hunger.</p><p>Her lips parted on a fractured cry that he took into his own mouth. His lips covered hers easily, gently, absorbing her cry as they moved against her with restrained hunger.</p><p>His fingers were tugging at her nipples, both of them now, shifting against her until he rose half over her, surrounding her with his heat.</p><p>\u201cGod, I would have loved to have heard that cry,\u201d he groaned against her lips.</p><p>Kelly could feel the tremors racing through her body, feel the soft wetness gathering between her thighs. Her hands lifted to his shoulders, her fingers pressing into the hard muscle as his lips smoothed over hers again.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to feel your nipple in my mouth,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want to slide my hand to your pretty thighs and see how wet and soft you are there. How much could you stand, baby, before you screamed again?\u201d</p><p>Not much. She was weak. She was entranced by the pleasure tearing through her body and she could do nothing to stop it.</p><p>\u201cI want you naked, Kelly,\u201d he breathed against her lips. \u201cWill you be naked for me, baby?\u201d</p><p>One hand moved to her hips, curling into the waistband of her sweatpants as he began to push them down her thighs.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d Was she scared? She was terrified, but not of being hurt. She couldn\u2019t make sense of the sensations racing through her, pleasure and fear, confusion and dazed hunger. They were flooding her, drowning her with conflicting needs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just playing, Kelly.\u201d He moved back, sliding the pants down her legs before pulling them free of her body.</p> <p>She was naked now, exposed if it hadn\u2019t been for the darkness of the room.</p><p>He lifted her hand again, kissing it before he surprised her by laying it over her lips.</p><p>\u201cShhh. We don\u2019t want anyone to hear.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think he really gave a damn if anyone did hear, but she pressed her fingers to her lips, certain she would die of embarrassment if her mother or Ray heard her pleasure.</p><p>She saw the flash of his teeth in a wicked grin before his head lowered.</p><p>It was a good thing she covered her mouth before his lips touched her aching nipple, before they surrounded the sensitive peak and drew it into his mouth. Because her cry was barely muffled with one hand as the other flew to his head.</p><p>Her back arched, and she swore flames burned over her body as he began to suckle at her. He wasn\u2019t slow and easy. He didn\u2019t ease her into it, he didn\u2019t tease her into it, he devoured her, and she was helpless beneath it.</p><p>\u201cGod. Baby.\u201d He buried his head between her breasts then, his breathing rough and hard as his hands moved down her waist, her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re going to my head faster than the whisky did.\u201d</p> <p>She needed more. She pressed against him, certain she was going to scream for more if he didn\u2019t touch her again.</p><p>\u201cEasy. Easy.\u201d His breathing was a rough groan as his lips moved along her chest, her collarbone. \u201cCome here, baby. Let\u2019s ease this fire before I lose my sanity.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to him as he moved her hand from her lips and covered them with his own. Then his other hand went between her thighs.</p><p>Kelly jerked against him, her hand latching onto his wrist as she felt his fingers part the wet folds.</p><p>\u201cOh God, you\u2019re bare.\u201d His voice was tortured as his fingers moved over flesh despite her hand gripping him. \u201cSweet heaven have mercy.\u201d</p><p>His thumb flicked over her clit as his fingers parted the swollen flesh.</p><p>\u201cEasy. We\u2019re going to do this quick, baby. If we don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to end up taking you here, in your bed, and then we\u2019ll both be screaming.\u201d</p><p>His lips covered hers again as his thumb moved along the outer edge of the sensitive bud of flesh as his fingers began to caress the greedy opening.</p><p>She was crying out beneath his lips. One arm latched around his neck as the nails of the other bit into his wrist. It didn\u2019t deter him. His thumb caressed, rotated, then pressed against her with diabolical results.</p><p>Stars exploded before her eyes as she jerked beneath him, shuddering violently as pleasure whipped over her nerve endings and devastatingly clashed through her senses.</p><p>She could feel her juices rushing from her sex, feel his fingers rubbing through them, intensifying her climax as a growl vibrated against her lips, covering her fractured scream.</p><p>And she was lost. She was distantly aware of his release, the movement of his free hand, the feel of his semen washing over thigh, which only intensified her own pleasure and egged at her fears. Not her fear of his touch, or the fear of being with him. But the overwhelming fear that there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that she could handle him.</p><p>Kelly eased into sleep within minutes of Rowdy cleaning them both up and tucking the blankets around her. He felt her relax against him, felt the soft sigh that left her lips. Moving slowly, he eased the blanket further over her shoulders, feeling her head on his arm, her silky hair against his chest as he held her. It was killing him, the pain, the fear he knew she had to have endured. He could feel his heart breaking in his chest even as a killing rage burned in his soul.</p><p>She was his. She had been his as long as he had known her and by God he wasn\u2019t letting her go. She knew him, knew he would cut out his own heart before he\u2019d hurt her\u2014that trust was still within her. If it weren\u2019t, she would never have been able to climax so sweetly for him, or sleep in his arms, to allow him to hold her, her sweet body tucked so close against his own. Naked.</p><p>He stared into the dimly lit bedroom, his eyes narrowed, his mind working. Whoever dared to hurt her, to stalk her, wouldn\u2019t be breathing for long. He wouldn\u2019t be breathing two seconds past the time Rowdy learned who he was. And that was a silent promise, a vow he made to Kelly. She would never be hurt again.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Maria opened Kelly\u2019s door the next morning, not really expecting what she saw. Ray had warned her the night before, but he had been drunk, amorous, so she hadn\u2019t really taken him seriously. Perhaps she should have\u2014the shock wouldn\u2019t have been so great.</p><p>She was used to coming in to find Kelly napping in the large wingback chair on the other side of the room, the television droning in the background. The room was silent now, and Rowdy was staring at her through slitted eyes from the bed.</p><p>He was wrapped around her sleeping daughter like a living vine. Kelly lay on her side, her back pressed against Rowdy\u2019s front, her head sheltered beneath his chin. One hard leg lay over her daughter\u2019s fragile ones beneath the blankets, his arms surrounding her as her hair tangled over them. He was bent over her, wrapped around her, and Kelly was sleeping peacefully.</p><p>It was more than obvious that they both were naked. Kelly was her baby; seeing her sleeping in a man\u2019s arms, especially Rowdy\u2019s, was disconcerting. She had expected the closeness they had before her marriage to Ray to develop, but not in this way. As siblings, very close friends, but never this. This terrified her.</p><p>The sexual tension that vibrated from the two whenever they were together had always worried her, deeply. She had been terrified for years that Rowdy would break her daughter\u2019s heart. What she saw now filled her with conflicting emotions. Rowdy would protect Kelly, and, ultimately, that was Maria\u2019s greatest wish. Her daughter\u2019s protection. But what he could do to her baby\u2019s heart was almost more than she could bear.</p><p>As she stared at the two, Rowdy\u2019s frown darkened, his gaze narrowing at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>Ray had warned her, she had known herself what was coming.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the marina.\u201d She mouthed the words back at him, hoping her daughter would continue to sleep.</p><p>He nodded with a subtle shift of his head, never really moving. Content. That was how he appeared. Content where he was, holding Kelly close.</p><p>She backed slowly from the room, her hand lingering on the door panel for a moment as she fought the worry building within her. Maybe Ray was right. Maybe Rowdy was all Kelly truly needed to get past the attack. Maria hoped so. The shadows in her daughter\u2019s eyes broke her heart, but even more the worry that whoever had attacked Kelly would return terrified her. Until they caught him, Maria knew she would never sleep easy.</p><p>Kelly came awake slowly, her senses alive, her skin tingling at the warmth that surrounded her. There was no momentary fear, no surprise. Rowdy was holding her. She could feel him wrapped around her, spooned against her as though she had been made for the position.</p><p>She was aware of something else as well as she lay there, her body tucked into his. He was hard. His erection pressed against the crevice of her buttocks, a thick intruder, waiting. She bit her lip, stiffening in his arms, her muscles tightening. Pleasure and fear combined inside her. And the pleasure was stronger. The culmination of what felt like a lifetime of fantasies and needs rose inside her, blocking the fear, pushing it back until nothing mattered except Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby.\u201d His voice was drowsy, calm. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hard-on.\u201d He snuggled against her, tucking her closer to his chest as her hands gripped the bedspread and she fought to level her breathing.</p><p>\u201cI hate to say this,\u201d she wheezed. \u201cThat\u2019s not a hard-on, Rowdy. That\u2019s a baseball bat.\u201d</p><p>His snorted chuckle vibrated against her back, and only pressed his erection closer against her rear. She stiffened further.</p><p>\u201cWant me to move? I\u2019m pretty comfortable right now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she just bet he was. She forced herself to breathe deeply, to push back the panic threatening, building in her mind. This was Rowdy and he wouldn\u2019t hurt her now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking it to death,\u201d he murmured and he rubbed his chin against her hair. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf your baseball bat?\u201d She fought for humor rather than hysteria. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Rowdy, I hear you\u2019re pretty fond of it. Lots of practice and all.\u201d</p><p>She felt his hand move, his fingers running over hers, sending tingling spirals of heat to build beneath them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little minx,\u201d he growled at her ear, a velvet-soft sound that rippled through her senses. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d</p><p>A grin tugged at her lips at his chastising tone. She relaxed against him, feeling her body conform to his, settling against hard muscle and aroused heat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nice, remember?\u201d Her eyes closed as he chuckled at her back. It was an old argument going back years before. It usually occurred whenever she told him what lousy taste he had in women, and pointed out their faults in vivid detail.</p><p>\u201cI do remember.\u201d His lips smoothed over the top of her head, the caress sending trailing fingers of pleasure to wash through her body. The slightest caress, no matter how subtle, had the power to make her tremble. \u201cYou have a mean wit sometimes, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>She gave an amused snort at that. \u201cI just didn\u2019t care to tell you the truth, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>His girlfriends weren\u2019t exactly the kind of woman he brought home to dinner. As a matter of fact, he had never brought a woman home to dinner. Kelly would never have been able to tolerate that. She wondered if he had known that.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when you were seventeen, and you bought that scrap of material you called a bathing suit?\u201d he mused softly.</p><p>She remembered the bathing suit, bought specifically in the hope of teasing him past the control she always hated so much.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you noticed.\u201d She turned her head, staring up at him, close.</p><p>His eyes were darker, tiny pinpoints of emerald glittered in the sea green iris, mesmerizing her, filling her vision. And his lips. Her eyes darted to his lips, so close. And she knew how they felt rubbing against her own, firm and warm, stoking fires inside her she hadn\u2019t imagined existed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d he whispered, his voice rougher now. \u201cAll summer. I think my cock still has the imprint of my zipper on it.\u201d</p><p>His hand stroked up her arm, his palm creating a heated friction that had her nerves prickling with awareness. She could still feel his erection like heated iron resting against the crevice of her rear, but his lips drew her.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kiss me again, Rowdy? Anytime soon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d The seductive croon had a shiver racing through her.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Now would be a good time.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you want me to?\u201d His hand slid from her arm to her stomach and rested there.</p><p>She felt his fingers, long, broad, resting against her, with nothing between them. And they were moving, slowly easing above her hips, passing her abdomen until his hand rested on the bare flesh of her midriff.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d God, if he didn\u2019t kiss her she was going to die from the need of it. \u201cYou distracted me last night. I didn\u2019t get to feel it real good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy little Lolita.\u201d His lips lowered, brushed against hers. \u201cHow long have you been teasing me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I was nine?\u201d She breathed a laugh against his lips.</p><p>The first day she had seen him. He had been as handsome as sin and a god in her eyes when he saved her from a bully in that park.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I was fifteen. You were the sweetest little girl. Staring up at me with those big gray eyes so full of tears because that bully had taken your hair bow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you got my hair bow back.\u201d She was panting for breath, her lips brushing his with each word.</p><p>\u201cI got your hair bow back.\u201d</p> <p>He took her breath. His lips captured hers in an all too brief, fiery kiss. No tongue, no more than a taste of him on her lips before he drew back.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d She reached for him, needing more, aching for more. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>His fingers played against her midriff, rubbing in slow sensual circles, creating little starbursts of sensation that exploded in her sex. Her nipples were on fire, begging to be touched, caressed. His hands were so close, the heat of them warming the tight, aching mounds.</p><p>She stilled against him as his hips shifted against her rear once again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of you,\u201d she whispered, staring into his eyes, fighting to keep her own open. \u201cI\u2019ve never been scared of you, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d he whispered, his eyes darkening. \u201cI can see it in your eyes, in your face.\u201d A somber smile touched his lips. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay, baby, you won\u2019t be scared for long.\u201d</p><p>She opened her lips to speak, then stared at him in astonishment as he rolled from the bed and flashed her a wicked smile. A teasing smile, before bending over and picking up his discarded sweats. He pulled them over his legs, covering his nakedness and the full, engorged length of his erection.</p><p>Kelly rolled to her back, propping herself on her elbows and staring at him as he moved to the bottom of the bed. He was so obviously aroused it made her mouth water. His cock pressed against the sweatpants with implicit demand, a thick length of steel-hard flesh that she ached for.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being teased like that,\u201d she pouted. \u201cCome back here and kiss me properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve it yet.\u201d His voice was a dark croon, his expression arrogant, certain. Smug.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve it?\u201d Disbelief warred with amusement. \u201cI\u2019ve been of age for at least six years now, Rowdy. Ready, willing and able. And\u201d\u2014she stretched her legs out slowly, looking at him from beneath lowered lids\u2014\u201cI think I\u2019ve waited too long. You didn\u2019t give me a chance to fully enjoy it last night.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, a seductive droop of the eyelids, the exceptional green eyes glittering from between heavy black lashes.</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree.\u201d His voice lowered, his hands gripping the railed footboard of the bed, his fingers curling around it, clenching. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited too long, Kelly. Now, let\u2019s see how bad you want it.\u201d He winked slowly. \u201cBetter shower, baby, I think you\u2019re due at the marina this afternoon. I\u2019ll take you in on the Harley.\u201d</p><p>And just as easily as that he turned and sauntered to the bedroom door. He didn\u2019t look back, didn\u2019t pause. He opened the door and left the bedroom, his broad, bare shoulders straight and strong. Too damned sexy for his own good.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Mackay\u2019s Marina was one of the smaller ones, specializing in rentals and mechanical servicing. Some berths were leased out, and the attached restaurant and convenience store added to the overall \u201cone stop\u201d friendly atmosphere of the landing.</p><p>Mackay\u2019s Marina had begun with Rowdy\u2019s grandfather, Joseph Mackay, and then under Ray Mackay\u2019s guidance had turned into a thriving, yearlong enterprise. One he wanted to turn over to Rowdy as soon as his son was willing.</p><p>The bait shop and sporting goods section of the main buildings were separated from the store and restaurant by the main office. Kelly\u2019s mother had put in the convenience store and additional gas pumps after their marriage on the condition that part of the enterprise go to Kelly once they retired. It was an agreement Ray and Rowdy had accepted easily.</p><p>Kelly was ringing up the variety of goods that old man Tanner and his son Ricky had picked up, when she saw Rowdy and Dawg walk into the main room. Natches had just left a few minutes ago after spending nearly an hour flirting and straightening the shelves at the side of the room.</p><p>She would have been a fool not to notice that the careful restraint in his demeanor toward her had changed. He watched her now with a subtle interest; a promise unique to the Mackay boys. She knew their moves, and knew the instant he walked in the room that he was no longer simply watching over her as he and Dawg had done in the past year. The additional element of desire was no longer hidden from her.</p><p>\u201cKelly girl, you need to put these fishing rods on sale.\u201d Ken Tanner\u2019s scowl was fierce, his brown eyes eagle-bright. Wisps of gray hair stood on end over his head, and his lined face was normally fierce, though he had a heart of gold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Ray, Ken. But you know how he is. That will be $14.62.\u201d</p><p>She took the money from him, ignoring his son. Ricky was a shifty-eyed little prick who took pleasure in poking at others\u2019 weaknesses. Thankfully, he reined it in while his father was around.</p><p>As she counted out his change, she caught sight of Rowdy moving behind the counter while Dawg started straightening some of the higher shelves across the room. Dawg had spent his summers working at the marina before he left high school. For him, Rowdy, and Natches, it was almost automatic to work when they were hanging around.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe.\u201d She stiffened as Rowdy moved behind her, placing a hand on her shoulder as he leaned down to kiss the top of her head. \u201cTired yet?\u201d</p><p>She felt the flush that suffused her face as Ricky\u2019s gaze became frankly assessing and old man Tanner grinned in delight.</p><p>\u201cRowdy Mackay. Boy, it\u2019s about time you came home. You just visiting or staying?\u201d Ken\u2019s raspy voice boomed through the store.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ken. Ricky.\u201d He moved to the counter, shaking the gnarled hand reaching out to him. The older man\u2019s hand was a pale, weak extension when clasped in Rowdy\u2019s strong, darkly tanned hands. \u201cI\u2019m home to stay this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s about time.\u201d He nodded firmly, his knowing gaze shifting to Kelly for a long second, a hint of compassion entering his eyes. \u201cYou going to take care of our girl here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKen!\u201d Her face flamed hotter at the question as she chastised him.</p><p>\u201cLike all of us ain\u2019t watched you twitching around him since you were too young to know what a twitch was.\u201d He snorted, frowning back at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you be playing dumb, girl. Just \u2019cause I\u2019m old don\u2019t make me blind.\u201d</p><p>She ignored Rowdy\u2019s chuckle as she quickly bagged the items Ken had bought and handed them across the counter.</p><p>\u201cI hope you catch lots of fish, Ken,\u201d she gritted out between her clenched teeth, pasting a facsimile of a smile on her face.</p><p>She was as fond as she could be of the old man, but he wasn\u2019t one to mince words.</p><p>His snicker was amused, kindly. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the bait, girl. It\u2019s all in the bait.\u201d He nodded to Rowdy with one of the few smiles Kelly had ever seen out of him. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Ricky.\u201d He nudged at his son, heading toward the lake-side door. \u201cSee you later, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Ken.\u201d As he spoke, Kelly felt his hand settle in the small of her back, his fingers rubbing in tiny circles over the loose cotton shirt she wore.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d she hissed, turning on him as Ken and Ricky left the building, the glass door whishing shut behind them.</p><p>She pushed his hand away, propped her hands on her hips, and glared up at his smiling face as he crossed his arms over his chest and smiled wickedly back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to make me pout if you start refusing my pitiful advances, Kelly,\u201d he sighed. \u201cAnd here I stayed awake all night last night with a numb arm just so you could sleep comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s snicker was clearly heard.</p><p>\u201cDumb and dumber,\u201d she muttered, though she couldn\u2019t keep the smile from her face as he reached out to run the backs of his fingers over the side of her neck. Shivers raced through her at the small caress. And it wasn\u2019t fear. She could feel the pleasure suffusing her body, dampening the flesh between her thighs.</p><p>It was disconcerting. She had spent months with the fear that she would never be able to enjoy Rowdy\u2019s touch again. That the desires he had filled her with, the needs and fantasies, would be swamped with the fear. The knowledge that they were coming back, perhaps stronger than ever was at once nerve-racking and comforting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost closing time. I thought we\u2019d help you close up. Then we take all that Chinese food I have out in the cycle\u2019s saddlebag and have dinner before we head out on the lake.\u201d He pushed her hair back from her shoulder as he spoke, his fingers lingering on the shell of her ear for long seconds after he finished.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Dawg locking the lake-side doors and hanging up the Closed sign.</p><p>\u201cRay will skin you alive.\u201d She shook her head, though she couldn\u2019t still the smile on her lips. \u201cSummer hours are longer now, Rowdy. I still have an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Dad first.\u201d He moved back, his expression intent, sexy. \u201cBetter yet, Dawg can finish up for you. Come on, Kelly, sneak away with me.\u201d</p><p>Sneak away with him? How many times had she dreamed of hearing him say those words? She would have snuck out with him, anytime, any place.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Kelly.\u201d Dawg lent his approval to the idea. \u201cI\u2019ll close up shop here and help Ray and your mom outside before I leave.\u201d</p><p>As Rowdy\u2019s first cousin, and the oldest by several months, Dawg had usually led the pranks the Nauti Boys had gotten into. The three men had been hell on wheels through their high school years.</p><p>She breathed in deeply, her hands sliding from her hips to her jeans pockets as she glanced up at Rowdy again.</p><p>\u201cYou know you want to,\u201d he whispered with a wink. \u201cCome on, I even spent the day airing out the boat and getting her ready.\u201d</p><p>The Nauti Buoy was his pride and joy, not to mention his weekend home. He and his friends spent their summers on the water, normally in the houseboats they had acquired over the years. Their title, the Nauti Boys, had come as much from the names of their boats as from their sexual practices.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She gripped her courage with both hands and gave him a short nod. \u201cI haven\u2019t had Chinese in a while.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t eaten out much period, preferring to stay in the house when she was home rather than forcing herself to pretend a security she didn\u2019t feel. It terrified her, not knowing who her attacker was. If he was a friend or a stranger, someone she trusted or would have trusted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, his voice warm, approving as she moved past him, tugging at the hem of her oversized shirt before one of his big hands caught one of hers.</p><p>Warmth surrounded her fingers, fed into her bloodstream, and sent heat surging through her system. Adrenaline spiked the wave of warmth, fed it into her tightening nipples, her swollen clit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll catch you on the lake later, Dawg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call before I head out.\u201d Dawg nodded as they moved past him, his eyes narrowed, the brilliant green glittering behind the spiked lashes surrounding them. They held the same teasing warmth and sensual promise that Natches\u2019s had earlier.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She followed Rowdy as he moved through the main marina office, waving to her mother as he opened the door and escorted her through it. She wondered if she looked as confused as she felt.</p><p>Stilling her emotions and her equilibrium after waking up with him that morning had been hard enough. She had been nervous, her fingers shaking, her stomach clenching each time she thought of waking up beside him, feeling him surrounding her, his erection pressing into her rear. That had been the most disconcerting part. She should have been frightened. The psychologist had told her she would likely be frightened the first time she tried intimate relations after the near-rape. That the intimacy of allowing a man to touch her, to hold her, might be difficult to get through.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been. He had made her more aroused than frightened. And in ways, that was more frightening than the fear of his touch. Everyone had told her for months that being touched would be difficult for her, but being touched by Rowdy had been a dream come true.</p> <p>\u201cYou think too much sometimes,\u201d Rowdy announced as he collected the bags of Chinese food from the steel saddlebags mounted to the side of the motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cI can walk and chew gum at the same time too.\u201d She rolled her eyes at him, feeling his hand at the small of her back again.</p><p>In the past twenty-four hours he had touched her more than he had in the last ten years. Of course he hadn\u2019t been home for the better part of those ten years, but it wasn\u2019t as though the opportunity hadn\u2019t been there.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go on to college?\u201d he asked as they moved onto the docks. \u201cI expected you to head off right after high school.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged at the question. \u201cI took business classes at the tech school. You might get the marina when Ray and Mom retire, but the store and fuel supply are mine,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThey\u2019ll only grow as the traffic on the lake increases, and I wanted to be prepared for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that as though you think I might want to get rid of you.\u201d They turned along the plank, heading for the Nauti Buoy, the fifty-foot sea green and white houseboat.</p> <p>\u201cNot get rid of me maybe.\u201d She stepped onto the wide porch, moving back as he slid open the glass sliding doors before heading into the dim, air-conditioned comfort of the living room/kitchen.</p><p>The shades were all drawn, the lights out. As he closed the door behind them, he pulled the heavy drapes closed over it, sealing them inside the intimate, cool comfort of his home away from home.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d he asked as he moved to the small kitchen. \u201cDo you think I wouldn\u2019t want you around, Kelly?\u201d</p><p>The wheel column sat in the corner in front of the large shaded window beside the glass doors. A six-foot burgundy couch sat to her side, two matching chairs on the other side of the room, behind the wheel. The kitchen was equipped with a mini refrigerator, chest-type freezer, and narrow four-burner stove with an overhead microwave and oak cabinets. The double sink was narrow, but efficient. Across from the work area a circular table with four cushioned captain\u2019s chairs sat beneath a stained-glass chandelier. Farther along was a small bathroom and shower, berth bed, and a walkout to the back diving area.</p><p>She loved the Nauti Buoy. They had spent the summers on it when she was younger. Upstairs was another larger, opulent bedroom, as well as a master bathroom and deck. Before Ray had given it to Rowdy, there had been two bedrooms downstairs. Now, the second one was a drying/changing area for the back deck with a small washer/dryer combo.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure,\u201d she finally answered, staring back at him, her fingers knotting in the hem of her shirt.</p><p>\u201cYour mother helped build the marina.\u201d He turned to her after setting the food on the table. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take it from you, no matter what happened.\u201d</p><p>He hooked his thumbs in the pockets of his jeans, watching her with those eyes. Eyes that stripped her defenses, that sent butterflies crashing to and fro in the pit of her stomach.</p> <p>She licked her lips, staring back at him. The last thing on her mind now was the business. Nerves clashed as her senses became more heightened; the air in the confines of the craft became heavier, dense with the seductive, subtle scent that was unique to Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t, Rowdy.\u201d She cleared her throat, forcing herself to move to the cabinet and the kitchenware there.</p><p>As she pulled plates and silverware from where they were held and set the table, Rowdy warmed the food in the microwave, setting it on the table before pulling a bottle of cheap wine from the fridge.</p><p>At some point, he had turned on a CD, lowering the volume until the soft, intimate music flowed through the cabin.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d The dark throb in his voice was so sexual that the suggestion took on a whole new meaning.</p><p>\u201cEat.\u201d She breathed in slowly. \u201cOkay. We eat.\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>As they ate, he told her about the Marines. She knew he was glossing over the harder details, the blood and death he\u2019d seen overseas, the friends he had lost. She knew when he was talking about those friends who were no longer alive to laugh with him. His eyes would darken, his expression becoming reflective.</p><p>He told her about the desert, made her laugh at some of the pranks he and his buddies had played on their CO or other soldiers. She saw the beauty of the sun rising over a desert landscape, or the calm tranquillity of the moon rising, with his deep voice and reverent descriptions.</p><p>But he had missed home. She heard that in every word. How beautiful the moon glistening off the sand could be, but it didn\u2019t compare to the early morning fog that rose from the lake or the moon slicing a path of golden light across the wet surface.</p><p>How he would miss the guys he\u2019d fought with, but he dreamed of slipping off into the mountains and making the homemade moonshine he, Natches, and Dawg often made.</p><p>The silence of the desert, the symphony of the forest. He saw the beauty of the land he\u2019d been in, but he knew the treasures to be found in the land he\u2019d grown up in.</p><p>\u201cWhat about women?\u201d She asked the question that plagued her most as he stacked the dishes in the tiny dishwasher and turned back to where she watched him from the table.</p><p>She propped her elbow on the table, cupping her chin in her hands as she watched him curiously.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a saint, baby.\u201d His lips quirked with that sexy little half smile that was trademark Rowdy. \u201cBut there was nothing serious. Hasn\u2019t been anyone in a while, actually. What about you?\u201d</p><p>He was leaning against the counter, his muscular body relaxed. Well, mostly relaxed. He was hard. She could glimpse the bulge in the front of his jeans from the lower portion of her vision and was dying for a full look.</p><p>\u201cNo one for me,\u201d she answered with a self-mocking grimace. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get over you. You left and broke my young heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter your young heart than my neck,\u201d he grunted. \u201cI was twenty-two-years-old, Kelly. I should have been shot for even looking at you then.\u201d His eyelids lowered. \u201cBut it was damned hard not to look. You filled out a pair of shorts almost as good as you fill them out now.\u201d</p><p>She felt the flush that rose over her face, her gaze flickering away from him for long moments as she breathed in deeply.</p><p>\u201cYou know, those loose clothes are going to have to go,\u201d he sighed. \u201cOne of my favorite parts of coming home was watching you run around in those snug little shorts and tank tops. Made my dick harder than hell, but it was a sight I sure as hell miss, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slammed into his. The green was darker now, his expression heavy with hunger.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She swallowed tightly. \u201cI\u2019m more comfortable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d The whispered retort was delivered with a knowing smile. \u201cYou\u2019re scared. I\u2019m home now, Kelly. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>He had promised her, so long ago, as long as he was around, no one would hurt her. It was the bully, she remembered. She was terrified of staying in the park after school while her mother worked, after the bullies had started picking on her. Unless Rowdy was there. He had taken care of her. And sometimes one of the others. If Rowdy couldn\u2019t be there, Dawg or Natches had been.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I promised I\u2019d always take care of you?\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou were the littlest bit of thing I had ever laid my young eyes on. Those tears on your face when those bullies stole that frippery in your hair made me madder than hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved my hair bows.\u201d She restrained her teasing smile. \u201cAnd saved Mom a ton of extra money. I loved my hair bows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still love your hair bows.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI saw them scattered all over your bathroom last night when I got up for a drink. Damned things own your sink counter.\u201d</p><p>The style of those pretty hair trifles had changed now. Rather than actual bows there were silver barrettes, glittering little bobby pins, and stylish little doodads he had yet to identify.</p><p>She lifted her brows. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty though.\u201d</p><p>He pushed from the counter, moving with a predatory ease, a shift of bone, muscle, and sinew that had her breath catching in her throat as he walked to the table.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He reached out, the backs of his fingers smoothing over the side of her face. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty. Too damned pretty for those loose clothes. Take them off for me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring a change\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have on a bra and panties, I presume?\u201d His fingers wrapped around her wrist, drawing her to her feet. \u201cI bet they cover you better than that damned bathing suit did when you were seventeen.\u201d</p><p>The air was suddenly too thick to breathe, her sight dazed, filled with the color of Rowdy\u2019s eyes and the desire she could see glowing in them. Her thighs tightened as she felt the tingle of response racing through her womb, rippling through her vagina.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head the boat for the cove,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe could do some swimming, watch the moon rise over the lake. Would you like that, Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bra and panties isn\u2019t exactly a bathing suit.\u201d She drew in a deep breath, moving away from him as she tugged at the large shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly naked, either,\u201d he said as he moved to the wheel column. \u201cThink about it. So do we go to the cove anyway?\u201d He glanced back at her, lifting a black brow suggestively.</p><p>Kelly breathed in deeply.</p><p>\u201cThe cove sounds like fun.\u201d She finally nodded firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnd the clothes?\u201d His gaze dropped over her body before coming back to her eyes.</p><p>She lifted her brow mockingly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything to deserve it yet, Rowdy,\u201d she purred sweetly. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to think about it.\u201d</p><p>She was going to have to think about it?</p><p>As he maneuvered the Nauti Buoy toward the hidden cove, Rowdy found a smile tugging at his lips. He might not deserve to see those loose clothes coming over her perky little body, but he was going to. The long, thin, denim shirt fell to her thighs and draped over her slender shoulders. Even her jeans were loose, a protective shell to cover herself with.</p><p>His jaw clenched at the thought. Kelly had never had a problem wearing clothes that emphasized her slender body, until now. The attack had changed that; she was nervous now, where before she had been confident of herself as a desirable, pretty young woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t tease him like she had for far too many years. She was more contained, quieter. And he realized he missed the spitfire she had been. By now, they should have been arguing loud enough to draw attention, while she drove him crazy with a combination of lust and exasperation.</p><p>Instead, she was standing at the glass sliding doors, staring into the distance reflectively as her fingers gripped the drapes at the side.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong, Kelly.\u201d He leaned into the back of the barstool he was sitting in, one hand gripping the wheel as the boat plowed through the water toward the cove.</p> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d She turned back to him with a frown, her gray eyes twinkling with good humor.</p><p>\u201cI think I deserve to see you stripped down to something decent.\u201d He scowled. \u201cStop letting that bastard win.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes before turning back to the scenery outside the boat.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything, Rowdy,\u201d she retorted, but there was no conviction in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d He began unbuttoning his own shirt as he glanced at her, his cock throbbing in delight as she glanced back at him, her eyes shadowed with interest.</p> <p>Within seconds he\u2019d stripped the shirt, tossing it back on the chair behind him as he flashed her a wicked grin.</p><p>She turned to him then, crossing her arms over her breasts as she lifted her brow.</p><p>\u201cYou could at least lose the jeans,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThat shirt is big enough to cover two of you. No one would know.\u201d</p><p>Four years ago she had worn that tiny little bikini all damned day, flipping around him like a wood nymph intent on driving mortal men insane. Now, he couldn\u2019t even get her out of her pants.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing,\u201d she warned, her voice holding a subtle snap.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen me push yet, baby,\u201d he growled in return. \u201cDo you think I didn\u2019t take the time to find out just how much you\u2019ve been hiding since that bastard attacked you? You stopped dressing like the girl I knew and started dressing like your damned grandmother instead. You\u2019re scared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, duh!\u201d she mocked him. \u201cGo figure. Maybe I should just prance around naked for you, Rowdy.\u201d She wasn\u2019t really angry, yet. Her eyes were sparkling though, her cheeks flushing with irritation.</p><p>\u201cThat would work for me.\u201d He grinned wolfishly. \u201cLet\u2019s try it and see if it will work for you. Take yours off and I\u2019ll take mine off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would take yours off anyway.\u201d Her laughter was soft, knowing.</p><p>\u201cFor you, baby, anytime.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cA far cry from your answer in the past years.\u201d The shade of mockery in her voice wasn\u2019t lost on him. \u201cWhy now? You come back and suddenly can\u2019t wait to get into bed with me? It\u2019s enough to make a girl suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d he agreed, grinning back at her. \u201cThere\u2019s no secret there, sweetheart. I wasn\u2019t about to take a kid to my bed. Being a virgin will be hard enough for you, I at least wanted you to be mature enough to know what the hell you were getting into. But I had no intentions of not coming back for you.\u201d</p><p>Surprise reflected in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I decided I wanted someone else?\u201d Her eyes narrowed, her lips thinning at the confidence he knew she was reading in his tone.</p> <p>\u201cThen Dawg or Natches would have taken care of it until I made it back on leave.\u201d He shrugged easily. \u201cI put a claim on you a long time ago, Kelly. You just didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere between the little sex games that your buddies shared in?\u201d</p><p>Ohhh, now was that just a little shade of jealousy there? He watched her closely from the corner of his eye as he kept the teasing grin in place.</p><p>\u201cSex games are for adults.\u201d He scratched at his chin as he glanced back at her. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t handle them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I couldn\u2019t handle them?\u201d She frowned back at him as she straightened and placed her hands on her hips. \u201cYou never gave me the chance to try.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t let your mouth write checks your body can\u2019t cash, baby. Don\u2019t dare me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a dark, warning look, one she immediately recognized. He wasn\u2019t playing here. Not yet. And before he started, he wanted her aware of the rules.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d She pushed her hands into her jeans pockets, staring back at him with an edge of anger, of arousal. \u201cI paid attention to your reputation a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t shying away from him. That was good. He didn\u2019t want her shying away from him; he wanted her curious, interested. He wanted her horny.</p><p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d He ran his hand over his chest as he guided the houseboat into a turn that would take it off the main section of the lake and into a more narrow waterway leading to the cove. \u201cAnd you still teased me every chance you had. You\u2019ve stopped teasing me. Maybe you decided you can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re being a prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being honest, Kelly.\u201d He gave his head a quick, negative jerk. \u201cYou listened to the rumors, you say. Evidently you didn\u2019t listen close enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I said,\u201d he answered, narrowing his eyes as he glanced back at her. \u201cI\u2019m fine with having the princess. I\u2019ll take you to my bed, treat you like crystal, and love you with everything I have to give you, for as long as you can put up with me. But don\u2019t tempt the beast, sugar, because when he gets hungry, you might get more than you\u2019ve bargained for.\u201d</p><p>He watched her expression go blank.</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d She blinked back at him, so damned innocent it made his guts clench.</p><p>\u201cKelly, I\u2019ve always loved you,\u201d he told her, meaning it. Knowing he meant it. \u201cIn one way or the other, you\u2019ve always been a part of me. You\u2019re old enough to decide if you want to settle in with one man, forever, or not. I figure I can give you this summer to decide for sure if I\u2019m that man. If not, then I\u2019ll let you go. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but I\u2019d do it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Rowdy, I\u2019ve always loved you.\u201d She watched him in confusion now, hope and fear in equal parts shadowing her eyes.</p><p>He tapped his fingers against the wheel, turning it until it swung into another waterway leading to the private cove. Natches\u2019s family owned the small property that bordered the bay. It was on the back side of undeveloped land, and completely private.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you have,\u201d he finally answered as he pulled along the tree-shaded bank and cut the engine.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything more as he moved beyond the sliding doors, throwing out the heavy front anchor weight before moving to the back and doing the same. As he returned to the living area, he paused by the table.</p><p>\u201cI came back for you,\u201d he said, leaning against the small bar, forcing himself to stand away from her. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dad was so worried. He knew I came back for you. And the rumors are fact, baby. So don\u2019t push me where the games are concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you or your dad making decisions for me,\u201d she snapped, her gray eyes flaring in defiance. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to try for a relationship, then we\u2019ll meet in the middle. Somehow. But not if you think you can plan my life for me.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. She was a bundle of fire, that was for damned sure.</p><p>\u201cTake off the pants,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s go one step at a time, Kelly. See what your limits are together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur limits,\u201d she retorted. \u201cNot just mine.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled into a frankly sexual, wicked smile.</p><p>Kelly licked her lips nervously. The action had the head of his erection pounding with need. Damn, he wanted that little tongue there laving the thick crest, licking around it as though it were a favorite treat.</p><p>She bit her lower lip and glanced away before breathing in deeply. Her hands moved, pulling out of the jeans pockets before moving beneath the shirt to unsnap the pants. She kicked off her sandals then pushed the jeans over her hips and down her legs.</p><p>Within seconds she was laying them over the chair with his shirt before turning back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou used to tease me like a brazen little hussy,\u201d he whispered, staring at her legs, dying to feel them around his hips. \u201cIt was one of the things I looked forward to most when I thought of coming home.\u201d He watched her move toward him, her eyes becoming cloudy with passion as he kept his voice low, carefully teasing.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t act as though you enjoyed it,\u201d she murmured as she drew up to him. He jerked as she placed her small hand on his bare chest and ran it slowly down to his tight abdomen. \u201cYou stayed away from me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand, moving it to her arm, feeling the softness of her skin as he ran his fingers to her elbow and back again.</p><p>\u201cIf you knew the things I wanted to do to you over the years, you would have run screaming.\u201d He stared down at her uplifted face, his gaze on her lips. The soft, candy pink perfection of those full curves had him aching. \u201cYou\u2019re still too damned young for the things I want to do to you. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to do to me, Rowdy?\u201d Her hand slid from his abdomen to his chest again as she stared at him, her eyes reflecting the same hungry need she had shown for years, but it also showed a shadow of fear, of hesitation.</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to lie to her. Now wasn\u2019t the time to hide any part of who or what he was, or the hungers he could unleash on her. If there was a time to be honest with her, it was now. Before the emotional connection that had bonded them for so many years deepened, before there was a chance she could be hurt.</p><p>Arousal flashed in her eyes as her breathing became heavier, jerkier. \u201cGive me an example.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers down her arm until he found her hand, lifted it, pulling her fingers to his lips as he watched her through narrowed eyes. Her gaze flickered to his lips as he licked over the pad of two fingers, her eyelids drooping, pleasure rather than fear filling her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want,\u201d he whispered. \u201cExactly what I suspect you\u2019re most frightened of now.\u201d He lifted his other hand, smoothing back her hair from her face, his thumb caressing her cheek. \u201cI want to strip you down, love you from head to toe as often as possible, and sometimes...we might not be alone.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in a hard hitch a second before she jerked away from him, moving across the room, her shoulders stiff and straight as he forced himself to relax, to wait.</p><p>\u201cAnd if we weren\u2019t alone?\u201d Her voice was thin, breathy. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was arousal or fear that inspired it.</p><p>\u201cIf we weren\u2019t alone, you know the only men I\u2019d ever allow around you,\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd if it\u2019s not what I want?\u201d She asked, her gray eyes dark, shadowed with indecision.</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t press you for it.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest again as he leaned against the counter. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t think about it, that I won\u2019t fantasize the hell out of it. I won\u2019t lie to you, Kelly. Ever. And I won\u2019t have things between us that don\u2019t need to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do they feel about this?\u201d Arousal lay thick in her voice, as did the fear. \u201cHave the three of you already been making plans to seduce me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are times when men don\u2019t have to make plans, Kelly.\u201d He kept his voice smooth, even. \u201cThey know me, just as well as I know them. No plans will ever be made outside of your presence.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in slowly, her nostrils flaring as she watched him closely.</p><p>\u201cWhich brings me to another point,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhether you want to do it or not, you\u2019re going to at least have to fake it. Until I catch that bastard who attacked you, I\u2019ll let him think it\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll torture him with the knowledge of it. Because I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let him threaten you any longer. So you might want to think about at least enjoying some of the pretense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he spoke, he watched her pale, then flush as fury contorted her features with lightning swiftness. A spark was all it took, and he had known he was taking that risk.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re going to play with me?\u201d she threw back at him, her voice rising in fury. \u201cThat I\u2019m going to let you play head games with that sick bastard until he comes after me again?\u201d</p><p>Betrayal flashed in her eyes, in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cThink again, damn you.\u201d She stalked over to the chair, yanking her pants from the seat and jerking them over her legs as she cast him a heated glare. \u201cYou\u2019re a son of a bitch, Rowdy. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do this.\u201d Emotion clogged her throat, the pain in her voice tearing at his chest.</p><p>\u201cHell yes, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he snarled, stalking to her as she struggled to snap and zip her jeans. He gripped her arms, staring down at her, rage eating him alive at the thought of that perverted bastard holding her down, cutting her with that knife. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes, Kelly, do you understand me? He\u2019s a threat to you. A danger. And that I will not tolerate. If we don\u2019t catch him, he\u2019s going to rape again, and the next woman might not live to regret it. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to use me.\u201d She slapped at his arms, breaking away from him as she screamed the accusation in his face, her gray eyes swimming with tears. \u201cYou want to pervert what I feel for you, what I\u2019ve needed for years, and turn it into some kind of damned war game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you until I can\u2019t breathe, dammit,\u201d he growled back at her. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken a comfortable breath since you developed breasts. But he\u2019s going to come after you again, sooner or later. You know it and I know it. What happens if he catches me off guard? If he gets to you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that. And I\u2019m careful now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI snuck up on you yesterday morning,\u201d he snapped. \u201cDo you have any idea how easy it is to get past even Dad\u2019s security system? Do you think you could have stopped him even if that window had been closed and locked?\u201d He saw the truth in her eyes. \u201cForget that, Kelly. The other girls he raped couldn\u2019t stop him. He raped one of them while her parents slept only rooms away from her. You can\u2019t hide from him, and you can\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop yelling at me!\u201d She pushed him back furiously, her hands cracking against his stomach as she slapped against it to forcibly put distance between them.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t listening to me,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t listen to you,\u201d she screamed, the tears falling from her eyes, her face pale, her eyes raging with fury and the sense of betrayal he could see tearing through her. \u201cYou call this love? Setting me up? Oh God, Rowdy, how could you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>A sob tore through her body as she stared up at him, her fists clenched at her side, tears wetting her cheeks and breaking his heart.</p><p>\u201cDo what, Kelly?\u201d he finally asked wearily, shaking his head. \u201cWant you safe? Well? I\u2019m telling you who and what I am, and what I am endangers you with this bastard anyway if he\u2019s even heard of me. Dawg, Natches, and I have been sharing our women since we were old enough to understand what our dicks were made for. You know that as well as anyone else does. Loving me doesn\u2019t mean you have to do shit about it. Loving you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s something I have to have. But we\u2019re talking about more than that now. We\u2019re talking about your life, and I\u2019ll do whatever the hell it takes to keep that bastard from ever touching you again. Ever, Kelly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how do you know it wasn\u2019t one of them?\u201d she threw in his face. \u201cIt could have been either of them. He tried to rape me anally, Rowdy. And the three of you are considered the ass-fucking kings, so tell me how you know it\u2019s not one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they know me,\u201d he snapped back. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve watched you twitch that little ass at me since you were a teenager. Trust me, baby, if it was one of them, they would have never made the mistake of believing that good girl persona you project to every other man close enough to watch you. You\u2019re a good girl to the world, but you, baby, are bad to the bone when it comes to me. I know it, and you know it. You just have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet fucked!\u201d she screamed back, enraged, her face flushed red, her eyes glittering now with a fury he\u2019d rarely seen in her.</p><p>He smiled. A slow, teasing, wicked grin that only fueled her rage as his gaze dropped down her body then back up.</p><p>\u201cBut, darlin\u2019, ain\u2019t that what we were talking about?\u201d</p><p>Before she could do more than gasp he had her in his arms again, his lips covering hers, his tongue slipping past her lips to taste the wild anger and arousal pumping through her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think. She didn\u2019t fear. He felt her hands grip his shoulders, her little nails pricking against his flesh as his hand moved beneath her shirt, to her thighs.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he growled, lifting his head to stare into her dazed, stormy eyes as his palm cupped the hot flesh between her thighs, the heat of his flesh searing her even through her jeans. \u201cI bet you\u2019re wet, Kelly. So fucking wet it\u2019s seeping through your panties.\u201d</p> <p>He pressed closer, feeling her hips buck at the pressure against her clit.</p><p>God, he wanted to strip her. He wanted to tear those clothes off her and lay her down on the closest available surface and devour her. He wanted to bury his lips between those perfect thighs, send his tongue searching through the silken folds of her pussy.</p><p>And she wanted it, too. She was pressing against his hand, her hips bucking into it as the heat of her filled his palm.</p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she snapped, her breathing rough as a low whimper left her throat.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d He rotated his hand, watching her eyes flare, feeling the heat intensify against his palm. \u201cYou love me, Kelly, just like you love this. And you want more. Admit it, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her thighs parted further as his fingers curved, massaging the sensitive flesh through her clothes.</p><p>\u201cI want you, not a game,\u201d she cried out, arching to her tiptoes, helpless against him. He liked her helpless against his touch, loved feeling the heat of her against his hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd if the game comes with it?\u201d He watched her intently, his eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep you safe. And this is what it takes. I won\u2019t let him catch us unprepared. I won\u2019t let him touch you again.\u201d</p><p>He released her slowly, hating letting her go as she stared back at him miserably.</p><p>\u201cThink about that,\u201d he whispered, keeping his voice gentle. \u201cI hate it like hell, and no one wishes I could have seduced you more than I do. I would have loved seducing you, baby. But your safety is more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy safety?\u201d she asked mockingly. \u201cOr your desires?\u201d</p><p>Anger flared inside him. \u201cYou know me better than that, Kelly.\u201d He kept his jaw tensed, his tone of voice low. \u201cNothing matters as much as keeping you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only on your terms,\u201d she pointed out, furious, causing him to pause. \u201cOn your terms and by your rules. Well, you know what, Rowdy, your rules suck. Maybe I need to decide if playing your game is worth the risk to my heart and to my safety.\u201d</p><p>NINE</p><p>He watched as the Nauti Buoy pulled into her berth, fifty feet and gleaming beneath the summer moon, her lights giving the craft a soft, romantic look. How he had dreamed of having such a craft, a place he could use to hide, to take his good girls and fulfill the promises he made to them.</p><p>He thought he had chosen so wisely. His perfect girls, pure in heart and in nature, and they loved him. He was their love, but it had taken so long to find the one he wanted for all time. The perfect good girl. So sweet-natured and pure, never dirtying herself or her good name. Despite the brother.</p><p>His fists clenched at the thought of the brother. He was depraved, perverted, and he was going to dirty her. Rowdy Mackay was going to shame Kelly, and he knew it. He had seen them today, in the store, his hands on her, his eyes raking over her as though he owned her.</p><p>Rowdy Mackay didn\u2019t own her. She belonged to the man who loved her, who respected her. And she was going to love him. Just like the others did. They hadn\u2019t loved anyone else either. He watched them sometimes, making certain they didn\u2019t allow anyone else to touch what belonged to him. Sometimes he called them, reminded them of who they were waiting for. They had promised to wait on him to find his one true love.</p><p>Kelly could be his true love. He thought it was possible. Until Rowdy came home.</p><p>The Nauti Boys. They were depraved. Perverts. But they had never fooled with the good girls. They left the perfect ones alone, always preferring the tramps, the little whores willing to spread their legs not just for one of them, but sometimes for all three at once. They shared their women all the time, watching and listening to their nasty screams as they begged for more.</p><p>His fists clenched, his gut rolling in sick suspicion. Rowdy had taken Kelly away on the houseboat. He had never done that by himself before. In the past, it had always been with her and her friends, never alone.</p><p>He shook at the fear that the bastard had dirtied her. He couldn\u2019t let that happen. Kelly was sweet and clean, she had never been dirtied by another man\u2019s seed, by another\u2019s possession of her.</p><p>She had screamed for him when he touched her, though. He hadn\u2019t had time to hear her beg for him, or to hear her promise to remain true to him. No sooner had he attempted to possess her than that big dumb hick visiting his whore girlfriend had started yelling outside the door. He couldn\u2019t get caught. His sweet Kelly couldn\u2019t be seen with a man in her bed. It would ruin her reputation and she wouldn\u2019t be clean anymore. Her reputation meant everything.</p><p>Bastard Rowdy. Rowdy Mackay thought he was perfect, thought all the girls were his. He was going to hurt sweet Kelly, his sister. She was his sister, he had no business touching her. Sisters shouldn\u2019t be touched, his father had warned him of that.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as Kelly moved from the boat and jumped onto the narrow floating dock. She was angry. He could see it in her face, in the stiff set of her body beneath the bright lights of the dock.</p><p>She said something as Rowdy locked the doors, causing the man to stiffen, to turn to her slowly. He didn\u2019t like the smile Rowdy gave her. It was carnal. Dirty.</p><p>He watched as she stalked ahead of the other man, her loose clothing demure, hiding the body that belonged to him alone. How perfect she was. His good girl. He had to finish his claim on her. He had to make certain she belonged to him. Not Rowdy. Never Rowdy and his perverted friends.</p><p>He watched as Rowdy walked her to her car. He was too close to her, even though she was angry. Rowdy was standing too close. He was crowding her.</p><p>She unlocked the door and opened it, then Rowdy touched her. Don\u2019t touch her. He clenched his fists, sniffing miserably, fighting the tears that fell from his eyes. Rowdy shouldn\u2019t be touching her.</p><p>But he was. The depraved bastard was touching her hair, her cheek, smiling down at her. Rage shattered in his head, filling his vision with a red haze as he watched another move from the shadows of the dock. Dawg. The bastard couldn\u2019t even use his real name\u2014he used the nickname of the animal he was.</p><p>Kelly started as the other men called out to them, flashed Rowdy a furious look, then got into her car. The car door closed and within seconds she was pulling from the parking lot. She was going home. But she wouldn\u2019t be going alone. Rowdy would go as well. He lived in the house with her. His bedroom would be close to hers, he could hear her, smell her, maybe touch her as she slept.</p><p>Oh God, don\u2019t let him touch her, he prayed. Don\u2019t let him dirty the good girl. She was his good girl. And, she just might be his perfect love.</p><p>Kelly forcibly restrained the anger pounding through her bloodstream as she stepped into the house with Rowdy close behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you two found your way home.\u201d Ray and Maria stepped into the entryway.</p><p>Kelly breathed in deeply before turning to them, pasting a smile on her face as she met their concerned gazes.</p><p>\u201cRowdy has a habit of poking along on the way back from the docks.\u201d She kept her voice flat and even. \u201cYou know how he is.\u201d</p> <p>They weren\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lousy liar, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Rowdy drawled, his deep baritone still sending shivers up her spine despite her anger.</p><p>She glanced over at him. His thumbs were hooked in the pockets of his jeans, long legs stiff and straight as he smiled in open amusement back at their parents. She drew in a deep, hard breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going up to bed.\u201d She smiled stiffly. \u201cRowdy can be a butt by himself. I don\u2019t feel like dealing with it.\u201d</p><p>She raced up the stairs, fearing Rowdy would follow her, grateful he didn\u2019t. She slammed the door to her bedroom, twisting the lock on the handle before she stomped to her window and jerked the heavy curtains closed.</p> <p>\u201cBeg me for it,\u201d he panted at her ear, holding her down. \u201cYou\u2019re my good girl, Kelly. You\u2019re mine, it\u2019s okay to let me in. Let me in...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at the intrusive memory. She had managed to hold back the fear while she was with Rowdy, but now that she was alone, it was sneaking in, attacking her. The feeling of being watched was overwhelming, her skin crawling as her stomach churned with panic.</p><p>She had, as Rowdy had argued, essentially been the one who got away. She had escaped the full rape, suffering only some cuts made to weaken her, and a terror that still brought her awake with a cry on her lips.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wear the clothes she used to because the marks were still there. Shorts and tank tops might reveal the nearly imperceptible white scars that still marred her arms, shoulders, and legs. Nakedness would reveal the ones on her buttocks. Deeper slices had been made there as he held her down, cutting her panties from her.</p><p>Her mother swore they weren\u2019t noticeable. But to Kelly, they were.</p><p>She still remembered the feel of that knife biting into her, razor-sharp, the skin parting as cold pain streaked through her nervous system, and the feel of hot blood as it began to pour from the wounds. The doctor had assured her that within a few years they would be gone entirely. She wondered if the memories would fade as well.</p> <p>She paced through the dark room to the wide recliner that sat on the far wall, beneath the standing lamp she used to read by. Collapsing into it, she propped her elbows on her knees and dropped her head in her hands. She didn\u2019t need Rowdy\u2019s arguments earlier to understand that she wasn\u2019t out of danger. She knew she wasn\u2019t, just as she knew that it was only a matter of time before her attacker made his next move.</p><p>She felt stalked. There was no proof, nothing but her own suspicions and her own fears. Shaking her head, she moved to her dresser. She pulled free one of the long sleeveless gowns she slept in and headed for the shower. A cold shower maybe, she thought as she adjusted the water. If she didn\u2019t get the memory of his kiss, his teasing out of her head, she would go crazy.</p><p>But even the cool water did nothing to still the idea he had planted in her head earlier. She was furious that Rowdy would play games to draw the stalker out, but she was smart enough to realize she wasn\u2019t safe.</p><p>She dried her hair, staring at the thin white scars on her shoulders and upper arms. There were four on one, three on the other. They showed clearly in the bright light of the bathroom, the dark blue gown emphasizing the marks.</p><p>At times she swore she could feel the ones on her buttocks.</p><p>She shook her head as she turned from the mirror, moving to the bedroom, her hand reaching out to flip off the light. She paused at the switch, her eyes narrowing on the man in her bedroom.</p><p>Rowdy had obviously showered as well. Dressed in gray sweatpants, he was propped against her pillows, waiting on her, a scowl creasing his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cThat expression freezes on your face and you\u2019ll be terrifying little kids on the streets,\u201d she informed him as she flipped off the light and walked into the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone at night, Kelly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWindows were locked and so was the door,\u201d she informed him as she stood by the side of the bed, her arms crossed over her breasts.</p><p>\u201cAnd I got in the door anyway.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled slowly, her gaze sliding to the shadowed outline of the door as Rowdy reached over and clicked on the dim lamp on the small table beside him.</p><p>The lock was in the standing position, still locked.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d She turned back to him, pretending to ignore the fact that he was mouthwateringly sexy as he lay on the flowered comforter of her bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of cake,\u201d he grunted. \u201cThe window locks aren\u2019t a lot harder to release. Until I can get the contractor out here to add to the security, you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>His expression was determined, stubborn. It was easy to tell when Rowdy had made up his mind. His expression went completely bland and his sea green eyes turned as cool as the arctic.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou sleep here and I\u2019ll sleep in your bed. No biggie.\u201d She moved for the door.</p><p>\u201cOpen that door, Kelly, and your mom and my dad are going to get dragged into this little disagreement we\u2019re having. Is that really what you want?\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p><p>She stopped halfway to the door before turning back to him.</p><p>\u201cWhose side would they take?\u201d She opened her eyes wide, with mocking innocence. \u201cNow I wonder, what will they think about the little proposal you put to me earlier?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, his eyes glittering with lust, with amused hunger.</p><p>\u201cDad would probably kick my ass out of the house,\u201d he growled good-naturedly. \u201cIs that what you really want?\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him, restraining the urge to kick his butt herself. He was right. Ray would likely skin his hide if he ever learned of his son\u2019s proposal.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t expected it. She had. She had looked forward to it. How was that for some sick shit? She had actually looked forward to the day Rowdy would return and make good on the promise his kiss had made years ago.</p><p>And she had known if he did, the possibility of just such a proposal would come. She had been ready for it. Prepared for it. What she hadn\u2019t expected was the cold-blooded intention he had of using it to catch her would-be rapist. As though the act no longer had anything to do with the two of them. As though the desire, the need, and the hunger were a means to an end and nothing more. It was without feeling, without emotion. And God help her, whenever she was around Rowdy, she felt nothing but emotion. Swirls of it. Lava-hot, lightning forks of sensation that rippled over her nerve endings, rendering even the air itself a caress against her sensitive flesh.</p><p>And emotions? Oh, she didn\u2019t even want to go there. Except she was already there. Arousal, uncertainty, fear of the unknown, and a fear of losing the dream in the face of reality.</p><p>He was asking her to choose. She had wanted to be seduced.</p><p>She turned back to him, drawing in a slow, deep breath, her head lifting as she stared at the confident, cool countenance he presented to her.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my bedroom.\u201d She crossed her arms over her breasts, pressing her lips together as she glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not one of the Nauti Boys\u2019 playthings. And I\u2019m not in the mood for games. Not yours or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She watched the surprise gleam in his eyes for just a second. For the first time in all the years she had known him, she had never surprised him, until now.</p><p>With a ripple of muscle, he moved from the bed, his gaze never leaving hers as he rose, coming to his feet and walking around the bed.</p><p>He was aroused. The thick length of his erection tented his sweatpants, drew her eyes and made her mouth water. She had fantasized about that erection. About all the things a woman could do with such a prime piece of flesh.</p><p>She let her eyes linger on the proof of that arousal before lifting them to his face again. He was close. So close she could smell the clean, male scent of him. Dial soap and heated male arousal.</p><p>She stood still as he stalked around her, the movements deliberate, predatory. Suddenly he wasn\u2019t the laid-back, patiently amused Rowdy she had always known. She could feel the purpose, the male intent that poured from him.</p><p>Her breath caught as he paused behind her, his hand reaching up to allow his fingers to smooth her hair back over her shoulder, to bare the shell of her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d She jumped at his whispered response. \u201cAnd, baby, I do like to play.\u201d His hands ran down her arms, creating a friction of heat as she felt his lips at her shoulders. \u201cI guess that makes you my playmate, if not my plaything.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened a second before she jerked out of his hold, turning back to him furiously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She gave him a tight, angry smile.</p><p>Stupid male confidence, she fumed.</p><p>He tilted his head, the beginnings of a smile twitching at the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cI could convince you.\u201d</p><p>No doubt.</p><p>She snorted as though it weren\u2019t possible. Unfortunately, he probably could convince her, but at what cost to her soul?</p><p>\u201cGo get in your own bed, Rowdy. Don\u2019t make me cause a scene. Ray wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d She walked to hers, flipping back the blankets and moving into the comfort of the mattress, ignoring him as though he didn\u2019t matter. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d he murmured as he paced to the other side of the bed, staring down at her, aroused, determined.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t changed at all, Rowdy.\u201d She pulled the blankets to her waist as she sat propped against the pillows. \u201cPerhaps you just never really knew me.\u201d She raised her brows in emphasis. \u201cThat\u2019s always a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed waking up with me,\u201d he accused. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to throw me out.\u201d</p><p>That one was a no-brainer. No, she didn\u2019t want to throw him out. She wanted to curl against him and sleep as fearlessly as she had the night before and awaken as warm and protected as she had that morning.</p><p>She lifted her chin, refusing to answer him, fighting to hold his knowing stare as he watched her from beneath the veil of his thick, black lashes.</p><p>\u201cGo play with someone else.\u201d She might have to kill him if he tried. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think this is a game?\u201d He scowled down at her, his hands bracing on his powerful hips as his eyes began to simmer with irritation.</p><p>\u201cI think it is for you,\u201d she answered somberly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a game. Don\u2019t play games with me, Rowdy. Not now, not ever.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p><p>Rowdy leaned forward, muscular arms propping him up on the mattress as he stared into her eyes. Kelly fought the need to glance away from him, to deny the hold he had on her. There was no turning away from him. He mesmerized her, made her hungry, made her need.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of you, Rowdy,\u201d she tried to smirk back at him. \u201cDon\u2019t try to intimidate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the games, then don\u2019t play them.\u201d His voice was dangerously, warningly soft. \u201cYou want something from me, then tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth clenched in anger.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI want you out of my bedroom and out of my face. Go away.\u201d She made a shooing motion with her hand then stared at him in shock as his hand whipped out, catching her wrist.</p><p>Her heart jumped to her throat as he brought her fingers to his mouth, rubbed them against the velvet roughness of his lips before opening them and licking over the pads with a subtle flick of his tongue.</p><p>She was helpless. Struck dumb by the sheer sensuality of watching him caress nothing but her fingertips. Feeling the warmth of his lips, the flickering heat of his tongue, the sensual nip of his teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Each caress sent flares of heat exploding with sensual devastation throughout her body. Her nipples were so hard, the nerves there so sensitized, that they were sending rippling flares of response straight to her womb, convulsing it with an erotic punch of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d She was shocked at the whimper in her voice, at her inability to pull away from him.</p><p>He came closer. Kneeling on the bed, still holding her hand, he pulled her to him until she was on her knees facing him.</p><p>He took her other wrist, placing her palms against his chest before his hands smoothed up her arms, over her shoulders, down her back to her hips. She trembled, shuddering at the light caress; it could have been firmer, could have been more destructive. It was subtle instead. Soft. Giving her the chance to break away, knowing she couldn\u2019t. That she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he whispered again as his head lowered.</p><p>She stared back at him, fighting to breathe, fighting against the desires raging inside her. She was helpless against his touch, against the hunger that gleamed in his eyes.</p><p>Just as she became helpless against his kiss.</p><p>His lips covered hers, slowly at first. So slowly, too slowly. They stroked over hers, his tongue flickering out to lave them a second before his teeth caught the lower curve, nipping at it as he watched her.</p><p>Her breathing hitched as she felt his hands bunch in the material of the gown at her hips. It drew slowly up her thighs, working over her flesh, baring her to his hands.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cJust feel, Kelly. Feel for me. Burn for me...\u201d</p><p>She felt cool air caress her thighs, then his hands against her naked flesh, callused, heated, as his lips slanted over hers and he stole her mind with his kiss.</p><p>Deep, drugging kisses. Pleasure tore through her system, consumed her to the point that the knowledge that she was being lowered, laid beneath him, barely registered in her mind. All she knew was the pleasure. The feel of his hard body above her, his hands smoothing over her bare thighs, her hips, then working on the tiny buttons at the bodice while his kisses ravished her lips.</p><p>She was drowning in him. The taste of him. His touch. The muted male sounds of hunger and pleasure as she began to touch him. She needed to touch him. To immerse herself in every sensual sensation she could consume. Her nervous system was rioting with the chaotic impulses rushing through them. The air around them became heated, steamy with the desperation that infused each kiss, each touch.</p><p>\u201cGod, you taste sweet.\u201d His lips tore from hers, his breathing heavy, hard, as they moved to her neck.</p><p>She tilted her neck, panting for air as she felt his teeth rake down the sensitive column, then felt the brush of cool air over her naked breasts.</p><p>As his head lifted, she opened her eyes, staring back at him in dazed fascination as his gaze dropped. He had pulled apart the unbuttoned edges of her gown, displaying the swollen, hard-tipped mounds of her breasts.</p><p>The expression on his face was pure, carnal hunger. His eyes heavy-lidded, his lips moist and swollen from their kisses, his cheekbones flushed a brick red.</p><p>As though suspended between dream and reality, she watched as his head lowered, her eyes widening, a strangled groan leaving her lips as his tongue covered one spiked, aroused nipple.</p><p>Reaction shot through her, jerking at her body as her hands tightened on his neck, her back arching. This was heaven. It was ecstasy. The most pleasure she had ever known in her life.</p><p>His tongue lashed at the hard point as he sucked the flesh into his mouth, drawing on her deeply, creating a pleasure\u2013pain sensation that had a startled cry leaving her lips.</p><p>Lips he immediately covered, stilling the aroused cries as his fingers replaced his mouth. Tweaking at the tender tips, causing her to writhe beneath him as she fought to get closer, to still the ache burning between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cShh. Easy.\u201d His groan was whispered against her lips, his voice dark, desperate. \u201cDamn, Kelly. I can\u2019t take you here. Dad will kill me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you if you don\u2019t.\u201d His chest pressed against her breasts, rasped her nipples so she fought to breathe. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, Rowdy, please.\u201d</p><p>His hand smoothed down to her thigh, his fingers close, so close to where she needed them. She gazed back at him pleadingly, feeling her vagina ripple with need, the muscles clenching in desperation.</p><p>\u201cIf I take you, you\u2019re going to scream,\u201d he whispered, his eyes darkening, a ravenous lust filling his expression. \u201cI want to hear every cry that leaves your lips, Kelly. Every scream as you come around me. I can\u2019t do that here. We can\u2019t do that here. You know that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, a weak whimper passing her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited too long, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d His kiss was gentle and much too short as he eased her gown over her thighs and then covered her breasts once again. \u201cTomorrow. We\u2019ll go out on the boat,\u201d he whispered, pushing her hair back before moving slowly to her side and pulling her into his arms.</p><p>She laid her head against his chest, fighting to regulate her breathing, to tear herself back from the endless spiral of heat he had thrown her into.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t fair,\u201d she whispered as he lifted the sheet over them. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be sleeping in your own bed.\u201d</p><p>She was too weak to make him move now, too desperate for his touch, any touch, to force him from her bed.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep.\u201d His arms contracted around her. \u201cI\u2019d be fighting shadows if I slept away from you, Kelly. Let me hold you. Know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips to his chest. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Rowdy,\u201d she told him softly, wondering at the edge of remorse she heard in his voice.</p><p>He was silent, but his hands still stroked her back, soothing now, where seconds before they had been arousing.</p><p>\u201cJust let me hold you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cSleep beside me, Kelly. We\u2019ll argue out the rest of it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to sleep?\u201d She sighed, shaking her head. \u201cRowdy, I\u2019m never going to sleep with your hard-on poking at my belly all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can,\u201d he chuckled at her ear. \u201cYou need your rest, baby. Because tomorrow night, I really wouldn\u2019t bet on you getting any sleep at all.\u201d</p><p>She was silent then, lying against him, feeling his arms surrounding her, protecting her. God, what was she doing? She had lived and breathed for the day Rowdy would return and see her as more than just a pesky little girl. That he would see her as a woman, as his woman. And here he was, ready to claim her, and she was fighting it, fighting him. Or was she fighting herself?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game, Kelly.\u201d His voice was soft, surrounding her, causing her eyelids to flutter in pleasure as it stroked over her senses. \u201cI\u2019m deadly serious about this. About us. I wasn\u2019t joking when I said you were mine. I came home to claim you, if that\u2019s what you still want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it doesn\u2019t work that way, Rowdy. I want you until I can\u2019t think, can\u2019t breathe. But you\u2019re different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no different than I\u2019ve ever been and you know it.\u201d His voice hardened. \u201cYou don\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to protect you. You want everything tied up in roses and sweet promises. I can give you that, to a point. But I won\u2019t ignore the danger. And you have to accept that. This will be taken care of.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t angry; he wasn\u2019t trying to convince her. He was telling her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about using me. Me and whatever we share between us sexually, flaunting it in front of him to provoke him.\u201d That terrified her more than she wanted to admit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the quickest way to finish this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the quickest way isn\u2019t always the best.\u201d She didn\u2019t know if she wanted to take that step, if she wanted to force a madman\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you think you can hide whatever this relationship brings.\u201d His voice hardened. \u201cDo you believe that\u2019s possible, Kelly? Whether you make the choice to immerse yourself in everything I can give you, or not, doesn\u2019t make a difference. Everyone is going to believe you are. He\u2019ll believe you are. My plan will just flush him out quicker, that\u2019s all. But we\u2019ll play it however you choose.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the easy, matter-of-fact way he said that. She could feel a \u201cbut\u201d in there somewhere, she just had to find it.</p><p>\u201cYou could have at least tried to hide that part of your sex life from the world,\u201d she finally sighed with an edge of irritation.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He sounded genuinely curious now. \u201cKelly, I\u2019m who I am. I don\u2019t hide that, from anyone. I don\u2019t flaunt it. I don\u2019t advertise it. Others have. What happens between you and me I expect will stay between you and me. You don\u2019t advertise yourself, and you won\u2019t advertise our relationship. Why should we do without something we might enjoy because of what others suspect, or think?\u201d</p><p>She hated it when he pulled logic into his arguments with her. He had always done that.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m scared,\u201d she whispered, rolling away from him to sit on the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cOf me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf myself. Of what could happen.\u201d She moved to her feet, pacing away from the bed as she rubbed at the chill that rushed over her arms. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about pushing someone who isn\u2019t sane. And in the same breath...\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to make a decision,\u201d he finished for her. \u201cNot about your safety but about something much more important to you. Your sexuality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a virgin.\u201d Her laughter was self-mocking. \u201cI expected something a little more romantic, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you deserved something a hell of a lot more romantic, Kelly.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBut catching this stalker is more important than romance. And I\u2019m not going to play games with you. From the beginning, we won\u2019t be alone. If it doesn\u2019t happen for you with Dawg and Natches, then we have to at least give the impression of it. We can\u2019t afford to let this guy catch us unawares, I can\u2019t afford to let him hurt you again, because God as my witness, my sanity won\u2019t survive it, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d She pushed her fingers through her hair, turning from him, trying to ignore the fact that she wasn\u2019t insulted, wasn\u2019t offended or furious. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking about this thing with your cousins being a one-time deal, are you?\u201d She kept her back to him, kept her expression hidden.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>The rumors had started when they were in their teens. Three young men with charisma and sexuality, who had been the downfall of a local divorc\u00e9e. It had begun then, at an age that none of the three men would reveal. Too young, Rowdy knew. But damn, it had been hot that summer, and not just from the sun. Loren Barnes had been a quiet, schoolmarmish lady on the outside, but inside she had been hotter than fireworks in July.</p><p>She had taken three uncertain virgin boys and, in a few short months, taught them to be men well before their time. All together. All at once. One soft female body, her approval and cries of pleasure penetrating their lust-hazed minds as they took her lessons and drove her to the brink of passion with them.</p><p>She taught them how to romance, how to tease, how to cajole, how to subtly drive a woman crazy and make her so wet the slick essence of her would dampen her thighs. She had taught them how much more pleasure they could bring together than alone. And to the Mackay boys, that was what it was all about.</p><p>Women were treasures, precious gifts of never-ending excitement, sweetly scented flesh, and mysterious motives. They were a challenge and a comfort, a balm to the soul, and an adventure like nothing else ever created. They were infinitely strong, and yet infinitely vulnerable. Rowdy, Dawg, and Natches had realized years before that alone they couldn\u2019t give the pleasure they could together, but also, they couldn\u2019t protect as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ironically, it was Kelly who taught them that lesson. As a kid, keeping up with her had been practically impossible for just one of them. It took the three of them to keep her safe, to keep her happy as she grew up. Watching for the bullies who liked to pick on her because she was poor, because she was pretty as a picture and sweetly gentle. And they wanted to keep her that way.</p><p>She was also impetuous, defiant, and smart as a whip. There had been nothing sexual involved. She amused them, made them laugh, and challenged them to keep up with her with an innocent thirst for life and adventure that appealed to the teenagers. After her mother married Ray, she was then \u201cfamily,\u201d as well.</p><p>As she grew older, as they grew older, things had slowly shifted for all of them. Four years ago it had come to a head. She had just turned twenty, hotter than fireworks and as tempting as sin itself. The three of them had been a little too drunk, a little too wild that night. And she had been there.</p> <p>\u201cMake up your mind, Rowdy. You don\u2019t put a claim on her, one of us is going to.\u201d Natches\u2019s eyes followed her as she laughed and danced beneath the brilliance of the full summer moon.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still too young.\u201d He denied the need, as well as the challenge.</p><p>\u201cKeeping the local boys off her ass is getting harder,\u201d Dawg muttered. \u201cI\u2019m tired of bruising my knuckles on their thick skulls. Make up your mind. If you don\u2019t intend to keep her, one of us will.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy grimaced, finished his beer, then crumpled the can as he fought to hold onto his control. It was getting harder each time he came home, to stay the hell away from her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too fucking young and the two of you know it,\u201d he snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s not ready for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s old enough to make the choice,\u201d Natches drawled. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to the Marines and that\u2019s fine. But if she\u2019s not willing to wait on you, then we aren\u2019t either. Claim her man, or one of us will.\u201d</p><p>She had been like a fire at midnight. He had to make her want to wait on him. He had to ensure her need for him. And he had done that. But in doing it, he had cemented his need for her.</p><p>As he held her in the darkness of the night, the soft warmth of her pressed into his chest, he knew her earlier protest was the key to her soul. The romance. She needed the romance, she deserved it, but God knew he had no idea how to make it romantic. He could give her pleasure. Enough pleasure to leave her screaming in orgasm, begging for more. But the heart of the woman needed more. A lesson Loren had taught them, but one they had forgotten over the years.</p><p>The women they had drawn to them hadn\u2019t been ones to need the romance, or even want it.</p><p>For the first time in his life Rowdy felt helpless. Eliminating the threat to her was imperative. And he wasn\u2019t going to lie to her. Not Kelly. She deserved more than that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not asleep.\u201d Her whisper was as soft as a breath.</p> <p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d He sighed, knowing her mind had been running as fast as his.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t said much since that final question. She had drawn in a deep, hard breath, informed him she was going to sleep then curled into his arms, and turned out the lights. But she hadn\u2019t gone to sleep anymore than he had.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d she finally asked. He didn\u2019t have to ask what she was talking about. It was a question he had hoped she wouldn\u2019t ask. Yet he had known she would.</p><p>He slid his hand from her hip to her stomach, feeling the muscles flutter beneath his palm.</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s pleasure comes from his woman\u2019s,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBecause we learned how much better it can be for a woman when no part of her body is neglected. Because we learned as young men how much easier it is to protect what\u2019s ours when we work together. Hell, Kelly, I could give you a thousand reasons and none of them would really make sense. Because it\u2019s who we are, what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it end?\u201d He knew where she was going, what she would eventually ask.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want it to. My needs aren\u2019t more important than yours. It won\u2019t be every time. It won\u2019t be an either-or.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for long moments. He closed his eyes, grimacing in painful awareness of the can of worms he had opened.</p> <p>\u201cAnd when they find the women they want for their own? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an either-or,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019ll do nothing you can\u2019t live with, Kelly. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll want to.\u201d Her voice lowered further. \u201cIf Dawg or Natches found a woman they wanted for their own, then you\u2019d want to be a part of it, wouldn\u2019t you, Rowdy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss being a part of it, anymore than you would miss their touch after having had it.\u201d There was no way to reassure her, and God knew he wanted to.</p><p>He felt her flinch against him.</p><p>\u201cYou would touch another woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything that would jeopardize us.\u201d That wasn\u2019t acceptable. \u201cEver. Not at any time.\u201d</p><p>As he stared into the darkness, he thought of her touch, her kiss. Could he touch another woman? At any time?</p><p>\u201cSo it would be my choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would still want to.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He couldn\u2019t lie to her. He wouldn\u2019t lie to her, even though he was terrified of losing her.</p><p>He caressed her abdomen as he held her, as silence filled the room once again.</p><p>\u201cThis might not work.\u201d Her voice trembled with an awareness of what she might be looking at. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do that. I don\u2019t know if I could handle your need to do it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily into her hair, drawing her closer, knowing he could be risking both their hearts with the hungers that tormented him. It was the reason he had left four years before, the reason he couldn\u2019t begin this relationship with anything less than the truth.</p><p>\u201cI can live without it,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could live without you, Kelly. Not now. Not after the years I\u2019ve spent needing you. I\u2019ll give you everything I am, as much as you want. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him then, her soft gray eyes dark in the dim light of the room as he stared into the shadowed expanse of her face.</p><p>\u201cThe first time...\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cHowever you want it.\u201d</p><p>Bonding came in so many ways. He would have had Dawg and Natches there, but he wouldn\u2019t push her. He couldn\u2019t push her. Not now.</p><p>\u201cYou want them there.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew open at the soft statement.</p><p>\u201cI want them there,\u201d he affirmed, knowing her safety demanded nothing less. He ignored the possessiveness raging inside him. \u201cKelly, I want everything for you, and I know that\u2019s hard to understand. The first time, it\u2019s special for a woman. It begins a bonding with her lover, one that never really dies. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve never taken a virgin, never fooled with a woman who didn\u2019t know the score, until you.\u201d</p><p>He felt the shiver that raced over her, the little tremor of fear, or response, he wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to have that, with them?\u201d The uncertainty in her voice, the edge of hurt broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cKelly, listen to me.\u201d He framed the side of her face with his hand, his thumb smoothing over her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do a damned thing that\u2019s going to hurt you or make you uncomfortable. Baby, it won\u2019t be good for me, or for Dawg and Natches, if it isn\u2019t something you want with everything inside you. This is your choice. The perception of it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want it,\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses.\u201d He could feel it in her then, the need to have the choice taken from her, to be seduced. \u201cI\u2019m not making them and I won\u2019t let you. Think about it, Kelly. Decide what you want, what you need. I\u2019m not a kid, and you\u2019ve known me too long to be able to fool yourself about me. You\u2019ve known, you wanted to sugarcoat it, pretend it wasn\u2019t real, but you knew. Now decide what you want, because I won\u2019t make that decision for you. Not now, not ever. I love you, baby, but I can\u2019t love you enough for both of us.\u201d</p><p>He felt her then, her fingers moving against his chest, leaving a path of fire in their wake as they smoothed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cCan you do anything without your cousins?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr do you need their help all the time, Rowdy? Maybe you\u2019re the one making excuses.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Her fingers were at his abdomen now, her nails raking over his flesh, tracing the skin above the waistband of his sweatpants.</p><p>Impetuous. Defiant. An adventure. That was Kelly.</p><p>His hand trapped hers, holding it still against him, his eyes narrowing on her in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere but here,\u201d he growled. \u201cNow go to sleep, minx. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll have our parents hearing us in here screwing our brains out. I\u2019m right fond of keeping my private parts intact if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, flipped around, then horror of all horrors, because his control was edging toward nonexistence, that curvy little ass tucked into his hips, cushioning the raging fullness of his cock. Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Rowdy.\u201d Her husky little purr nearly had him coming in his pants. \u201cMaybe tomorrow we\u2019ll see what you can actually do without your cousins around to approve of it.\u201d</p><p>A grin tilted his lips. Oh, he\u2019d show her all right, in ways she could never imagine.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Kelly stared at the bed as she came from the shower the next morning. It was perfectly made, the flowered comforter smoothed out, the pillows neatly stacked at the headboard. And lying at the bottom of the mattress was clothing she hadn\u2019t worn since the attack.</p><p>The low-rise jeans were patched and faded, and she new exactly how low they were. The waistband barely reached her hipbones, with the snap in the front dipping lower nearly an inch.</p><p>The white vest-style summer shirt rose above her navel, and would reveal the belly ring that lay glittering on top of the shirt. The brilliant green emerald twinkled and gleamed beneath a shaft of sunlight coming in from the window. She had chosen that particular gem because of its resemblance to Rowdy\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Kelly drew in a deep breath before turning her head to stare at Rowdy where he sat in the recliner. Leaning forward, his arms resting on his knees, he watched her silently, emotion swirling in his gaze. Compassion, understanding, determination.</p><p>She stepped closer to the bed, turning back to stare at the clothes. She had been too scared to wear them before, terrified that how she dressed had somehow caused the attack.</p><p>She was still scared, but as she stood there, she realized that the terror that had often filled her before Rowdy\u2019s return wasn\u2019t there now. Just as he had protected her from those bullies years before, she knew he would protect her now.</p><p>She cleared her throat before speaking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain you can catch him? That he\u2019s watching me? Waiting?\u201d She picked up the belly ring, staring down at it intently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain, Kelly.\u201d His voice was dark, deep, confident.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who it is?\u201d She knew Rowdy, and his cousins. And she knew Dawg and Natches had been investigating the attack since it happened.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But we will. He\u2019s not sane enough to hide for long.\u201d</p><p>Could she be a woman again, rather than a child hiding? Kelly admitted, if only silently, that the woman had been protesting the baggy clothes and the lack of adventure for a year now. She was ready to return, just as the psychologist had warned her she would be.</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cI need to go to town today. To the spa.\u201d The intimate waxing had been put off too long.</p><p>Tension began to sizzle in the room. She knew he would know what it meant. Rowdy was an expert on a woman\u2019s body and all the various procedures they used to tempt a man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to drive you in.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cWe could pick up dinner later and go out on the lake.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled roughly before nodding. She could feel her insides quivering with the knowledge that once he got her out on the lake, she would be in his bed.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d she said as she turned back to him slowly.</p> <p>She dropped the towel that covered her, watched his eyes flame, his face flush, and his body come to immediate attention as she stood before him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put in.\u201d She held the belly ring out to him. \u201cWould you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God!\u201d His gaze moved to hers slowly. \u201cDad\u2019s home, Kelly. If I fuck you here, he\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to fuck me, Rowdy.\u201d She kept her voice low, intimate as she moved to him. \u201cI asked you to put the ring in.\u201d She extended her arm, her fingers holding the glittering gem.</p><p>She loved teasing Rowdy, always had. The look in his eyes made her breathless, showed his hunger. It was the reason she had always waited on him, always known she belonged to him. For years, every time he looked at her, he ate her with his eyes, consumed her with the hunger in them. Just as he did now.</p> <p>Without speaking, he moved forward on the chair, spreading his legs before his hand gripped her hips, pulling her to him. His hands were hot on her flesh, sending sizzling impulses of pleasure raking over her nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cGive me the ring.\u201d His expression was heavy with sensual intent as he took the ring from her fingers.</p><p>Kelly stood still, silent as he inserted the curved metal into the tiny hole before snapping the ball end in place. But he didn\u2019t stop touching her there. He positioned the emerald teardrop in place over the entrance to her navel before his fingertips skimmed over her lower belly.</p><p>Her womb convulsed beneath his fingers as pleasure tore through her. Lower, she felt the curves of her pussy dampen further than they already were as her vagina pulsed in heavy need.</p><p>\u201cLook how pretty,\u201d he whispered, his eyes centering between her thighs as her fingers gripped his shoulders and her knees trembled. \u201cYou\u2019re wet for me, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always wet for you. I\u2019ve been wet for you for years, Rowdy,\u201d she informed him, her voice almost a whimper of hunger.</p> <p>She realized then the mistake she had made in teasing him. She was too hungry, needed him too much to tempt what she knew she couldn\u2019t have beneath Ray\u2019s roof.</p><p>She stared down at Rowdy in a haze of need as he shifted, his head coming closer, his lips pressing into her lower belly as she gasped at the contact. Long-fingered hands smoothed down her hips to her thighs, nudging them apart gently before raising his head. He stared at the flushed folds of her mound. His thumb caressed over the tattoo just above her pussy. The eagle in flight, one wing dipping toward her damp flesh.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you, Kelly,\u201d he groaned, his voice roughening further. \u201cI want to lay you down, spread those pretty legs, and lick all that soft syrup from you.\u201d</p><p>Weakness flooded her, taking her breath, her senses, and turning them into one hard ache for just that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet.\u201d The fingers of one hand trailed around her thigh, then slid slowly, so slowly, but with destructive results, through the thick wetness that lay between the soft folds of flesh.</p><p>\u201cRowdy,\u201d she breathed, her fingers sliding to his hair as his head dipped to her belly again. \u201cPlease touch me. Please.\u201d</p><p>She had waited so long, dreamed so desperately of his touch that now that it was happening, she feared it was just another dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do more than touch you, baby,\u201d he whispered as his lips moved closer to the pounding ache of her clit. \u201cI\u2019m going to touch you, taste you, I\u2019m going to make you scream for me, Kelly. Beg for more.\u201d</p> <p>Okay. She could handle that.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She felt his chuckle, the sound rasping, filled with hunger as his fingers circled her clit. Her hips arched forward as a low cry left her lips. Need flamed inside her with an intensity that drove anything else from her mind.</p><p>\u201cShhh, baby,\u201d he groaned, his fingers parting her. \u201cRemember Ray.\u201d</p><p>Ray who?</p><p>His breath whispered over the damp, throbbing bud, sending her senses reeling as a knock sounded at the door. Kelly jerked in Rowdy\u2019s grip as she felt him tense beneath her hold.</p><p>\u201cRowdy, I\u2019m heading out. I need to talk to you before I leave,\u201d Ray called through the thick panel. \u201cGet out here, boy, so I can get to work.\u201d</p><p>She heard his footsteps retreating as Rowdy\u2019s fingers slowly slid from her flesh.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he breathed out, moving her back as he lifted his head to stare back at her. \u201cYou\u2019re dangerous, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d Kelly shook her head as he rose from the chair, his hands smoothing up her back, yet holding her from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the spa,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd later, I\u2019ll show you how much I love having your sweet pussy bare to me. Get dressed, baby, so we can escape for awhile.\u201d</p><p>His lips whispered over hers, ignoring her silent plea for more as her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d he told her again, moving back. \u201cStop driving me crazy, baby. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Okay, two could play this game, Kelly was certain. With narrowed eyes she watched as Rowdy stalked from the bedroom, his body tight with tension and the bulge in his pants so apparent he had pulled the tail of his white cotton shirt free of his pants to cover it. She was sure there was no way Ray wouldn\u2019t be aware of his son\u2019s problem.</p><p>She snickered at the thought of the tough Rowdy squirming beneath his father\u2019s gaze. Ray was a good guy, but she knew how he was. He hadn\u2019t wanted this relationship to develop between her and Rowdy, neither had her mother, though she wasn\u2019t certain why. She had loved Rowdy forever, and despite Ray and her mother\u2019s marriage, she had never understood the reasons for their disapproval.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, dressed and feeling more feminine and less afraid than she had in months, Kelly picked up her phone and called the spa. Marla Reiner, her favorite technician, was available and eager to see Kelly returning to her regular visits. With a little maneuvering, Marla managed to schedule her right in and disconnected the call with a cheery good-bye.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, Kelly placed her hand on her stomach to still the butterflies racing through her system before she moved to her bedroom door and headed downstairs.</p><p>In the back of her mind was the knowledge that nothing would ever be the same from this day on. Once Rowdy had her, she knew what would happen. Questions still plagued her, as did an instinctive discomfort regarding the idea that Rowdy could ever want to touch another woman, no matter the relationship that developed between her and his cousins.</p><p>God, it was so strange having that thought in her mind. It had always stayed distant, an awareness of what could happen if she ever got into Rowdy\u2019s bed. There wouldn\u2019t be just one man, but three pleasuring her. Now that it could be reality, she found herself both curious and hesitant. Aroused and frightened. But Kelly knew she wasn\u2019t willing to draw back. Maybe she was different, maybe she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>For years rumors had abounded of the Mackay cousins. Women whispered their names with naughty pleasure at the thought of them. Her friends had jokingly informed her that she was insane for not moving into Dawg\u2019s or Natches\u2019s bed while Rowdy was in the service.</p><p>She could have. But deep inside she knew that who her heart belonged to made a difference. Alone, Dawg and Natches held no appeal for her. But with Rowdy...</p><p>She stepped into the kitchen, watching as he turned to face her, his deep green eyes approving, and hungry.</p><p>She belonged to Rowdy.</p><p>God, she was gorgeous. Rowdy couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her as he drove the truck into Somerset, listening to her soft voice relating the local gossip.</p><p>Johnny Flowers traded wives with his worst enemy, Buck Layne. Crista Jansen was back home and had moved into her parents\u2019 home place outside of town. No one knew why she had returned to town after years away, but everyone was gossiping about it. Rowdy bet Dawg was interested in that one. He had been hot as hell for Crista before she ran off to college eight years before.</p><p>One of Rowdy\u2019s old girlfriends now owned the caf\u00e9 he and Dawg and Natches had frequented before Rowdy left, and for the most part, for all the things that had changed, everything was pretty much the same. It was one of the things Rowdy loved about home. It was familiar, endearing.</p><p>Lake Cumberland was a place of mystery and beauty, and the small towns that surrounded it were filled with friends and family and memories that had gotten him through the last eight years in the service.</p><p>And memories of Kelly.</p><p>He glanced at her again, the light reflecting off the emerald at her pretty belly drawing his gaze again. It made his dick hard. Damn, he was dying for her, his cock was throbbing in his jeans and his mouth watering for the taste of her.</p><p>He entered the city limits, navigating the summer traffic as he drove to the popular spa the women in town seemed to flock to.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d He pulled into an empty space in front of the entrance and turned to her. \u201cI programmed my number into your cell phone; call me before you leave. I\u2019m meeting Dawg and Natches at the caf\u00e9 up the street, so I won\u2019t be far.\u201d</p><p>Those kissable lips curved into a slow, promising smile as she leaned close.</p><p>\u201cI bet I could walk down the street all by myself, Rowdy,\u201d she whispered teasingly, sending a jolt of fear to slice through his soul.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant his voice to be so harsh, but the slight flinch and the spark of fear and anger that filled her eyes assured him he was much harsher than he intended to be.</p><p>Rowdy drew in a quick, hard breath before pushing his fingers through his hair, frustration eating him alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby,\u201d he growled, his voice still rougher than he wanted. \u201cDon\u2019t scare me like that. Give me a while, okay?\u201d He gave her a quick, comforting smile. \u201cLet me protect you, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>She sat against the door now, her gray eyes quiet, her expression closed until she glanced away and lowered her head.</p><p>\u201cI understand, Rowdy,\u201d she finally sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019m tired of hiding.\u201d She turned back to him, a frown edging at her brows. \u201cI\u2019m tired of letting him win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly, promise me you\u2019ll call me before you leave.\u201d He reached out to her, his fingers running down her cheek, feeling the small quiver of response that ran through her. \u201cDon\u2019t fight me on this, please. He\u2019s a madman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy.\u201d She brushed his hand away as she glared back at him. \u201cI\u2019ll call you, Rowdy. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to try anything in broad daylight. It would be too risky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut we can\u2019t be certain, either. Until I know what we\u2019re dealing with, we\u2019re going to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says the man who wants to poke at the crazy person by letting him think I\u2019m taking on the Mackay cousins all at once,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI think walking down the street is a hell of a lot safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly why you shouldn\u2019t be walking down the street alone,\u201d he pointed out softly. \u201cHe knows I have you now, Kelly. Which means Dawg and Natches aren\u2019t far behind, in his eyes. From here on out, we can\u2019t underestimate him; we take nothing for granted.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy forcibly tamped down the violence rising inside him. He knew if he ever managed to get hold of the bastard who dared to touch her, then he would kill him. There would be nothing left for justice to convict.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll call you before I leave,\u201d she snapped with a spark of anger he couldn\u2019t blame her for. \u201cBut don\u2019t take forever to pick me up, if you don\u2019t mind. I have a few other things I\u2019d like to do while I\u2019m in town. And I\u2019d appreciate a little less paranoia until he actually shows that he is stalking me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached out to grip the door handle. Just as fast Rowdy caught her arm, causing her to turn back to him. His hand moved, his fingers threading through her hair as he drew her head back and captured her lips quickly with his.</p><p>Summer heat, lightning, and the sweet taste of a woman\u2019s passion met his hunger, tightening his gut with lust. He couldn\u2019t wait to get her beneath him. At that moment, nothing mattered except getting through the rest of the day until he could get her to the houseboat and the large bed awaiting them there.</p><p>He forced himself to release her seconds later, staring into her dazed features with a satisfaction so intense it caused his balls to tighten.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d She smiled despite the chastisement, her cheeks flushed with warmth and her breathing ragged.</p><p>\u201cSure it was,\u201d he whispered, pulling back from her, despite the need to wrap her in his arms and run away with her. He wanted to hide her. To make certain no one could ever touch her again. \u201cI need to touch you, babe. That\u2019s always fair considering how long I\u2019ve waited to do it.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at that before pushing her fingers through her hair and flashing him a disgruntled look. \u201cNo one made you wait.\u201d</p><p>She was out of the truck before he could stop her, tossing him a cheery smile before crossing the sidewalk and entering the spa.</p><p>Rowdy breathed out roughly. She was going to be the death of him, there was just no other way around it. With her shining innocence, tempting eyes, and sweetly rounded body, he knew she was capable of making him curse as often as he sighed in need.</p> <p>He gave his head a quick jerk before reversing from the parking spot and driving farther down the street to the caf\u00e9 he had told Dawg and Natches to meet him in.</p><p>Reginald\u2019s Caf\u00e9 was newly remodeled, the inside cool and welcoming as he entered. Dawg and Natches were waiting at one of the back tables, steaming cups of coffee sitting in front of them.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout time you got here, cuz,\u201d Dawg grunted as he slid into the chair across from him. \u201cI thought we were gonna have to come down there and rescue Kelly from your clutches ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Natches chuckled as Rowdy leaned back in his chair and watched his cousin curiously. Dawg had changed over the years, more than any of them, Rowdy sometimes thought. He was darker, despite the joviality, quieter than he used to be.</p><p>Rowdy didn\u2019t know what had happened during the years he spent in the Marines, but it had affected his cousin. Natches was just as lazy as always, his smile quiet, his eyes watchful. Of course, none of them were as relaxed, as carefree as they used to be.</p><p>There was a darkness in them that had always lurked just beneath the surface. A difference that separated them from other men, made them appear wilder, more dangerous. And in ways they were more dangerous. They had proved that overseas.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Rowdy could tell there was more going on than a general bad mood.</p><p>Dawg leaned forward, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYou had company outside the house last night.\u201d Dawg\u2019s voice was low. \u201cOn that little knob above the house that looks into Kelly\u2019s room. I was checking it out this morning before heading here. He must have been there all night. The grass was indented where he sat, with claw marks at the side where the bastard dug his fingers into the ground. He\u2019s getting pissed.\u201d</p><p>Hell. Rowdy had known Kelly\u2019s attacker was watching, waiting. He just hadn\u2019t been certain where, or how.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go from here, Rowdy?\u201d Natches watched him with a spark of excitement in his eyes that Rowdy knew was as much to the thought of a good fight as to the chance of touching Kelly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her back to the boat this evening,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe\u2019ll head out to the cove. We should be staying the night. We\u2019ll see how brave he wants to get. We\u2019ll have dinner on the boat. Let the bastard think we\u2019re all having a fine time. After dark the two of you can slip on shore and I\u2019ll pull farther out into the water. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p><p>Dawg and Natches nodded somberly. They were waiting, watchful, their bodies now on high alert. Not that anyone else would have noticed the change.</p><p>They paused as the waitress moved toward them, her steps slow, her head down, waves of burnished chestnut curls pulled into a low ponytail, her classically pretty features stiff and tense.</p> <p>Rowdy cocked his head at the woman. Crista Jensen kept her head carefully lowered as she refilled the coffee cups before turning to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me if I wanted anything to eat, Crista.\u201d Dawg surprised them all with his mocking drawl. \u201cDidn\u2019t Jenny warn you to look after us good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Dawg,\u201d Natches muttered, his voice low but easy to hear.</p><p>Rowdy watched as Crista pulled the ordering pad from the back pocket of her jeans, a pencil from behind her ear and watched Dawg with a spark of anger. Dawg stared back at her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to order, Dawg?\u201d Her words were gritted, her voice raspy.</p><p>\u201cEh. Nothing right now, but be sure to check back in a few minutes.\u201d Dawg\u2019s smile was all teeth, a predatory snarl if Rowdy had ever seen one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to do that.\u201d Crista\u2019s smile was no less antagonistic as she returned the order pad to the back pocket of her jeans, picked up the coffeepot, and stalked away.</p><p>The minute her back turned, Dawg\u2019s eyes narrowed and a flash of anger seared the depths as he rose to his feet, dug into his pocket, and slapped a few dollars to the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the marina,\u201d he snapped before stalking from the caf\u00e9.</p><p>Rowdy watched, perplexed, before turning to Natches.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDawg in heat,\u201d Natches snickered. \u201cShe won\u2019t give him the time of day.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy glanced to the woman in question and restrained his smile as he noticed her gaze, centered squarely on Dawg as he stormed from the caf\u00e9. Sad, weary, her expression marked with indecision. Yeah, she was giving him the time of day, perhaps more than the big lug deserved.</p><p>Now this was an interesting development.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are we playing tonight? One on one or is she ready for all of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly will let us know what she wants.\u201d Rowdy shifted his shoulders, a primitive surge of something akin to possessiveness rising inside him as Natches watched him curiously.</p><p>That was strange. He was one second from baring his teeth and daring Natches to touch Kelly. He knew the pleasure the three of them could bring her, versus the pleasure he alone could bestow. So what the fuck was his problem all of a sudden?</p><p>Shit. He could feel the back of his neck prickling as irritation began to surge inside him.</p><p>\u201cWaiting on her has been a bitch,\u201d Natches grimaced, his light green eyes gleaming with lustful determination. \u201cShe\u2019s going to go up in flames\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Natches.\u201d Rowdy lifted his coffee cup to his lips, glaring at his cousin across the table as Crista moved to a table close to them.</p><p>Natches watched the woman, his expression considering.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s up with that one,\u201d he sighed. \u201cDawg has been like a bear with a sore tail ever since she arrived back in town. She didn\u2019t even let the family know she was coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her husband? Didn\u2019t she marry some guy from Virginia?\u201d</p><p>Natches shook his head. \u201cShe was engaged for awhile. Guess it fell through.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy almost breathed a sigh of relief that the conversation had moved from Kelly. He was going to have to figure this out. Now wasn\u2019t a time to be hedging between desires, dammit. But he was hedging, and he knew it.</p><p>He glanced at Crista Jansen again, narrowing his eyes. Dawg had had a thing for the other woman for years. She had always managed to resist his charms, his attempts to talk to her, to seduce here.</p><p>Rowdy and Natches had watched him attempt to bargain for a single date from her for nearly a year before they joined the Marines, and Natches had related that the first thing Dawg had gone looking for when he came home from the service was Crista. Only to learn she had left Somerset.</p><p>Could he fuck her? Rowdy turned his gaze back to the Formica-topped table and sipped from his coffee again. A year ago, he could have, easily. The thought of having her between himself and his two cousins would have had his dick perking in interest.</p><p>His dick wasn\u2019t interested. He frowned. Hell, there was no excitement, period. He stared back at her.</p><p>She was pretty enough. Nicely rounded. She moved a little self-consciously, as though not quite comfortable with what she was doing.</p><p>Her face was a rounded oval, her skin clear and silky-looking. Nice hair. But he wasn\u2019t interested. He wasn\u2019t aroused. As a matter of fact, the urge to get up and leave the caf\u00e9 was so damned strong it was all he could do to stay in place.</p><p>He should have been practically drooling at the thought of helping Dawg and Natches fuck her to oblivion. They were sure as hell hot enough at the thought of fucking Kelly.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you two anything else?\u201d Crista refilled the coffee cup, her expression resigned for some reason as she glanced at Dawg\u2019s chair.</p><p>\u201cAn explanation would be nice.\u201d Rowdy lifted his head, watching her closely as she seemed to pale.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDawg\u2019s been chasing you for years, Crista. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Crista\u2019s eyes burned with anger as she slowly tucked the ordering pad into her back pocket and glared at him furiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a plaything for the three of you,\u201d she snarled then, surprising him and Natches. \u201cIf you cared for anything past yourselves then you damned well wouldn\u2019t expect it. You\u2019d grow the hell up and get over it.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was hoarse as tears sheened her eyes before she blinked them back furiously.</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThe three of you might as well be clones of each other. You can\u2019t even breathe alone.\u201d</p><p>Turning, she stalked back to the register where two customers waited, her fingers stabbing at the input keys as she flicked a scornful glance back at them.</p><p>\u201cHave I been gone too long?\u201d Rowdy turned back to Natches, gratified to see the same surprise reflecting in his face.</p><p>\u201cDamn, and she used to be such a nice, quiet little girl,\u201d Natches grumped as he scratched at his chin.</p><p>Rowdy snorted at the description. Crista had been anything but nice and quiet and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem breathing without your help.\u201d Rowdy grinned as he finished his coffee.</p><p>\u201cDamned good thing.\u201d Natches shook his head as he peeked another look back at the little waitress, a frown pulling at his brow. \u201cHell, you\u2019ve been gone eight years, Rowdy, and other than a few times you were home, me and Dawg\u2019s been pretty damned tame. What the hell has her by the ear anyway?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy shook his head as he glanced at his empty coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s going to bring us more coffee?\u201d he asked ruefully.</p><p>Both men looked back at the woman, estimating their chances for caffeine.</p><p>\u201cIf she knows what\u2019s good for her.\u201d Natches\u2019s grin was wicked. \u201cOr else, I might have to call Dawg back to sweet-talk her for us.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy chuckled, though when he glanced back at Crista he could feel the frown tugging at his brow again. The fact that Dawg wanted her should have been all it took to produce a raging hard-on and more than a surfeit of interest. Instead, all he felt was an edge of sadness. Their lifestyle, the very truth of their sexuality stood between Dawg and a woman Rowdy knew had to be more than interested in the other man.</p><p>Women didn\u2019t get that upset if they weren\u2019t interested. If they didn\u2019t care. Crista Jansen cared\u2014it had been there in her eyes, in her anger. But he had to agree with one thing. She wasn\u2019t the type of woman who would willingly share her man, anymore than Kelly was. And that was the clincher. She was a woman worth keeping, a one-man woman. And she needed a one-woman man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TWELVE</p><p>Kelly waited at the door of the spa, watching as Rowdy pulled into the parking area in the pickup. She felt naughty as she waited for him, her body waxed and buffed, smoothed and lotioned.</p><p>As he stepped out of the pickup she pushed open the door and moved out to meet him, returning his smile as she felt the flush across her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d He opened the passenger-side door as she neared the truck, his green eyes intent as he watched her closely.</p><p>\u201cAll ready.\u201d Her voice trembled, dammit. Then she trembled all over as his hands gripped her hips and he lifted her into the seat of the truck.</p><p>She could feel the blush deepening in her face.</p><p>\u201cDamn, that blush is pretty.\u201d Rowdy cupped her face, turning her face to him for a quick kiss and a wicked grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re bad,\u201d she laughed as he moved back, winking at her before closing the door and heading back to the driver\u2019s side.</p> <p>Within seconds, the interior of the truck was once again filled with his scent. Male. No cologne. Just the scent of primal heat teasing her senses.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asked as he slid the vehicle into reverse and pulled out of the parking spot.</p><p>\u201cStarved.\u201d Her stomach was convinced she hadn\u2019t eaten in weeks.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we pick up a few greasy cheeseburgers and fries and head out to the boat for awhile?\u201d He suggested smoothly, glancing at her from the corner of his eye as she felt her heart race.</p><p>Alone on the boat with Rowdy? And he had to ask?</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d She nodded as her thighs clenched and her breasts suddenly felt heavier, more sensitive.</p> <p>There was something in his expression that warned her he was tired of waiting. A ready stillness, a tension. Rowdy had shown amazing restraint to this point. She had a feeling that patience had come to an abrupt end.</p><p>\u201cWill we be taking the boat out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The marina is pretty empty today,\u201d he said as he made a quick turn into a local fast-food restaurant. \u201cI thought we\u2019d eat, laze around, drink a few beers, and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk,\u201d she repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cAnd other things.\u201d There was no smile this time, no teasing, no edging around what they both wanted as he stared back at her. \u201cStill want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Kelly stared back at him, trying to regulate her breathing, to still the excitement climbing inside her.</p><p>He nodded slowly before turning his gaze back to the drive-thru he was pulling up beside.</p><p>Good to his word, he ordered greasy cheeseburgers, several of them, and masses of fries.</p> <p>They were silent as he pulled forward, paid for the food, and collected the bag before driving back onto the road. Kelly watched the miles pass, staying quiet. She had waited for this, for too long she sometimes thought. And now, knowing that the waiting was nearly at an end, she could feel her nerves rocketing.</p><p>She was a virgin. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell she knew near enough about the male body to please him the first time. Suddenly, she almost regretted waiting. Maybe she should have gone for some kind of experience, but there had been no desire to become intimate with the men she had dated.</p><p>Not that she normally dated them long. Dawg and Natches were always too close, always butting their noses into her dates. She had found it amusing over the years, but now she wondered if she should have put a stop to it. Should have at least tried to learn how to please a man.</p><p>She wanted to please Rowdy. She wanted to know how to touch him, how to excite him.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying so much,\u201d he chastised gently as they neared the marina.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worrying.\u201d She forced a smile to her face. She was not going to act like a nervous teenager.</p><p>He snorted at her denial, his gaze knowing as he glanced at her again. \u201cI know you, Kelly. You\u2019re sitting over there biting a hole in your lip. That means you\u2019re worrying.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Busted.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything, Rowdy Mackay.\u201d She stuck her tongue out at him as she tossed her head defiantly. \u201cYou just think you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know damned near everything about you,\u201d he argued, his lips pulling into a sensual smile as he turned the truck along the lakefront road. \u201cWhen you\u2019re biting your lip like that, you\u2019re worrying. And there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to happen between us that you need to worry about. Anticipate maybe.\u201d There was that wicked smile again. \u201cBut nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Her face heated again. Damn him. Blushing was not her favorite thing to do.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do if Ray comes out to the boat to check on us?\u201d She leaned back in her seat and regarded him in amusement now. \u201cYou know how overprotective he gets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad had to drive to Louisville this morning.\u201d Satisfaction filled his voice. \u201cYour mom went with him. They have the Colberts minding the store and pumps while they\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo while the cat\u2019s away the mouse gets to play, huh?\u201d she asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cMouse?\u201d He frowned back playfully. \u201cSweetheart, trust me here, there ain\u2019t no mice on my boat. But the big bad wolf might end up devouring a certain little lamb for sure.\u201d</p><p>Kelly couldn\u2019t help the laugh that bubbled from her throat as Rowdy pulled into the parking slot nearest the entrance to the upper end of the docks. The locked gate was normally for maintenance only, but the Mackay cousins used it rather than walking the distance along the docks to the main entrance.</p><p>He laid his forearms over the steering wheel as he turned to look at her then, his green eyes capturing hers as all amusement fled his expression. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>Kelly inhaled slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for years, Rowdy. You\u2019re the one that took his own sweet time.\u201d</p><p>He was dying for her. Rowdy clenched his teeth as he placed his hand at Kelly\u2019s back and led her along the floating dock to the Nauti Buoy. At this rate, his cock was going to permanently carry the imprint of his zipper. Every step he took the scent of her filled his head; beneath his hand the silken feel of her flesh tortured his senses.</p><p>In his other hand he carried the food, which meant he was going to wait to consume Kelly. And waiting wasn\u2019t high on his list of priorities today.</p><p>The knowledge that the bastard who had attacked her was watching her burned at him. The son of a bitch. Rowdy had known he was watching, could feel it, but the proof of it sent fury surging through his veins.</p><p>Just five minutes with the bastard, he thought, that was all he needed. Hell five seconds. Just long enough to relish hearing the son of a bitch\u2019s neck break. Rowdy swore if he got his hands on the man who dared to hurt her, he would die. Never, not ever, would he threaten Kelly again.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your cousins?\u201d Kelly asked as they neared the Nauti Dawg. Rowdy\u2019s boat was now sitting between Dawg\u2019s and Natches\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask their schedule.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>They were around, watching. Seeing who was paying attention to the three boats now parked off to themselves in the temporary docks normally reserved for those boats waiting transporting out of the lake. Later tonight they would be positioned on the hill above the house instead. It was time to catch this bastard, before he went completely off the deep end.</p><p>He swore he felt a shiver race up her spine and hid his smile. Kelly was curious, but wary. Until he let her know Dawg and Natches wouldn\u2019t be there, she hadn\u2019t totally relaxed with him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I would push them on you, Kelly?\u201d He asked softly as they stepped onto the Nauti Buoy and he unlocked the glass sliding doors.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d She shrugged as he glanced over at her. \u201cAnd I do know how to say \u2018no,\u2019 Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>But would she say \u2018no\u2019? It was something he hadn\u2019t wanted to think about. He deliberately didn\u2019t think about it simply because each time the subject came up he got heartburn. He\u2019d never had heartburn a day in his life, but lately, it was becoming a daily malady.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you know how to say no,\u201d he grunted as he sat the food on the table and turned back to her. \u201cThat\u2019s what you told me every time I tried to get you to help me in the yard when you were younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTried to con me into doing the yard myself.\u201d She gave him a knowing look. \u201cTry another one hotshot. I knew your tricks. You would leave me to it and disappear with your buddies without worrying about me following you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, but he wasn\u2019t fooling her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so misunderstood.\u201d He shook his head as he neared her, his lashes lowered, his expression just sexy as hell as he passed her.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d She jumped as the palm of his hand landed on her butt before he locked the doors then pulled the heavy drapes over the glass.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for being sassy.\u201d He laughed at her frown. \u201cGet over here and eat, woman, then you can show me your wax job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a car, Rowdy.\u201d She rolled her eyes despite the flaming awareness sizzling through her body.</p><p>She tried not to stare at him, tried not to sink into the brilliance of those green eyes, glittering with hunger and emotion. But it was damned hard not to.</p><p>The jeans he was wearing conformed to his hard thighs and emphasized the mouthwatering bulge between them. The shirt he wore stretched across his broad chest and molded to his hard abs. If there was an ounce of fat on his body she couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sugar girl.\u201d His voice lowered as he moved to the table, turning on the small light hanging overhead. \u201cYou empty the bag and I\u2019ll get the beer.\u201d</p><p>Beer and cheeseburgers. Kelly couldn\u2019t remember a meal she had enjoyed more as she sat across from Rowdy and talked. They argued. They always argued. Over the weather signs, the best fishing holes, and life in general.</p><p>\u201cI think you disagree with me just to have something to do,\u201d Rowdy finally laughed as she tossed a French fry at his head.</p><p>\u201cProbably. I\u2019d hate for you to confuse me with all those women who swoon at your feet and beg for your attention,\u201d she pointed out before finishing her beer and setting the bottle aside. \u201cYou\u2019re spoiled, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was spoiled.\u201d He sat back in his chair and looked at her. He just looked at her, his gaze intent now rather than teasing or flirting. \u201cI remember the day I realized you were turning into a woman,\u201d he finally said softly, his voice deepening. \u201cYou were going out with that little prick Charlie Dayne. Your skirt was too short, your legs too tanned and you wearing the necklace I had bought you that Christmas. That damned little heart was laying right on the upper curve of your breast because that shirt was cut too low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to get Mom to make me change clothes.\u201d She remembered. She remembered seeing his eyes that day, seeing the wild fire in them that nearly stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou were sixteen fucking years old,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd all I could think about\u201d\u2014he shook his head\u2014\u201cI should have been shot for what I was thinking, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about you then too.\u201d She was mesmerized by the fire in his eyes now. \u201cI only went out with Charlie because I knew you didn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDonnie Winters?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward with a little snicker. \u201cHe liked you more than he liked me. He thought you were hot, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>He blinked back at her before realization dawned in his eyes. \u201cYou little minx.\u201d He shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI had six months of free hand washes for my car at his parents\u2019 car detailing shop simply because he got to see you without your shirt on.\u201d She laughed, moving cautiously from the table as he leaned forward in his chair, obviously remembering the fact that he had been outside working on his car that day. Shirtless. And the date had been unexpected, a spur of the moment decision Kelly had made.</p><p>\u201cYou sold my body for a few car washes?\u201d He asked slowly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelly giggled. \u201cA few? Hey stud, one a week for six months. I told you, you were hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to paddle your ass.\u201d He came out of his chair, watching carefully as she backed away from him, trying not to laugh at the outrage in his expression.</p><p>\u201cHe went on all evening about the sweat dripping down your chest, Rowdy,\u201d she snickered. \u201cI think he was more impressed than I was.\u201d She shrieked as he bounded over the table, turned, and tried to run.</p><p>There was no place to run, and controlling her laughter enough to actually fend him off was impossible, especially once his fingers found the ultrasensitive ticklish areas in her sides and sent her to the floor as she fought his attacking fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Don\u2019t you tickle me,\u201d she cried breathlessly, rolling, bucking against him as he came over her, his teeth bared in a laughing growl as he caught her hands, stretching them over her head, and stared her down with mocking retribution.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that, Kelly,\u201d he promised wickedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, stud?\u201d She blew him an air kiss before collapsing in giggles again as he tickled down her side.</p><p>\u201cI surrender,\u201d she laughed breathlessly, twisting beneath him, desperate to escape the fingers. \u201cI promise. I promise. I surrender.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stilled, but he didn\u2019t move. Her eyes opened, the laughter dying on her lips at the hunger in his face. He was doing nothing to hide it now, nothing to dilute it. And it stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cRowdy,\u201d she whispered his name, her heart suddenly slamming against her ribs as his gaze dropped to the buttons of her blouse.</p><p>\u201cYou were sixteen years old,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd all I could think about was doing this.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered, his lips pressing to the upper swell of one breast as his tongue licked over it. Velvet flames rasped over her flesh as a shock of sensation slammed into her womb.</p><p>\u201cAnd this.\u201d His head lifted. \u201cOpen your lips for me baby, let me show you why I had to run has hard and as fast as I could run.\u201d</p><p>He kept hold of her arms, keeping them stretched above her head, helpless beneath him, restrained as his lips lowered and stole her breath.</p><p>Heat flamed through her, ripping across nerve endings and destroying any sense of control as his lips slanted across hers in a kiss guaranteed to wipe every thought from her mind except for thoughts of him.</p><p>Kelly arched to him, a broken moan leaving her lips as his tongue laved the lower curve, slipped in to tease hers then retreated as he bestowed a series of deep, short kisses that had her begging for more.</p><p>\u201cGod, the taste of you,\u201d he whispered before licking at her lips again. \u201cYou make me hungrier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life, Kelly. You make me lose my mind with my need for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle that,\u201d she panted, breathless, on fire for him now. \u201cLose your mind some more now.\u201d</p><p>She arched her neck as his lips slid down it, his free hand moving to the small buttons of her blouse and slowly, too slowly, pushing them through the buttonholes as his lips followed the path he was revealing.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Rowdy,\u201d she moaned as his teeth raked over the sensitive chord in her neck as her blouse parted, revealing the white lace bra she had worn beneath it.</p><p>Sexy and silky, the bra was bought with Rowdy in mind during his last trip home.</p><p>\u201cSweet Kelly,\u201d he groaned as his lips traveled to the valley of her breasts, his tongue licking at the curves as he then flicked open the little closure at the front of the bra.</p> <p>She was going to explode. She was going to melt. Kelly could feel the perspiration gathering on her body as tension tightened her and arousal prepared her.</p><p>\u201cSuch pretty breasts. And sweet, sweet hard little nipples.\u201d His fingers pulled back the cup of her bra to reveal one swollen curve, peaked with a tight, reddened nipple. \u201cLike perfect ripe little berries.\u201d</p><p>When his tongue curled around the peak and drew it in his mouth, Kelly was certain she lost her mind. Stars exploded behind her closed eyelids and a whimpering moan tore from her throat as he began to suckle.</p><p>It was so good it was killing her. Her head twisted against the carpet as she strained beneath him, desperate to be free as the pleasure began to tear through her body.</p><p>She didn\u2019t just feel the draw of his mouth on that nipple, but an echo of it in the other nipple. Fingers of sensation trailed to her womb, then ricocheted to her clit and beyond. The slow, sweet suction erupted in pinpoints of flames throughout her body and left her gasping, nearly incoherent beneath the caress.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re sweet.\u201d Rough. Hoarse. The obvious hunger and need in his voice left her weak even as her nerve endings sizzled with unbearable heat.</p><p>This was what she had dreamed of, waited on. Rowdy holding her, his voice husky, his desire for her obvious in each touch, each kiss.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she begged as he stroked his cheek over the sensitized nipple. \u201cNot yet.\u201d She would hate to have to kill him.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he growled. \u201cNot ever. But I won\u2019t take you here.\u201d</p><p>Before she could catch him, pull him back to her, he was on his feet and lifting her body against his. The room seemed to tilt, the world around her shaking as his lips covered hers again and his hard arms lifted her against him.</p><p>Tension radiated in the air around them as she realized the world was tilting because he was lifting her in his arms. It was shaking because he was moving quickly to the steps that led to the bedroom upstairs. Then it stilled, and only the fireworks remained as she felt the mattress beneath her back and Rowdy coming over her.</p><p>Her breath caught at the feel of his big, heavy body above her, sheltering her, protecting her. As long as Rowdy was near, then she would always be safe. And warm. Hot even.</p><p>She arched against him as he drew the blouse and the strap of her bra from one shoulder, his lips caressing her skin with heated strokes as he undressed her.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of your soft, waxed flesh has tormented me today,\u201d he growled as he lifted her, his hands pulling the clothing from her body as her head fell back on her shoulders to allow his lips to caress her neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how bad I want to bury my lips between your legs?\u201d He nipped at the rounded curve of her breast as he tossed the shirt and bra to the side and lowered her back to the mattress. \u201cSo bad, Kelly, that I stay hard thinking about the taste of you.\u201d</p><p>His voice was rough, deep. The dark timbre sent shivers racing over her body as she trembled beneath him, her hands reaching up to touch his bare shoulders while his fingers went to the button of her jeans.</p><p>Sharp explosions of sensation began to vibrate through her clit, her vagina, as a maelstrom of pleasure whipped through her body.</p><p>Finally. God, finally he was touching her as she needed to be touched, holding her, sliding the jeans and thong from her to bare the sensitive, damp folds of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cGod. Oh hell, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened at the serrated sound of his voice, her lashes fluttering over her eyes as she focused on his face. His expression was primal, intent as he stared between her thighs before lifting his gaze to hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet for me.\u201d His hand reached out, his fingers running through the drenched slit as she arched, a broken cry leaving her lips at the wake of fire that trailed with his touch.</p><p>Then she lost her breath entirely as he brought those fingers to his lips, tasting her, his gaze deepening, his eyes growing brighter as he suddenly moved from the bed, his hands going to his own jeans.</p><p>Within seconds he was naked, his hard body gleaming with sweat, the engorged crest of his erection glistening with pre-come.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you,\u201d she whispered then, lifting up, reaching for him, desperate for him.</p><p>He was hard. Heavy. Her fingers wrapped around the base of his cock and her head lowered, her tongue swiping over the engorged head.</p><p>Oh he liked that. The mushroomed head pulsed and spilled a glistening droplet of pre-come. Which she had to lick off. Taste.</p><p>\u201cPut it in your mouth.\u201d His hands were in her hair now, his green eyes glittering with lust. \u201cSuck it, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her lips opened slowly as he pressed the thickly flared head against them, cupping over it as it slid into the warmth of her mouth.</p><p>A tight grimace pulled at his lips. \u201cFuck yeah. God, you look pretty. So sweet and pretty.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swiped her tongue over the throbbing crest, moaning at the dark, erotic taste of his flesh as he began to move, to thrust in small, easy movements against her lips as she began to suck delicately.</p><p>It was so good. So sexy. Her gaze was locked on his, her mouth filled with his erection as her hands stroked the straining shaft.</p><p>It was the stuff of fantasies. His hands pulling at her hair, burying his cock almost to her throat while his muscles strained from hunger. Hunger for her. For her touch. For her body.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, baby. I can\u2019t come yet. Oh, God, not yet.\u201d He held her back, controlling her needy denial as he pulled his cock from her lips. One hand pressed her back to the bed as he moved between her thighs once again. \u201cLet me have you first, Kelly. Just this once, baby.\u201d</p><p>His hands restrained her gently, pressing her back to the bed as his head lowered to the wet folds between her thighs, and her senses ignited.</p><p>His tongue rasped over the bare, tender flesh with the softest stroke, licking at her, burning her with each touch as she fought to get closer.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. She needed more.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d Her wail of need tore from her throat as his tongue flickered around her clit, sending pulsating, fiery fingers of sensation wrapping around the tight bundle of nerves. Kelly strained closer, her head thrashing on the bed as her hands dug into his hair and she fought to hold him to her.</p><p>Just another second. She knew if he would linger right there, right where the pleasure burned deeper, then the agonizing need tearing through her would ease.</p><p>Just another second.</p><p>She cried out again as he hummed against her flesh, his hands parting her legs further before she felt the slightest pressure at the entrance to her vagina. A parting, a caress that sent her senses spinning.</p><p>\u201cRowdy, please...please...\u201d She couldn\u2019t hold back the pleas, the need for release.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet,\u201d he crooned against her clit, causing her to jerk, to arch, the terrible need tormenting her only growing by the second now.</p><p>Wicked electric arcs of pleasure whipped over her flesh as perspiration began to cover her body and the hunger straining in every cell drove her closer to the brink. She needed. She ached.</p><p>She screamed as his lips covered her clit, his tongue flickering as he suckled at her flesh and stars exploded before her closed eyes.</p><p>Release was cataclysmic; it erupted inside her, drawing her muscles tight, pulling her upper body forward as she fought for something to hold onto, to find a sense of balance. A balance that couldn\u2019t exist within the fiery ecstasy overtaking her.</p><p>\u201cJesus! Kelly.\u201d Rowdy rose fiercely between her thighs, a hazy image invading her senses as she stared back at him, dazed, uncomprehending until she felt the sudden, thick pressure parting her, pressing against the convulsing entrance to her vagina.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d She couldn\u2019t scream, she could barely speak. \u201cPlease. Please...\u201d</p><p>Her hands gripped his wrists now, her upper body still tense, tight, lifting to him as her gaze dropped between her thighs. There, straining, thick, his cock pressed against her as his hips began to press closer.</p><p>\u201cRowdy.\u201d The thin, pleading sound of her own voice was unfamiliar to her ears.</p><p>\u201cEasy. Easy, baby.\u201d He was panting, his hard abs flexing, thighs tightening.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help watching, seeing the thick length of his erection, the heavy veins throbbing, the tight flesh steel hard and iron hot. \u201cNow.\u201d She lifted closer, moaning in painful need as her flesh began to stretch.</p><p>\u201cKelly. Baby.\u201d His cock slid in deeper, the dark crest disappearing inside her and causing the untouched muscles to convulse as the dampness increased, easing his way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes lifted to his, seeing the color blazing from within his dark face, his expression a grimace of painful pleasure.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear the waiting. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The sudden jolt of his hips buried him deeper as Kelly shuddered at the tight penetration, her head hitting the mattress as her hips lifted closer.</p> <p>She was consumed with pleasure. It burned through her nerve endings, clenched her womb, convulsed her vagina, and demanded satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Her hips lifted in a sharp, quick move as he fought to penetrate her slowly, to ease inside her. She didn\u2019t want ease. She wanted the burn, the destructive, flaming pleasure she could feel building inside her.</p><p>And it came. The sudden upthrust buried his flesh deeper inside her, breaking through her virginity, sending a burst of rapture, sharp and much too short, through her system.</p><p>\u201cFuck! Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. Oh God...yes. Please, Rowdy.\u201d She twisted beneath him, fighting the tighter hold on her hips, the sudden restraint as he paused above her. \u201cPlease. Fuck me. Fuck me now...\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t scream; all she could do was lose her breath as he drew back then filled her, impaled her. Buried the full length of his cock inside her before he came over her, gripping her hair in his fingers as his lips covered hers.</p><p>Mindless, rapturous. The sensations blazed deeper, higher; they filled her senses, overcame reality, and sent her spiraling through a star-studded night as he gave her what she begged for.</p><p>His cock was a hard, blistering length of iron thrusting inside her, stroking tender tissue, building the tension, the pleasure, to a height that Kelly swore she couldn\u2019t bear.</p><p>Writhing beneath him, she fought for release, gasping, begging, her hands buried in his hair, her lips open against his, every cell possessed by him, stroked by him, enflamed by him, until she was certain only death could await, because there was no way to survive such pleasure.</p><p>\u201cFuck! There, baby.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to scream as his lips lifted, one hand gripping her hip, the other her hair as her lashes raised and she fought to plead silently, desperately for release.</p> <p>\u201cThere sweet Kelly,\u201d he groaned, the strokes suddenly intensifying, the rapid-fire thrusts pulling the tension tighter. Deeper. \u201cJust like that, baby.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as she felt the sudden contractions in her womb.</p><p>\u201cThere it is sweetheart.\u201d His voice was tight, encouraging. \u201cLet it have you, baby. I\u2019ll hold you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy would hold her. She wasn\u2019t really going to die. She was going to disintegrate.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Kelly. Let it go, sweetheart. I have you. Forever, baby.\u201d His voice was guttural, desperate, carnal. It was like black velvet, rasping over her senses, surrounding her, stroking her, filling her.</p><p>Her release slammed into her. Kelly felt the sudden implosion, then a heavy gathering, a second before ecstasy exploded violently inside her.</p><p>Convulsive spasms of release erupted around his hard flesh, a heavy, wet warmth washing over his cock as her release spilled through her.</p><p>Her muscles locked around him, attempting to hold him, to capture forever the rapture radiating through her with such brilliant force.</p> <p>And she did die, she thought with hazy perception. All preconceived notions of loving Rowdy, died. All her fantasies of what pleasure could be, they died. And they were reborn.</p><p>His voice wrapped around her, his arms surrounded her, and he was driving deep, burying himself inside her before she felt the white-hot flames of his release as he began to fill her, spurting inside her with a force that stole any remaining sanity she may have possessed.</p><p>Kelly collapsed beneath him, exhausted, fighting to breathe, her strength exhausted as she shuddered in the aftershocks of a pleasure she could have never imagined existed.</p><p>This was why women crowded around Rowdy. Why they vied for his attention and begged for his touch. Why she had waited, prayed, and saved herself for him alone.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She could barely force the words from her lips as she let exhaustion take her. \u201cJust love you.\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Rowdy ordered pizza at midnight and brought it to bed. He fed her bites of pepperoni and cheese and let her drink from his beer. He propped himself behind her, naked, and let her use his chest for a pillow as she acclimated herself from being a virgin to being his woman.</p><p>\u201cWhen were the parents getting home?\u201d The moon had risen hours ago, somewhere around the time that Rowdy was making her scream in the shower.</p><p>\u201cThey were staying overnight.\u201d His voice was low, lazy. It soothed now, reaching into that part of her soul that had been stripped bare by his loving. \u201cI thought we would stay the night on the boat.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stilled against him. She could feel the tension slowly invading his body now, and it wasn\u2019t sexual.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Not that she cared to spend the night on the boat, but she knew he worried about vulnerabilities the boat presented if someone were watching it.</p><p>His arms came around her, snug, sheltering, and she knew immediately that something was wrong. Rowdy sighed behind her, his muscular arms flexing as he rubbed his cheek against her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou may as well tell me, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone was watching the house last night,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOn the hill in front of your bedroom window. They were there for most of the night.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swallowed tightly as she stared across the room. \u201cHe\u2019s been watching me.\u201d She had sensed it. A part of her had known she was being watched, she just hadn\u2019t wanted to admit it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kelly.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice lowered as his lips pressed against the top of her head. \u201cIt might not even be him. I just want to be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you going to be certain?\u201d she asked, feeling the fear invade her in a slow, insidious crawl. \u201cWhere are Dawg and Natches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re watching the boat. The sheriff is going to check out the hill tonight. He\u2019s ex-Army, he knows how to do it. Besides, there\u2019s no way I can make love to you in Dad\u2019s house. Every time I think about it, Kelly, my balls shrivel.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to lighten the mood. She could hear it in his voice. Kelly shook her head as she pulled herself from his arms and moved from the bed, swiping the shirt he had worn earlier from the floor and pulling it on.</p><p>\u201cKelly,\u201d he protested softly. \u201cBaby, I\u2019ll fix this. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She held her hand up without turning back to him, hiding her desperate attempt to hold back her screams with sheer force. Shaking her head she moved quickly to the doorway then down the steps that led to the first floor of the houseboat.</p><p>Where she was going to go, she didn\u2019t know. There was no place to hide, no way to escape.</p><p>You\u2019re my good girl, Kelly. My good little girl. Tell me you love me. You love me, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Kelly stumbled at the last step as the words whispered through her mind, the memory of his hissing voice, his hands holding her down, parting the cheeks of her rear as he spread the lubrication there and attempted to rape her.</p><p>She had felt him trying to enter her.</p><p>She wrapped her arms over her stomach, determined not to throw up, not to scream in rage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this to yourself!\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice was dark, angry, as his arms came around her again, turning her to his chest, pulling her against him as he surrounded her, sharing the heat of his body as she felt ice building in her soul. \u201cKelly, I swear. We\u2019ll catch him.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head desperately, realizing tears were washing down her cheeks as the sobs clawed at her chest.</p><p>She could still feel the cuts the attacker had sliced into her flesh, the blood running over her skin, hot, slick.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d she cried, her fingers curling into fists as he held her to him, refusing to let her go. \u201cI can\u2019t do it again.\u201d She would never survive another attack and she knew it. \u201cOh, God, Rowdy. Oh, God. I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Rowdy picked Kelly up in his arms, moving to the sofa, cradling her against his naked body as he held her head to his chest and fought back the intense, primal violence threatening within him.</p><p>The bastard had scarred her. Not just her mind with his attempted rape, but her soul. The attack had instilled a fear inside her that he knew she would never fully recover from, and it destroyed him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kelly,\u201d he crooned at her ear. \u201cI have you, baby. No one can hurt you here, sweetheart. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered against him. The cries had eased, but the trembling in her body hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cKelly, baby, you have to trust me.\u201d He cupped her chin, forcing her to look up at him, his heart breaking at the sight of her eyes drenched in tears, her face pale from fear. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be.\u201d Husky, filled with fear, her voice sliced open his heart. \u201cI knew he was watching me. I could feel him. God, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>She jumped from his lap before he could stop her, stumbling across the floor. She turned on him, her eyes blazing with cloudy fury as she stared across the distance.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t stop. He won\u2019t stop until he hurts someone again, and next time, he might hurt you.\u201d</p><p>What he thought was fury in her eyes was actually horror. He saw it swamp her features, leeching the rest of the color from her face.</p><p>Rowdy straightened from the couch, aware he was naked, aware his body was responding to the sight of her, the smell of her. He saw her gaze flicker down, then jerk back up.</p><p>\u201cGod, Rowdy now is not the time for that.\u201d The look of complete female irritation on her face shouldn\u2019t have been amusing\u2014he was certain.</p><p>He made sure his look was completely wicked. He couldn\u2019t bear to see the fear in her eyes; if he had to replace it with irritation or even anger, than so be it.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, anytime is the perfect for this when you\u2019re around,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, pacing back. \u201cWe have to talk about this, Rowdy. I have to figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure what out?\u201d His eyes narrowed at the purpose that began to fill her face.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave.\u201d Her voice was laden with sorrow, with grief. \u201cI have relatives on Dad\u2019s side in Montana. It\u2019s a nice little town. I can go there. For awhile.\u201d Her voice roughened with the threat of tears.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn, Rowdy.\u201d She faced him, determination and grief filling her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here. He could strike at Mom or your dad. Or\u2014you.\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>What the hell was he going to do with her? Rowdy stared back at her somberly, feeling his chest ache with an emotion that so outdistanced love that he couldn\u2019t describe it.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest and frowned back at her. \u201cI\u2019ll only follow you, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t follow me,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThis is your home. The marina. The lake. All of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lakes in Montana.\u201d He shrugged. Arguing over her leaving would only make her more determined to go. He knew Kelly. Once she decided she was right, that was it. It took blood, sweat, and tears, on her part, before she would realize how wrong she was.</p><p>She was stubborn, defiant, soft, and loving, but she could drive him crazy in two hours flat if he let her. But he would never be bored with her. Frustrated, yes. Bored? Never.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave.\u201d She glared back at him. \u201cYour friends are here. Your cousins, your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are yours.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIf you want to leave, fine. Pack. We\u2019ll go to Montana. Hell, we\u2019ll go to fucking Fiji if you want to and become beach bums, but you aren\u2019t leaving without me.\u201d</p><p>She propped her fists on her hips as her lips flattened.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to just sit here and wait on that bastard to attack again? Wait on him to hurt someone else? Maybe you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can take him.\u201d His smile was tight, hard. He would relish it.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fight a bullet, Rowdy,\u201d she argued desperately. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t fight fair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you try dropping any idea you have of leaving me,\u201d he growled. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. I didn\u2019t go through hell for the past eight years to give you a chance to be certain you want me, just to have some sick bastard fuck it up. You\u2019re mine, Kelly.\u201d</p> <p>And if his words didn\u2019t convince her, then his cock better, because it was stiff as steel and throbbing with a life of its own.</p><p>Her gaze flickered down again, a bit of color flushing her pale cheeks as she licked her lips nervously.</p><p>\u201cPut your pants on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019ll just have to take them right back off,\u201d he promised her. \u201cTake the shirt off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She crossed her arms over her breasts again. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished talking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course we are.\u201d He moved closer. \u201cThe only thing left is your decision. Do we stay or do we leave? Because whichever, Kelly, we do together.\u201d</p><p>Before she could evade him he had her in his arms again, ignoring the sharp little nails that pressed into his shoulders as he pulled her hips in against his and pressed his cock against her lower stomach.</p><p>\u201cFeel how hard I am, Kelly.\u201d He nipped at her ear as she trembled in his arms. \u201cDo you really want to leave me like this? Hot and hard for you? Aching for you every night that you\u2019re gone? Like I\u2019ve ached for the past eight years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou survived,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cBut I hadn\u2019t had you then.\u201d He licked the shell of her ear before trailing his lips to her throat. \u201cI hadn\u2019t felt your hot little pussy wrapped around my cock, milking me dry. I\u2019ve had that now. I don\u2019t think I can live without it.\u201d</p><p>He watched as heat began to fill her eyes, as the anger in her expression softened, just a little.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you hurt,\u201d she whispered breathlessly. \u201cHe\u2019s crazy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right he is,\u201d Rowdy bit off the fury that would have filled his voice, barely managing just anger. \u201cHe touched you, Kelly. He made the mistake of taking from you, of hurting you. Do you think I\u2019ll ever forget that? That he won\u2019t pay for it if I ever manage to find out who he is? The son of a bitch would have served himself better to run as hard and as far as he could from me, rather than stalking you. Because I won\u2019t rest until I find him.\u201d</p><p>Kelly opened her lips to speak, to argue he was certain, only to be interrupted by a less than polite pounding on the side of the houseboat.</p><p>\u201cOpen up, cuz,\u201d Dawg called through the sliding doors. \u201cWe have trouble, man.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s eyes widened in alarm as Rowdy stalked to the back of the houseboat, grabbed a pair of shorts, and jerked them on before stalking back to the door.</p><p>Dawg and Natches stepped into the room seconds later, their expressions dark, cold.</p><p>\u201cHe hit the house while we were on the hill, Rowdy,\u201d Dawg growled as he glanced over at Kelly. \u201cKelly\u2019s room. He trashed it.\u201d</p><p>He was going to kill the motherfucker. The minute Rowdy walked into Kelly\u2019s room, he made that vow. This wasn\u2019t like the promises he had made before to kill a son of a bitch. This was a vow, a soul-deep pledge to kill the sleazy, fucking bastard crazy enough to do this to his woman.</p> <p>Her room was destroyed. Everything she had was destroyed.</p><p>Bits of lace and silk that had once been a treasure trove of frilly feminine panties and bras were scattered on the floor. Her hair bows were broken, ripped, cut. Her bedspread was slashed to ribbons as were her clothes.</p><p>Rowdy knelt in front of the closet and picked up the tatters of what had once been a pretty scarlet sundress. Beside it lay a shoe, the heel broken off, the red leather hacked at.</p><p>Makeup was smeared, swiped, and dumped over her dresser. Jeans were shredded, frothy nightgowns were unrecognizable, and more than a dozen pair of lace and silk stockings were destroyed.</p><p>The feathers from the pillows drifted along the floor, the dresser mirror was smashed, and the padding in the chair had been ripped out.</p><p>Kelly was still waiting downstairs to come up and see if anything was missing. The sheriff and his boys had finished dusting for prints, but nothing had been found.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was pissed.\u201d Deputy Carlyle stood in the doorway, his expression curious as he stared around the wreckage.</p><p>Rowdy lifted his gaze and stared back at the younger man. Carlyle was new on the force. An unfamiliar face and therefore suspicious as far as Rowdy was concerned.</p><p>And Rowdy didn\u2019t like the way he was staring around Kelly\u2019s room. Curious. A little too interested in the bits of fluff that had once been her clothes.</p><p>Carlyle was young, maybe in his early twenties, definitely not long out of the Police Academy, with an ego that showed clearly on his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cDid you get any prints?\u201d Rowdy raised slowly, his eyes narrowed as he stared at the deputy.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d Carlyle leaned against the door, his too lean body rangy, his brown eyes surveying the room again. \u201cNo prints on the door either. He slid right by the security system, came straight up here, and sliced and diced. Good thing Kelly wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy restrained a growl. Bastard had no right to act so familiar with Kelly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Good thing,\u201d he retorted instead.</p><p>\u201cSheriff contacted your parents, they\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d Carlyle smiled. \u201cThey were upset of course.\u201d</p><p>His parents? Rowdy frowned at the hint of condemnation in the deputy\u2019s voice. As if Kelly were his sister, or some blood relation. The judgment set his teeth on edge.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished here?\u201d Rowdy asked tightly. \u201cAnything else you need, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>Carlyle lifted a brow. \u201cNothing, Mr. Mackay. We have everything.\u201d He smiled confidently.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should leave.\u201d Rowdy smiled back, all teeth.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Carlyle nodded. \u201cAs soon as we get Kelly up here to see if anything is missing. I need that before I leave. The sheriff insisted.\u201d</p><p>Assaulting an officer of the law was a very bad thing, Rowdy reminded himself. Kelly would be upset. She wouldn\u2019t be happy with him at all.</p><p>\u201cShe can give her statement tomorrow afternoon, Deputy,\u201d he all but barked. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to tell you shit tonight.\u201d</p><p>Carlyle smiled again as he lowered his head and shook it slowly.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were a real tough guy,\u201d he commented, his voice on the wrong side of mocking. \u201cI\u2019d rein that in if I were you, boy.\u201d</p><p>Boy? Rowdy narrowed his eyes slowly.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out of my house,\u201d Rowdy growled. \u201cDon\u2019t piss me off any further, boy. And before you get on your high horse maybe you should call your boss and ask him just how far back we go together. You\u2019re risking more than my fist in that smirking face of yours.\u201d</p><p>Beating around the bush wasn\u2019t his style, and he\u2019d just had enough of this little dweeb\u2019s sneer.</p><p>\u201cDawg and Natches are still downstairs, Mackay,\u201d the deputy said.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Rowdy snapped.</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, there isn\u2019t much you boys don\u2019t do together. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019d actually fight without them.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy smiled at that one. The kid was a punk, and he was about to learn a lesson he didn\u2019t want right now. \u201cI managed to kill just fine without them for four years, Deputy. Want to test it?\u201d</p><p>Carlyle\u2019s smirk was going to get him killed for sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just leave you to your business here then,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cBring Kelly into the office in the morning. I\u2019m looking forward to talking to her.\u201d</p><p>Carlyle turned then and ambled down the hall as Rowdy reminded himself that killing outside the Marines was a bad thing. Very bad. Especially smart-mouthed deputies.</p><p>Son of a bitch, when had kids like that decided the job was a power trip? Rowdy had half a mind to follow him outside and show him what real power was. The kind of power that slipped up on you in the dark and left you bleeding.</p><p>And he could have, hell, he would have taken him out while he was standing there in the doorway with that sneer, but all he saw was Kelly. She would have been horrified if he had actually hurt that little punk while she was around.</p><p>Shaking his head he moved downstairs, mentally gearing himself up to face Kelly. Every little treasure she possessed had been in that room. The teddy bear he won for her at a fair when she was just a kid. The porcelain doll one of her friends had gotten her for a birthday. Her frilly hair bows and her silky clothes.</p><p>He stepped into the living room, his gaze connecting with Dawg and Natches as Kelly jumped to her feet from the chair she had been sitting in.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Her fingers were twisting together in front of her, her face pale.</p><p>Damn, he hated this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad, baby,\u201d he sighed, moving to her and pulling her into his arms.</p><p>She fit against him perfectly. A warm weight he hadn\u2019t known was missing in his life until now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d She shook her head against his chest. \u201cI need to go up there, though. I have to see what\u2019s left. The sheriff wants a statement.\u201d</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t keep her from going up there, despite the fact that it was killing him.</p><p>He stared at Dawg and Natches over her head and with a small movement of his head indicated that he wanted the area outside of the house checked. The sheriff\u2019s boys could have missed something. Something his cousins might identify quicker than the investigative team that had come out could have.</p><p>Dawg nodded as he and Natches moved from the room.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Rowdy sighed, keeping his arm around her. \u201cLet\u2019s go check it out.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing left, just as Rowdy had warned her. Kelly stared at the mess silently from the doorway and fought back her tears. Even the jewelry box had been destroyed.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to tell if anything is missing?\u201d The destruction was complete.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get it cleaned up.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s arms were wrapped around her from behind, his presence sheltering her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Kelly shook her head, trying to hold back the fear growing inside her. \u201cHe\u2019s angry now, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Always be my good girl. You\u2019ll always be my good girl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s angry now,\u201d Rowdy admitted. \u201cBut he\u2019s not the only one. Do you want to go through the room now or wait till morning? It might be better to wait.\u201d</p><p>She had been violated again. Kelly could feel the pervasive knowledge that even though the attacker hadn\u2019t touched her again, he had still violated her. He had taken something else from her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI need to get this cleaned up. I can\u2019t stand knowing it\u2019s destroyed like this.\u201d</p><p>She had to force back her tears. It broke her heart, seeing her treasures destroyed as they were, knowing there was nothing she could do to bring them back. But wasn\u2019t that the purpose behind this sort of attack? To take her mementos, the things she loved away from her?</p><p>She moved into the bedroom, staring around at the destruction, and wanted to scream. This was her room. She had had all her treasures here. Her jewelry, her stuffed animals, her dolls. And her hair bows. For once Rowdy hadn\u2019t been able to save her hair bows.</p><p>She bent down and picked up the pieces of a hair comb. The small fake pearls were crushed, the little crystals shattered. It had been one of her favorites.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll replace them, Kelly,\u201d Rowdy promised behind her. \u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>She cradled the bit of plastic that was left in her palm. They could replace the hair bows, but nothing could replace the sense of security that had been stolen from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Rowdy had finally managed to convince Kelly and her mother to leave the bedroom alone until morning. They were both exhausted when he and his father walked into the bedroom at three a.m to find the two women crying in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>Rowdy had taken Kelly to his bedroom where he held her as she slept, and Ray had taken her mother to their bed. Rowdy was certain his father had gotten no more sleep than he had though, despite the fact that Dawg and Natches had slept downstairs until the security system could be repaired.</p> <p>At eight, Rowdy met Ray in the hallway heading downstairs.</p><p>\u201cKelly still asleep?\u201d Ray kept his voice low.</p><p>Rowdy nodded sharply.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d His father\u2019s eyes glittered with anger.</p><p>\u201cIf I know Dawg, it\u2019s already on.\u201d Rowdy was certain he had smelled it moments before he left his bedroom.</p> <p>Ray tugged at the band of his jeans and sniffed sharply, his jaw bunching. \u201cLet\u2019s go get some. I\u2019ve had about all I can take of sitting around and thinking.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy knew exactly what he was talking about.</p><p>They met Dawg and Natches in the kitchen. Both men were hunched over steaming cups of coffee, talking quietly as Rowdy and Ray entered the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fresh.\u201d Dawg nodded to the pot on the counter.</p><p>\u201cDid you manage to find anything this morning?\u201d Rowdy asked as he moved to the cabinet and pulled two cups down.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Dawg sighed. \u201cMe and Natches went over this place with a fine-toothed comb. Whoever it was slipped in like a damned ghost and back out the same way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Ray snapped. \u201cI\u2019m about tired of this, Rowdy. Maria and Kelly are losing enough sleep. They don\u2019t need this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Dad.\u201d Hell, he didn\u2019t need it. He was having nightmares the way it was.</p><p>\u201cHe was just watching her until you came back, Rowdy,\u201d Dawg informed him. \u201cWe found several places where he\u2019s been watching the house from. The rains have wiped out most of the evidence of someone watching, but he likes to snack while he\u2019s watching. A few candy papers, a couple of soda bottles. No prints though. We checked for that. He\u2019s watching from points above the house, several different areas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she knew she was being watched,\u201d Rowdy sighed. \u201cShe felt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him.\u201d Natches\u2019s eyes were flinty, cold. \u201cHe\u2019ll make the wrong move soon.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy rubbed the back of his neck as he pulled out a chair and sat. His cup smacked the table as he sat it down.</p><p>\u201cHe destroyed every fucking piece of clothes she owns. Every goddamned hair bow and frilly girly thing she possessed. He destroyed her.\u201d</p><p>And Rowdy would destroy him, it was that simple. Once Rowdy got his hands on the bastard, he was dead. Painfully dead. The hurting, screaming kind of dead.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you catch a damned ghost?\u201d Ray snarled as he sat at the other end of the table. \u201cThe sheriff has been looking for him, I\u2019ve been watching out for anyone suspicious, and no one has seen shit.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s gaze connected with Dawg\u2019s and Natches\u2019s. The bastard had come after Kelly again because he knew she was on the boat with Rowdy. He was pissed. He would make a mistake soon enough.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you three think you\u2019re going to keep me out of this,\u201d Ray warned knowingly. \u201cYou\u2019re not as good at those sneaking little looks as you think you are. Tell me what you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not up to anything, Dad.\u201d Rowdy pushed his fingers wearily through his still damp hair. \u201cHe\u2019s mad. He had to have known Kelly was on the boat with me last night. He considers her his good girl. She\u2019s not waiting for him, so he\u2019s punishing her. He\u2019ll make a mistake soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially if you have your way?\u201d Ray growled. \u201cBe careful, Rowdy. Don\u2019t try to play games with this bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo games.\u201d Rowdy lifted his cup to sip at the coffee as he stared back at his father. \u201cI won\u2019t have to play any games. He won\u2019t be able to stand her being with me. He\u2019s trying to scare her away from me with this. When it doesn\u2019t work, he\u2019ll come after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Kelly?\u201d Ray snapped. \u201cWhat if he goes after Kelly?\u201d</p><p>Dawg shook his head at that one. \u201cHe\u2019ll come after Rowdy. And when he does, we\u2019ll all be waiting.\u201d</p><p>Ray stared at the three of them harshly. \u201cDon\u2019t play with Kelly\u2019s reputation, Dawg,\u201d he warned him. \u201cI won\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Dawg glanced at Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cThe three of you are going to piss me off,\u201d Ray snapped.</p><p>Hell, just what he needed, his father getting in on this. If Ray was suspicious, then Maria would be too and then she would start working on Kelly. Rowdy knew what it was going to take to bring Kelly\u2019s attacker out of the woodwork. If they didn\u2019t push him, then he would strike when none of them expected it. They couldn\u2019t take that chance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d He stared back at his father firmly. He wasn\u2019t arguing over it. He wasn\u2019t debating it. One way or the other, he would make certain Kelly was safe.</p><p>\u201cWithout hurting Kelly further?\u201d Ray\u2019s expression was suspicious.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to keep Kelly out of this,\u201d Rowdy warned him. \u201cShe\u2019s the one he\u2019s after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s the one that needs to know how we\u2019re going to stop him,\u201d Kelly\u2019s voice stated from the doorway.</p><p>All eyes turned to her. She was dressed in one of her mother\u2019s gowns and a robe, her long hair flowing around her, her gray eyes stormy.</p><p>She was scared and fighting to be strong. Enduring. Kelly was enduring. He had known that years ago, but he was learning it more now. She wouldn\u2019t go down easy. She might have her weak moments, but she would come back fighting. And what he needed her to do now was fight.</p><p>He watched as she moved to the coffeepot, filled her cup, then turned back to stare at the four of them in determination.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens, Ray, it\u2019s my decision,\u201d she stated. \u201cYou and Mom can\u2019t protect me forever.\u201d</p><p>Ray\u2019s jaw bunched with the anger that acknowledgment brought.</p><p>Turning back to Rowdy, his eyes narrowed warningly as he rose from the table. \u201cShe better not get hurt,\u201d he snapped. \u201cOr the three of you will answer to me.\u201d</p><p>He stalked from the kitchen then and stomped up the stairs, obviously heading for the bedroom he shared with Maria.</p><p>Silent, Rowdy watched as Kelly moved to Ray\u2019s chair and sat down gingerly, placing her cup carefully on the table before asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the quickest way to draw him out?\u201d</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Knowing what Rowdy had planned and actually seeing it being put into effect were two different things. Kelly found that watching the men converge on a project was almost scary.</p><p>The Nauti Boys weren\u2019t known for playing nice, in any way. But seeing the hard, cold men studying the banks as they maneuvered into the wide, deserted cove two days later, reminded her that they had been warriors for years, Marines who had survived a long, bloody war.</p><p>The men gathered in the living room. Dawg stood at the sliding glass doors that led to the deck, while Natches watched the back, and Rowdy kept a check on the bank along the side of the river.</p><p>Their eyes were narrowed, bodies tense and prepared, and all Kelly could do was worry. And try to stem the butterflies rising in her stomach.</p><p>She knew the plan was to make her stalker believe she was playing with all the Nauti Boys at once while protecting her from the three of them. They believed he was unbalanced enough, angry enough to show himself. But there was more. She could feel the tension between the three men, the knowledge that they were waiting on her. Wondering if she would give to the three of them together as she had given to Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too quiet, baby.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice was soft, filled with hidden depths as he glanced back at where she sat on the couch, staring back at him.</p><p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be much to say,\u201d she responded quietly, seeing the shadows that filled his eyes.</p><p>She wished he wasn\u2019t so handsome, wished he wasn\u2019t so male. And she wished his cousins didn\u2019t draw her almost as much as Rowdy himself did. It was one of the issues she had struggled with since the attack. Her rapist had called her a good girl, but she knew she wasn\u2019t, not really, and that scared her. No woman had ever held even one of the Mackay cousins\u2019 hearts\u2014what made her think she could? What made her think she could hold all three?</p><p>\u201cI told you, Kelly, whatever happens, it will be just you and me.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had. On the way to the marina, his voice quiet and throbbing with lust, but she had heard the tinge of regret as well. As though he were torn in his needs, in his wants.</p><p>She was aware of Dawg listening, his back to them, his body tense.</p><p>\u201cThe Nauti Boys playing separately.\u201d She arched her brow at the comment. \u201cThat\u2019s just about unheard of, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>Dawg snorted. Rowdy shook his head, his green eyes chastising.</p><p>\u201cYour tongue has grown sharper over the years, darlin\u2019,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m a hungry man right now. It\u2019s not nice to tempt hungry men.\u201d</p><p>She settled into the corner of the couch, lifting her legs to the cushions and stretching them to the side. Rowdy\u2019s gaze followed the movement with a spark of interest.</p><p>\u201cMy tongue has always been sharp, you just haven\u2019t been around enough to notice.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDawg and Natches should have warned you of that. Wasn\u2019t that part of their job description?\u201d</p><p>Knowing they had been watching her and running off potential lovers hadn\u2019t suited her well. It was a damned good thing she hadn\u2019t known before Rowdy came home.</p><p>\u201cThe job was hard enough as it was, brat.\u201d Dawg turned his head, flashing her a mock frown over his shoulder. \u201cThere was no sense in making it more complicated.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy chuckled as Kelly glanced back at Dawg archly. He winked with a slow, sensual lowering of one thickly lashed eyelid. And she knew that move shouldn\u2019t have affected her; unfortunately, it always did. Dawg was a natural-born flirt.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like I was hard to watch.\u201d The pretend pout was aimed at Rowdy. \u201cAnd here I thought I was being a...\u201d The words trailed off as she caught what she was about to say.</p><p>She thought she had been a good girl.</p><p>She jerked from the couch, ignoring Rowdy\u2019s soft protest as she stalked through the cabin of the houseboat to the back deck.</p><p>For a moment, she wasn\u2019t certain she could keep her dinner in her stomach as fear lurched through her. A cold sweat covered her skin and she felt naked, exposed in the tiny bathing suit she had managed to let Rowdy convince her to wear.</p><p>Ignoring Natches, she moved to the rail, staring down at the water churning at the hull, and swallowed tightly. She had been a good girl. She had waited for Rowdy, instinctively knowing she belonged to him. She may have moments of insecurity in holding his heart, but she had always known she loved him. Always known that he would be her first. She gripped the rail, forcing back her fears as the remembered sound of her own screams echoed through her head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s won.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Natches\u2019s voice had her breathing in roughly as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI bet you feel like you\u2019re naked, on display,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Natches.\u201d She fought back the fears rolling through her. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your skin crawling, Kelly?\u201d</p><p>It was. The feel of him behind her, knowing he could see her bare skin, that he wanted to touch her, was suddenly terrifying.</p><p>This was Natches. He was almost an extension of Rowdy, a protector, a friend.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be scared because I\u2019m about to say the wrong thing. I don\u2019t want to forget every dream I ever had, or lose the man I\u2019ve loved forever because I can\u2019t control the nightmares.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never lose Rowdy, Kelly,\u201d he spoke behind her, far enough away that she wasn\u2019t jumping out of her own skin, but close enough that she could clearly hear him. \u201cHe\u2019s waited on you for eight years now. You\u2019re not going to get rid of him easily.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing hitched.</p><p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen tonight, Kelly, then he\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d His voice was soothing, gentle.</p><p>Kelly turned to him, staring into his compassionate expression, ignoring the flame of fury that burned behind the sympathy in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd you and Dawg?\u201d</p><p>His lips tugged into a crooked smile as his pale green eyes seemed to darken with a hungry cast.</p><p>\u201cYou belong to Rowdy, Kelly, and vice versa. If that\u2019s what you want, then Rowdy will let us know. Until then, nothing has changed with us. We\u2019re no different than we\u2019ve always been to you, and our feelings for you haven\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>His gaze flickered over her quickly, and Kelly remembered that he had looked at her the same way for years. With a tinge of teasing lust that he never allowed free. Dawg had always done the same thing, knowing the day would come that Rowdy would claim her, and possibly they would as well.</p><p>She glanced at the doorway as Rowdy suddenly filled it, his green eyes bright as they went over her body. He paused at her thighs, centering his gaze on the black material of the bikini bottom she wore before lifting to the fabric that stretched over her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI never mistook you for a good girl,\u201d he murmured, his voice deep, rough. \u201cYou were my girl, Kelly. Always.\u201d</p><p>His girl. Her breath caught in her throat as she stared back at him. Not his good girl, his bad girl, or his naughty girl. Just his.</p><p>\u201cI bet you fantasized about it.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice sent curls of heat whipping through her womb before they struck at her clit, her nipples.</p><p>She had fantasized about it. Of Rowdy holding her, whispering in her ear, watching.... She bit back her moan at the thought of those fantasies.</p><p>\u201cCome back in, Kelly.\u201d His voice was a rough growl now, his expression heavy with lust as his eyes darkened to an emerald depth.</p><p>She stared at the hand he extended to her before her gaze flickered to Natches. He was watchful, tense, but rather than the driving hunger, his eyes held warmth and desire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, Rowdy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just going to go in and pilot the boat to the cove, babe. We\u2019re going to relax, nothing heavy, no decisions to be made, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Kelly reached out to his outstretched hand, feeling his heat and strength. Then he was pulling her to him, flush against his body, his hand carrying hers until her arm curved behind her back and she was arched into him. The length of his cock pressed into her belly, a thick wedge of heat and hardness that left her knees trembling.</p><p>\u201cJust let me touch you, Kelly. Just me. That\u2019s all.\u201d His head was lowered until his lips caressed the shell of her ear, sending shivers racing down her spine.</p><p>He was seducing her. She lifted her free hand to his biceps, holding on tight as his lips traveled to her neck, smoothing over her sensitive flesh, sending sparks of intense need slicing through every nerve ending.</p><p>He lifted his head, a sensual smile curving his lips as he drew her back into the cabin, retaining his hold on her hand as he returned to the wheel.</p><p>Dawg moved aside, returning to his post at the balcony doors as Kelly glimpsed the narrow opening into the sheltered cove ahead.</p> <p>They were staying the night, she knew that. The first step in drawing out a madman. Kelly allowed Rowdy to pull her in front of him, between him and the wheel. Her breath caught as his hand settled on her bare stomach, just over the butterflies beating violently within.</p><p>He stood behind her, flush against her, his erection resting in the small of her back, covered only by the thin material of his cutoffs.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he knows where we\u2019re going?\u201d She could barely force the words from her lips.</p><p>\u201cHe studies his victims,\u201d Rowdy sighed. \u201cHe\u2019ll know about me, about Dawg and Natches. If he doesn\u2019t follow, he\u2019ll at least be aware of where you are.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s plans were targeted at someone who would be watching, waiting. Which meant her rapist had been watching her more closely than she had ever imagined.</p><p>\u201cKelly, we\u2019ll catch him.\u201d His hold tightened on her. \u201cI promise you, baby, we\u2019ll take care of this. We\u2019ll take care of you. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have listened,\u201d she whispered. \u201cEveryone warned me about the window. I should have listened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have stopped him, baby. It didn\u2019t help the other women he raped. Women alone, who did everything right. He still got to them. This isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>She knew that, in her head. Her fears and her shame told her otherwise.</p><p>No. No. No. He crouched on the cliff overlooking the cove, sheltered by the pines and brush that surrounded him, rocking back and forth on his heels as he fought the pain inside his chest.</p><p>They were all there. All three of them were there with her. Tears coursed down his face as he watched Dawg and Natches Mackay lower the anchor weights on each side of the boat before returning to the cabin.</p><p>The curtains were pulled. Thick, heavy curtains that wouldn\u2019t show so much as a shadow once night fell. There would be no way of knowing how far Kelly was allowing those bastards to debase her.</p><p>He sniffed, holding back his sobs, and let the rage building inside him burn. He had thought she was such a good girl. A sweet, pure angel who deserved his gentleness and his love.</p><p>She was a whore. Just like the other whores who had allowed the Mackay cousins to touch them in the past. There was nothing innocent about her. Nothing good. Nothing pure.</p><p>But she was his one true love.</p><p>And she was breaking his heart. He had refused to dirty her, had given her his heart, and this was his repayment.</p><p>He had treasured her. Had shown her his caring, his respect and consideration.</p><p>No more.</p><p>A small sob escaped him as he realized what had to be done. She had stolen his heart. The only way to rid himself of the torment was to rid himself of Kelly. She would have to die, but first...first he would show her how bad girls were really treated.</p><p>She was nervous, frightened. Rowdy wasn\u2019t unaware of how warily Kelly watched Dawg and Natches. Equal parts curiosity and fear raged in her eyes. For as long as he could remember he had never had a problem sharing a woman with his cousins. But something made him hesitate now. Held him back from seducing her into the acts that he and his cousins had seduced their women into before.</p><p>The more he thought of Kelly\u2019s innocence, and the fact that she had saved not just her body, but her heart for him as well, caused something to clench in his chest. An emotion he couldn\u2019t name, a hunger, a desire he couldn\u2019t define.</p><p>But Kelly had always engendered such emotions inside him. She could turn his heart when no one else could, and bring out protective instincts he didn\u2019t think he possessed.</p><p>As they sat watching one of the latest action-adventure DVDs, he felt her move against his side, drawing closer to him, her mostly bare body tucking closer to his.</p><p>Neither Natches nor Dawg were watching her. They had joked through the evening, drank a few beers, and seemed as enthralled with the movie as any man should be. But the tension was rising. Kelly\u2019s tension as well as theirs.</p><p>He tightened his arm around her, drawing her closer to his chest, and felt the heat rising from her. Her hand flattened on his muscular abdomen, her fingers curling into the flesh as he stared down at her bent head.</p><p>He was hard, hurting, his cock throbbing beneath his cutoffs with raging demand.</p><p>His breath caught with a shocked hiss as he felt her hand caress the tight muscles of his abdomen. Inquisitive fingers ran along the band of his shorts, sending imperative signals to his overly tight cock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get in trouble,\u201d he whispered against her hair as the head of his dick began to throb in demand. If he didn\u2019t ease the constriction against his cock, then permanent zipper tracks were a definite threat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naughty, remember?\u201d She turned her head, her lips pressing against his breastbone as his hand lifted, his fingers tangling in her hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease, Kelly,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m riding a very fine edge right now.\u201d</p><p>She licked him. Son of a bitch. He nearly jumped out of his skin as he felt the slow, savoring lick of her hot little tongue.</p><p>\u201cReally? Strange, I could say the same thing about myself. Spending the last two nights sleeping with you, without being with you wasn\u2019t easy, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>No shit. After having her, the hunger for her had only grown.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t unaware of Dawg and Natches listening closely, or the careful readiness of their bodies. They were as aroused as he was, as hungry.</p><p>She lifted her head, her slender, lithe body moving, rising as he watched, entranced. She stood in front of him before gracefully straddling his thighs and lowering herself into his lap.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d His head fell back on the couch, his hands catching her hips as he jerked her flush with the tortured length of his cock.</p><p>Her pussy was hot, the heat of it burning through her scanty bathing suit bottom as well as the threadbare material of his denim cutoffs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone, baby.\u201d He tilted his head as her lips moved to his neck. Each touch reminded him of her inexperience, or her daring.</p><p>She knew Dawg and Natches could hear every move, every passionate sigh.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of you,\u201d she whispered in his ear a second later, her soft breath sending pleasure racing over his flesh. \u201cWhile you were gone, I dreamed of touching you, kissing you, of all the things I knew you enjoyed. That I knew I would enjoy.\u201d The hesitant admission had his body tightening further.</p><p>He felt the tremor that quivered through her, the hint of fear and of arousal. The soft weight of her body against his was driving him crazy. The need to throw her to her back on the couch and devour her was making him sweat. The feel of her straddling his lap, her hands moving over his chest, her lips at his neck was too much.</p><p>She had initiated the contact, had known that Dawg and Natches were in the room. He should leave it at that, he thought. He should seduce her, as he knew she wanted to be seduced. But seduction and the acts he wanted to see her involved in did not go hand in hand. Rowdy knew Kelly\u2019s innocence, knew the demons that rode her, and he swore to himself he wouldn\u2019t add to them.</p><p>If this were her choice, then she would face it. And she would face it from the beginning.</p><p>Kelly felt her head spinning as pleasure washed through her with the force of a sensual tidal wave. She could feel Rowdy\u2019s hands roaming over her back, her buttocks, bringing a sense of heat and overwhelming pleasure rather than pain and fear.</p><p>One hand moved up her spine, threaded in her hair, and before she could guess his intention he was pulling her head back as he turned, lifting her, pushing her to the couch.</p><p>Before she could do more than gasp, he stole her breath with his kiss. Her lips parted beneath his, her tongue meeting his in a duel of exquisite ecstasy. She couldn\u2019t help curling her fingers into his broad shoulders, feeling the muscles flex beneath her touch, bunch with power as he buried her smaller body beneath his much larger one.</p><p>There was no fear here. There wasn\u2019t even the thought of fear. There was only Rowdy\u2019s touch, his lips covering hers, one hand tangled in her hair, the other moving inexorably to the rounded curve of one breast.</p><p>She fought to breathe, certain there had been enough oxygen in the air before his kiss. And she would have broken away to breathe, but it was so good, so hot, so filled with liquid, carnal delight that she couldn\u2019t draw away from him. But she could touch him. God, how she had dreamed of touching him over the years, feeling him against her, possessing her.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d Her cry was instinctive as he pulled his lips from her, her eyes opening to stare into his expression in dazed fascination as he pressed his jeans-clad erection tight between her thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe sure.\u201d His voice was guttural. \u201cLook around you, Kelly. Be certain of what you\u2019re doing. There\u2019s no turning back. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Dark erotic power filled his expression. His brilliant green eyes were moss-dark, his face flushed, his lips heavy with greedy hunger.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Rowdy.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think about what could or would be. She wanted to feel the dreams she had known for so long. Rowdy taking her, his cousins pleasuring her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled, his voice rough, his hands clamping on her wrists as her hands moved for the snap of his cutoffs. \u201cLook around, Kelly. Look at them. Let them know they\u2019re welcome or they leave. That simple. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat cold-blooded?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cNo, dammit.\u201d He lifted her from him before she could do more than gasp, striding across the room before turning back to her.</p><p>\u201cRowdy, man, let this go,\u201d Dawg muttered warningly as Kelly sat up on the couch.</p><p>\u201cYou make the choice,\u201d he growled, his eyes tormented with need, with demand. \u201cI won\u2019t do it for you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly rose jerkily from the couch, her body on fire, her face flaming with anger and embarrassment, and an instinctive demand that she deny them all. She stared at the three of them, all aroused, all awaiting her decision. A decision that had nothing to do with emotion and everything to do with hunger and their dominance. They wanted her surrender, a complete surrender, and she wasn\u2019t certain she could give it.</p><p>\u201cAll or nothing?\u201d she questioned in reply.</p><p>\u201cYou know better than that, Kelly.\u201d Rowdy sliced his hand through the air with frustrated fury. \u201cDon\u2019t play games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have to say the words instead?\u201d she asked, challenging him, facing him with the same determination that glittered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWords work.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest as Dawg and Natches slouched in their chairs and watched him, each wearing dark, disapproving frowns.</p><p>\u201cOh, I just bet they would.\u201d She flipped her hair from her face before propping her hands on her hips. \u201cShould I just ask you all to screw me, Rowdy? Why don\u2019t I just bare it now and let you take turns with me. Hell yeah, make it damned easy on you, wouldn\u2019t it? That way, you don\u2019t have to feel like shit later because you let another man take what was yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think for one fucking minute that they don\u2019t know exactly who you belong to?\u201d he questioned her with dark intent. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t care, baby, you wouldn\u2019t have been a virgin the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d she argued in amazement. \u201cDo you really believe that all it takes is a touch from a Nauti Boy to turn any woman\u2019s crank?\u201d She waved her hand mockingly. \u201cYour ego is becoming more swollen than your dick, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>Wrong word. All three men seemed to tighten, straighten at the explicit word that left her lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just look at the three of you.\u201d She rolled her eyes in mocking amusement. \u201cLike little boys waiting for a treat. Well, fuck that. Find someplace else to treat, because I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m still in the mood.\u201d</p><p>She stomped across the room, determined to reach the curving staircase that led to the upper bedroom and peace. She passed Rowdy with a disdainful little hiss, so irked and frustrated with his male, redneck attitude that she could have kicked him.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected him to reach for her. But even if she had, she wouldn\u2019t have expected him to lift her so quickly into his arms before his lips slammed down on hers.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a romantic kiss. It wasn\u2019t soft and delving, or deep and passionate. It was hungry demand, carnal intent. It stole resistance and replaced it with pure fiery need, and nothing less.</p> <p>Before she could protest, before she even processed the information, she found her rear braced on the counter, her thighs spread, and Rowdy devouring her.</p><p>She was lost in him, helpless in his arms as usual and loving it. Her fingers speared into his hair as his lips moved over hers, his tongue a restless marauder that conquered hers with inordinate ease.</p><p>And his hands weren\u2019t still either. Within seconds, the bikini top she wore was tossed aside, the hard tips of her breasts pressing into the fine layer of hair that covered his broad chest.</p><p>She shifted against him, her fingernails digging into his scalp as the tender, spike-hard tips burned in pleasure.</p><p>Kelly moaned at the loss as his lips pulled from hers, moving to her neck as her head fell back, the whiplash of sensations jerking her against him as his broad palms framed the tender mounds when he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty.\u201d His lips were swollen, his eyes heavy-lidded and intense as they focused on the swollen curves. \u201cYou have the prettiest nipples, Kelly. As pretty pink as cotton candy. And they taste just as sweet.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to her breasts. The light pink nipples were straining toward him, diamond-hard and desperate for his touch. No other man had touched her there. No one but Rowdy. She ached for him, needed him, belonged to him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop here,\u201d he whispered, his gaze lifting to hers. \u201cOnce I sate myself on these pretty nipples, I\u2019m going to go lower, Kelly. I\u2019m going to strip those damned bottoms off and spread your pretty legs. Then I\u2019m going to lap at every sweet drop of syrup running between your thighs. Are you ready for that? And I won\u2019t care who\u2019s watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Rowdy, I\u2019ve dreamed of it.\u201d She had tossed in her lonely bed as the hunger for it kept her awake night after night.</p><p>A primal growl left his throat as his head lowered, his tongue swiping over one tender nipple before he enveloped it in his hot mouth.</p><p>His lips closed over the peak, sucking it into his mouth as his tongue curled around it. Kelly jerked violently, the pleasure so strong, so fiery that she could do nothing but cry out in response. Rowdy\u2019s hard hands held her in place as his lips devoured her, sending her senses reeling, her pulse rocketing as sensuality wrapped around her.</p><p>She heard a male groan, but whose it was she wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll just watch,\u201d he whispered as his head lifted. \u201cWatch me eat every perfect inch of your body this time. That\u2019s all. No pressure, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>She arched toward him. She didn\u2019t want to hear about it, she didn\u2019t want to analyze it. She wanted to feel. She wanted each sensation to rip through her, wanted the pleasure to never end.</p><p>And he took the offering. His lips closed on the opposite peak, drawing it into his mouth and setting it aflame as he surrounded the other with his thumb and forefinger. Then, his fingers tightened.</p><p>\u201cRowdy!\u201d The surprised exclamation echoed around her as the fiery lance of sensation tore through her. Not quite pain. Almost, but a fiery kind of hurt that made the pleasure hotter, sweeter.</p><p>\u201cGod, Kelly...\u201d The rough moan was whispered between her breasts as his head moved. He was fighting for breath, his fingers working her nipple, causing her to shudder with each tug at the eager tip. She could feel the hunger blazing out of control now, the need ripping through her, hard, bright, and hotter than a living flame. And she needed more. So much more.</p><p>Kelly could feel Dawg and Natches watching as she burned in Rowdy\u2019s arms. His lips and hands were never still, caressing over her, filling her senses with the dark taste of passion and the stinging need growing within her.</p><p>She was desperate for him. Her legs wrapped around his hips as she pressed her mound tighter against the rock-hard length of his cock. Her swollen clit was screaming for relief even as her tormented nipples begged for more.</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice was a rough growl as he lifted her from the counter, his hands curving beneath her bottom to hold her in place against the straining length of his erection. \u201cI\u2019m not taking you on this counter.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t care where he took her, as long as he did.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d A whimpering cry whispered from her lips as her arms circled his shoulders, her lips moving to the corded strength of his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait again, Rowdy. I can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more waiting, baby.\u201d She felt him moving up the curving steps that led to the upper deck and the large bedroom. She had no idea if Dawg and Natches were following. She didn\u2019t care if they were, or if they weren\u2019t. Nothing mattered except Rowdy\u2019s touch. Except touching Rowdy.</p><p>As he lowered her to the wide bed that dominated the center of the room, Kelly twisted, pressing against his broad shoulders until he lowered himself beside her, stretching out beneath her gaze.</p><p>Finesse be damned. She wasn\u2019t experienced, he knew it and she knew it. But she was desperate to touch him, to taste him. Without thought she scrambled to his side, one hand gripping his shoulder, the other smoothing down his hard chest as her head lowered to the flat male nipples that drew her attention.</p><p>If his mouth on hers could make her weak, could she do the same to him?</p><p>\u201cShit! Kelly. Baby...\u201d Maybe she could.</p><p>His hands buried in her hair, his body jerking against her as she nipped at the little discs before laving them with her tongue.</p><p>Hard, growling moans came from his chest as her hand lowered to the band of his cutoffs, her fingers tearing at the snap before he brushed her fingers away to release the material himself.</p><p>Kelly contented herself with tasting him. Both nipples, licking and nipping at them with rising pleasure before she began to move lower.</p><p>\u201cGod, Kelly.\u201d Rowdy tightened further as her tongue licked around his navel before heading to the length of hard flesh still covered by his cutoffs.</p><p>\u201cI need to touch you, Rowdy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet me touch you.\u201d She parted the fabric, then watched as he gripped the material of the waistband in his hands and shed it with easy grace.</p><p>And there he was. Hard, thick, his cock rising along his abdomen, pulsing with life as a small bead of semen collected at the tip. Kelly licked her lips, remembering the taste of him.</p><p>She bent, reaching out with her tongue to swipe over the bulging head as she tasted him. A bit salty, bold, wild, like Rowdy. And she wanted more.</p><p>A rumbled groan came from his throat as her fingers trailed down the ridged length of his erection, curiously exploring each shift of the bulging veins until she reached the hair-roughened sac below.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby.\u201d One hand clenched in her hair as the other cupped her cheek now. \u201cCome down slow and easy. Take me in that pretty mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>The hand moved from her cheek as her lips parted. It gripped the base of the hard stalk, lifting it until the head pressed against the damp curves. Kelly whimpered at the heat and hardness before her lips opened, stretching to surround him, to take him into her mouth as her tongue flickered over the expanse of skin that she was able to reach.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes!\u201d His hips bucked against her mouth, driving his cock in deeper as she tried to lick at each new expanse of flesh.</p><p>It stretched her lips, filled her mouth with the taste of sexual intent, a wicked, intoxicating male taste that inflamed her senses. She felt his fingers bunching in her hair as she began to slowly suck at the engorged crest.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, baby,\u201d he crooned. \u201cYour mouth is like liquid silk.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice was rough, erotic.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby,\u201d he encouraged her as she followed the lead of his hands in her hair, her lips moving up, then down, filling her mouth with as much of his erection as possible as she suckled at the rising flesh, her tongue flickering over it.</p><p>He took one hand and caught hers, wrapping her fingers around him, high enough to keep it from going too deep into her mouth before he returned his fingers to her hair. He sifted through the strands before tangling within them and moving more firmly against her, his cock thrusting with slow, easy strokes inside her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDamn. You\u2019re stealing my sanity, baby,\u201d he growled as she felt the bloated crest throb in her mouth. \u201cThere you go. Suck it nice and hard. Oh hell...\u201d Her lips tightened on him as she lifted her eyes to see the carnal expression on his dark face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had never realized how hungry she was for him, until now. Until his cock filled her mouth, the wild taste of aroused male consuming her, driving her past shame to a realm where nothing mattered but touch, taste, desire.</p><p>As her mouth moved on him, her hand began to stroke the strong shaft, moving up and down, pumping the hard column as he fucked her mouth with increasingly strong strokes.</p><p>At the same time, she felt a touch behind her. Male hands sliding her bikini bottoms from her, smoothing over the rounded curves of her ass. Was it Dawg or Natches? She didn\u2019t know, she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She watched Rowdy\u2019s gaze flare, though, as he stared over her head for a long second. When his eyes returned to hers, they were wild with lust.</p><p>Then she felt it. A slow, reverent kiss on one buttock, then the next. A tongue, wicked and alluring, flickering along the top of the narrow crevice that separated the rounded cheeks.</p><p>Her head jerked up as a keening moan left her lips, her eyes widening in shocked pleasure. An insidiously wicked caress nearly had her collapsing against Rowdy. Only his hands held her upright, his gaze holding her sanity as she felt the probing tongue gently rimming the ultrasensitive entrance to her anus.</p><p>She should be screaming in fear, instead, she was panting with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Rowdy...\u201d Her voice was weak, questioning. Should it feel so good? Should she be so desperate for more?</p><p>\u201cShh, baby,\u201d he whispered gently. \u201cLet it feel good. Just for a minute. Just for another minute.\u201d</p><p>She cried out as she felt that knowing tongue press against the entrance again. Her head whipped from side to side as she fought to breathe, fought to make sense of the blinding pleasure. When it breached the small hole with a slight pinching sensation, only to pull back, then probe inside again, she shuddered at the intensity of the carnal caress, suddenly terrified. Not of the touch or the man, but of herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kelly...easy, baby.\u201d The touch was suddenly gone as Rowdy pulled her to him, his lips covering hers as he bore her to her back.</p><p>He kissed her with ruthless demand, leaning over her and working his lips over hers with experienced lust. He ate her kiss, consumed her, and taught her to consume in return.</p><p>Rowdy lifted his head from the kiss, his senses drunk with the taste of the woman beneath him, his body aching to possess her.</p><p>The soft, dim glow spread over Kelly, clearly revealing bare silken flesh between her thighs, devoid of any sign of feminine hair. He had expected it, had known what awaited him, but the sight of it was a punch of lust to his gut anyway.</p><p>He blinked down at the pink, flushed curves as they gleamed with a layer of soft, silky syrup, licking his lips in hunger.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re pushing a man already hanging on the edge,\u201d he growled as he watched his fingers move, smoothing over the swollen flesh until they could delve into the rich, dewy slit below.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Rowdy...\u201d Her cry pierced through him as he parted her, his gaze drinking in the flushed flesh covered in slick honey as her hips arched to him, her thighs spreading further.</p><p>He pressed the pad of his palm over her clit as his fingers found the tender entrance to her pussy and circled it slowly, his mouth watering to taste her. Lifting his fingers he turned his gaze to her again, narrowing his eyes as he moved his fingers to her pouty lips and painted them with her own juices.</p><p>Shock widened her eyes as she gasped. His other hand moved to her head, lacing his fingers through her hair as he spread the sweetness over her lush lips.</p><p>\u201cLick it off,\u201d he growled. \u201cCome on, baby, see how sweet and hot you\u2019re going to taste when I get my tongue inside that hot little pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d He could hear the protest of her innocence, the dark hungers filling her, urged on by his own needs as she hesitated in the face of the unfamiliar intensity of their combined lust.</p><p>\u201cLick your lips,\u201d he ordered her again, his voice rough, the need to see her completely immersed in the needs building between them overwhelming.</p> <p>Her tongue peeked out as the flush deepened on her face. A grimace twisted his lips as she licked at her own sweetness, tasting what he craved so desperately for himself. Then, her tongue curled around his finger, drawing a hoarse moan from his chest as she sucked it into her mouth.</p><p>The feel of her drawing the remaining taste from her fingers broke his control. He pulled from her, moving between her thighs, spreading them further as he lifted her to his descending mouth and buried his lips in the liquid heat flowing from her.</p><p>She was more intoxicating than moonshine, sweeter, hotter than life itself, and all his.</p><p>Kelly heard her own cries flowing through the night around her and could do nothing to still them, to smother them. Rowdy\u2019s mouth was burning through inhibitions, through shyness, and igniting a fire inside her pussy that threatened to consume her. He held her legs wide, his mouth eating her decadently, his whispering murmurs of pleasure and hunger fueling the flames burning through her.</p><p>His tongue was voracious. It licked, spread fire through the burning flesh and caressed her with a knowledge and experience that had her gasping. Small, flickering strokes against her clit caused her to arch to him, her hips jerking as sensation raked like talons of need through her nervous system. The pleasure, oh God, the pleasure was too much to bear. Each circular stroke around the hard, pulsing knot of her clit stole her breath. Her womb convulsed with the need for orgasm as the pleasure tore through it before spreading throughout her system.</p><p>His fingers weren\u2019t still either. One circled the sensitive opening to her vagina, spreading the juices that wept from her aching center before his tongue stroked lower, moving to lap at her, to draw the taste of her into his mouth as she screamed out from the precipice he kept her teetering on.</p><p>She was so close. Too close to be held back in such a way. She could feel the sensation burning throughout her body, igniting a firestorm that raced through her bloodstream.</p><p>Finally. She writhed beneath him, her head tossing as all the fantasies she had known in the past five years were finally coming to life. Rowdy was touching her, tasting her, loving her.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I could get drunk on your taste.\u201d His voice was a hoarse growl a second before his tongue plunged inside the gripping entrance to her cunt, fucking into her with licking strokes that had a strangled scream leaving her throat.</p><p>The tension building inside her was frightening. Control was a thing of the past, as Rowdy was causing the gathering tightness in her belly to deepen, to convulse with each inward thrust of his wicked tongue. Her hands tightened in his hair as she shuddered and the wet heat flowing from her vagina increased.</p><p>She was panting for air, sensation racing across her flesh, sensitizing her, leaving her gasping amid the inferno he was creating. His hands weren\u2019t still anymore than his tongue was. They smoothed over her thighs, his thumb flicked at her clit, sending sharp sensations of agonizing need tearing through her a moment before it retreated. His hands curled along the cheeks of her ass, and as his tongue plunged inside her again, he parted the soft curves, tugging at the entrance to her ass and sending sharp flares of heat whipping through her system.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d She writhed, beneath him, her head tossing on the blankets as she felt perspiration gathering along her body, trickling down her breasts, her tummy, even as her juices flowed from her pussy. \u201cI can\u2019t...I can\u2019t stand it....\u201d</p><p>It was different than the first time. The sensations were harder, fiercer, driving her further from herself as she fought to hold onto reality.</p><p>\u201cMake it stop!\u201d She tried to scream, to demand an ease to the pressure building in her womb, her thighs, deep inside her cunt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. If anything, his mouth became more voracious, his fingers exploring further, pressing deeper against the untouched entrance he was massaging.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...I swear...I can\u2019t stand...\u201d She lost her breath as she felt his finger breach her ass, felt it slide slowly inside her as his lips covered her clit, his thumb slipping into the entrance of her pussy and destroying her.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d She fought the lightning surge of almost painful sensation that shot through her.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you can\u2019t. You will come for me, Kelly. Now,\u201d he snarled, his finger retreating, gathering more of the silky liquid flowing from her before sliding in deeper, stronger, his thumb pumping into her pussy before his lips covered her clit again. He suckled at the tender bud, his tongue flickering over it as his finger bit into her ass, his thumb fucking her cunt until she felt herself erupt.</p><p>Her scream filled the night as she dissolved, saw lights exploding behind her clenched eyes and heard Rowdy\u2019s roar of pleasure a second before he was rising between her thighs and throwing her higher.</p><p>\u201cHang on, baby.\u201d He gripped her hands, moving them to his shoulders as she felt a thick pressure against the sensitized entrance to her pussy.</p><p>She stared up at him, dazed, awash in cascading waves of ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cSweet baby,\u201d he groaned, his green eyes darkening as his hands clasped her face. \u201cHold on to me, sweet thing. I can\u2019t wait. Not even another minute.\u201d</p><p>Her eye widened, fluttered, fought to stay open as she felt his cock stretching her, invading her. Better than the first time, stroking sensitive nerve endings, caressing delicate tissue until she wept with need. And it didn\u2019t stop. It went on and on, as though in slow motion, stretching her until she was certain she could hold no more before she found she could.</p><p>She jerked in his grip, her nails pressing into his shoulders as she whimpered then screamed as Rowdy settled to the hilt inside her. She could feel every thick inch parting the tender tissue of her pussy, straining it to its limits as fingers of electricity sizzled through and the tension began to increase once again within her.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re tight.\u201d His expression was strained as she stared up at him, fighting to make sense of the sensations ripping through her. \u201cAnd soft as silk.\u201d His forehead pressed against hers.</p><p>He grimaced, lifting his head a few inches as he stared down at her, his thumb dragging roughly over her lips as she fought to breathe.</p><p>\u201cLift your legs.\u201d His voice was like gravel. \u201cBrace your knees against my hips.\u201d He lowered one hand, lifting her thigh as she did as he bid.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Rowdy.\u201d He slid in deeper than ever, filling her in ways she couldn\u2019t explain. \u201cOh God, I don\u2019t know what to do...\u201d She wanted to cry, wanted to ease the furious throb of hunger pulsing in her womb, in her cunt.</p><p>\u201cShush, baby,\u201d His voice was strained, his body tight with the effort it was taking as he helped her, positioning her knees against his hips as a ragged moan tore from his chest. \u201cSon of a bitch, you\u2019re so fucking tight. I could come just feeling you grip me like that.\u201d</p><p>The muscles inside her pussy were indeed milking him, rippling around him, driving her crazy with the furious heat building inside them. She stared up at him, feeling the tears on her cheeks, the emotions clogging her throat. She couldn\u2019t imagine ever needing anything more than she needed Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cEasy now, sweetheart,\u201d he warned as she felt his thighs bunching. \u201cIf I don\u2019t move I\u2019m going to come before you ever get yours. And you have to have yours.\u201d A wicked smile crossed his swollen lips as he began to move.</p><p>His cock slid slowly from the clutching grip of her cunt as she heard her own desperate groan of pleasure; the thrust back had her crying out in sharp agonizing need, and then there was no stopping him.</p><p>He arched back, gripping her legs and pressing them closer to her body as he stared down to where they came together, her gaze following automatically, watching as the slick, glistening shaft of his cock powered in and out of the flattened curves of her cunt. It was mesmerizing, consuming. She could feel raking fingers of pleasure, pain, sharp sensation, and fiery explosions of hunger ripping through her body as she watched him fuck her. Watched his cock thrust in and out, shafting her with furious strokes as the world receded around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She came again, screaming through her orgasm, and still he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he snarled, turning her to her side, her legs bent, pressed to her breasts as he leaned over her, one hand parting the cheeks of her ass as his fingers found the tingling entrance there.</p><p>Her back arched, her head falling back as his finger slid inside, pumping in tandem with the thick erection driving inside her cunt, stretching her, burning through her mind as pleasure and pain mixed with the addition of another finger to stretch her tender anus. And still his cock drove into her, stroking furiously over sensitized nerve endings until she was shuddering, convulsing around him, her juices spewing from her pussy as she heard him give a ragged shout and felt his body tighten.</p><p>She was still dissolving around him as she felt his release, the hot, furious blasts of semen filling her, burning her, sending her into another quaking paradox of sensation that had her convulsing beneath him as he held his cock deep inside her, shuddering with the pleasure ripping them both apart.</p><p>Kelly had lost sanity long before Rowdy\u2019s release. She quivered in the aftermath of orgasm, weak, wasted by the emotion, the pleasure that had erupted through her. She felt him collapse beside her, still buried inside her pussy, his breathing harsh, his arms tight as he pulled her to his damp chest.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby,\u201d he crooned in her ear as one hand massaged her chest, reminding her she was holding her breath as it released in a rush, sending stars exploding before her eyes. \u201cThere you go, sweet thing,\u201d he murmured, his lips at her shoulder as his cock jerked inside her. \u201cRest for a bit. Just a little bit. Then we\u2019ll try it again and see if we can\u2019t get it right.\u201d</p><p>Get it right? Dear God, if that wasn\u2019t right then he would kill her if he ever managed perfection.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>It was still dark when Kelly awoke, her body pleasantly sore as Rowdy slept deeply beside her, sprawled naked on his stomach.</p><p>Heat curled low in her stomach as she stared at his shadowed form, a shiver of remembered pleasure echoing through her womb.</p><p>Moving quietly, she slid from the bed, searching until she found Rowdy\u2019s T-shirt, discarded on the nearby chair earlier that night, and pulled it over her naked body. She couldn\u2019t hear anything below, but she doubted Dawg and Natches were both sleeping.</p><p>Making her way down the narrow, curved staircase, the faint glow of the television provided a dim light as Kelly headed for the small refrigerator.</p><p>She pulled a bottle of water free, uncapping it as she straightened and lifted it to her lips before she caught sight of Dawg.</p><p>He was sitting in the shadowed corner between the table and counter, his eyes gleaming in the darkness as she paused, watching him.</p><p>\u201cRowdy\u2019s gonna bitch over you stealing another of his shirts,\u201d he drawled quietly as she felt her face flush.</p><p>The heat had nothing do with the fact that she was caught stealing more of Rowdy\u2019s clothes, it was the sudden question of whether or not his wicked mouth had been the one caressing her earlier.</p><p>\u201cHe should be used to it by now.\u201d She cleared her throat uncomfortably, feeling a tingle of heat curl around her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a stubborn boy, though.\u201d He shrugged negligently. \u201cYou already know that.\u201d</p><p>Kelly leaned against the counter and watched him curiously. There was a lot she still didn\u2019t know about Rowdy and his relationship with his cousins. All anyone seemed to care about was the fact that sexually, they enjoyed sharing their toys.</p><p>She ducked her head, knowing she shouldn\u2019t have put off learning more about the three men together rather than just focusing on Rowdy. But it was Rowdy who held her heart, not the other two. Though she knew, eventually, they would become a part of the relationship she and Rowdy shared.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a frightened little doe standing there.\u201d His voice was like dark silk. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other too long for that wariness in your eyes, little girl.\u201d</p><p>Yes, they had. Dawg and Natches were as much a part of her life as Rowdy was.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not frightened of you, Dawg,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not frightened of any of you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she was frightened of herself.</p><p>\u201cPeople make too much out of our little pleasures,\u201d he grunted. \u201cAs though some insidious evil causes it rather than choice.\u201d He chuckled at his own words. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing evil in it, Kelly. And Rowdy would never press you for what you don\u2019t want. So you don\u2019t have to watch us as though we\u2019re going to jump you at any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the three of you think I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was getting myself into when I waited on Rowdy.\u201d She pressed her lips together as her own frustration ate inside her. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of not wanting it, Dawg, or even if I do want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be seduced into it. You want the choice taken out of your hands?\u201d He leaned back in his chair, watching her intently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to analyze it to death, that\u2019s for damned sure,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder the three of you found a woman to share if you talked her to death first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other women didn\u2019t matter, Kelly.\u201d He shocked her with his answer. \u201cThey were fun and games\u2014you\u2019re Rowdy\u2019s future. There can be no misunderstandings, no seduction, no hesitations or hiding from the truth if you accept it. If you accept it, then you accept all of it.</p><p>Even the fact that eventually, the man she loved would touch another woman, pleasure her, fuck her. She couldn\u2019t accept his cousins\u2019 touch without that knowledge.</p><p>\u201cI love him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be easy on any of us.\u201d He lifted his shoulders heavily. \u201cNatches and I both love you too, Kelly, not like Rowdy does, but we love you. We\u2019ve been burning along with him to touch you. But the day will come when one or both of us will find the woman we want for our own. The sharing isn\u2019t an every time thing, but it would sure as hell be missed if we stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever asked you to stop, Dawg?\u201d she asked. \u201cHave you ever considered it?\u201d</p><p>Something dangerous flashed in his expression before it was gone just as quickly. \u201cI\u2019d stop if someone I loved asked it of me. If I knew the woman I loved couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d He shrugged his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could bear to see him touch another woman, Dawg.\u201d A self-mocking smile twisted her lips. \u201cHow\u2019s that for hypocrisy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hypocrisy, sweetheart, honesty,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes a relationship like this work, being honest about it. Being true to yourself and to Rowdy. We couldn\u2019t ask for anything more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do this just for Rowdy,\u201d she breathed out roughly. \u201cI won\u2019t let him touch another woman just because I know it\u2019s what he wants. It has to make sense to me. I have to be able to live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true enough.\u201d He nodded in understanding. \u201cAny relationship is give and take. You give a little, Rowdy gives a little, and vice versa.\u201d He rose from his chair, moving the short distance to where she stood, towering over her.</p><p>Kelly swallowed deeply as she felt him surrounding her, his heat, the sensual hunger building inside him.</p><p>\u201cDawg...\u201d There was no way to retreat.</p><p>She shivered as he reached out, his callused fingers running down her arm and filling her with conflicting emotions. Could she do it? Fantasizing about it was one thing, and Lord knew she had fantasized about it often. But actually taking that step was another matter.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she protested, shaking her head as denial began to rage within her. A panicked sense of discomfort began to build. It might be what Rowdy wanted, but this wasn\u2019t Rowdy. It wasn\u2019t his body heating her, his need surrounding her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark and shadowed. A lot of truths can be hid in the shadows.\u201d Dawg\u2019s voice was darker than the night. \u201cAs can lies.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat as his head lowered, his lips too close to her own.</p><p>\u201cI could seduce you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI can give you that, Kelly. I don\u2019t have to wake up with you in the morning. I don\u2019t have to face you knowing I used your body against you. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoron.\u201d She pushed against his chest, her hands smacking into his hard-packed muscles as a shadowy chuckle whispered around her. \u201cGet away from me. You\u2019re about as amusing as the flu, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I make my point?\u201d His teeth flashed in a smile.</p><p>She sniffed disdainfully. \u201cThe point wasn\u2019t needed. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking I don\u2019t understand his reasons. But I\u2019m also still a woman, Dawg, not a plaything. He can get serious about this, or he can forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan he get anymore serious, Kelly? He let one of his cousins lick your ass. That\u2019s pretty damned serious to me.\u201d</p><p>Her face flamed as she narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWas it you?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest, watching her with a hint of a smile. \u201cOne licked, the other watched in anticipation. I ain\u2019t tellin\u2019 who did what.\u201d</p><p>A feeling of denial raged through her at the memory. This wasn\u2019t fantasy, it was reality, and she wasn\u2019t comfortable with it, no matter how much she wished she was.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Dawg, one of these days you boys are going to bite off more than you can chew in a woman. What are you going to do then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks to me like Rowdy has already managed that one,\u201d he chuckled as his gaze shot past her. \u201cAnd here he is to see how much further he can sink into monogamous bliss.\u201d</p><p>Kelly turned quickly, barely restraining a moan at the sight of Rowdy, naked, hard, his eyes gleaming with interest as he stood at the bottom of the steps. One thing she could say about him, naked or dressed, confidence oozed from every pore of his body. Confidence and pure, driving lust.</p><p>He tilted his head as he watched her, his gaze moving to his cousin, then back to her slowly. There was a challenge there, a knowing glint in his eye that assured her that he was well aware that she was wet and aroused herself.</p><p>\u201cThere you go stealing my clothes again.\u201d He shook his head in mock chastisement. \u201cI was hoping you would learn better, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she needs to be spanked,\u201d Dawg murmured behind her, sending her pulse rocketing at the suggestion.</p><p>She arched her brow as she held Rowdy\u2019s gaze. He was grinning back at her, a crooked, self-assured grin filled with carnal intent.</p><p>As she watched him, she was aware of Natches moving from the rear of the cabin, watching the scene curiously. The testosterone swept through the room, heavy with wicked hunger and sinful intent. Three predatory males, no matter how they tried to hide the primal instincts that ran just beneath the surface of their lazy humor.</p><p>They converged on her, tall, broad, aroused. Rowdy was the only one completely naked, but the other two were following suit quickly. Natches stripped off his shirt, while behind her she heard Dawg\u2019s movements, the rustle of his clothes.</p><p>Nerves ripped through her, sending shudders of instinctive response to curl through her lower stomach before burning a path of erotic destruction along her erogenous zones. Her nipples peaked. Her lips ached and her sex wept.</p><p>\u201cTake the shirt off, baby,\u201d Rowdy whispered as his hands gripped the hem, slowly drawing it upward.</p><p>Behind her, Dawg stepped closer. The shock of his bare hands running up her thighs had her tensing at the pleasure. She was so wet she could feel her juices dampening her thighs now, running freely from her weeping pussy as they prepared her for the coming possessions.</p><p>\u201cLook how pretty you are...\u201d Rowdy whispered reverently as she lifted her arms, allowing him to strip his shirt from her body. \u201cYou nipples are so hard, flushed. I love tasting them, Kelly. Feeling them in my mouth, the tight little points throbbing on my tongue.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were throbbing now at the thought of it.</p><p>The shirt was tossed aside, but it wasn\u2019t Rowdy\u2019s hands that cupped the firm globes, it was Dawg\u2019s. They slid around her side until both hands were filled with her flesh, the index finger and thumb of each hand gripping a hard point, playing with them, rolling them deliciously.</p><p>Her head fell back against his chest as the fingers moved aside. Rowdy shifted, making room for Natches as both men lowered their heads to the upthrust peaks.</p> <p>Kelly went to her tiptoes as sensation exploded through her. A ragged cry slipped past her lips as a flood of weakening lust ripped through her.</p><p>Kelly lost the ability to speak, to see, to do anything but feel as two sets of hard male lips covered the sensitive peaks. Fire engulfed her as damp, lava-hot tongues begin to whip over the tight flesh, and hard male mouths began to suckle erotically.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sweetheart,\u201d Dawg whispered at her ear as she began to writhe within the hold the three men had created. The feel of their mouths sucking at her sent arrows of near painful pleasure ripping to her womb, her clit. The aching throb was destroying her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kelly.\u201d His hands moved from her breasts, only to be replaced by Rowdy\u2019s and Natches\u2019s.</p><p>One arm clasped her to him as he slid his hand down her stomach, moving slowly for the tortured flesh of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d His name was a whimpering plea as she felt Dawg\u2019s palm cup the sensitized folds of her cunt, one finger tucking subtly against the syrup-laden entrance to her vagina.</p> <p>Rowdy groaned as he continued to suckle her, his teeth raking her nipple, his tongue flickering over it as Natches caught the tip he held captured between his teeth and pinched at it.</p><p>Her cry echoed around her as she twisted against Dawg, silently pleading to feel his finger slipping inside her.</p><p>The sensations tearing through her body were violent, destructive. Alternative caresses, suckling mouths, hands over her, hot male groans washing over her. And she was in the center of it, weak, helpless against the eroticism of each touch.</p><p>She pressed against Dawg\u2019s palm, shattering cries passing her lips at the pressure against her clit. It would be so easy to climax, if she could just press against him a bit more, just the barest friction would allow her to ease the hunger beating at her.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, baby,\u201d he whispered at her ear, nipping her lobe. \u201cLet your body burn for us, get so hungry that nothing matters except the touch, the need.\u201d</p><p>She was already burning. Her fingers clenched in Rowdy\u2019s and Natches\u2019s hair as she felt Dawg\u2019s fingers moving, felt him spreading her juices, allowing them to coat the tight entrance beyond as his finger massaged the closed portal.</p> <p>She felt her anal entrance clench at the caresses, felt it open, milk at the tip of his finger as another hand, she didn\u2019t know whose, began to play with the swollen bud of her clitoris.</p><p>She was trapped between them, in the middle of the kitchen area, suspended within a pleasure, a heat so intense she could barely make sense of it. Pleading, incoherent cries fell from her lips as she arched back, arched forward, so desperate that she no longer knew which touch would send her streaking toward orgasm; she just knew she needed it.</p><p>Yet, it was different than it had been with Rowdy alone. She struggled to push aside the vague unease she felt. The lack of emotional warmth, of sharing that had come from being in bed upstairs, just her and Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, sweetheart,\u201d Dawg whispered again as she felt the tip of his finger slide inside her anus. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re tight, and hot. Your ass is sucking at my finger like a little mouth, needing more. Do you need more, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>At the same time, hard fingers captured her clit and pumped it wickedly. Oh God, she could come so easy, if she could just get closer.</p><p>She relaxed her buttocks as flames licked at the little bud. Simultaneously, the little entrance sucked the hard finger deeper as the pressure eased at her clit, causing her to scream in pleasure and frustration.</p><p>Her ass felt filled, and yet she needed more. Her clit was pounding with need, her pussy clenching with it until suddenly, sirens began to rip through her head....</p><p>\u201cFuck...\u201d Reality slammed through as she was jerked to the floor, three cursing, furious men covering her as blasts shattered the erotic frenzy with cold fury.</p> <p>\u201cGet her to the side.\u201d She was being pulled, jerked to the side, between the heavy cabinets as the sound of pounding feet and raging curses were heralded by return fire.</p><p>Shadows flashed around her in the dark as she scrambled to the corner of the cabinets, her hands brushing over fabric as she felt the shirt she had worn earlier beneath her hands.</p><p>Pulling it from the floor, she crouched in the V made by the cabinets and pulled it over her head as Rowdy pressed her tight against his side.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask questions, she wasn\u2019t hysterical. She followed his lead as he, Natches, and Dawg began to work her closer to the back of the houseboat.</p><p>\u201cBastard shot the hull, Rowdy,\u201d Dawg hissed as the gunfire eased.</p><p>The computerized alarm was still going nuts, the siren shattering her nerves as the sound of the security personnel on the other end demanded an answer.</p><p>She noticed no one was answering. Within seconds they were informed that Lake Patrol had been alerted and was now moving for the area.</p><p>\u201cThe pumps are working.\u201d Natches slid in place with them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay until the patrol gets here.\u201d</p><p>They were dressed. She felt the scratch of Rowdy\u2019s jeans on her thigh, Natches at her rear. Dawg had dragged his shorts back on, but where Rowdy had come up with clothes she wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s on the cliff overlooking us,\u201d Natches snapped. \u201cThe trajectory of the shots would be about right for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to cross the point to get back to the road,\u201d Dawg growled. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. I\u2019m going after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d The word was a hollow, raspy sound, jerking from Kelly\u2019s throat as she caught at his pants.</p><p>Dawg brushed her hand aside, moving through the darkness as the pulsing siren continued to echo through the boat.</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d Rowdy pressed her against the counters before moving for the alarm box and quickly cutting the sound off.</p><p>Kelly listened silently as he spoke to the security personnel, his voice hard, dark, furious.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move from here until Rowdy comes back,\u201d Natches whispered in her ear. \u201cI need to check upstairs.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in reply, her throat tight, fear and fury clogging her voice until she wasn\u2019t certain she could speak. This was because of her. Someone had shot into the boat, tried to sink it, to kill them, because of her. She had placed Rowdy and his cousins in danger, had caused a madman to focus on them.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her waist, staying in place, huddled against the counter as Rowdy flipped on a light in the living area.</p><p>She looked up as he came around the counter, his expression hard, his eyes gleaming with rage.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby.\u201d His voice was gentle as he reached down for her. \u201cLake Patrol will be here to escort us to the dock in a minute. We need to get you dressed.\u201d</p><p>She pulled herself wearily to her feet, gazing around at the destruction. The windows were shattered, glass and debris littering the floor, the paneling splintered from the bullets.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He lifted her into his arms as she stared around numbly at the destruction.</p><p>Despair tightened in her chest as she buried her face against Rowdy\u2019s neck. She could feel her stomach cramping with guilt, with fear. One of them could have died. She could have lost Rowdy, or Dawg or Natches could have been hurt, killed.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He sat her in the middle of the bedroom floor before moving to the small closet and pulling free a pair of her jeans. \u201cPut these on.\u201d</p><p>She accepted them silently, bending to pull them over her feet and then to her hips before she took the sneakers from his hand. She sat on the bed, slipped them on, then struggled to tie the laces.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby.\u201d As Rowdy knelt before her, she realized the small whimpers she could hear were her own.</p><p>He brushed her fingers out of the way before tying the laces quickly, then staring up at her. Something twisted inside Kelly at the gentle emotion she saw in his eyes. Beyond the anger, the determination to kill that she could see raging inside him, she saw his gentleness.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t your fault, Kelly.\u201d He reached up, cupping her cheek in his hand.</p><p>Kelly fought the tears that clogged her throat. Rather than answering, she pulled from his touch slowly, shuddering at the thought that his need for her could end in his death.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try it.\u201d The snarl that twisted his face had her staring back at him in shock. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m going to let you run from me now, Kelly,\u201d he snapped roughly. \u201cThe time for running was over the minute you let me fuck that hot little body of yours.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head desperately, pushing against his chest as she fought to jerk to her feet. She couldn\u2019t speak. If she dared to attempt to, she knew the screams of rage and fear wouldn\u2019t be far behind.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Kelly...\u201d He grabbed her wrists, forcing her in place as she heard the first hoarse cry leave her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared, baby. I swear to you, we\u2019re all okay, we anticipated this, we know how to fight him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested fiercely, feeling the tears seeping past her eyes despite her desperation to hold them in check. \u201cHe\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t do this. You can\u2019t...\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to let him do it.</p><p>She tried to tear herself away from him, to get away from his touch, his warmth. She couldn\u2019t live like this. She couldn\u2019t live if anything happened to him, or the others, because of her.</p><p>\u201cI will do it.\u201d He gripped her upper arms, giving her a brief, hard shake as she stared back at him miserably. \u201cHear me well, Kelly. I will stop him. And when I get my hands on him I\u2019ll kill him. Do you understand me? He will never ever touch you or another woman again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Death shadowed his eyes as she stared back at him, incredulous. He would kill, and he would do so with no guilt, no second thoughts, she could see it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to kill you all. He won\u2019t stop.\u201d Her voice was shaky, her insides trembling with enough force to make her stomach pitch. \u201cBecause of me. What if you\u2019re hurt? What if he manages to...\u201d To kill one of you. She couldn\u2019t say the words, was terrified to let the thought pass her lips, as though giving it voice would make it more real than it already was.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop either, Kelly,\u201d he bit out. \u201cListen to me, dammit. I will not stop until he\u2019s dead. I will not let that bastard terrorize you.\u201d</p><p>She opened her lips to argue, to beg, only to be cut off as Dawg moved quickly into the room.</p><p>\u201cHe got away.\u201d He was breathing rough, heavy. \u201cLake Patrol is moving in and Ray and Maria are right behind them. Natches is on the deck waiting for them.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy turned back to her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving with them, Kelly. Don\u2019t even consider it.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught, feeling the shudders in her belly beginning to work through her body. She had no other choice. She had to leave. And soon, she would have to leave Ray\u2019s home as well. She couldn\u2019t continue to endanger the people she loved.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me gag you.\u201d She stared back at him in shock as his voice rumbled dangerously.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to try to run from this. I can see it in your eyes. Leaving town isn\u2019t the answer Kelly. And if you try, I\u2019ll throw you over my shoulder and cart you out of here like a sack of fucking potatoes. Don\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled back from his teeth in a powerful snarl as his eyes blazed with green fire back at her. Shock whipped through her at the deadly warning she saw in his gaze, as well as the confidence that he would carry out his warning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d She tried to protest, to fight against the sheer force she could feel wrapping around her.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Kelly,\u201d he growled, rising slowly to his feet as he pulled her after him. \u201cDon\u2019t fight me on this. Not right now.\u201d</p><p>She felt dazed, overtaken, her mind overwhelmed by the danger and the certainty that if she attempted to run from him, then he would chase her down. He wouldn\u2019t let her go. Not now, not yet. Not before he shed blood.</p> <p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Sheriff Ezekiel Mayes had surveyed the destruction of the Nauti Buoy after she limped into dock. His deputies were going through the interior as Kelly, Rowdy, Dawg, and Natches sat inside the small employees\u2019 room of the marina.</p><p>Ray and Maria stood at the side of the room as Sheriff Mayes took their statements. Kelly could see the knowledge in the sheriff\u2019s eyes as he questioned her, his gaze flickering to the Mackay cousins, a hint of disapproval lighting the golden brown depths of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see anything at all?\u201d His gaze went over the four of them once again. \u201cHard to believe three tough ex-Marines would let a stalker get the jump on them, especially considering those same Marines were well aware of the danger of the situation.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pressed her lips together as she clenched her hands in her lap. She had to grit her teeth to keep from defending the men. To keep from revealing the fact that she knew Rowdy had planned this. She knew he had, and it infuriated her.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Zeke, you know better than that,\u201d Rowdy bit out. \u201cKelly needed some time out. I thought the cove would be safe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fool, Rowdy,\u201d the sheriff snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not buying that shit and neither is your daddy.\u201d He nodded to where Ray was staring back at his son with a heavy scowl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m old enough that my daddy\u2019s opinion either way doesn\u2019t sway me, Zeke,\u201d Rowdy snapped back. \u201cNow why don\u2019t you let me take Kelly home to rest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly, letting these three mix you up in some crazy scheme to catch this stalker is a bad idea.\u201d The sheriff hunched down in front of her chair. \u201cLet me handle this. We\u2019ll catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t yet,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head as anger and fear collided inside her.</p><p>Damn them all. She felt like a bone in the middle of a pack of wild dogs.</p> <p>Compassion filled the sheriff\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not a vigilante, sweetheart. When he\u2019s caught, I need the law on my side, not his. Kelly, if these boys suspect someone, I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I suspected anyone, you\u2019d know it, Zeke.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice was hard, cold. \u201cNow leave her the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, stop snapping around me.\u201d Kelly jerked to her feet, causing the sheriff to straighten and stare down at her with a heavy scowl. \u201cAll of you. I\u2019ve had enough for tonight. I didn\u2019t see anyone. I didn\u2019t hear anything. We were on the lake to get the hell away from that bastard. That was all.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her fingers through her hair, aware of the strained silence filling the room. She glanced over at her mother, and saw knowledge there. They knew why she was at the lake with the three cousins. She and Ray knew, and though Kelly felt no embarrassment, no shame at the knowledge, what she did feel was a sudden certainty that this wasn\u2019t a relationship she could endure.</p><p>Not because of the knowledge. Not because of morality. Because she didn\u2019t love them. She loved Rowdy, and the discontent, the subtle anger building inside her for days now over his expectations were clawing at her heart. The attack had only reinforced it. She was tired of being controlled. Period. First by a damned stalker and then by her need to please Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go home.\u201d She shook her head before lifting her chin and staring around the room. \u201cNow. I need to sleep and I need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go home.\u201d Sheriff Mayes nodded. \u201cBut I may need to ask you some more questions tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a minute and I\u2019ll drive you\u2014\u201d Rowdy began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ride with Mom and Ray,\u201d she told him, ignoring the surprise that swept across his face. \u201cI need to think, Rowdy. We can talk later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly.\u201d He caught her arm as she moved to step past him. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>We?</p><p>She moved her gaze over his cousins. She had been in their arms, felt their hunger and their lust, and despite the pleasure, she could feel her anger building. They were like little boys desperate to keep their newest toy close to them.</p><p>She inhaled deeply. \u201cWhatever you want to do, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her arm from his grip before moving to Ray and her mother.</p><p>\u201cSure?\u201d Ray asked her quietly.</p><p>\u201cI just want to go home,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy, Natches, and Dawg moved from the store with them. She was aware of how they placed themselves around her, protectively, shielding her. She felt smothered instead as she moved into the backseat of her stepfather\u2019s Laredo.</p><p>Within minutes they were heading to the house, a fucking convoy of vehicles. Dawg and Natches were in front of the Laredo with Rowdy bringing up the rear.</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2014\u201d Her mother began softly.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Mom.\u201d She huddled into the backseat, wishing she could make sense of the emotions clouding her heart, her mind. Trying to make sense of her anger.</p><p>Rowdy was taking her over. Forceful. Dominant. He was so certain he knew what she needed, but Kelly had seen what she needed, and it wasn\u2019t what he was offering.</p><p>It was the reason she couldn\u2019t make the choice. Why she fought Rowdy every time he pushed for her to make a conscious decision about her needs. It was why she had wanted to be seduced, because she knew that unless the decision was taken out of her hands, she couldn\u2019t make it.</p><p>And that drove home the sharp edge of knowledge that this wasn\u2019t something she could do. She couldn\u2019t let this happen, because if she did, it would shadow her relationship with Rowdy forever. It would be better to lose him now than to have to share him later. If any more of her soul became invested in this, then she didn\u2019t know how she would bear letting go of every dream she had ever had. Hell, she didn\u2019t know how she was going to do it now.</p><p>Maybe she just wasn\u2019t naughty enough for the man she loved, or his cousins.</p><p>He was a fool. Rowdy followed the Laredo, his thoughts as confused as the emotions he had glimpsed raging in Kelly\u2019s eyes. He ached, and it wasn\u2019t because of the attack. That just pissed him off. No, he ached because the attack had been a diversion he had begun praying for just before it happened. A way to pull Kelly from Dawg\u2019s arms, make certain the fingers filling her tight ass were gone, the touch to her clit no one\u2019s but his own.</p><p>Jealousy had begun to mar the pleasure even before the sounds of gunshots and the whiz of bullets tearing through the cabin had sent them all crashing to the floor.</p><p>What the hell was he supposed to do now? Dawg and Natches had protected her for the past four years from the bastards desperate to get into her pants. His two cousins hadn\u2019t touched her because of the understanding of the relationship that would evolve later. Even though Rowdy knew they had hungered for her almost as desperately as he had.</p><p>Had he not been so intent on running those last four years, of being certain what he wanted, the attack wouldn\u2019t have happened. He would have been there to protect her, to keep that bastard from touching her. But what would have happened to the relationship he had always envisioned?</p><p>He realized now that the shift in his desires had begun before he returned home. Hell, before he took that last tour in the Marines. He hadn\u2019t wanted to face it, and now it was slamming into his face with the force of a sledgehammer.</p><p>He was risking everything he had come home for and he hadn\u2019t even realized it. His own arrogance, his own certainty that he hadn\u2019t, that he couldn\u2019t change. That the sexual pleasures that had always been such a part of his life would remain the same.</p><p>Kelly was changing the rules. She was changing him.</p><p>Rowdy rubbed at his neck wearily, blowing out a frustrated breath as he turned into the driveway of his father\u2019s home, his eyes scanning the well-lit exterior. Dawg and Natches had pulled to the sides of the driveway, keeping Ray\u2019s Laredo between their vehicles with Rowdy bringing up the rear.</p><p>Turning off the ignition, Rowdy opened the door and stepped from his pickup as Ray, Maria, and Kelly slowly stepped from the Laredo.</p><p>With a flick of his fingers he sent Natches ahead of them to check out the house before Kelly entered. His eyes continued to scan the exterior, the hairs on the back of his neck tingling as he moved closer to Kelly. He could feel the bastard out there, watching them.</p><p>She leaned into him as his arm went around her. Damn, she was exhausted, terrified. What the hell was he going to do about her? As the warmth of her swept through his body, the possessiveness growing inside him seemed to expand, strengthen.</p><p>Leading her toward the house, he kept his senses on alert as Natches slipped in ahead of them, with Dawg following close behind.</p><p>\u201cRowdy, we need to talk,\u201d Kelly whispered as they stepped up to the porch.</p><p>\u201cWe will, baby.\u201d He bent his head, kissing the top of her head before leading her into the hallway, his eyes finding Dawg as he made his way along the top of the stairs. Natches had moved into the kitchen, each man checking the rooms thoroughly as Rowdy led Kelly, and their parents, into the darkened living room.</p><p>\u201cLeave the lights off for now, Dad,\u201d he advised his father as he moved Kelly to the wide chair at the side of the room. \u201cThere were signs of a watcher on the hill overlooking the house on this side the other night. The lights will pick up shadows with the thin curtains in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d his father muttered, but the lights stayed out. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>As Ray took care of drinks for himself, Maria, and Kelly, Rowdy went through the house again, checking windows, assuring himself it was safe for the few hours of night left. Dawg was currently set up in Kelly\u2019s room, armed with a night vision telescope as he watched the hill across the clearing, while Natches had slipped outside to take watch.</p><p>Returning downstairs, he escorted Kelly to his own bedroom. She was quiet, withdrawn, and he\u2019d be damned if he knew what to say to her.</p><p>\u201cGrab one of my shirts and go on to bed, darling.\u201d He couldn\u2019t touch her, if he did, he was guaranteed to completely humiliate himself. How could one man be as big a fool as he was? he wondered. And now, how did he fix it?</p><p>She was moving for his closet even as he spoke, and pulling free one of his more comfortable T-shirts. He had to give her credit for knowing what she wanted.</p><p>As he stood silently watching her, she stripped down to bare skin, then drew the shirt over her head and smoothed it down past her thighs. His clothes hung on her, but they carried her scent for weeks after she wore them. The soft, subtle hint of woman that only he could smell.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead and do whatever you have to do,\u201d she told him, her voice cool as she flipped the blankets back on his bed and crawled in. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to deal with it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, baby.\u201d He came close enough to bend, to let his lips caress the still kiss-swollen curves of hers as she stared up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will,\u201d she sighed heavily, her gray eyes shadowed. \u201cAnd tomorrow, I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think she meant sexually.</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, Rowdy.\u201d She shook her head firmly. \u201cTomorrow. I\u2019m just too tired to talk tonight.\u201d</p><p>He could see the adrenaline crashing through her, wiping her out. She was still in shock, fighting the reality of the attack. She would dream later, he knew. And the nightmares could be ugly. He promised himself he\u2019d be back by then, that he would hold her through them, ease her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d He smoothed her hair back from her face as she settled into the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs for a while, baby. I\u2019ll leave the door open and I won\u2019t be long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay, Rowdy,\u201d she assured him, a thread of mockery filling her voice. \u201cGo. Just let me sleep.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy paced the house. Nervous tension was a bitch, and suffering from it wasn\u2019t something he normally did. But damn if he wasn\u2019t just about to cut his own throat just to ease the thoughts tormenting him.</p><p>What the hell had he done?</p><p>When he first came downstairs on the Nauti Buoy, the sight of Kelly standing next to Dawg had sent his cock to full erection and the blood racing through his veins. Just as it had earlier when his cousin had moved behind her, his lips moving over her buttocks, spreading them, caressing her.</p><p>It had been hot as hell, feeling her pleasure as her hot little mouth surrounded the sensitive crest of his cock. Holding back had been iffy. His balls had drawn up in tortuous need, desperate to explode as the pleasure of it had seared his nerve endings.</p><p>He had ignored that unfamiliar tension that began to hover at the back of his mind. Fought with it. Then later, as his lips suckled at her tight nipple his eyes had watched as Natches pleasured the other, and he heard the words Dawg whispered to her. How snug she was, how hot, and the lust that filled his cousin\u2019s voice had slapped at Rowdy.</p><p>Jealousy. Possessiveness. He wasn\u2019t used to those emotions, but now they raged inside him until his fists were clenched and violence simmered just beneath the surface. He prayed for the chance to get his hands on the little son of a bitch stalking Kelly. To take out the fury and aggression rising inside him on someone who deserved it. Neither Dawg nor Natches deserved it, but it was building, growing inside him until Rowdy wasn\u2019t certain he could contain it.</p><p>Stalking back to the living room, he moved to the small bar Ray kept at the side of the room and poured a measure of whiskey into one of the tumblers sitting ready. The liquid burned going down, but did nothing to calm the beast raging inside him.</p><p>\u201cLiquor doesn\u2019t help, boy.\u201d</p><p>He turned, his hand tightening on the butt of the pistol he carried before recognizing his father.</p><p>Ray stood just inside the doorway, dressed in a pair of dark cotton pajama bottoms and a faded T-shirt. His expression was sober, lined with worry, and his eyes gleamed with knowledge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll catch him.\u201d Rowdy shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s losing focus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about her stalker.\u201d He moved farther into the room. \u201cI was talking about what happened on that boat before he attacked.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy brought the glass to his lips and threw back the rest of the whisky before grimacing tightly. Damn, he didn\u2019t need this conversation with his father.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t set well, does it, Son?\u201d Ray moved closer to the bar, lifting one of the clean tumblers and pouring his own drink. \u201cIt starts eating at your gut first thing, tearing at you, making you wonder where your mind was.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy narrowed his eyes on his father, hearing the knowledge in his voice, the assurance that only came from experience.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t take her,\u201d he muttered, wondering why the hell he was bothering to explain this to his father of all people.</p><p>\u201cMight not have, but something happened. Something strong enough to make you panic, to keep you awake. To tear your guts up with guilt.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cShe was shot at, Dad, that\u2019s enough to shake any man\u2019s insides.\u201d</p> <p>Ray sipped at his drink, staring at him over the rim of the glass. Rowdy couldn\u2019t hide from the knowledge, no matter how much he suddenly wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s going on, Son,\u201d he finally sighed heavily. \u201cYou think you and those two hardheaded cousins of yours are the only men in this family to think they know what they want in a woman? And in her pleasure?\u201d Ray frowned heavily, his eyes darkening. \u201cYou\u2019re not. I\u2019ve tried to warn you since I first caught wind of what was going on, and you\u2019ve never wanted to listen.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy watched his father curiously then. Through the years, there had been whispers that Ray Mackay and his best friend had been up to some sexual little games, but nothing concrete and nothing his dad had ever confirmed.</p><p>Ray grunted mockingly. \u201cYour generation thinks they know everything. You don\u2019t. Mine knew what a reputation was, and we knew what should be kept private and what should be flaunted. Women like Calista James were steered clear of except for a certain few. We knew our actions would always backfire on us, if not at the time, then later, on our wives, our children. I thought I taught you that, but maybe I failed there too.\u201d</p><p>Ray shook his head as he nodded to the chairs Maria and Kelly had sat in earlier. \u201cCome over here, Rowdy. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving face,\u201d his father sighed. \u201cThose two cousins of yours have waited nearly as long as you have for Kelly. They don\u2019t love her like you do, but when you yank something like that out of a man\u2019s hands, he\u2019s bound to get pissed. And you don\u2019t want that kind of pissed from men you\u2019ve been as close to as brothers.\u201d</p><p>Ray leaned forward in his chair, staring back at Rowdy intently. Damn, that look had the ability to send him right back to his teenage years and the memory of his father\u2019s chastisements.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a teenager anymore, but at the moment he felt as uncertain as one.</p><p>Rowdy turned his gaze to his drink, wondering what the hell he was supposed to say. He\u2019d already figured out the fact that he was making a hell of a mistake\u2014he didn\u2019t need his father to point that out to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough, being as close to men as you are to Dawg and Natches,\u201d Ray sighed. \u201cYou three are closer than brothers, you always have been.\u201d He shook his head, staring down at the glass in his hand as he grimaced painfully. \u201cI had a friend like that once, Rowdy.\u201d He lifted his eyes then. \u201cA damned good friend.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy stared back at him, knowing what was coming. Knowing he didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>\u201cIt was before your mother.\u201d Ray cleared his throat. \u201cAnd there was this woman. One that made the blood boil in my veins, made me want forever. But I was dumb. Brick dumb. I thought I\u2019d always be the man I was then. That what I wanted sexually would always be a part of my life. And I shared that woman. Because I thought that pleasure was the greatest gift I could give her...\u201d</p><p>He tossed back the rest of his drink before meeting Rowdy\u2019s eyes once again.</p><p>\u201cKelly should have been your sister, Rowdy. If I hadn\u2019t been so stupid, I wouldn\u2019t have lost Maria all those years ago. She chose the lover willing to love just her, rather than his own selfishness. Willing to give her all of himself, without the childish need to have it all his own way.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s jaw bunched tightly.</p><p>\u201cDad, let it go.\u201d Rowdy shook his head sharply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re figuring it out, I can see that in your eyes. The same way I thought I was figuring it out. But I let that bond I thought I had with my buddy get in the way. I was torn between the loss of friendship, and my own wants. And I thought the woman would be there either way. It wasn\u2019t the friend I lost, Rowdy. It was the woman. And trust me, when it comes right down to it, Kelly is no different than her mother.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy breathed in deeply. Damn, he hadn\u2019t wanted to hear this. He lifted the whisky before tipping more of the liquor into his glass.</p><p>His father was silent then, finishing his drink as Rowdy sipped from his.</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d Rowdy finally breathed out roughly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove changes us, Son.\u201d Ray rose to his feet, crossing the room slowly to set his empty glass on the bar. \u201cDon\u2019t make the same mistake I did, Rowdy. Once it\u2019s over that first time, once you\u2019ve let another man claim what\u2019s yours and yours alone, you lose a part of your soul. Getting it back is hell. A hell I hope you never know.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy stared back at his father silently, finally hearing what the other man had always tried to teach him. What was fair, what he wanted alone, wasn\u2019t all that mattered. He had begun learning it in the Marines, but it was slapping him upside the head now.</p><p>\u201cJames Salyers was still a friend when he died, Rowdy. And I grew up and learned some damned hard lessons. Maria gave me a second chance, but that chance came at a cost. A very high cost. The daughter that should have been mine came from another man, and the son I love more than life is about to fuck up not just his own life, but that girl\u2019s as well. Watching it and knowing I can\u2019t stop it is hell. Remember that while you struggle between what you love and what you want.\u201d</p><p>As Rowdy watched his father leave the room, a heavy sigh slipped past his lips. Maria\u2019s objections to his relationship made more sense now. He shook his head, realizing how well his father, James Salyers, and Maria had kept that secret. Reputations. Theirs was intact, but his wasn\u2019t. And now, he was risking Kelly\u2019s as well.</p><p>Kelly was awake when he returned to the bedroom a little after midnight. Sleep wasn\u2019t coming, no matter how hard she sought it. Each time she closed her eyes she saw...herself...surrounded by the Mackay cousins, their hands touching her as pleasure whipped around her. But it wasn\u2019t pleasure she felt in the memory. She felt the dark swirl of shame.</p><p>The same emotions she had felt each time she swore she wasn\u2019t waiting one day longer on Rowdy and she was going to find someone to love her. To stick around and be with her. Each time she had tried, each time she had attempted to allow another man to touch her, shame had eaten her alive for days later.</p><p>The door closed behind him, the click of the lock causing her to open her eyes, to stare through the darkness as his shadow moved toward the bed.</p><p>God, she loved him. If she could give him his every desire then she would do it in a second, but some things she knew she couldn\u2019t do. Dawg and Natches she couldn\u2019t do. And she had no idea how to tell him. No idea how to broach what she knew could destroy the relationship she had dreamed of.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s quiet,\u201d he said softly as he pulled his shirt from his body.</p><p>The room was dark, too dark to make out his expression, but she could hear his voice, see the gleam of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d She could feel the tension between them.</p><p>Rowdy sat at the edge of the bed, pausing before he sighed tiredly and bent to take off his sneakers.</p><p>\u201cRowdy?\u201d She whispered his name, uncertain what to say, what to do as he rose to his feet and shucked off his jeans.</p><p>He was naked. As he turned to her she glimpsed the heavy, engorged length of his erection a second before she was suddenly jerked to him.</p><p>\u201cRowdy?\u201d She gasped his name as his lips covered hers, stealing her breath, her startled cry.</p><p>And from there, her strength. His hands were hard, dominant as he tore the shirt from her body, tossing it carelessly to the floor before his lips took hers again. Her muted cries built in her head as he bore her to the bed, spreading her thighs, sinking into her.</p><p>There were no preliminaries. No foreplay. One moment she was empty, the next she was full, her pussy stretched to its limits as he groaned into her mouth.</p><p>She fought to breathe, and she could feel his struggle as well. The harsh sounds that tore from his throat were almost animalistic in their hunger, their intensity. His lips held back both their cries as he began to move, hard, furious strokes inside, sending her nerve endings into shock, the pleasure ripping through her with the same desperation with which his erection thrust into the slick, heated depths of her body.</p><p>Her arms wrapped about his neck, fingers pushing into his hair as one hard hand gripped her hip, holding her in place as he moved. The other arm curled beneath her as he supported himself on his elbow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He surrounded her. He possessed her. Pleasure became a burning, consuming need as he fucked her with a hunger that swept through her soul. She could almost touch his soul. Then her eyes opened, widened, shock and ecstasy exploding through her as the orgasm overtaking her stole a part of her very spirit. Stole it and merged it with his. Melded them together as he stiffened above her, his cock swelling then pulsing as his release jetted inside her. Deep, almost violent spurts of his seed heated her, triggering another, deeper orgasm, sending stars to explode around her as she screamed soundlessly into his kiss.</p><p>\u201cMine!\u201d The hard, throaty growl that left his throat had to have been her imagination. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Possessive. Consuming. His.</p> <p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>\u201cRowdy, we\u2019re not going to be able to keep her here.\u201d Dawg moved through the living room, checking the windows and their latches the next afternoon. \u201cYour dad\u2019s security system is good, but it won\u2019t stop a bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know many that will,\u201d Rowdy muttered, tamping down his impatience as he pushed his fingers through his hair and surveyed the living room.</p><p>He had been through the rest of the house, just as Dawg and Natches had been over the hill above it. The bastard was hiding there at night, watching the house, and he had a clear shot into every room from one point or another, if one of them messed up and didn\u2019t close the curtains well enough.</p><p>And that didn\u2019t change the fact that his dad and Maria were refusing to leave now. As was Kelly.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back at us quick enough to keep us from making headway into security here,\u201d Natches drawled from the entryway. He was in that clearing across from her room last night. I never caught sight of him, but I could feel him. He was out there. And he\u2019s damn good.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get her out of here, Rowdy,\u201d Dawg reiterated. \u201cNow. My gut is going crazy with this. Whoever the bastard is, he\u2019s lost his damned mind. He won\u2019t care who he kills to get to Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour place?\u201d Rowdy\u2019s eyes narrowed on Dawg\u2019s expression. He could see the expectation there, the excitement.</p><p>Dawg\u2019s house was an underground masterpiece built by his parents. The outside was cement and stone overlaid with roughened wood siding. The windows were extra thick and after Dawg\u2019s return from the Marines, bulletproof. As far as anyone knew, there was only one way in or out. No one knew about the hidden entrance except for the three of them.</p><p>Dawg nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the most secure.\u201d</p> <p>Rowdy braced himself. He could feel the sexual tension beginning to heat up in the room. His cousins had waited years for this. Hell, they all had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sharing her.\u201d The words were out of Rowdy\u2019s mouth before he could stop them.</p><p>His head snapped up, his jaw tightening as Dawg and Natches stared back at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIs that your decision or Kelly\u2019s?\u201d Natches tipped his head to the side and watched him curiously.</p><p>Rowdy found the look testing his temper. Natches liked to push and he liked to challenge things just for the hell of it. Rowdy hated the thought of fighting his cousin over something that should have been settled years before, but he would.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whose decision it is.\u201d Rowdy pushed the words past his lips, attempting to contain the anger rising from his cousin\u2019s question. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening. We\u2019ll move her to the house, but hands off. Period.\u201d</p><p>Dawg sighed heavily, a grimace contorting his expression.</p><p>\u201cNow, son of a bitch, how did I know you were going to go and get all dog-eared fucking jealous?\u201d he griped, his green eyes narrowed in irritation. \u201cHell, Rowdy, talk about blue balls going on here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalk about too damned bad,\u201d Rowdy muttered as his muscles bunched and flexed beneath his flesh in rising tension. Damn, this shit sucked. As though the possessiveness, the emotions he felt for her were a separate being living within his flesh and bone.</p><p>\u201cHell, we can argue over this later,\u201d Natches finally grumped. \u201cAfter I take out my mad on that son of a bitch stalking her. Then we can fight over sharing rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sharing rights. Period,\u201d Rowdy snapped. The only thing that restrained him from taking his cousins apart limb by limb was the fact that he knew them. They weren\u2019t pissed, at least not yet. But Rowdy admitted he was getting there fast.</p><p>And it was his own damned fault. He was mad at himself for letting this situation get out of control, for letting his cousins believe there would be more here than he was able to accept now.</p><p>\u201cChill out, cuz,\u201d Dawg breathed out roughly. \u201cHell, it would have been nice, but no one\u2019s pushing. Wouldn\u2019t be worth a shit if both of you didn\u2019t want it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy narrowed his eyes on his older cousin. There was a vague restlessness in his voice, and he realized it had been there for a while.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you two think you\u2019re doing? Growing the fuck up?\u201d Natches snapped then, disgust lining his voice and filling his green eyes. \u201cIf I wanted to grow up I would have stayed in the fucking Marines.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy rolled his eyes. Trust Natches to get to the heart of the matter.</p><p>\u201cI guess it was bound to happen eventually,\u201d Dawg sighed. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get the little troublemaker hid out in the house and see what we can do to make her life a little safer before she takes on the resident grouch here.\u201d He flicked his hand toward Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cThis falling in love crap obviously sucks,\u201d Natches commented as he turned and headed out of the room. \u201cRemind me to steer clear of it why doncha, guys? God only knows what kind of fool I might end up making of myself if I made that mistake.\u201d His mock shudder had a grin pulling at Rowdy\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Natches, you know what happens when we tempt fate.\u201d How many times had they assured themselves the fun and games would never end. And now look where they were.</p><p>\u201cFate can kiss my ass,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cBetter yet, she can suck my dick. I\u2019m footloose and fancy-free, my man. And that\u2019s how I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy eyed his cousin warily. There was lightning striking somewhere, he was certain, and at that moment he decided he didn\u2019t want to be anywhere around when Natches finally did manage to fall in love.</p><p>\u201cThink about it guys,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d ever be able to touch another woman after Kelly? That she could ever bear the thought of it, even if I could? She\u2019s my life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this sugar is just going to give me a toothache,\u201d Natches growled as he threw him a dark look. \u201cGet over it already. She would have gone along with it if she had spent awhile between the three of us. She\u2019s a fair-minded person\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell maybe I\u2019m not,\u201d Rowdy bit out, his tone guttural. \u201cKeep pushing me, Natches, and you\u2019re going to get the fight you\u2019re aiming for.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy was aware of Dawg watching them both warily, sensing the tension suddenly whipping between Natches and Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cNone of you are going to fight.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s head whipped around as Kelly stepped into the room, her gray eyes glittering with temper, her face flushed with it.</p><p>She was dressed in a pair of those low-rise jeans he liked so damn well. It was paired with a little cami shirt with tiny straps that flashed abdomen and the belly ring that made his dick jerk in his pants. That curvy little body of hers was going to be the death of him.</p><p>Surprisingly, Natches backed down from the look in her eye, not that Rowdy blamed the other man\u2014she looked ready to claw all their eyes out.</p><p>\u201cHell, Kelly, you know us. We fight for the hell of it.\u201d Natches flashed a smile at her, one that gave a hell of a pretense of friendly amusement, if you discounted the darkening of those pale eyes.</p><p>\u201cSave it for someone you can convince.\u201d She frowned back at the other man.</p><p>Natches grimaced.</p><p>\u201cKelly, you know\u201d\u2014Rowdy leaned against the bar as he watched her\u2014\u201cI can take care of some things myself here.\u201d</p><p>She was cute as hell as she watched them with a temper tantrum seething just beneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cWhere these two are concerned?\u201d She flicked her fingers between Dawg and Natches. \u201cRowdy, I doubt a whole team of Marines could whip those two in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral might have tried though,\u201d Dawg pointed out, his lips twitching in a grin.</p><p>She stared between the three of them before her gaze moved back to Rowdy. He could see it in her eyes, she must have caught part of the conversation, but that didn\u2019t mean she liked any of it. He was realizing just how intensely private his little love was, and it shocked him to realize how much that pleased him.</p><p>He should have known Kelly would change the rules on him; what surprised him was the fact that she made him like it. It sent a strange little pulse of pride through him, that considering his past, he shouldn\u2019t have felt.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re making plans concerning my life or my safety,\u201d she said then, crossing her arms beneath the tempting mounds of her breasts, \u201cI think I should be a part of the planning process. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>What had made him think she would accept anything less?</p><p>\u201cNow, Kelly,\u201d Natches drawled then. \u201cWe can take care of the detail stuff here. You shouldn\u2019t worry your little head about this stuff.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy and Dawg both blinked back at the other man, wondering if he\u2019d lost his ever-lovin\u2019 mind. Everyone who knew Kelly knew you simply did not patronize her, period. She was sharp as a whip and had definite ideas on a lot of things. Pig-headed men being one of those things.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s eyes narrowed on him. \u201cJust not worry my little head about it?\u201d she asked him gently.</p><p>\u201cKelly...\u201d Rowdy cleared his throat, looking for an excuse for his dim-witted cousin.</p><p>\u201cMore or less.\u201d Natches\u2019s smile was condescending as Rowdy stared at him in disbelief. When had his cousin decided that women were stupid?</p><p>\u201cKelly, sweetheart, Dad and Maria were supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to distract me, Rowdy, it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she snapped, her dark eyes furious as her stubborn chin lifted, her soft lips tightening in anger as her gaze swung back to Natches.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kelly, we all know Natches can be a knothead,\u201d Dawg sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s not hurt him too bad here. We might need him down the road later to dig ditches or something.\u201d</p><p>Natches\u2019s lips lifted in a grin as his light green eyes stayed locked on Kelly. And suddenly, Rowdy knew his game. He almost laughed when his gaze went back to Kelly and rather than seeing furious arousal glittering in her eyes, he only saw the anger.</p><p>His little spitfire wasn\u2019t in the least turned on by Natches\u2019s confrontational attitude.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Natches\u201d\u2014she lifted a hand and surveyed her nails for a second before lifting her gaze back to the other man\u2014\u201cjust because I\u2019m not exactly a part of the upper crust of this fine little town doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know its little secrets. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking I\u2019m one of those slow-witted little blondes you and Dawg have been snacking on lately. Because I\u2019m not. And neither am I at all interested in taming that bad boy thing you have going on. And as for you.\u201d She turned to Rowdy.</p><p>Rowdy lifted his brow curiously. There was the arousal. It glittered just beneath the anger as she raked over his lazy slouch against the bar. \u201cBefore making any plans that concern my future, maybe you\u2019ll be good enough to discuss them with me first. If you don\u2019t mind, that is.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. The lash of displeasure in her voice actually stung.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s our cue to go,\u201d Dawg stated with a smile as he straightened from where he was leaning against the wall. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Natches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Natches drawled. \u201cWatching her neuter him is way too much fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rowdy straightened as hurt flashed in Kelly\u2019s eyes as she stared back at the other man. Natches\u2019s tone was bordering snide, and Rowdy was fed up with it.</p><p>\u201cNatches, shut the hell up,\u201d he warned softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Natches asked with apparent joviality. \u201cHell, Rowdy, I\u2019m taking notes here. Watching you get your dick twisted in a knot like this over her is teaching me what not to do.\u201d</p> <p>He was going to kill Natches.</p><p>\u201cKelly, ignore that fool,\u201d Dawg drawled then. \u201cHe\u2019s just pissed as hell that you\u2019re not twisting his dick, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s getting ready to get his ass kicked.\u201d Rowdy moved then.</p><p>He stalked across the room, ignoring Kelly\u2019s flinch as he pulled her against him, his lips pressing to her forehead as he held her to him, his gaze slicing to Natches in warning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just discussing the best place to protect you, baby.\u201d He rubbed his hand down her arm, feeling her tremble against him despite her anger. \u201cNo plans are being made without you. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be babied.\u201d She pulled away from him, but the hurt in her voice was easy to hear and Rowdy promised he was going to make Natches pay for that one. \u201cI just thought somehow, plans that included me were my business. Just forget it.\u201d</p><p>She turned and stalked from the room as Rowdy turned back to Natches. The minute he heard her moving up the hallway, he jumped for the older man.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Hold on there, boy.\u201d Dawg jumped in front of him, blocking him with his wider body as Rowdy growled in fury. \u201cYou know how he gets. Dammit, Rowdy, you start a fight in here and Maria\u2019s gonna kick all our asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out of my face.\u201d He jabbed his finger over Dawg\u2019s shoulder, glaring back at Natches as his expression darkened with anger. \u201cAnd so help me God, you treat her like that again and I\u2019ll tear your dick off and feed it to you. You want to be a bastard because you\u2019re not getting what you want, then you take it up with me.\u201d</p><p>He knew Natches\u2019s problem, and he knew he should have anticipated it. Dawg and Natches both had waited, just as he had, for Kelly. They had hungered, lusted, expected certain things where her relationship with Rowdy was concerned.</p><p>This was his fault. As he jerked away from Dawg, he admitted it was his fault, but he\u2019d be damned if Kelly was going to pay for it with Natches\u2019s surly attitude.</p> <p>He paced to the bar, pouring a quick drink and kicking it back as he grimaced at the sting. Natches was damned good at pushing buttons, and, Rowdy admitted, Kelly was a sore spot with him. Hell, he should have known years ago that this wasn\u2019t going to work, rather than running from the situation as he had. And he had run. The emotions that damned woman caused to rise inside him threatened his sanity at times.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt her.\u201d Natches cleared his throat uncomfortably. \u201cHell. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy lifted his gaze. He was so damned close to fighting Natches that he had to clench his fist to hold onto his control.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine, Natches,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI can understand why you\u2019re pissed but if you take it out on her again, you\u2019ll deal with me. You got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that.\u201d Natches snorted, though he didn\u2019t sound overly concerned at the prospect. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see if I can find a sign of that bastard while you cool off. Hell, son of a bitch needs to die for fucking shit up like this.\u201d</p><p>He stomped from the living room. Seconds later, the door slammed behind him. Rowdy stared back at Dawg then.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll chill out.\u201d Dawg slapped him on the shoulder as he headed from the room. \u201cYou take care of Kelly, and we\u2019ll watch your back. And when Natches\u2019s time comes, we might even watch his.\u201d</p><p>NINETEEN</p> <p>Kelly was furious. The anger that sizzled through her carried her through the afternoon and into that evening.</p><p>It was the fear making her angry and she knew it. It was making her crazy. And Rowdy, Dawg, and Natches weren\u2019t helping matters. They were making a target of themselves rather than her, daring a madman to strike out at them. Endangering all their lives, and it scared her to death. And that\u2019s where the anger stemmed. Toward the bastard who thought she should belong to him rather than the man she loved. A monster who wanted to terrorize her because she wasn\u2019t the good girl he had decided she should be.</p><p>She snorted at that thought. The fantasies she\u2019d had over the years where those three men were concerned were anything but good. But they were fantasies for her. She liked the fantasies, she liked pretending she was daring enough, cool enough, to control Rowdy and his cousins.</p><p>But the truth of the matter was that she was anything but cool, calm, or collected when it came to Rowdy. And as hot as the thought of having all three men focused on her was, as hot as it had been in the boat, something still held her back. Made her wary.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around with a gasp, wishing now that she had turned the lights on. Natches was shadowed from the hall light, a dark form leaning against the wide entrance into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt my feelings,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou pissed me off.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to piss you off either.\u201d</p><p>Natches flipped on the light. He grinned at her as she watched him warily.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember how Dawg and I rushed to the hospital after you were attacked?\u201d he asked, his voice soft, a bit sad.</p><p>And they had. Ray swore the doctors had almost had to call security to get them to leave the hall outside her room.</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>He brushed back the long hair from his devilishly handsome face. Natches was a charmer, with the face of a fallen angel and eyes that invited a woman to be bad.</p><p>\u201cWe knew you were ours even when you were a little girl,\u201d he said reflectively. \u201cNot in the sense we knew it after you grew up, but we claimed you. Watched out for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Rowdy, Natches,\u201d she whispered, halting what she feared was coming. \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to tell me you love me in the same way, because we both know better.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cWe\u2019re a set. You\u2019re destroying it, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her, his light green eyes wary and somber but she could feel the anger in him. She was changing the rules and he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to, Natches,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t be what you want, I can\u2019t do what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew that was part of it,\u201d he growled. \u201cEveryone knows that\u2019s part of it.\u201d</p><p>Kelly tipped her head to the side, watching him. Of the three cousins, Natches had always been the most alone. Dawg had his sister after his parent\u2019s death, as well as Rowdy\u2019s parents. Natches\u2019s parents were cold, almost inhumanly so. Scions of the county, with more money than they needed and less heart than anyone Kelly had ever met. How a brother of Ray\u2019s could have turned out like that, she couldn\u2019t figure.</p><p>And Natches had always suffered for it, until he was old enough to leave. Dawg and Rowdy were his family. They were all he really claimed. And though she couldn\u2019t see him as needy, she could see the regret that egged at him, the fierce determination not to lose that connection he had with the other two men.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat Rowdy does when he leaves me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s going to leave you?\u201d Mocking laughter filled his voice then. \u201cHell, Kelly, what do you think we were fighting over when you walked in? Rowdy gave us the \u2018hands off.\u2019 He\u2019s gone all white-knight possessive on us for some damned reason, and it has to be because you refused to do it.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cSon of a bitch dared us to touch you. You have his dick tied in so many knots he doesn\u2019t know what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Now, that just didn\u2019t sound like Rowdy. Rowdy wasn\u2019t a man who didn\u2019t know what he wanted. And he always meant what he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that was what you were arguing over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not the one who would have problems understanding the concept.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s deep, angry voice broke in on the conversation as he stepped into the smaller entrance next to the stairs.</p><p>He stared back at Natches, his eyes narrowed, his body corded and tense.</p><p>\u201cHell, back down, Rowdy,\u201d Natches sighed. \u201cI just wanted to apologize for hurting her feelings, not take you on.\u201d</p><p>Natches pushed his fingers wearily through his hair. She could feel the sense of resignation moving around him and the sadness of it pricked at her.</p><p>Kelly shivered as Rowdy moved next to her, his arm going around her waist, pulling her against the warmth of his body. As he did she caught the look that flashed across Natches\u2019s face. It was so quick that she wondered if she imagined it. Envy, regret.</p><p>\u201cI accept your apology, Natches,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, this isn\u2019t what I intended.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy tensed at her side.</p><p>Natches\u2019s grin was crooked, charming, but the sight of it made her chest ache. It was a ruse. Natches wasn\u2019t taking this well, and of the three men, she wondered if perhaps he was the one who needed the sharing the most.</p><p>\u201cTime for me to slip out and see if we can catch our evil neighborhood stalker now.\u201d He straightened from the doorway, flexing his shoulders as he turned toward the hallway. \u201cCatch ya\u2019ll later.\u201d</p><p>As he disappeared she felt Rowdy\u2019s hands slide through her hair.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He tilted her head back, staring down at her with a slight frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an emotional wreck, Rowdy.\u201d She grimaced at the concern in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re suddenly treating me with kid gloves and it\u2019s getting on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d His frown darkened as she moved away from him then turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cYou told Dawg and Natches to keep their hands off me?\u201d She leaned against the center island and crossed her arms beneath her breasts as she stared back at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later.\u201d</p><p>He turned away to the fridge, opening it to grab a beer as she stared back at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d He unscrewed the bottle top with a hard jerk of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that perhaps this doesn\u2019t concern me in some way? That maybe I don\u2019t have a say in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop this, Kelly,\u201d he warned her, his voice grating as his eyes flamed back at her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a conversation I\u2019m ready to get involved in where you\u2019re concerned, not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll drop it.\u201d She uncrossed her arms, straightened her shoulders, and lifted her chin defiantly. Drop it? Oh she could drop it all right. \u201cI\u2019ll drop it completely, Rowdy. And you can go to hell at the same time you find yourself someplace else to sleep. If I\u2019m not able to decide for myself whether or not I\u2019ll screw another man, then I\u2019ll be damned if I have the brains to decide if I want to screw you.\u201d</p><p>She stalked from the kitchen, fists clenched, her teeth grinding. God, when he had gotten so damned arrogant? So impossible to deal with? She didn\u2019t know when it had happened, but where she was concerned, it could stop now.</p><p>When had she become so damned stubborn?</p><p>Rowdy watched Kelly as she stalked from the kitchen, then listened to her stomp up the stairs muttering to herself before he moved.</p><p>Self-control, he had tried to warn himself. Things weren\u2019t exactly stable right now. Between the stalker, his argument with Natches, and his own revelations about himself, he knew his temper wasn\u2019t exactly calm. But this was just too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Moving quickly up the stairs behind her, he caught the bedroom door as she was attempting to close it, pushing his way in before he slammed it forcibly.</p><p>\u201cDid I ask you to follow me?\u201d she hissed, her gray eyes dark and gleaming with irritation as she faced him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to ask.\u201d</p> <p>Before she could blast him with whatever her lips were opening to say, he jerked her to him, lowered his head, and stole the sound with his kiss.</p><p>It was like sinking into ecstasy, fire, all the pleasure he could have ever imagined. He caught her little gasp with his lips, felt her hands grip his shoulders, her nails biting into the fabric of his shirt as he turned and lifted her, pressing her against the wall as he devoured the sweetness of her lips.</p><p>Her kiss. He loved her kiss. The feel of her lips softening beneath his, her body straining against him as his hands moved over it, pushing beneath the thin material of her shirt to cup her swollen breasts.</p><p>She was ready for him. He could feel it in the way her tongue met his, the hot little moans smothered by his lips. God, he had dreamed of this. Dreamed of touching her. Loving her.</p><p>Pulling his head back, he jerked her shirt over her head, staring down at her, fighting to breathe as he watched the heavy lift and fall of the firm mounds.</p> <p>He loved her breasts. His hands cupped them again, fitting over the fragile lace of her bra, his thumbs raking over the tender tips as he stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d He could hear the guttural tone of his voice, but he also saw the effect of it in her eyes.</p><p>They darkened in hunger as she drew in a hard breath, her tongue licking over her swollen lips.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he whispered then, desperately, hungrily. \u201cAll of you, baby. Sweet and hot, and crying for me.\u201d</p><p>He took her lips again before he made a fool of himself. Before he went to his knees and begged her to see, to understand the selfishness rising inside him. It sliced through him like the sharpest blade. The thought of another man touching what was his, taking the innocence, the sweetness of Kelly was more than he could bear.</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d She shuddered in his grip as he released her bra, drawing it from her shoulders before his hands went to the clasp of her jeans.</p> <p>\u201cThis is mine.\u201d He worked his hand between them to push her jeans roughly over her hips before cupping the hot, wet mound of her pussy.</p><p>His fingers delved beneath the silk of her panties, so desperate for the feel of her that taking time to completely undress her was more than he could consider.</p><p>His fingers moved through silken heat, parting the bare folds to sink into the sweet, tight depths of her slick core.</p><p>She arched into the touch, pressing against him, driving his finger further inside her as she cried into the kiss. The hot little sounds she made as he touched her had his cock throbbing in demand. He needed her. Needed to taste her, to touch her.</p><p>Now. He had to claim her.</p><p>The sharp knock at the door had his muscles clenching further in denial.</p><p>\u201cRowdy, we have movement out here.\u201d Dawg\u2019s quiet voice was dark with imminent violence. \u201cYou in on this, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kelly clutched at his shoulders as he moved back.</p> <p>Son of a bitch, if he caught the bastard stalking her he was going to rip him apart with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d He pulled her jeans quickly back in place.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go out there,\u201d she cried out, her face paling as her fingers gripped his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s too dark Rowdy, and you don\u2019t know where he could be hiding. Wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell he wasn\u2019t going out there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he snarled, sealing the claim with a hard kiss to her lips. \u201cAll mine, Kelly. And that bastard is going to figure that out at the end of my fist or my gun. I don\u2019t care which.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from her, jerking the door open and closing it before Dawg could see her, her sweet breasts rising over the lace of her bra, her pale face staring back at him with equal amounts of fear and anger.</p><p>The fear was going to be gone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go hunting.\u201d He took the rifle Dawg handed to him and headed downstairs.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>Kelly waited until nearly dawn for Rowdy, Dawg, and Natches to return to the house. Whatever or whoever had been out there had been determined not to be found. They had disappeared, leaving the three men with a growing, restless anger. And a determination to get her where they felt she would be protected.</p><p>Despite her objections, Rowdy packed her clothes and loaded her into Dawg\u2019s truck as the sun began to rise beyond the mountains.</p><p>She was terrified, she admitted. Whoever was stalking her knew how to hide, which only made him more dangerous. The thought of Rowdy, or one of his cousins, paying for the danger stalking her was eating a bleeding wound into her soul.</p><p>Finally, despite her objections and her demands that she simply leave town, the pickup pulled into the graveled road leading to Dawg\u2019s house.</p><p>Kelly knew the moment she saw the house why they had chosen Dawg\u2019s as a secure location. She had forgotten about the house, built by Dawg\u2019s parents, and set into the base of the mountain that ran through their property outside Somerset. He spent most of his time on his boat, so she hadn\u2019t considered the house.</p><p>The huge dwelling was set into the side of the mountain, with only the front left in view. Dawg\u2019s father had designed and overseen its building, Ray had once said, claiming that he was determined to have the most unique home in the county. And it was that.</p><p>It had been meant to be a vacation home, private, out of the way, and as unique as his parents had been. Though Rowdy had often wondered if Dawg\u2019s father hadn\u2019t been more than the architect he claimed to be. There were too many secrets in the Mackay family, he admitted, and one of these days, he was going to get to the bottom of them.</p><p>The face of the house was warm wood, covering steel and cement, with large windows looking out from the kitchen on the left, and the large living room on the right.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t opulent, or expensively furnished, but it was a huge dwelling with four bedrooms, accompanied by private baths. There was an exercise room and a basement pantry\u2013wine room larger than some apartments she had been in.</p><p>The house was built in three levels\u2014kitchen, living room, and exercise room on the ground level, bedrooms above on the top level, and the basement on a third level. She now understood why Dawg\u2019s father, Chandler Mackay, had been considered one of the finest architects in the nation.</p><p>It had been surprising when Dawg entered the Army then took over the lumberyard his father had owned. Everyone had expected him to step into his late father\u2019s shoes and become an architect instead.</p><p>Rowdy led her through the large open living room to the wide hallway that opened at the back of it. There, two sets of curved wooden steps led to the other levels. He moved aside as they reached the stairs that led to the upper level, allowing her to move ahead of him.</p><p>The steps were narrow, but comfortable, and led into another short hallway and two open doors.</p><p>\u201cThe left.\u201d He nudged her toward the open door, his voice brooking no argument as they moved into the room.</p><p>A huge king-sized bed took up the center of the room, draped with sheer curtains that hung from a steel ring in the center of the ceiling and tied at each corner of the bed.</p><p>A dark wood dresser and chest, writing desk, and vanity table sat along the walls. Scenic pictures set in frames that resembled windows on the far side of the bed. Behind it, another door opened into what was obviously a large bathroom.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she murmured as Rowdy moved in behind her and closed the door before setting her bags on the floor. He must have packed everything she had before they left his father\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cIt suits Dawg.\u201d He shrugged negligently. \u201cGo ahead and get settled in, take a nap if you need to. We\u2019ll go out to dinner later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer to stay here.\u201d She turned to him slowly, keeping her expression carefully bland.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest as he watched her, the dark gray T-shirt he wore stretching over his rippling muscles. \u201cDawg, Natches, and I decided we\u2019re going to eat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be alone.\u201d She pressed her lips firmly together. \u201cI told you that.\u201d</p><p>The argument had raged for hours. She couldn\u2019t believe his complete arrogance and stubbornness. He refused to leave her alone for even a second, and he wouldn\u2019t hear of her leaving town without him. At this point, he wouldn\u2019t even hear of her leaving town with him. She would have settled for that.</p><p>\u201cAnd I said, you can forget it,\u201d he repeated, not for the first time as he dropped his arms and moved closer. Kelly stepped back, ignoring his dark frown. \u201cKelly, baby, you don\u2019t have to worry like this, everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it will.\u201d She smiled tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re staying in a house that could likely defend against an attack from a foreign government and your cousins are packing in enough weapons to defend against an army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for looks only,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWe have a plan, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did the other night on the lake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, that was just to see how rock-dumb that bastard could get. He\u2019s dumb enough to need help breathing at this point. He won\u2019t be that hard to catch.\u201d</p><p>Confidence gleamed in his eyes, even as dread burned in her belly.</p><p>\u201cHe would have been caught by now if it were that easy.\u201d She pushed her fingers through her hair as she shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re underestimating him, Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re underestimating me,\u201d he grunted as his hands whipped out, pulling her into his embrace before she could avoid him.</p><p>Heat instantly sizzled across her body, nearly taking her breath as he pressed the hard length of his erection against her belly.</p><p>\u201cWant me to help you shower?\u201d He nuzzled his face against her neck, his tongue licking over her pulse erotically as his fingers clenched at her hips.</p><p>Kelly gripped his shoulders, certain the weakness in her knees was going to become a permanent thing if he didn\u2019t stop touching her so damned much. She needed to think; she didn\u2019t need her mind clogged by his kiss, his passion.</p><p>\u201cI can manage alone.\u201d Her voice was hoarse, despite the strength she attempted to inject into it.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He lifted his head, staring down at her knowingly before whispering, \u201cI bet you can, but can you manage this alone?\u201d</p><p>His lips caught hers before she could do more than gasp, covering them, taking them as his tongue licked at the curves, tempting her to play with him.</p><p>How she had always longed to play in just such a way with Rowdy. His lips tugged at hers as he stared down at her, his eyes heavy-lidded and darkening with sexual hunger. His tongue stroked over hers, retreated, then came back for more until she was moaning and reaching for him, desperate for the kiss he was teasing her with.</p><p>\u201cHungry for me, baby?\u201d His voice was dark velvet, rasping against her senses as she arched against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been hungry for you,\u201d she whispered, nipping back at his lips as his eyes narrowed, his expression becoming primitive, deepening with sexual energy as her hands smoothed from his shoulders to his chest and lower.</p><p>She needed him. She had never pretended otherwise. She needed everything he was, everything he wanted and needed to give her.</p><p>She gripped the material of his T-shirt, pulling it quickly from the band of his jeans as she allowed her nails to rake his flesh. The trembling response that raced over his body sent flashes of erotic heat tingling between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cTake the shirt off, Rowdy.\u201d She pushed the hem to his chest before lowering her head, her lips pressing to the hair-spattered skin beneath the flat, hard male nipple that drew her attention. \u201cI want you naked. I want you against me, inside me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The shirt was jerked from his body and tossed aside. His expression darkened, his face flushing with hunger as he stared back at her.</p><p>Kelly murmured her approval as she bent her head, licking around the tight, hard nipple that fascinated her. How she loved Rowdy\u2019s lips on her breasts, his teeth scraping her own hard peaks.</p><p>She raked over the tight point with a tentative little nip.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d He flinched, his hands gripping her hair, tightening in the strands before pressing her to him again. \u201cAgain, Kelly. God, baby, do it again.\u201d</p><p>She did that and more. She licked, sucked, rasped the point until she could feel a fine sheen of perspiration coating his chest and felt his breath heaving.</p><p>She moved her fingers lower, struggling with the metal buttons of his jeans, dragging them free and spreading the material apart. He wore no underwear. Rowdy wasn\u2019t an underwear-type man, and she knew it. Which suited her fine. It made it easier for the hard length of his cock to push free, rising nearly to his navel, thick and heavy, the head bloated and damp from the silky pre-come coating it.</p><p>\u201cSuck it.\u201d His voice was a hard rasp as she licked a path down his chest to the hardened flesh below.</p><p>\u201cPatience is a virtue.\u201d She could barely speak for the lust rising inside her.</p><p>\u201cFuck patience,\u201d he groaned, his hands tugging sensually at her hair. \u201cGod, baby, do you know how often I dream of watching you wrap your pretty mouth around my dick?\u201d</p><p>A punch of excitement convulsed her womb and sent a spasm of response trembling through her pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou should have savored it last time,\u201d she panted. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to now.\u201d</p><p>But she did. She grasped the heavy weight of his erection as she used her other hand to push at the band of his jeans. A growl of impatience tore from his throat as he moved, toeing off his shoes before quickly disposing of his jeans.</p><p>Each second it took him to undress, her palm stroked his cock, up and down, tightening at the base before loosening and running up the silky shaft once more. Until his hands were in her hair again, clenching in the strands, sending darts of heat to rake across her scalp as lust slammed through her bloodstream. Prickles of sensation, of need, raced across her flesh as emotion erupted through her chest.</p><p>Rowdy. She had dreamed of him, lusted for him, waited for him. Now, everything she had ever prayed for was being threatened because of one careless act on her part. Because she had waited. Because she had wanted Rowdy to seduce her rather than take her. Had she belonged to Rowdy before he left last year, then the attacker would have never targeted her. And she could have belonged to him. He would have tried to fight it, but he had wanted her as badly as he did now. He had hungered as much as she had.</p><p>She lowered her head the last inches as she bent to him, taking the mushroomed head between her lips as her tongue stroked over the throbbing crest.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d he growled, his hands tugging at her hair, pulling it just enough to light a sudden blinding flame of need inside her.</p><p>She liked the pain. Not true pain, the spark of intensity, the erotic burn that emphasized the pleasure. She liked it, and she wanted more.</p><p>Kelly wrapped her fingers around the shaft of his cock, pumping it with slow, measured strokes as she began to suckle the head with a growing hunger she could no longer control. She wanted to take all of him. Wanted to feel his cock pulse in her mouth, feel his semen spilling onto her tongue.</p><p>\u201cHere, sweetheart, let me help you take those clothes off.\u201d His fingers were pulling at her shirt, tugging at her hands and her head until she released his flesh to have the shirt stripped from her body.</p><p>\u201cCome here, darlin\u2019, turn right around for me.\u201d Rowdy turned her as his hands stripped her jeans over her thighs before tugging them free of her legs as he slipped her shoes from her feet.</p><p>His lips touched her thigh as he undressed her, her knee, his tongue licked, his teeth rasped.</p><p>It was taking too long and it was taking forever and she was certain she was going to scream from sheer excitement as she felt him push her over the bed, his hard, callused hands parting her buttocks just before hungry lips began to caress the hidden flesh.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. Feeling him move, she knew he was reaching for the tube of lubricating gel on the bedside table. Knew what was coming.</p><p>Cool lubricated fingers eased into the narrow crevice seconds later, massaged the rippling entrance to her ass as she cried out her pleasure. \u201cThere, baby,\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice whispered across her senses. \u201cIt\u2019s just for me. Just feel good, sweetheart. Just for me.\u201d</p><p>One hand held her in place as the other slowly, methodically prepared her rear.</p><p>\u201cI want you there, Kelly,\u201d Rowdy groaned as she felt his finger slide fully inside her before retreating. \u201cI need you there. I want to part those pretty cheeks and watch your sweet ass suck my cock in.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop the ragged cry that left her throat, or the overwhelming hunger for him. Rowdy was making her crazy. His fingers were pumping inside her anus now, two stretching her, making her burn in ways she had never imagined.</p><p>She could feel the juices weeping from her pussy, thick, silky, soaking the bare curves as he teased her clit with a finger, making her hips jerk and sending talons of need ripping at her womb.</p><p>She needed...oh God, she needed his fingers pumping inside her pussy, filling her there as the rocketing sensations overwhelmed her body.</p><p>She could feel her rear entrance being stretched further, slickened, heavily lubricated as Rowdy kept up the pressure on her clit, kept her begging for more.</p><p>Her hips were churning, driving his fingers deeper inside her. He was breathing hard, almost as hard as she was.</p><p>\u201cMore, baby.\u201d Another finger joined the first two, working inside her, stretching her until she was burning alive for more, ready, willing to plead for more if only she could find the strength to speak.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d She shuddered, her back arching at the fullness stretching her.</p><p>\u201cThree fingers, Kelly,\u201d Rowdy growled as his arm latched around her waist, holding her upright. \u201cThree fingers buried in that tight little ass. When I pull them out, you\u2019ll be ready for me.\u201d He pressed on her shoulders until she was lying over the bed. Rowdy moved her, arranged her as he pleased, propping her knees on the mattress as he pressed her shoulders down.</p><p>All the while he worked his fingers inside her, pulling nearly free, spreading more of the cool gel over them before working them inside her once again.</p><p>\u201cFuck. So fucking pretty\u201d\u2014she felt his hand smooth over her buttock as he pulled his fingers free of her grip\u2014\u201cso pretty, and so damned sweet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowdy...\u201d Her fingers clenched in the blanket as she felt the bloated crest of his cock tuck against the entrance.</p><p>\u201cLet it hurt, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust a little bit. Let yourself feel how the pleasure and the pain mix, how it can make you fly like nothing else does.\u201d</p><p>He pressed closer.</p><p>Kelly held her breath, feeling the nerve-laden tissue begin to part, to suck him in, rippling around him as it began to burn.</p><p>She was fighting to breathe through the pleasure. Through the burn. Through sensations that tore through her mind and left her dazed with the explosions of heat burning through her body.</p><p>\u201cDamn. You\u2019re tight, sweetheart.\u201d He pulled back, pressed forward again, working the thick crest into her further with each stroke.</p><p>Below, his fingers circled her throbbing clit, stroked down the parted slit, and massaged the entrance to her vagina. She pressed back, desperate to feel them inside her.</p><p>\u201cRowdy!\u201d She screamed his name as she felt the head of his cock pop inside her. A hard, blinding stretch of tissue that had her arching, had her nerve endings flaming as a finger speared inside the depths of her pussy.</p><p>Rowdy slid inside her to the hilt then. His hands were tight on her hips, holding her steady as the hard rasp of his breath echoed in her ears. Part growl, part groan, his pleasure was vocal, physical, wrapping around her as it blended with her own. This was what she wanted. Needed. Just this. Just with Rowdy. He moved then, slowly, dragging his cock nearly free before pressing forward again. The movement sent violent waves of pleasure tearing through her as she begged Rowdy for ease.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes, baby. You\u2019re so sweet. So tight. So hot,\u201d he rasped, his voice dark and rough as he began to thrust inside her slow and easy.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She reached back for him. \u201cPlease...\u201d She needed him deep inside her. Needed his erection tunneling into her harder as his fingers teased her pussy. \u201cNow...\u201d</p><p>He gave her what she was begging for. Slowly. Teasingly.</p><p>His fingers caressed the swollen folds of her pussy a second before his hand retreated, only to return. Her eyes flew open, a startled cry leaving her lips as she felt the buzzing vibration of the vibrator he pressed against her vaginal opening. The thick tip entered her pussy, burning her further. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re so fucking tight.\u201d She could feel the perspiration that covered her skin, that dripped from his.</p><p>Kelly shook her head. \u201cTake me. Please...\u201d</p><p>She heard him, felt Rowdy press the vibrator upward, working inside her slowly. Her anal muscles flexed around the invading cock as her pussy convulsed around the vibrator filling her. The tapered head of the toy pressed forward, making room for the following shaft.</p><p>It was unlike anything she could have imagined. As Rowdy filled her ass with his cock, he filled her pussy, filled her until she was certain she could take no more, only to learn she could take more. Much more.</p><p>By the time the toy had seated fully inside her, her screams of pleasure had turned to raspy, incoherent pleas. Sweat coated her body as her juices coated her thighs. She was slick all over, wet and pierced and dying for more.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that, baby?\u201d Rowdy leaned over her, his chest pressing against her lightly as he fucked into her slow and easy. \u201cCan you take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d She was crying, so desperate to come she was shaking from the need. \u201cFuck me. Please. Please...\u201d</p><p>He moved. His cock and the vibrator began to power inside her in tandem. The friction, the overwhelming intensity of pleasure consumed her. At first slow, tentative, then faster, harder, he began to thrust inside her with strong, powerful strokes.</p><p>Kelly writhed between Rowdy and the toy, the sensations of the dual penetration, of the pleasure flowing between them, just them, no one else, sent ecstasy screaming through her system.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t survive this pleasure. It was burning, intensifying, stealing her mind, her body. She felt each stroke tightening her womb, pushing her closer, deeper into the maelstrom overtaking her.</p><p>She was going to explode. She could feel it, flew closer to it, feeling the rapture build, the pleasure, so deep, so intense, so overwhelming...</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s name was on her lips. A scream of fear, of ecstasy as she felt the orgasm rip through her. It tightened her body, her vagina, tore through her and flung her into a pleasure she couldn\u2019t fight, couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>She felt Rowdy stiffen, felt the heat of his release, the hard shudders that suffused his body, and a blinding fiery blaze of emotion that had her screaming his name.</p><p>As the hard, wracking shudders eased from her body she collapsed against him, wasted, exhausted, certain she couldn\u2019t open her eyes if her very life depended on it.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Rowdy walked from the bathroom half an hour later, dressed in fresh jeans and a shirt before moving to the bed and the shoes he had left forgotten beside it. Kelly still slept. A hard, hopefully dreamless sleep. Sprawled on her stomach, one arm tucked beneath the pillow, her cheek rested on, breathing deep. She looked innocent, sweet, and untouched.</p><p>It was hard to believe she had been a wildcat less than an hour before. The sweet little kitten sleeping so calmly bore no resemblance to her, he thought with a smile. Rowdy shook his head, the smile creasing his face further at the memory. He had always known she would be a firecracker in bed, ready and willing for any adventure he could give her. She was earthy, lusty, and she liked that sharp little edge of pain he enjoyed giving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached out, smoothing back a thick swathe of hair from her cheek as emotion overwhelmed him, tightened his chest, and reminded him of what he could have lost. If he had given in to the demand that he take her the year before, the attack might have never happened. Hell no, it wouldn\u2019t have happened, because he would have demanded reassignment. He couldn\u2019t have left her. He had known that then. Once he had her, there was no way he could have walked away.</p><p>He was crazy about her. So crazy in love with her that it terrified him clear to the soles of his feet. She was young as hell, and still so innocent it broke his heart.</p><p>Leaning forward, he pressed a butterfly kiss against her forehead before tucking the sheet closer over her shoulders. Minutes later he was striding into the living room where Natches and Dawg waited on him. Natches had his head back on the couch, eyes closed. Dawg just looked grouchy as he stared back from the chair he sat in.</p> <p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Dawg grunted as Rowdy dropped into a chair across from him. \u201cGuard duty sucks.\u201d</p><p>There was a gleam of envy in Dawg\u2019s eyes, despite the amusement in his tone.</p><p>\u201cDid guard duty pay off though?\u201d Rowdy lifted a brow, staring back at his cousin questioningly.</p><p>Dawg grinned in satisfaction. \u201cGuard duty paid. I slipped out the doggie hole and found a nice little perch topside. We had some definite movement.\u201d</p><p>Natches\u2019s eyes opened as he straightened in his seat, his expression going as darkly dangerous as Rowdy felt. Evidently this wasn\u2019t information Natches had been given, which surprised Rowdy.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of movement?\u201d Rowdy asked, paying attention to the dangerous, predatory light that gleamed in Natches\u2019s expression as Dawg continued.</p><p>\u201cLittle fellow, barely taller than Kelly. Dressed in hunting gear with a hooded mask. He was being real careful. Watching the house from heavy cover. I couldn\u2019t get a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize anything?\u201d They were getting close. The stalker was losing his grip on reality if he had followed them so quickly.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s stalker was obviously beginning to crack, and that was what they needed. Just a small fracture in his self-control and they would have him.</p><p>Dawg shook his head. \u201cI watched him as best I could. Maybe something will trigger if I see him around anywhere.\u201d A grimace twisted his expression. \u201cCatching him might not be easy, but I have a feeling he\u2019ll make another move soon.\u201d</p><p>Of course he would, he considered Kelly his. The fact that the Nauti Boys had her, were possibly sharing her, would be too much for his tenuous hold on reality to survive.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take guard duty from here on out,\u201d Natches spoke up then, his voice bland, unassuming. Dangerous. A good ole boy attitude covering a steel core of determination.</p><p>Rowdy stared back at him curiously. Natches had changed in ways that were hard to put a finger on. He had returned from the Marines only months before Rowdy had, quieter and a hell of a lot harder than he had been when he went in. That hardness was more than maturity and confidence, more than a soldier who had seen battle in the sands of another nation. Despite his vow that he had never grown up, somehow, Rowdy knew better.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Rowdy nodded slowly. \u201cYou take watch. We\u2019ll head into town in the morning, take Kelly shopping, do some stocking up. We\u2019ll let the bastard see what he\u2019s missing. If he\u2019s the nutcase I suspect, he\u2019ll hit by tomorrow night.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to give him an opening?\u201d Natches\u2019s voice softened.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make it look too easy. He has to work for it.\u201d Rowdy sat back in the chair, considering their options. \u201cDawg, weaken the security monitor on the kitchen window, and in the shrubbery beneath it. Make it look natural, something he can get through. He\u2019s broken the women\u2019s security systems so he\u2019s not a stranger to it. Let\u2019s see what the bastard\u2019s made of.\u201d</p><p>Dawg nodded sharply as Natches continued to watch them with a hard, merciless stare that assured Rowdy that he wasn\u2019t the only one waiting to shed blood.</p><p>Rowdy turned his gaze back to Natches, realizing in that second that he had seen the look in his friend\u2019s eyes before. He had seen it in another man\u2019s eyes, a Marine assassin. He had worked alone, disappearing for weeks at a time and returning with that same dead, cold chill in his eyes.</p><p>Hell. He blew out a silent breath as Natches met his eyes, his expression never changing. What the hell had Natches gotten into while he was in the service?</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead and set up,\u201d Rowdy told him quietly. \u201cLet me know before morning how you want to play it.\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s head had lowered, proof that he was aware of a truth that Rowdy hadn\u2019t been privy to. A truth he still wasn\u2019t certain of the details to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go public with you when you need me to,\u201d Natches said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll use the bolt-hole otherwise.\u201d</p><p>The bolt-hole, or dog door as Dawg had amusingly named it, was the single, secret entrance into the house from a shrub-hidden door several hundred feet around the base of the hill. Dawg wasn\u2019t the trusting sort, and his time in the Marines hadn\u2019t helped his trust issues any.</p><p>\u201cBoys, we need to talk when this is all over and done,\u201d Rowdy sighed, watching the weary resignation in his cousins\u2019 eyes. \u201cKeeping secrets among ourselves isn\u2019t a good thing, ya know?\u201d</p><p>Dawg grunted, a sound of wry amusement that was typical Dawg. Natches\u2019s lips quirked into a smile.</p><p>\u201cA good drunk maybe,\u201d Dawg growled as he rose from his chair and paced across the room toward the kitchen. \u201cUntil then, boys, I need food. You want me to take mess duty?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s eyes met Natches\u2019s in shock, as his cousin\u2019s widened in horror.</p><p>\u201cHell no!\u201d They both came out of their seats, rushing for the kitchen as they heard pans rattling beneath the stove cabinet and remembered Dawg\u2019s past attempts at manning a stove. The memory wasn\u2019t a pleasant one.</p><p>He had checked on his girls. His special good girls. Kelly was weak\u2014she was allowing herself to be degraded, to be taken. Oh, how he had hoped she had been the only one. He had prayed, prayed so long and hard that his good girls were waiting on him.</p><p>He curled into the corner of the small dark apartment, rocking himself gently as he stared at the first of his lovers. He had thought she was so pure, so sweet. With her long, silken blond hair, and her innocent blue eyes. She had a soft voice, one that stroked the senses and made him think of his mother before she became a whore. Before she had turned his father away, before his father had stolen him away for his mother\u2019s sins. They had to punish her. She hadn\u2019t been a good girl.</p><p>He sniffed, realizing he was crying. He hated crying. Crying never helped, tears made a man weak, he remembered that from his father\u2019s lessons. A man had to do what he had to do. His father had been weak. The old man had cried, he had raged but he had left the depraved creature he had married rather than punishing her.</p><p>He should have punished her. If his father had punished his mother, then she wouldn\u2019t have been so bad. She would have been the good wife and mother she should have been. If she had been a good woman, then she wouldn\u2019t have lost her son.</p><p>He flinched at that memory, shaking his head to force it back from his mind as he reached out to touch thick strands of hair that flowed out from his good girl\u2019s head.</p><p>He touched the silken strands, rubbing them between his fingers, remembering how soft and sweet she had been. Before she had let herself grow weak. Before she had let another man convince her to be bad.</p><p>He stared at the man, a tight smile crossing his lips at the sight of the nude man, laying half on the bed, half on the floor. He wasn\u2019t dead, but he would soon wish he was.</p><p>The girl. He sighed wearily as he let himself stare at the blood staining the carpet. She stared back at him sightlessly, her china blue eyes reflecting the horror of her punishment.</p><p>Kelly must have somehow convinced this one that she could be bad, too. How, he wasn\u2019t certain. He could have sworn his girls didn\u2019t know about each other. He had taken pains to be very careful. But Kelly was so bad, so depraved, that she would have found a way to convince the others that they too could escape him.</p><p>They belonged to him. They were his good girls. He wouldn\u2019t allow another to touch them, not like his mother had.</p><p>He pulled himself to his feet, careful to pick up the knife and clean it of the blood that stained it. Her blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be my good girl now,\u201d he whispered as he stepped around the blood and moved for the spare bedroom.</p><p>He had hidden there for hours, waiting for her to come home. Waiting to assure himself that she was a good girl. Only to listen in pain and fury as another man touched her.</p><p>He fought back his tears again as he entered the dark room and headed for the window he had used to slip inside the apartment. He had bypassed her security. How easy it had been. She had thought she was safe from him. That she could disobey him as his mother had disobeyed his father. She had found out wrong. Just as Kelly would have to learn as well.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>The next morning, Kelly would have preferred to enjoy the awakening caresses Rowdy was bestowing as she swam toward reality rather than the warm, sensual dreams twining around her. Unfortunately, the moment was interrupted by Dawg\u2019s growling message that her mother and Ray were on their way, and they had better get their asses ready before the arrival. His words, not hers.</p><p>She had enough time to shower and dress, never realizing the kind of devastating news her parents would bring.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Dana Carrington.\u201d Ray\u2019s voice was low, angry. \u201cShe was murdered, and her boyfriend was molested.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sat in shock, listening as Ray recounted the murder that had taken place the night before. She sat at the kitchen table, her hands wrapped around her coffee cup as Rowdy stood behind her, his hands resting on her shoulders as she felt fear tremble through her.</p><p>\u201cKelly.\u201d Her mother leaned forward in her chair, staring back at her worriedly. \u201cI called your aunt Beth in Montana, she wants you to come stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice was hard.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s gaze flickered to Ray. He glanced at Rowdy in concern, but said nothing more.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not safe here, Rowdy\u2014\u201d her mother protested.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be any safer there,\u201d he argued as Kelly tightened her fingers on the coffee cup. \u201cAt least here, Dawg and Natches and I have a chance of catching this bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy letting him think she\u2019s screwing all three of you?\u201d Maria came out of her chair then, her cry filled with fear as she faced Rowdy. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Douglas, what if using her doesn\u2019t work? What if he gets to her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Rowdy growled warningly.</p><p>\u201cKelly, listen to me, whoever this is has killed now. He won\u2019t stop...\u201d Her mother stared back at her, her eyes damp with tears, her lips trembling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Maria,\u201d Rowdy protested.</p><p>\u201cLet her have her say, Rowdy.\u201d Ray shook his head regretfully. \u201cShe\u2019s her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you stop it!\u201d Kelly\u2019s palm cracked on the kitchen table, sending an enveloping silence to fill the kitchen as all eyes turned to her. Ray and her mother, Dawg and Natches, Rowdy, she could feel their gazes boring into her as she lifted her head and stared back at her mother.</p><p>Kelly drew in a deep, hard breath. Fear was like a snake coiling in her belly, striking at her chest in an effort to be free.</p><p>\u201cRowdy\u2019s right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop killing now. If I stay here, there\u2019s a chance he can be caught\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Kelly, listen to yourself,\u201d Maria protested desperately. \u201cThat girl last night is dead. He raped her boyfriend while he was unconscious. He\u2019s not sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t run.\u201d She shuddered at the thought of being terrified of the dark for the rest of her life, of being terrified of what could happen. But even more, she knew there were a lot of things Rowdy would allow, but he would never let her go. \u201cWe have to face it. Now. Here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, for a minute she wished Rowdy were less intense, less determined. She wished she didn\u2019t know him as well as she did.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Aunt Maria,\u201d Dawg grunted as she continued to glare at Rowdy. \u201cYou know lookin\u2019 at him like that don\u2019t work. He\u2019s just going to get in a bad mood and pout on us all night long if you do.\u201d</p><p>Maria flashed her nephew by marriage a dark look. Dawg grinned back, flashing strong white teeth through his gaze remained hard.</p> <p>\u201cYou boys are going to get her killed,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game you\u2019re playing here.

Now stand the hell down and we can talk about this reasonably, or by God we won\u2019t talk about it at all.\u201d</p><p>Ray breathed out wearily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Maria. You know he\u2019s right. She can\u2019t run all her life,\u201d he said, the regret heavy in his voice as Maria gasped in surprise.</p><p>\u201cRay, you don\u2019t mean that. She would be safe\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll never be safe as long as that bastard is on the loose, Maria.\u201d He grimaced, shaking his head. \u201cWe both know it. She has to make her stand here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ve heard enough!\u201d Kelly scraped her chair across the floor, coming to her feet and pushing her fingers through her hair with an edge of frustration.</p><p>\u201cKelly...I\u2019m scared for you,\u201d Maria whispered. \u201cIf Rowdy is so determined to stay with you, then the two of you can go away for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something I can run away from.\u201d Kelly swallowed tightly as she stared back at her mother.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he won\u2019t let you run away,\u201d Maria accused. \u201cDon\u2019t let him risk your life like this, Kelly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m letting him save it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBecause without him, I\u2019m dead. It won\u2019t matter where I go, or how long I stay, he\u2019ll find me. Just as he found the other girl. He won\u2019t let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would have,\u201d Maria bit out. \u201cHe left that girl alone until she found someone, and he would have left you alone if Rowdy hadn\u2019t drawn you into...this...\u201d Her arm swung out to encompass Rowdy, Dawg, and Natches.</p><p>Heat flamed in her cheeks as she breathed in roughly, staring back at her mother, hating what her mother suspected, hating that the danger she was in now was tearing at them all. No explanation would make a difference; her mother would no more believe that she wasn\u2019t sleeping with all three men than the stalker would.</p><p>\u201cThis is my business,\u201d she said softly. \u201cRemember that, Mom. And don\u2019t forget it. My relationship with Rowdy is my business, and it will stay that way. Period. I love you, but I can\u2019t deal with fighting with you right now. I want you to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, go home.\u201d She strengthened her voice, fought back her tears, and stared back at her mother firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll call. I promise. But this isn\u2019t going to help anything, and it\u2019s sure as hell not going to make this easier. For my sake, just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly...\u201d Rowdy\u2019s protest as she moved quickly from the room was ignored, as was Ray\u2019s curse and her mother\u2019s cry.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t handle the combined pressure, or her mother\u2019s fears. Her own were choking her, strangling her with tightening bands of remembered horror as she escaped the tension building in the kitchen.</p> <p>She had tried to tell herself that the man who attacked her would go away. That it would stop. That it couldn\u2019t be worse than what she had already endured. But now the nightmare was growing worse. Her stalker had become a murderer.</p><p>She rushed into the bedroom, carefully closing the door behind her as she capped her hand over her mouth in an effort to hold back her screams of horror. She wasn\u2019t the only one at risk now. She had known when the shots were fired into the boat that the stalker was going to try to hurt Rowdy. It hadn\u2019t sunk in though, not all the way to the bone, until Ray and her mother dropped their bombshell.</p><p>\u201cKelly, open the door.\u201d Rowdy wiggled the doorknob as he spoke on the other side of the panel. His voice was soft, gentle, nearly breaking her resolve to hold back her tears.</p><p>Pressing her lips together she turned the lock before moving away, unaware she had locked it in the first place. She moved to the center of the room, wiping her fingers over her cheeks in an attempt to dry the tears from her face.</p><p>The door opened then closed as silence engulfed the room for long seconds.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to hurt you,\u201d she finally whispered, keeping her back to him as she wrapped her arms over her breasts. \u201cWhat will I do if he hurts you, Rowdy?\u201d</p><p>She heard the male snort behind her, mocking, filled with stubborn pride. She turned to him slowly, wishing, praying, that none of this had happened. That she could have had her dream of holding Rowdy without the danger that surrounded them.</p><p>He was staring back at her tenderly, but there was no missing the spark of rage behind the tenderness, or the pure confidence that poured from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if you run, Kelly?\u201d he asked her, moving toward her, a slow, predatory movement that had her heart racing in anticipation even as fear overwhelmed her. \u201cCan you stay one step ahead of him? Can you live your life knowing he can strike at any minute? Knowing that eventually he\u2019ll get tired of just watching you, and find a reason to kill you instead? Just as he found a reason to kill that girl last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d Her breath caught as his hands cupped her shoulders, his thumbs smoothing over the flesh the straps of her shirt left bare. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Rowdy,\u201d her voice lowered. \u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s natural,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you know I\u2019m scared too, Kelly?\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cScared you won\u2019t trust us to protect you. Scared you\u2019ll leave, that he\u2019ll hurt you in ways you won\u2019t be able to come back from. That I\u2019ll lose you forever. That\u2019s what scares me, Kelly. Hell, it terrifies me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d She shook her head, shaking at the throb of emotion in his voice, the pain that threaded through it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather die than see that, Kelly,\u201d he whispered painfully, his eyes tormented, dark with emotion. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand, sweetheart? I love you until I can\u2019t breathe without feeling it move through me, feeling your presence around me. You\u2019re my heart. My soul. I won\u2019t let that bastard take that from me. If it means I have to lock you up for your own protection and listen to you rage for a lifetime, I\u2019d do it. Anything, Kelly, to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>The tears were streaming down her face now, shudders whipping through her body at the sound of his voice. Her big, tough Rowdy, his tone soft, thick with emotion, his eyes brilliant with it.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Rowdy.\u201d Her hands moved from his chest, no longer pressing to hold him back, but moving to his shoulders as he drew her to his chest, holding her close, secure against him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Kelly.\u201d She felt his head lower, felt his lips move over her forehead. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine, babe. I\u2019m not stupid, or careless. And Dawg and Natches sure as hell aren\u2019t. We\u2019re going get through this. All of us, baby.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head for his kiss, needing it, desperate to fill the dark places moving through her soul with the fire of his hunger, his need. She could feel his cock straining beneath his jeans, pressing against her stomach as she drew his head down to her.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Rowdy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cKiss me like I dream\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips stole her words as a hungry groan filled the air. His groan, her whimpering cry of need as she felt the heat and lust moving from him, into her.</p><p>Her lips opened as her arms curled around his neck, pulling him closer to her as he tilted her head back, sipping from her lips, licking at them, nipping until they opened as she was crying out for more. Needing more. His tongue was a stroke of fire, his hands were everywhere. Hunger heated the air, filled her body and whipped around her like forked fingers of lightning tingling over her body.</p><p>In those moments there was no stalker, no danger, no death or pain. There was only passion. There was only Rowdy.</p><p>Amazement flared through Rowdy, not for the first time, at the pleasure he received from just kissing Kelly. Holding her head between his hands, feeling her silky hair fall over his hands, feeling her lips like hot satin beneath his.</p><p>And her taste. She intoxicated him. Nothing but Dawg\u2019s white lightning had ever had the power to affect him so quickly, until Kelly\u2019s kiss. Her touch. Her passion.</p><p>He groaned against her lips as he let his tongue dip past them, feeling hers waiting, tangling against him like damp silk and sending his senses spinning.</p><p>A man shouldn\u2019t be so weak in the face of a kiss, he thought with a sliver of amusement. But damn if she didn\u2019t sap his will to resist her, to keep from taking her again and again.</p><p>And he was going to have her again. Now. He was going to lay her back on that big bed and sink inside her until she screamed his name.</p><p>He backed her toward the bed, keeping his lips on hers as his hands moved from her head to wrap around her back before gripping the hem of her shirt and pushing beneath it. She had the softest skin he had ever touched. Everything about Kelly was different, better, hotter, and sweeter, and with each touch he only wanted more.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of these damned clothes,\u201d he muttered as he tore his lips from hers, his eyes lifting to stare down at her.</p><p>Her lips were swollen, cheeks flushed with arousal, and her pretty gray eyes were dark, stormy with hunger. Damn, he liked her hungry. She was like a little tigress, scratching and mewling and uncaring of anything but the pleasure she was attaining. The pleasure he was giving her.</p><p>Getting undressed was a matter of a few ripped seams, some buttons popping, and strangled curses as they both struggled with stubborn jeans. But within seconds he was tumbling her back to the bed, his lips zeroing in on her hard, peaked nipples as the taste of her filled his mouth.</p><p>God, she was sweet. Arching to him, hoarse cries leaving her lips as he suckled at the tight little points. Her head was thrown back, her hands gripping his head, holding him to her as he went from one swollen mound to the other.</p><p>All the while her hot little body twisted and writhed beneath him as her thigh caressed the tight length of his cock. He could feel his balls tightening with the need to fuck and to do it now. It was always like this with Kelly. He couldn\u2019t wait to get inside her, to feel her silken heat clasping him, rippling around him as he thrust into the liquid fire of her tight little pussy.</p><p>And that heat was so close. He could feel it whispering over the head of his erection, drawing him to her. He wasn\u2019t going to be able to wait long, he knew. Long enough maybe, maybe, to ease down her straining body. He did just that, laying quick little kisses down her abdomen, licking at her skin, tasting her with every cell of his body. Just long enough to spread her thighs and settle between them before dipping his head for one quick little taste of her sweet, juicy cunt.</p><p>His taste buds exploded as he slid his tongue through the syrupy slit before circling the tight, swollen bud of her clit. Sweet, tart, silken ambrosia that entangled his senses and kept him coming back for more.</p><p>Her cries echoed around him as he enjoyed the taste and feel of the slick folds of her flesh. Silken and bare, her pussy flowered open for him. Peaches and cream and soft syrup, and he was a man with a taste for this particular fruit. Especially when those gorgeous legs lifted and her feet propped on his shoulders to allow him maximum access.</p><p>He could happily drown in her. He licked at the sweet cream, tasted the hunger and passion that rained from her. His fingers caressed the tender opening to her vagina, teased and tempted her before working inside her. His senses exploded with the heat that surrounded them, with the moist, rich juices that flowed from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ached for her. His cock throbbed like a demon\u2019s kiss, but the thought of leaving the succulent flesh beneath his lips was more than he could consider. Not while she burned like this for him. Not while her cries filled the room and her lithe legs spread wide for him.</p><p>He licked around her straining clit, grimacing as her pussy tightened further around his fingers. His dick was screaming in pain, begging to push inside her. He pulled his fingers back, pushed inside again and flicked the little nubbin with his tongue as she screamed for more, begged to come.</p><p>Not yet. God, the taste of her, the feel of her. He wanted to feel her coming around his cock, not his fingers. He wanted to feel the tight muscles rippling around his erection, sucking the semen from the depths of his balls, and sending his head racing with ecstasy.</p><p>He pulled his fingers from her, groaning at the effort it cost to pull back from her, to lift his head from her tender pussy and force himself to rise over her.</p><p>He pushed her legs back as he moved, opening her further for him as he pressed the head of his cock against the moist, flexing entrance to her pussy.</p><p>She stared up at him, her expression dazed, her eyes the color of storm clouds as her hands lifted to his chest. Her palms pressed against the hair-roughened muscles, her nails biting into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease, Rowdy, now.\u201d</p><p>He pressed in the barest fraction, his breath catching at the heat that surrounded the tip of his cock. Looking down, he watched as the smooth, naked lips of her sex parted, glistening with her juices and hugging his cock as he began to work inside her.</p><p>Flames traveled from the sensitive crest to his tortured balls as he fought to breathe. Release was an agonizing need that sent fingers of electrified pleasure racing up his spine. He couldn\u2019t come yet. Not yet. He thought of baseball, fishing, auto mechanics, and cleaning his gun, but each subject fizzled within his mind as he sank further and further into her heat.</p><p>Shaking his head, he plunged in the last inches, growling at the tightness, the suckling heat. He was a man on the verge of madness, control gone, only the wild need to fuck and mate spurring him now.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop with one thrust. Pulling back, he began fucking inside her deep and hard, snarling at the pleasure that built with each stroke, at the extreme sensations overtaking his body. His thighs bunched, his balls nearly drawing into his body before he finally felt Kelly explode.</p><p>\u201cFuck. There, baby. So sweet and hot. Come for me, Kelly. Come for me so hard...\u201d</p><p>Her pussy tightened around his cock nearly to the point of pain as it began convulsing around him. Liquid heat engulfed him, burned him, then sent him careening into a mad, furious drive toward his own pleasure.</p><p>\u201cGod yes! Sweet baby\u201d\u2014the words ripped from his chest, from his soul\u2014\u201cGod help me, I love you.\u201d</p><p>The release exploded through his body, drawing him tight as an animalistic snarl left his lips. He buried his cock to the furthest depths of her before he felt the harsh, blinding explosions tearing through his scrotum. Pleasure was ecstasy, destructive and consuming as he felt his semen spewing inside the hot depths of the sweet cunt wrapped around him. It held him on edge, milking spurt after spurt of rich seed from his body before the last shudder tore through him and left him wasted.</p><p>Rowdy collapsed at Kelly\u2019s side, barely retaining enough sanity to keep from falling atop her. He was gasping for air, rippling echoes of pleasure still racing up his spine as he used the last of his strength to drag her into his arms and cushion her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cOkay...that was wild enough,\u201d she panted weakly against him. \u201cYou could have warned me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould have had to suspect first,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cGo to sleep or something. Let me rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy.\u201d But her voice was weak, drowsy. \u201cWe were going to shop. I heard Mom and Ray leave after we came up here. We could go shopping before they come back for the next round of arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNap.\u201d He groaned. \u201cJust nap. God, you just killed me. I gotta sleep.\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh against his chest was the last thing he heard as he sighed deeply and let himself drift off. Dawg and Natches could watch her for half an hour; she had wiped him out.</p><p>Kelly rose from the bed, a frown furrowing her brow as she found a loose T-shirt and shorts before heading to the bathroom. She was hungry\u2014breakfast had been set aside because of Ray and her mother\u2019s visit, and she was feeling it now.</p> <p>She forced herself not to think about the reason for that visit. If she thought about it then the fear would take over. The helplessness and overwhelming dread threatening to attack her lingered at the back of her mind, though, shadowing her thoughts.</p><p>She cleaned up quickly before dressing and leaving the bathroom. She glanced at Rowdy where he lay facedown on the bed, breathing deeply in sleep, before leaving the room. The beginnings of a smile tipped her lips as the need to curl up against him unfurled inside her.</p><p>At the same time her stomach growled warningly. Sex with Rowdy became a secondary need in the face of her hunger. But, she reminded herself, she had worked up a bit of an appetite with the sex part.</p><p>She moved slowly down the narrow staircase, listening for Dawg and Natches. She couldn\u2019t hear either of them, but the television was playing in the living room. She knew Natches had intended to sneak out somewhere, and she wouldn\u2019t put it past Dawg to be hiding as well.</p><p>She was surprised to see him lying on the couch instead. He was stretched out in what had to be an uncomfortable angle. His head was hanging over the side as he lay on his back and one leg bent at an odd angle, his arm falling to the floor.</p><p>Kelly tipped her head, staring at his dozing posture before shaking her head in confusion at it. She had seen some odd sleeping angles, but that one took the cake.</p><p>Restraining a soft laugh, she tiptoed through the living room and made her way into the kitchen. Despite the television, there was a heavy silence in the house that bothered her, made her wary. The moment she entered the kitchen she knew why.</p><p>She stopped in shock at the sight of Natches, facedown on the floor, a trail of blood oozing from his temple to stain the floor beneath him.</p><p>Her heart slammed into her throat, stealing her breath and the screams that tightened her chest. She gasped for air, certain she was going to smother, knowing the terror filling her would kill her before anything else could.</p><p>Rowdy. Oh God, she had to get to Rowdy. She turned, the blood rushing through her veins as her mind screamed at her to run, only to slide to a stop as she moved back into the living room.</p><p>Eyes wide, her lips parted in shock, she stared at the form standing in the middle of the living room, a gun pointing toward her chest.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>It took Kelly a moment to realize that she knew him. She blinked in surprise as she recognized the young deputy who had come to the apartment with the police the night of her attack and again to Ray\u2019s house the night her bedroom had been destroyed. He had been so quiet she had barely remembered him being there.</p><p>\u201cThey thought they could catch me.\u201d He smiled back at her, his hazel eyes gleaming with triumph as he waved the barrel of his weapon toward where Dawg lay on the couch. \u201cThey thought they were better than me because they were big, tough Marines.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft, almost girlishly so. His expression was benign, calm, terrifying.</p><p>Deputy Carlyle. He hadn\u2019t been on the force long, a few years maybe. He was easy to overlook with his nondescript, plain features and quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cDeputy Carlyle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarnes-Carlyle. John,\u201d he answered her then. \u201cMy mother\u2019s maiden name was Barnes, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Oh God, had he killed Dawg and Natches? From the corner of her eye she tried to make certain Dawg was still breathing, but she just couldn\u2019t be sure. Natches had seemed to be breathing, but was that wishful thinking or had he been?</p><p>He sighed as though in regret.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make them pay, but I guess the past is catching up on all of us.\u201d He glanced at Dawg before his gaze came back to her. \u201cI lost count of the beatings I took from my father because of what your lovers did with my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She shook her head, confused.</p><p>\u201cLoren Barnes was their lover,\u201d he snickered. \u201cShe was my mother. Dad stole me away from her a few years before she seduced them into her bed. She was such a whore. One man was never enough for her.\u201d</p><p>Kelly remembered Loren Barnes. She had died several years before, an older woman, perhaps her mother\u2019s age. There had been a rumor that the Mackay cousins had been her lovers years before, but Kelly knew none of them had ever confirmed it.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t tell me why you\u2019ve done this.\u201d She couldn\u2019t breathe, fear was strangling her, weakening her, and she knew right now she couldn\u2019t afford to be weak.</p><p>He looked at her in surprise, his thin lips curving into a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am, do you, Kelly?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head slowly, suspicion and horror beating at her.</p><p>\u201cMy poor little girl,\u201d he whispered, confirming her worst fears. \u201cAnd you were such a good girl at one time. You know I\u2019m going to have to punish you now. You were supposed to be mine.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as his finger tightened on the trigger.</p><p>\u201cHow was I yours?\u201d She was desperate, knowing there was no way to run from that bullet or from him. \u201cYou wanted to rape me.\u201d</p><p>A frown edged at his brows as she fought to remember everything she had heard Rowdy and the others talking about concerning the other rape victims. What had they said? He made them beg for it, made them swear to love him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to touch me.\u201d She forced the words past her numb lips. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His hand trembled.</p><p>\u201cYou loved me.\u201d She saw the madness light his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid I say I loved you?\u201d She had to buy herself some time. Rowdy would be awake soon, he would know something was wrong. Oh God, where was he?</p><p>He blinked at her question before a pout curled his lips. \u201cThat stupid neighbor broke in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I loved you, John.\u201d She fought to stay in control. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to touch me. I was never yours.\u201d</p><p>He blinked back at her. \u201cNo. You were mine.\u201d His voice was almost childlike. \u201cYou were a good girl until they touched you. You wanted to be mine, because I knew you were a good girl.\u201d</p><p>God, he was insane.</p><p>\u201cI have always belonged to Rowdy.\u201d She kept her voice calm, fought to still the hysteria rising inside her. \u201cYou knew I was Rowdy\u2019s. Everyone knew. His cousins made sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Anger leapt to his features.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re depraved,\u201d he yelled back at her, his features contorting with fury. \u201cThey touched my mother. They made my father know what they were doing to her, and he told me about it. How they made her a bad girl. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be a bad girl. She was my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father misunderstood.\u201d She was shaking, horrified. \u201cThey were just boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d John shook his head furiously. \u201cHe would sneak and watch them and then he would punish me. He would come home and make me lie down while he punished me with what they were doing to her. He had to teach me not to be bad. Now I have to teach you, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. She felt her stomach pitch with the horrifying knowledge of what he was talking about. How could a father do such a thing? Drive his own son into insanity in such a way.</p><p>\u201cJohn, you have to listen to me.\u201d Her fists clenched in her shirt. Just a few more minutes. Surely Rowdy would be here in a few more minutes. \u201cYou have to leave. If you shoot me, Rowdy will hear...\u201d</p><p>He smiled then. A confident, mad smile that sent terror racing through her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI took care of Rowdy already, Kelly.

He\u2019ll learn not to touch what belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>She was going to throw up. The insanity that spewed from him was the most sickening thing she had ever known. Worse even than the attack she had suffered at his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Her voice trembled despite the effort she used to hold it steady. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take what was yours.

You can\u2019t force it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as his eyes glistened with tears, his lips wobbling with some demonic emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me time,\u201d he pouted. \u201cYou would have told me you loved me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew I didn\u2019t love you.\u201d She edged back as his head turned from her. If she could get to the kitchen and he chased her, then she could use the hall exit to get back to the stairs. All she needed was a head start. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Rowdy, John. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Mine!\u201d he screamed back at her. \u201cI\u2019ll show you, you\u2019re mine then I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>He lunged for her. Fury lit his expression as rage transformed his face and he rushed her. Kelly turned, sliding on the slick floor as she heard an enraged howl of fury echo through the house a second before the sound of two bodies impacting pulled her up short.</p><p>Gripped the door frame, she turned back, shock filling her as she watched Rowdy struggling with the smaller man. Rowdy was bigger, but the blood at his temple showed the earlier blow that was now slowing his reflexes.</p><p>The gun John had carried slid across the room as he fought to get to it. Kelly rushed for it, crying out in rage as a hand snagged her ankle, bringing her to her knees.</p><p>Her head turned as she saw the knife in John\u2019s hand, and Rowdy\u2019s reach to grab at his wrist as the other man aimed at her leg. She kicked out, breaking loose before scrambling for the weapon.</p> <p>Her fingers latched onto the handgrip as she flipped over, bringing it up with both hands as she fought to get a clear shot.</p><p>The two men were snarling now, wrestling for the knife as she heard the sounds of sirens in the distance. The gun shook in her hand as she blinked back her tears, terrified that the deputy would manage to actually find a way to wound Rowdy with that knife. There was no way to shoot yet. No way to be certain if she did, that she would miss Rowdy.</p><p>There had to be something she could do. But if she did the wrong thing, it could mean Rowdy\u2019s life. She prayed, sobbing in terror as she watched the two men grapple until the knife was between them a second before Rowdy jerked the other man closer to him.</p><p>They both froze.</p><p>A whimper left Kelly\u2019s throat as the front door crashed inward, and as though in slow motion, she watched Deputy John Barnes-Carlyle slide slowly from Rowdy\u2019s grip to collapse on the floor.</p><p>His head turned toward her, his hazel eyes filled with shock and surprise.</p><p>\u201cMy good girl...\u201d he whispered before his gaze dimmed and his body went limp.</p><p>Kelly stared back at him, the sounds of police filling the room receding to the background as adrenaline began to crash inside her. She lifted her head as the gun dropped in her lap, watching as Rowdy began to move toward her, only to have the sheriff block him as the room continued to fill up. She could hear her mother, or was it merely wishful thinking? Rowdy was yelling and Sheriff Mayes was barking orders.</p> <p>She knew she should get up, knew she should do something. But all she could do was turn her gaze back to the dead deputy as she heard his final words ringing in her ears. \u201cMy good girl...\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t his good girl. A sob tore from her throat as she pushed to her feet, fighting past the shock winding its way through her. He was dead. He was dead, and Rowdy was surrounded by the police.</p><p>\u201cLet him go!\u201d she screamed out hoarsely, fighting past Sheriff Mayes as she struggled to get to Rowdy. She kicked at someone, her fist landed against another, but they parted, staring back at her in shock as she flung herself into Rowdy\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThank God! Baby.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s arms closed around her as his voice whispered in her ear. \u201cSweet Lord, Kelly. Don\u2019t ever terrify me like that again.\u201d</p><p>She was crying and couldn\u2019t stop. She could feel the sobs shaking her body as her arms tightened around his neck.</p><p>She could hear Rowdy explaining the deputy\u2019s insanity as he held her close. Somehow, he had managed to regain consciousness and call the police, informing them of who was there and what was going on as he slipped down the stairs.</p><p>They were prepared, but questions had to be answered. Dawg and Natches were brought around by the medics and the house continued to fill with people. But Kelly refused to leave Rowdy\u2019s side.</p><p>She held on to him through the evening, answering questions when she had to, but otherwise remaining silent as the knowledge slowly filled her mind that it was over. The stalker had been John Barnes-Carlyle, and he was gone. He was dead. It was finally over.</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Kelly stared around the living room the next morning, amazed that there was nothing left, not so much as a speck of blood, to prove that the night before had been no dream.</p><p>The only proof left was the egg-sized knots that had been left on Dawg\u2019s, Natches\u2019s, and Rowdy\u2019s heads. John Barnes hadn\u2019t come to the front door, he had known about Dawg\u2019s back entrance through his father, who had spent years spying on the Mackay cousins, and used it to slip into the house.</p><p>He had gotten Dawg first, while Natches was outside getting the last supplies from his truck. When he came in, he had seen the same thing Kelly had, what appeared to be Dawg napping on the couch.</p><p>He had moved into the kitchen with the supplies, where the deputy had moved in behind him and knocked him unconscious as well. He had waited until Kelly had left the bedroom upstairs, hiding in the other room until she started down the stairs, before he had disabled Rowdy. Or thought he had.</p><p>Rowdy had been coming out of his nap as he was struck; the blow had dazed him, taking precious minutes for him to get his bearings enough to struggle from the bed.</p><p>The sheriff had called that morning after running a night-long investigation on his dead deputy. He had indeed been Loren Barnes\u2019s son, kidnapped by his father several years before the Mackay cousins had become her lovers.</p><p>There was a long history of abuse as a child, foster homes, and disappearances that hadn\u2019t been followed up on at the time. As the full story emerged, everyone who had known him on the force had been shocked. His father had molested him for years, punishing him for the supposed crimes his mother had committed. Richard Barnes, the father, had been insane, and his insanity had been forced upon his son until it had warped his view of women.</p><p>Four women had paid for that crime.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d She turned her head as Dawg moved from the kitchen, followed by Rowdy and Natches.</p><p>She stared at the three men, feeling the tension that suddenly filled the room, the intensity in their eyes. She had known this was coming, had known Rowdy\u2019s cousins would soon put his decision to the test. She could see it in the ready tension of their bodies. There was none of the expected anger in Rowdy\u2019s expression though. His body was relaxed, easy, his gaze simmering with amusement.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a problem?\u201d She crossed her arms over her breasts and stared back at the three curiously.</p><p>\u201cRowdy\u2019s being greedy,\u201d Dawg grunted. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rather greedy myself, Dawg,\u201d she informed him fondly. \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d She could see the frustration in his face. \u201cHell, Kelly, our cousins in Texas have survived just fine.\u201d</p><p>The Augusts. They didn\u2019t even live in Somerset and they had a reputation here.</p><p>She breathed in deeply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Marly or their other wives,\u201d she informed them as Rowdy straightened, slowly tensing.</p><p>Dawg glared back at Rowdy then. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even give us a chance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love her, Dawg,\u201d Rowdy snapped, striding across the room to Kelly\u2019s side.</p><p>When he turned to face Dawg and Natches, his arm curled around Kelly\u2019s back, pulling her closer to his hard body.</p><p>\u201cWe love her enough,\u201d Natches protested, his jaw pulsing tightly.</p><p>\u201cOh give it up!\u201d Kelly stepped away from her lover, staring between the three men incredulously, laughter bubbling from her throat at their fierce expressions. \u201cGeez, do I look like a bone between the three of you?\u201d</p><p>They stared back at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cDawg, how many times did I flirt with you, just for the hell of it, while Rowdy was gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Rowdy turned to her in surprised irritation.</p><p>\u201cSave it.\u201d She rolled her eyes back at him. \u201cYou were gone, so the jealousy is a little late.\u201d She turned back to Dawg. \u201cAnd I\u2019m waiting on an answer, Dawg?\u201d</p><p>Dawg shifted nervously, rather like a little boy caught in a fib.</p><p>He cleared his throat, glancing at Rowdy with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cYou belonged to him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his always, Dawg,\u201d she informed him gently. \u201cNow, forever, and always. And that\u2019s my decision. Not Rowdy\u2019s. And it\u2019s one you won\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you she was trouble,\u201d Natches griped. \u201cDammit, Kelly, we didn\u2019t ask you to mess things up like this.\u201d He cast her a brooding glare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She smiled back placidly.</p><p>They weren\u2019t angry, she could see it in their eyes, feel it in the affection in their gazes.</p><p>Natches turned to Dawg and lifted his fist.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the last.\u201d</p><p>Dawg lifted his fist in return, touching it to his cousin\u2019s. \u201cThe last.\u201d</p><p>He appeared firm, decisive. Kelly tilted her head and watched both men curiously. Natches might never let go of the more extreme needs, but there was something there in Dawg\u2019s expression. Something hesitant. Something uncertain.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s arm hooked around her waist, dragging her toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bed,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cBut, Rowdy, I\u2019m not sleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, you will be. Later...\u201d</p><p>She was laughing as he swept her into the bedroom. </p> </body></html>"]
