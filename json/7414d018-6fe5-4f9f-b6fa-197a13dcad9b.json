Izzy could look at her situation and see just that. Motherless at a young age. Fatherless now, as well. Penniless. Friendless.</p><p>But she\u2019d never been hopeless.</p><p>Not yet.</p> <p>Not quite.</p><p>Because the name Isolde Ophelia Goodnight also suggested romance. Swooning, star-crossed, legendary romance. And for as long as she could remember, Izzy had been waiting\u2014with dwindling faith and increasing impatience\u2014for that part of her life to begin.</p><p>Once she\u2019d grown old enough to understand her mother\u2019s death, Izzy had consoled herself with the idea that this was all part of her epic tale. The heroines in fairy stories were always motherless.</p><p>When Papa overspent their income, and the maid was dismissed, she told herself the drudgery would pay off someday. Everyone knew that Cinderella had to scrub the floors before she could win the handsome prince.</p><p>By time she turned fifteen, their finances had improved, thanks to Papa\u2019s writing success. Still no prince, but there was time. Izzy told herself she\u2019d grow into her largish nose and that her frizzled hair would eventually tame itself.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t, and it didn\u2019t. No ugly-duckling-turned-swan here, either.</p><p>Her seventeenth birthday passed without any pricking of fingers.</p><p>At twenty-one, life forced a difficult truth on her somewhere on the road between Maidstone and Rochester. Real highwayman were neither devilishly charming nor roguishly handsome. They wanted money, and they wanted it quickly, and Izzy ought to be very glad they weren\u2019t interested in her.</p><p>One by one, she\u2019d let go of all those girlish dreams.</p><p>Then last year, Papa had died, and all the stories dried up completely. The money was gone soon after that. For the first time in her life, Izzy verged on true desperation.</p><p>Her cravings for romance were gone. Now she\u2019d settle for bread. What fairy tales were left over for a plain, impoverished, twenty-six-year-old woman who\u2019d never even been kissed?</p> <p>This one.</p><p>She clutched the letter in her hand. There it was, in black ink on white paper. Her very last hope. She forced herself not to hold it too tightly, for fear it might crumble to dust.</p><p>Dear Miss Goodnight,</p><p>It is my duty as executor to inform you that the Earl of Lynforth has died. In his will, he left you\u2014and each of his goddaughters\u2014a bequest. Please meet me at Gostley Castle, near Woolington in the county of Northumberland, on this twenty-first of June to settle the particulars of your inheritance.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Frederick Trent, Lord Archer</p><p>A bequest. Perhaps it would be as much as a hundred pounds. Even twenty would be a windfall. She was down to shillings and pence.</p><p>When Gostley Castle came into view, Izzy gulped.</p> <p>From a distance, it could have looked romantic. A collection of mismatched turrets and ranging, crenellated walls, studded amid rolling green fields. But the surrounding park had grown so wild and dense from neglect that by the time the castle came into view, she was already cowering in its shadow.</p><p>This castle didn\u2019t welcome or enchant.</p><p>It loomed.</p><p>It menaced.</p><p>She almost worried it might pounce.</p><p>\u201cHere we are, miss.\u201d The driver didn\u2019t seem to like it any better than Izzy did. He pulled his team to a halt well outside the barbican, a stone gatehouse set some distance from the castle itself.</p><p>After helping her down from the carriage, he turned up the collar of his coat and unloaded her baggage\u2014a single, battered valise. He carried it to the stone steps of the ancient gatehouse, strode briskly back, jammed his hands in his pockets, and cleared his throat. Waiting.</p><p>Izzy knew what he was after. She\u2019d paid the man in Woolington\u2014he wouldn\u2019t agree to transport her without payment in advance\u2014but now he wanted an additional expression of thanks. She fished a sixpence from her purse. So few coins remained, the purse didn\u2019t even rattle.</p><p>The driver pocketed her offering and touched his cap. \u201cWhat was yer name again, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight. Miss Izzy Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>She waited to see if he would recognize it. Most of the literate people in England would, and a great many of their domestic servants, besides.</p><p>The driver only grunted. \u201cJes\u2019 wanted to know it, in case someone comes around asking. If you\u2019re never heard from again.\u201d</p><p>Izzy laughed. She waited for him to laugh, too.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Soon driver, team, and carriage were nothing more than the fading crunch of wheels on the road.</p><p>Izzy picked up her valise and walked through the barbican. A stone bridge carried her over what once had been a moat but now was only a slimy green trickle.</p><p>She\u2019d done a bit of research in advance of her journey. There wasn\u2019t much to read. Only that Gostley Castle had once been the seat of the Rothbury dukedom, in Norman times.</p><p>It didn\u2019t look inhabited now. There was no glass in many of the windows. No lights in them, either. There should have been a portcullis that dropped to bar the entrance\u2014but there was nothing there. No door, no gate.</p><p>She walked through the archway and into the central, open courtyard.</p><p>\u201cLord Archer?\u201d Her voice died in the air. She tried again. \u201cLord Archer, are you here?\u201d This time, her call got a respectable echo off the flagstones. But no answer.</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>Dizzied from her strange surroundings and weak with hunger, Izzy closed her eyes. She coerced air into her lungs.</p><p>You cannot faint. Only ninnies and consumptive ladies swoon, and you are neither.</p><p>It started to rain. Fat, heavy drops of summer rain\u2014the kind that always struck her as vaguely lewd and debauched. Little potbellied drunkards, those summer raindrops, chortling on their way to earth and crashing open with glee.</p><p>She was getting wet, but the alternative\u2014seeking shelter inside one of the darkened arches\u2014was less appealing by far.</p><p>A rustling sound made her jump and wheel. Just a raven taking wing. She watched it fly over the castle wall and away.</p><p>She laughed a little. Really. It was too much. A vast, uninhabited castle, rain, and now ravens, too? Someone was playing her a cruel trick.</p><p>Then she glimpsed a man across the courtyard, standing in a darkened archway.</p><p>And if he was a trick, he wasn\u2019t a cruel one.</p><p>There were things in nature that took their beauty from delicate structure and intricate symmetry. Flowers. Seashells. Butterfly wings. And then there were things that were beautiful for their wild power and their refusal to be tamed. Snowcapped mountains. Churning thunderclouds. Shaggy, sharp-toothed lions.</p><p>This man silhouetted before her? He belonged, quite solidly, in the latter category.</p><p>So did the wolf sitting at his heel.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be a wolf, she told herself. It had to be some sort of dog. Wolves had long been hunted to extinction. The last one in England died ages ago.</p><p>But then . . . she would have thought they\u2019d stopped making men like this, too.</p><p>He shifted his weight, and a slant of weak light revealed the bottom half of his face. She glimpsed a wide, sensual slash of a mouth. A squared jaw, dark with whiskers. Overlong hair brushed his collar. Or it would have, if he had a collar. He wore only an open-necked linen shirt beneath his coat. Buckskin breeches hugged him from slim hips to muscled thighs . . . and from there, his legs disappeared into a pair of weathered, dusty Hessians.</p><p>Oh, dear. She did have such a weakness for a pair of well-traveled boots. They made her desperate to know everywhere they\u2019d been.</p><p>Her heart beat faster. This didn\u2019t help with her lightheadedness problem.</p><p>\u201cAre you Lord Archer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was low, unforgiving.</p><p>The beast at his heel growled.</p><p>\u201cOh. I-is Lord Archer here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you the caretaker?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you expecting him soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And no.\u201d</p><p>Was that amusement in his voice?</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI received a letter. From Lord Archer. He asked me to meet him here on this date regarding some business with the late Earl of Lynforth\u2019s estate. Apparently he left me some sort of bequest.\u201d She extended the letter with a shaking hand. \u201cHere. Would you care to read it for yourself?\u201d</p><p>That wide mouth quirked at one corner. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Izzy retracted the letter as calmly as she could manage and replaced it in her pocket.</p><p>He leaned one shoulder against the archway. \u201cAren\u2019t we going to continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis game.\u201d His voice was so low it seemed to crawl to her over the flagstones, then shiver up through the soles of her feet. \u201cAm I a Russian prince? No. Is my favorite color yellow? No. Would I object if you were to come inside and remove every stitch of your damp clothing?\u201d His voice did the impossible. It sank lower. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He was just making sport of her now.</p><p>Izzy clutched her valise to her chest. She didn\u2019t want Snowdrop getting wet. \u201cDo you treat all your visitors this way?\u201d</p><p>Idiot. She cursed herself and braced for another low, mocking \u201cno.\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cOnly the pretty ones.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. She ought to have guessed it earlier. The fatigue and hunger had done something to her brain. She could almost believe the castle, the ravens, the sudden appearance of a tall, dark, handsome man. But now he was flirting with her?</p><p>She had to be hallucinating.</p><p>The rain beat down, impatient to get from the clouds to the earth. Izzy watched drops pinging off the flagstones. Each one seemed to chisel a bit more strength from her knees.</p><p>The castle walls began to spin. Her vision went dark at the edges.</p><p>\u201cI . . . Forgive me, I . . .\u201d</p><p>Her valise dropped to the ground.</p><p>The beast snarled at it.</p><p>The man moved out from the shadows.</p><p>And Izzy fainted dead away.</p><p>The girl crumpled to the flagstones with a wet thud.</p><p>Ransom winced at the irony. Despite all that had happened, he still had the ladies swooning. One way or another.</p><p>He released Magnus with a low command. Once the dog had completed his wet-nose investigation, Ransom brushed the animal aside and took his turn.</p><p>He ran his hands over the limp heap of joints and limbs before him. Damp muslin, worn boots. Small hands, slender wrists. There wasn\u2019t much of her. She seemed to be half petticoats, half hair.</p><p>And God, what hair. Thick, curly, abundant.</p><p>He felt the warm huff of her breath against his hand. He slid his touch lower, searching for the girl\u2019s heartbeat.</p><p>His palm brushed over a full, rounded breast.</p><p>A surge of . . . something . . . passed through him, unbidden. Not lust, just male awareness. Apparently, he should stop thinking of her as \u201cthe girl.\u201d She was most definitely \u201cthe woman.\u201d</p><p>Ransom cursed. He didn\u2019t want visitors. Especially not visitors of the female kind. He had enough of that with the local vicar\u2019s daughter, Miss Pelham. She came around the castle every week or so, offering to read him sermons or some other foolishness. At least when Miss Pelham made her sunny march up the hill, basket of good deeds threaded over one arm, she came expecting to find a scarred, unshaven wreck of a man. And she was far too sensible to faint at the sight.</p><p>This woman crumpled on the flagstones hadn\u2019t been expecting Ransom.</p><p>What was it she\u2019d said about a Lord Archer? She had a letter on her somewhere that explained it, but he couldn\u2019t bother with that now. He needed to get her inside\u2014warm her up, give her a splash of whisky and milk in her tea.</p><p>The sooner she recovered her senses, the sooner she could leave.</p><p>He wrestled her sodden, unconscious form into his arms and stood. He adjusted her weight, finding the fulcrum between her hips and her shoulders, then made his way up the stairs to take her inside.</p><p>He counted the steps out. Five . . . six . . . seven . . .</p><p>As he took the eighth step, she shifted in his arms. He froze, bracing for unpleasantness. She\u2019d fainted dead at her first sight of him. If she woke to find him carrying her now, she might expire from the shock. Or split his eardrums with a shriek. Just what he didn\u2019t need\u2014an injury to his hearing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She mumbled faintly but didn\u2019t rouse. No, she did something far worse.</p><p>She nuzzled.</p><p>Slid sideways, curling into his embrace, and rubbed her cheek against his chest, seeking warmth. She gave a faint, husky moan.</p> <p>Another surge of . . . something . . . passed through him. He paused for a moment, absorbing the sharp invasion of it before he continued his climb.</p><p>Gods be cursed. The one thing Ransom wanted less right now than a swooning woman? A nuzzling woman. Since his injury, he didn\u2019t like anyone too close. And he didn\u2019t require any nuzzling, thank you. He had a dog.</p><p>The dog led the way as he reached the top of the stairs and turned to enter the castle\u2019s great hall. This space was his encampment, of sorts. He slept here, he ate here, he drank here, he . . . cursed and brooded here. His manservant, Duncan, was always after him to open more of the castle\u2019s rooms, but Ransom didn\u2019t see the point.</p><p>He settled the girl\u2014the woman\u2014on the decrepit horsehair sofa, pushing it nearer the fire. The sofa legs screeched across the stone floor. He waited to see if she\u2019d stir.</p><p>Nothing.</p> <p>He gave her shoulder a mild shake.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cWake,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cLook there. It\u2019s Lord Archer.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Ransom drew up a chair and sat nearby. Five seconds later, he rose again to pace. Twenty-three paces to the leftmost window, then back. He had his strengths, but patience wasn\u2019t one of them. Inaction made him a growly, ill-tempered beast.</p><p>When Duncan returned, he could send for a doctor. But it could be hours before Duncan returned.</p> <p>Magnus whined and nosed about his boots.</p><p>Ransom sent the dog to its rug by the fire. Then he crouched beside the sofa and placed one hand on the woman\u2019s neck. He slid his touch along that sleek, delicate column until he found her pulse with his fingertips. The heartbeat was weaker than he would have liked it to be, and rabbit-fast. Damn.</p><p>She turned her head, sliding her soft cheek into his hand. There she went again, nuzzling. The friction released gentle hints of a soft, feminine fragrance.</p><p>\u201cTemptress,\u201d he muttered bitterly.</p><p>If he had to have a swooning, nuzzling woman collapse on his doorstep, why couldn\u2019t it be one who smelled of vinegar and old cheese? No, he had to get one scented of rosemary and sweet, powdered skin.</p><p>He pressed his thumb to her rain-splashed cheek. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, woman. Wake.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d struck her head on the flagstones. He thrust his fingers into her upswept hair, yanking out her hairpins. There were dozens of them, it seemed, and with each one he pulled, the mass of hair seemed to grow wilder. Angrier. The curling locks tangled and knotted between his fingers, obstructing his explorations. By the time he\u2019d satisfied himself that her skull was intact, he could have believed that hair was alive. And hungry.</p><p>But her skull was in one piece, with no knots or swellings that he could detect. And she still hadn\u2019t made a sound.</p> <p>Perhaps she was injured somewhere else. Or maybe her corset was too tight.</p><p>There was only one way to tell.</p><p>With a gruff sigh, he shook off his coat and turned up his sleeves. Rolling her onto her side, he brushed her predatory hair away and set his fingers to the task of undoing the buttons down the back of her frock. He was out of practice, but there were some things a man didn\u2019t forget. How to undo a woman\u2019s buttons was one.</p><p>How to unlace a woman\u2019s stays was another.</p><p>As he yanked the laces from the corset grommets, he felt her rib cage expand beneath his palms. She shifted and released a throaty, sensual sigh.</p><p>He froze. Another surge of . . . something . . . pulsed through his veins, and this time he couldn\u2019t dismiss it as some tender nonsense.</p><p>This was lust, pure and simple. He\u2019d gone a dangerously long time without a woman in his arms.</p><p>He pushed the physical response aside. With brisk, businesslike motions, he pulled the sleeves of her frock down her arms, feeling for any broken bones along the way. Then he began working the bodice down to her waist. He couldn\u2019t let her just lie there in wet sacking, or she\u2019d catch a chill.</p><p>He would deserve a great deal of gratitude for this when she awoke\u2014but somehow he doubted he\u2019d get it.</p><p>Izzy came to herself with a jolt.</p><p>She was indoors. Inside the castle. Pillars sprouted around her like ancient trees, soaring up to support the vaulted ceiling of a cavernous great hall.</p><p>Looking about, she saw scattered furnishings in various states of decay. The near end of the hall featured a massive hearth. If there weren\u2019t a roaring fire in it, Izzy had no doubt she could stand inside that fireplace without even crouching. The blaze within fed not on splits of wood, or even logs, but on full tree trunks.</p><p>She lay on a dusty, lumpy sofa. A rough, woolen blanket had been drawn over her body. She peeked beneath it and cringed. She\u2019d been divested of her frock, stays, petticoats, and boots. Only her chemise and stockings remained.</p><p>\u201cOh dear heavens.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand to her unbound hair. Her Aunt Lilith was right. She\u2019d always harped on Izzy during those summers in Essex. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that no one will see them,\u201d she\u2019d squawked. \u201cAlways\u2014always\u2014wear a clean shift and stockings. You never know when you might meet with an accident.\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . dear . . . heavens. It all came back to her now. The rain . . . her swoon . . .</p><p>Izzy looked up, and there he was.</p><p>The Accident.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he said, without turning to confirm it.</p><p>\u201cYes. Where are my things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour valise is two paces inside the entry, to the right.\u201d</p><p>Izzy twisted her neck and glimpsed the valise, right where he\u2019d said it would be. It wasn\u2019t moving or open. Snowdrop must still be asleep. That was a relief.</p><p>\u201cYour frock is there.\u201d He gestured toward where her frock hung over the back of two upright chairs, drying by the fire. \u201cYour petticoats are draped over the far table, and your corset is on the other s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Izzy wanted to die. The whole situation was mortifying. Swooning at a handsome stranger\u2019s boots was embarrassing enough, but hearing him catalog her underthings? She clutched the blanket to her chest. \u201cYou needn\u2019t have troubled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed to breathe. And I needed to be sure you weren\u2019t bleeding or broken anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain why that required undressing her to her shift. A quick glance would tell him if she were bleeding.</p><p>\u201cAre you ill?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. At least, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you with child?\u201d</p><p>Her burst of laughter startled the dog. \u201cDefinitely not. I\u2019m not the sort of woman who faints, I promise you. I just hadn\u2019t eaten much today.\u201d Or yesterday, or the day before that.</p><p>Her voice was hoarse and raspy. Perhaps she was catching a cold. That would help explain the fainting, too.</p><p>Throughout this conversation, her host remained at the hearth, facing away from her. His coat stretched tight at the shoulders but hung a bit loose about his midsection. Perhaps he\u2019d recently lost some bulk. But there was plenty of him remaining, and all of it was lean and hard. His body was much like this great hall around them. Suffering from a bit of neglect, but impressively made and strong to the bones.</p><p>And that voice. Oh, it was dangerous.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know which upset her more: That this shadowy, handsome stranger had made so free with her person\u2014carrying her in his arms, unlacing her stays, taking down her hair, and stripping her to her thinnest undergarments? Or that she\u2019d somehow slept through the whole thing?</p><p>She snuck another glance at him, silhouetted by orange firelight.</p><p>The latter. Definitely the latter. The most exciting quarter hour of her life, and she\u2019d spent it completely insensible. Izzy, you fool.</p><p>But though she had no firm recollection of being carried in from the rain, her body seemed to have a memory of its own. Beneath her clothing, she smoldered with the sensation of strong hands on chilled flesh. As if his touch had been imprinted on her skin.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was good of you to carry me inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s tea. To your left.\u201d</p><p>A chipped mug of steaming liquid sat on a table nearby\u2014to her left, as he\u2019d said. She took it in both hands, letting its warmth seep into her palms before lifting it for a long, nourishing draught.</p><p>Fire raced down her throat.</p><p>She coughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilk. And a drop of whisky.\u201d</p><p>Whisky? She sipped again, not in a position to be particular. When approached with the appropriate caution, the brew wasn\u2019t so bad. As she swallowed, an earthy, smoky heat curled through her.</p><p>On the same table, she found a small loaf of bread and broke into it, famished.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked between mouthfuls. Aunt Lilith would not be pleased with her manners.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Rothbury. You\u2019re in my castle.\u201d</p><p>Izzy swallowed hard. This man claimed to be the Duke of Rothbury? It seemed too much to believe. Shouldn\u2019t dukes have servants to make their tea and dress them in proper attire?</p><p>God help her. Perhaps she was trapped with a madman.</p><p>Izzy drew the blanket close. Despite her doubts, she wasn\u2019t going to risk provoking him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize,\u201d she said. \u201cShould I address you as \u2018Your Grace?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the point of it. Within a few hours, I hope you\u2019ll refer to me as \u2018That ill-mannered wretch you importuned one rainy afternoon and then never pestered again.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful women are always trouble. Whether they mean to be or not.\u201d</p><p>More teasing. Or more lunacy. Izzy wasn\u2019t sure which. The only thing she knew for certain was that she was no kind of beauty. It didn\u2019t matter how she pinched her cheeks or pinned back her aggressively curly hair. She was plain, and there seemed no getting around it.</p><p>This man, however, was anything but ordinary. She watched him as he tossed more wood on the blaze. He added a log as thick as her thigh, but he handled it with all the ease of tinder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Miss Isolde Goodnight,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve heard the name.\u201d</p><p>He poked the fire. \u201cWhy would I have heard the name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was Sir Henry Goodnight. He was a scholar and historian, but he was most well-known as a writer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that explains why I don\u2019t know him. I am not a reader.\u201d</p><p>Izzy looked to the arched windows. The afternoon was darkening. The lengthening shadows worried her, as did the fact that she\u2019d yet to make out the entirety of her host\u2019s face. She was growing anxious to see him, look into his eyes. She needed to know just what sort of man held her at his mercy.</p><p>\u201cIt seems Lord Archer might be some time yet,\u201d she ventured. \u201cMight we have a candle or two while we wait?\u201d</p><p>After a grudging pause, he took a straw, lit it in the fire, and, carefully cupping the flame with one palm, moved it to a taper fixed atop the mantel.</p><p>The task seemed to cause him inordinate difficulty. The candlewick caught, but he held the straw in place until it burned down to his fingertips. He cursed under his breath and whipped it with his hand, shaking out the flame.</p><p>\u201cI hate to be a bother. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she was admitting it, except that she felt sorry he\u2019d burned himself to increase her comfort. \u201cI\u2019m not fond of the dark.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, bearing the candle. One side of his wide mouth tipped, like a scale weighted with irony. \u201cI haven\u2019t made my peace with it either.\u201d</p><p>The new flame cast golden light on his face. Izzy startled. His sculpted, aristocratic features did much to bolster his claim of being a duke. But something else about his face told a different story. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A dramatic, uneven scar sliced from his brow to his temple, ending on the crest of his right cheekbone. Though the candle flame flickered and sparked, his eyes didn\u2019t narrow or focus.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>The realization flared within her. At last, something about this day made sense.</p> <p>It all made sense.</p><p>The darkened room, his refusal to read her letter, his manual assessment of her health. His repeated mentions of Izzy\u2019s beauty despite what should have been ample evidence to the contrary.</p><p>He was blind.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Ransom remained still, letting the candle illuminate the mangled side of his face. He\u2019d been keeping his distance to spare her this, but she\u2019d requested the light.</p> <p>So he waited, allowing her a good, long look.</p><p>No shrieks, gasps of horror, or soft thuds as she hit the floor. Not this time. She exuded nothing but that same teasing fragrance of rosemary.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the candle.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was even more alluring than her scent. She had the accent of a sheltered English miss\u2014but with an undeniably husky, sensual undertone.</p><p>\u201cHas it been a long time since your injury?\u201d she asked. \u201cWere you wounded in battle? A duel? An accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fond of long stories.\u201d</p><p>He plunked the candlestick on the table with finality. \u201cNot this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know it\u2019s terribly forward of me to ask. I had decided against it. But then I thought, surely you must know that I\u2019m wondering. If I pretended sudden interest in the ceiling or the weather, that would be an insult of sorts, too. And you seem the sort of man who\u2019d prefer honesty\u2014even the uncomfortable kind\u2014to insincerity, so I just\u201d\u2014her voice dropped a half octave\u2014\u201cdecided to ask.\u201d</p><p>She went quiet. At last.</p><p>He was irritated with his body\u2019s response to her presence. Her femininity was like a lacy blanket taking up his favorite chair. Not something he would have brought into the room, but since she was there . . . he couldn\u2019t deny that a scarred, neglected part of him craved that softness.</p><p>Hell, he ached for it, straight to his bones.</p><p>\u201cVery well, I won\u2019t press you for the story behind it,\u201d she said lightly, \u201cbut be forewarned. I shall probably make one up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake up as many stories as you wish. Just don\u2019t make me the hero in them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen can we expect Lord Archer to arrive?\u201d</p><p>Damned if Ransom knew. He hadn\u2019t the faintest idea who this Archer might be. \u201cThere\u2019s been some misunderstanding. Whoever it is you\u2019re searching for, he isn\u2019t here. My manservant will be returning soon. I\u2019ll have him see you back to Woolington.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cThen I suppose I should dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d He waved in invitation. \u201cThere\u2019s no dressing room. And if you haven\u2019t gathered as much by now, you needn\u2019t wait for me to avert my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Just the same, he turned to the wall. He clucked his tongue, calling Magnus to heel.</p><p>Behind him, light footsteps padded across the floor. The rustle of petticoats grated on his calm. He reached down to give the dog a light scratch.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a mountain of correspondence on your table,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAre you very sure a Lord Archer didn\u2019t write to you?\u201d</p><p>Ransom considered. True, he couldn\u2019t be sure of anything that pertained to his written correspondence lately. Duncan had many useful skills, but none of them could be described as secretarial.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . I\u2019m grateful for the offer of transport to Woolington,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d go from there. I see you\u2019ve emptied my purse onto the table. You must have noticed how little was in it.\u201d</p><p>He had noticed. She had exactly three shillings, ten pence in her purse. No jewelry of any value. He hadn\u2019t searched the valise, but it weighed almost nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf you force me out tonight, I\u2019ve nowhere to go.\u201d</p><p>Ransom heard the slight waver in her voice.</p><p>He shut his ears to it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fathom why a young, unaccompanied woman would make the journey alone to the middle of Northumberland by the grace of her last few shillings.</p><p>But this Miss Goodnight needed to say good-bye. He wished her no ill, but he had nothing to offer her, either. If she was looking for a rescuer, she\u2019d found the wrong man.</p><p>\u201cMy manservant can take you to the village church,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps the vicar\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Magnus\u2019s ear perked under his touch. The dog\u2019s skull vibrated with a low, nearly inaudible growl.</p><p>A moment later, Ransom heard the sound, too. Hoofbeats coming up the road. An unfamiliar rhythm. It couldn\u2019t be Duncan. \u201cPerhaps this Lord Archer has come for you after all.\u201d</p><p>She released a breathy sigh. \u201cThank heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>In a matter of moments, the intruder\u2019s steps sounded in the courtyard. \u201cHullo, there? Miss Goodnight?\u201d</p><p>She flew to the window and called down. \u201cUp here, my lord. The great hall.\u201d</p><p>Once the man entered the hall, his steps arrowed straight toward their place near the hearth. Confident, clipped. Much too fast.</p><p>Ransom gritted his teeth. Damn, he hated this. Being at this constant disadvantage, unable to control the situation.</p><p>The fireplace poker was close at hand. He lifted it. \u201cStop there.\u201d</p><p>The footsteps halted, some ten feet away. He felt the fresh source of scrutiny burning over his scarred face.</p><p>\u201cIs that . . . ? But it can\u2019t be.\u201d The newcomer took one step forward. \u201cRothbury? Good God. It\u2019s like coming face-to-face with a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d Ransom said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I know you.\u201d Archer lowered his voice to a whisper. \u201cI was on the guest list, you see. Bride\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>Ransom steeled his jaw and kept his expression impassive. He wouldn\u2019t give this cur the pleasure of a reaction.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s seen you in months,\u201d Archer went on. \u201cThe rumor about Town is that you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the rumor has it wrong.\u201d</p><p>The truth was even worse.</p><p>Ransom gave the poker a meaningful tap against stone. This was his castle. He didn\u2019t answer questions here; he asked them. \u201cExplain yourself. What are you doing, luring unsuspecting women to my home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your home?\u201d Archer chuckled in a low, disconcerting way. \u201cWell, this should prove interesting.\u201d</p><p>Izzy felt as though she\u2019d wandered into the third act of a play. She had no idea what was going on, but it was unbearably dramatic.</p><p>Lord Archer did make a fine-looking player. She was comforted by his starched cravat and fitted gloves. Signs that civility still existed somewhere in the world.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll permit me to speak with Miss Goodnight,\u201d Archer said, unperturbed by the makeshift weapon leveled at his chest, \u201cI think you\u2019ll find all your questions answered.\u201d</p><p>The Duke of Rothbury\u2014for it would seem he was the duke, after all\u2014lowered his poker. Grudgingly. \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><p>Lord Archer turned to Izzy. He smiled and rubbed his hands together. \u201cSo. I\u2019ve been most anxious to meet the famous Izzy Goodnight. My nieces will be green with envy.\u201d His enthusiasm faded as he looked her over. \u201cI must say, you\u2019re not quite what I expected.\u201d</p><p>Izzy held back a sigh. She never was.</p><p>\u201cI always pictured you as a wide-eyed child,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was twelve when my father\u2019s stories began appearing in the Gentleman\u2019s Review. But that was almost fourteen years ago. And, in the natural way of things, I\u2019ve aged one year every year since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI suppose you would have.\u201d</p><p>Izzy merely smiled in response. She\u2019d long made a habit of rationing her remarks when speaking with her father\u2019s admirers. The Lord Archers of the world didn\u2019t want Izzy to be a grown woman with her own set of likes and dislikes, dreams and desires. They wanted her to be the wide-eyed young girl of the stories. That way, they could continue to read and reread their beloved tales, imagining themselves in her place.</p><p>For that was the magic spell of The Goodnight Tales. When they settled down with each weekly installment, readers felt themselves tucked beneath that warm purple quilt. They saw themselves staring up at a ceiling painted with silver moons and golden stars, their hair fanned across the pillow for a loving father\u2019s hand to stroke. They looked forward to that same, familiar promise:</p><p>Put out the light, my darling Izzy, and I shall tell you such a tale . . .</p><p>The truth of her childhood didn\u2019t match what was printed in the magazines. But if she ever let it slip\u2014oh, how people resented her for it. They looked at her as if she\u2019d just ripped the wings off the Last True Fairy in England.</p><p>Lord Archer sat on the arm of the sofa, leaning toward her in confidence. \u201cSay, I know you must be asked this all the time. But my nieces would garrote me with their skipping ropes if I didn\u2019t try. I don\u2019t suppose your father . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d Her smile tightened. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Cressida escapes from the tower. And I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve no idea of the Shadow Knight\u2019s true identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ulric\u2019s still dangling from that parapet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind it.\u201d He gave her a good-natured smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You must be more tortured by the uncertainty than anyone.\u201d</p><p>You have no idea.</p><p>Tortured by the uncertainty, indeed. She was asked these same questions at least three times a week, in person or in letters. When her father died suddenly of an apoplexy, his ongoing saga had been interrupted, too. His beloved characters had been left in all sorts of perilous situations. Locked in towers and dangling from cliffs.</p><p>Izzy found herself in the most desperate straits of all. Stripped of all her possessions, cast out of the only home she\u2019d ever known. But no one thought to inquire after her well-being. They all worried over Cressida locked in her tower, and her beloved Ulric, hanging by three fingers from the parapet.</p><p>\u201cMy father would be most gratified that you asked,\u201d Izzy told him. \u201cI\u2019m thankful, too.\u201d It was the truth. Despite her current circumstances, she was proud of the Goodnight legacy.</p><p>Over by the hearth, the duke cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she said, \u201cI think our host is eager to have us gone. Might I ask about this bequest my godfather left me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Lord Archer rummaged in a small portmanteau. \u201cI\u2019ve brought all the papers with me. We can have it done today. Rothbury can hand over the keys if there are any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeys?\u201d She sat tall. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour inheritance, Miss Goodnight. It\u2019s this. The castle.\u201d</p><p>Her breath left her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>In a dark voice, the duke protested, too. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>Lord Archer squinted at the documents. \u201cHere we are. \u2018To Miss Isolde Ophelia Goodnight, I leave the property known as Gostley Castle.\u2019 Is it pronounced like \u2018Ghostly\u2019 or \u2018Ghastly\u2019? Either one seems accurate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the bequest was money,\u201d Izzy said, shaking her head. \u201cA hundred pounds, perhaps two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no money, Miss Goodnight. Just the castle. Lynforth had several goddaughters, and apparently he gifted them with too few ponies or hair ribbons over the years. In the last months of his life, he decided to leave each of them every girl\u2019s dream. Her very own castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait,\u201d the duke interrupted. \u201cThis castle has been in my family for hundreds of years.\u201d</p><p>Archer looked at the papers. \u201cAnd apparently it was sold to Lynforth just a few months back.\u201d He looked over his papers at Izzy. \u201cI take it you\u2019re surprised by this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m stunned,\u201d Izzy admitted. \u201cThe earl was kind to me, but he wasn\u2019t even my godfather. Not properly. He was my father\u2019s patron at Court.\u201d</p><p>Izzy had been introduced to Lord Lynforth a few times, most recently when Papa received his knighthood. On that illustrious occasion, the dear old man had slipped Izzy a sweetmeat from his waistcoat pocket and given her a fond pat on the head. Never mind that she\u2019d been mere days from her twenty-second birthday. His intentions were kind.</p><p>Now the dear old man had left her a castle?</p> <p>A castle.</p><p>Archer pressed the folio of papers into Izzy\u2019s keeping. \u201cIt\u2019s all there. A copy of the will, the property deed. This castle and everything in it\u2014it\u2019s yours now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the folio. \u201cWhat am I to do with the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to live in it?\u201d Lord Archer looked at the soaring ceiling and shrugged. \u201cI suppose you could clean it up. Try to sell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crash.</p> <p>Izzy ducked as something exploded against the far wall.</p><p>She looked around for the source. She didn\u2019t have to search far. In another fearsome explosion of strength, the duke picked up a chair and sent it sailing against the wall, too.</p><p>Crash, part second.</p><p>Splintered wood cascaded to the floor.</p><p>In the aftermath, he stood working for breath, every muscle tensed and coiled with energy. He was a magnificent, volatile, and undeniably virile portrait of anger. Izzy was torn between admiration and fear.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t have it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can\u2019t live in it. She can\u2019t clean it up to sell.\u201d He pounded one fist against his chest, and the small hairs on Izzy\u2019s arms lifted. \u201cI am Ransom William Dacre Vane, the eleventh Duke of Rothbury. This is my castle.\u201d</p> <p>The wolf-dog growled. Tension crackled and filled the great hall, right up to the vaulted ceiling.</p><p>Lord Archer shuffled papers at his leisure. As though furniture hadn\u2019t recently exploded. \u201cYes, well. Duke or not . . . Matters don\u2019t seem to have gone your way recently. Have they, Rothbury?\u201d</p><p>The duke didn\u2019t reply. Unless one counted palpable seething as a reply\u2014in which case, he replied quite fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the papers are clear,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThe castle is Miss Goodnight\u2019s now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d the duke replied. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a man drops off the face of England for seven months, I should think his solicitors begin handling matters.\u201d Archer cast a glance at the long table heaped with unopened envelopes. \u201cMost likely, the information is somewhere in that postal avalanche.\u201d</p><p>Izzy stared at the folio in her hand. She\u2019d arrived with an empty purse and a growling belly. She still had an empty purse and a growling belly. But now she had a castle. And there was a duke in it.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. That\u2019s done. I\u2019ll be off.\u201d After snapping the portmanteau closed, Lord Archer picked up his case and moved as though he would quit the room.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d Izzy lunged after him, catching him by the sleeve. She lowered her voice. \u201cYou mean to just leave me here? Alone, in this . . . this ghostly and ghastly castle? Surely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Goodnight, much as I\u2019d love to spend more time in this charming locale, I\u2019m a very busy man. Lynforth\u2019s estate has me running all over England parceling out these musty heaps of stone to unsuspecting young women. I could offer you a ride back into the village. But surely your driver will come for you soon?\u201d</p><p>Her driver?</p><p>Of course. Lord Archer would never believe her to be destitute\u2014utterly without funds, a home, or transportation. He assumed that her well-sprung carriage and white ponies were just around the corner.</p><p>And unless she meant to sully her father\u2019s memory, exposing him as a neglectful spendthrift, Izzy couldn\u2019t correct the assumption.</p><p>\u201cYes, he will come for me soon,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cDoubt not.\u201d</p><p>Lord Archer looked around at the castle, then at her. His brow arched in amusement.</p><p>And then he did the most unforgivable of things.</p><p>He gave her a patronizing pat on the head. \u201cThat\u2019s little Izzy Goodnight. You do love an adventure.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Well,\u201d Izzy ventured to remark, some minutes into the tense silence Lord Archer had left behind, \u201cthis is an awkward situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwkward.\u201d The duke paced the floor, swinging his arms at his sides. Then he stopped in his tracks and said it again. \u201cAwkward.\u201d</p><p>The word rang through the great hall, bouncing off the ceiling vaults.</p><p>Izzy just stood there. Awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cAdolescence,\u201d he said, \u201cis awkward. Attending a past lover\u2019s wedding is awkward. Making love on horseback is awkward.\u201d</p><p>She was in agreement, so far as the first part. She\u2019d have to take his word on it when it came to the second and third.</p><p>\u201cThis situation is not awkward,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis is treachery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreachery?\u201d She clutched the folio of papers tight. \u201cI\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t do anything treacherous, Your Grace. I didn\u2019t ask Lord Lynforth to leave me a castle. I didn\u2019t know him any better than I know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis castle was never Lynforth\u2019s to give.\u201d His voice was low and stern. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know me at all.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps not. But she wanted to. She couldn\u2019t help it. He was just so intriguing.</p><p>Now that they were alone again, she took the opportunity to study his face. His scar aside, his facial topography was a proud, noble landscape, with strong cheekbones and a wide, square jaw. His hair was tawny, leonine brown with streaks of gold. But his eyes . . . those were Celtic eyes. Dark, horizontal slashes in his face, wide-set. Guarded.</p><p>Those eyes would be difficult to read even if he had perfect eyesight. If not for his trouble with the candle, Izzy might have gone hours without realizing he was blind.</p><p>She had a hundred questions she wanted to ask him. Nay, a thousand. And the stupidest questions of all were the ones that clamored loudest to get out.</p><p>Have you truly made love on horseback? she wanted to ask. How does that even work? Was it how you were injured?</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, I don\u2019t plan to evict you.\u201d She didn\u2019t imagine a man like this could be made to do anything. \u201cI\u2019m not your enemy. Apparently, I\u2019m now your landlady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy landlady,\u201d he echoed, sounding incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYes. And surely we can reach an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn understanding.\u201d</p><p>He strode to the opposite side of the hall, navigating the space and its furnishings with an ease that made Izzy envious. She stumbled more often than he did, and she had functioning eyesight.</p><p>If he\u2019d been recovering in Gostley Castle ever since the injury, he must have worked tirelessly to chart a map of the place in his head. She began to understand why he would be so loath to leave it. Even if he did have finer estates elsewhere, moving houses would mean starting all over again. She didn\u2019t want to be the heartless landowner who forced a blind man from his home.</p><p>He lifted her valise from its resting place near the entry\u2014two steps to the right of the door, as he\u2019d told her earlier. Then he strode the same distance back and set it on the table.</p><p>\u201cUnderstand this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Panic gathered in her chest as she stared at the valise. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t anywhere to go, or any means of getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t believe that. If your father was renowned throughout England\u2014knighted, even\u2014you must have funds. Or if not funds, friends.\u201d</p><p>At his heel, the wolf-dog snarled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in this valise?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my . . .\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not important right now. I\u2019ve told you I won\u2019t ask you to leave, Your Grace. But you can\u2019t force me out, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, can\u2019t I?\u201d He gathered her shawl from its drying place and wadded it into a ball, preparing to stuff it into the valise.</p><p>The dog growled and barked.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is in this thing?\u201d He opened the valise\u2019s latch.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Izzy said, jumping forward. \u201cBe careful. She\u2019s sleeping. If you startle her, you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>With a primal howl of pain, he jerked his hand from the valise. \u201cMother of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Izzy winced. Just as she feared, his finger had a swoop dangling from it. A swoop of slinky, toothy, brown-and-white predator.</p><p>\u201cSnowdrop, no.\u201d</p><p>The dog went mad, jumping and yipping at the snarling creature attacking his master. Ransom cursed and raised his arm, backing in a circle, trying to keep the two animals apart. Snowdrop being Snowdrop, she latched on tighter still.</p><p>\u201cSnowdrop!\u201d Izzy chased circles around the knot of tangling beasts. \u201cSnowdrop, let him go!\u201d</p><p>Finally, she scrambled atop the table and made a wild grab for the duke\u2019s wrist. She latched onto his arm with both of hers, using all her weight to hold him in place.</p><p>And then she paused there, trying to ignore the accidental intimacy of their posture. His shoulder was a stone against her belly. His elbow wedged tight between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cHold still, please,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cThe more you flail, the harder she bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not flailing. I don\u2019t flail.\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t. Clutching his arm this way made her acutely aware of the power in his body. But she was equally aware of another force. His restraint.</p><p>If he chose, he could fling both Izzy and Snowdrop against the wall, just as easily as he\u2019d demolished those chairs.</p><p>She calmed her trembling hands and reached for Snowdrop. With her fingers, she coaxed the animal\u2019s tiny jaws apart. \u201cLet him go, dear. For the sake of us all. Let the duke go.\u201d</p><p>At last, she succeeded in prying Snowdrop free of his savaged, bleeding finger.</p><p>Every living thing in the room exhaled.</p><p>\u201cGood God, Goodnight.\u201d He shook his hand. \u201cWhat is that? A rat?\u201d</p><p>Izzy descended from the table, clutching Snowdrop close to her chest. \u201cNot a rat. She\u2019s an ermine.\u201d</p><p>He swore. \u201cYou carry a weasel in your valise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I carry an ermine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErmine, stoat, weasel. They\u2019re all the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not,\u201d Izzy objected, giving the agitated Snowdrop a soothing rub along her tiny cheek. \u201cWell, perhaps they are\u2014but ermine sounds more dignified.\u201d</p><p>She cradled Snowdrop in one hand and rubbed her belly with the other, then carried her back to the valise and opened the small door in her ball\u2014a spherical cage fashioned of gilded mesh.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow be good.\u201d</p><p>The dog growled at Snowdrop. In response, Snowdrop curled her lip, flashing needlelike teeth.</p><p>\u201cBe good,\u201d Izzy whispered, sharply this time. She turned to the duke. \u201cYour Grace, let me see to your wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind it.\u201d</p><p>Undeterred, she caught him by the wrist and examined his fingertip. \u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount of blood, I\u2019m afraid. You\u2019ll want to clean this. It shouldn\u2019t wait. Perhaps we could . . . Ooh.\u201d</p><p>As she prattled on, he\u2019d picked up his decanter of whisky from the table and poured a liberal stream of the amber spirits right over the oozing bite.</p><p>Izzy winced, just watching.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>She pulled a clean handkerchief from her pocket. \u201cHere. Let me see.\u201d</p><p>As she dabbed at the wound, she studied his hand. Big, strong. Marred with all manner of small cuts and burns\u2014some fresh, others faded. On his third right finger, he wore a gold signet ring. The oval crest was massive. Apparently, dukes did everything writ large. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe wound is still bleeding,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a plaster about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll just apply pressure until the bleeding stops. Allow me. I\u2019ve dealt with this before.\u201d She wadded the handkerchief about his fingertip and pinched hard. \u201cThere. Now we wait a minute or two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold it.\u201d He wrenched away, applying the pressure himself.</p><p>Thus began the longest, most sensually charged minute of Izzy\u2019s life.</p><p>In the past, she\u2019d suffered through many an unrequited infatuation. But she typically lost her wits for pensive scholars in tweed or poets who sported tousled dark curls and woeful airs.</p><p>The Duke of Rothbury was unlike any gentleman she\u2019d ever fancied. He was hard, unyielding, and even before his injury, he didn\u2019t care to read. What was more, they were engaged in a property dispute, and he\u2019d threatened to turn her out into the cold Northumberland night.</p><p>Nevertheless, her stomach was a giddy frolic of crickets and butterflies.</p> <p>He was just so near. And so tall. And so commanding.</p><p>So male.</p><p>Everything female in her was rallying to the challenge. Perhaps this was how mountaineers felt when they stood at the base of a soaring, snow-crested alp. Exhilarated by possibility; awed by the inherent danger. A bit weak in the knees.</p><p>\u201cSnowdrop,\u201d he scoffed, leaning his weight against the table edge. \u201cYou ought to change her name to Lamprey. Who keeps a weasel for a pet, anyhow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gives a weasel as a gift?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of my father\u2019s admirers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should think it was one of his enemies.\u201d</p><p>Izzy joined him in sitting on the table\u2019s edge, resigned to explaining the whole story. It made a good illustration of how her father\u2019s literary success and the public\u2019s adoration never translated into much practical benefit.</p><p>\u201cMy father wrote an ongoing saga of knights, ladies, villains, sorcerers . . . castles. Anything to do with romantic chivalry. And the tales were all framed as bedtime stories told to me. Little Izzy Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Archer was expecting a young girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They always expect a young girl,\u201d she said. \u201cThe heroine of the tales kept an ermine as a pet. A fictional ermine, of course. One that was brave and loyal, and every bit as majestic, pale, and slender-necked as her mistress. And this fictional ermine managed to accomplish all sorts of clever, fierce, fictional deeds, such as chewing her mistress free of bindings when she was kidnapped, for the third time, by the fictional Shadow Knight. So a devotee of my father\u2019s stories thought it would be a lovely gesture to give real-life Izzy Goodnight a real-life ermine to call her very own.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be precious? the fool must have thought. Wouldn\u2019t it be marvelous and adorable?</p><p>Well, no. It wasn\u2019t, actually. Not for Izzy, not for Snowdrop.</p> <p>A real-life ermine did not make a cuddly, brave, loyal pet. Snowdrop was sleek and elegant, yes\u2014particularly when winter turned her thick coat white. But though she weighed a mere half pound, she was a vicious predator. Over the years, Izzy had suffered her share of bites and nips.</p><p>\u201cA stupid gift,\u201d the duke said.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue with his assessment. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t Snowdrop\u2019s fault. She couldn\u2019t help being a weasel. She was born that way. And she was ancient now, near nine years old. Izzy couldn\u2019t just toss her to the wolves\u2014or to the wolf-dogs.</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Lord Lynforth was following a similar impulse. He thought it would be an enchanting gesture to give little Izzy Goodnight a real-life castle of her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want his fanciful gift, feel free to refuse it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but this gift isn\u2019t the same as an ermine. This is property. Don\u2019t you understand how rare that is for a woman? Property always belongs to our fathers, brothers, husbands, sons. We never get to own anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re one of those women with radical ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she returned. \u201cI\u2019m one of those women with nothing. There are a great many of us.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to the floor. \u201cWhen my father died, everything of value passed to my cousin. He inherited my childhood home, all the furnishings in it. Every dish in the cupboard and every book in the library. Even the income from my father\u2019s writings. What do I have to my name? I have Snowdrop.\u201d</p><p>Her hands began to tremble. She couldn\u2019t help it; she was still angry with her father. Angry with him for dying and angry with him for dying this way. All those years she\u2019d helped him, forgoing any life she might build for her own, and he\u2019d never found time to revise his will and provide for Izzy should the worst occur. He was too busy playing the role of doting, storytelling father.</p><p>The duke didn\u2019t seem to appreciate the injustice of her situation. \u201cSo you do have somewhere to go. You have a cousin. He can support you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartin?\u201d She laughed at the suggestion. \u201cHe\u2019s always despised me, ever since we were children. We\u2019re speaking of the same boy who pushed me in a pond when I was eight and stood laughing on the bank while I sputtered and thrashed. He didn\u2019t throw me a rope that day, and he won\u2019t now. There\u2019s only one thing I can do. The same thing I did then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLearn to swim,\u201d she answered. \u201cQuickly.\u201d</p><p>His wide mouth tugged to one side. She couldn\u2019t decide if it was an appreciative half smile or a belittling smirk. Either way, it made her anxious.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, prattling on.\u201d She tilted her head and peeked under his makeshift compress. \u201cI think the bleeding has stopped.\u201d</p><p>With his teeth, he tore a strip of linen from a corner of the handkerchief and wrapped it around his finger, carefully folding under the ends and knotting it tight.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to leave Gostley Castle,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps we can agree on a quarterly rent.\u201d</p><p>Surely the rents on a property this size would be enough to secure her a well-appointed cottage somewhere. Izzy didn\u2019t need much. After several months as an itinerant houseguest, she yearned for the smallest comforts. Curtains, candlesticks. Sleeping beneath linens embroidered with her own monogram.</p><p>Just something, anything, that she could call her own.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s madness,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not paying rent on my own property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this property isn\u2019t yours. Not anymore. The Earl of Lynforth purchased it, and he left it to me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLynforth was gulled. Some swindler must have drawn up false papers just to bilk a dying man out of his money. I employ more than a dozen stewards and solicitors to manage my affairs, and they would not sell property without my consent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you very sure?\u201d Arching her eyebrow, she surveyed the expanse of unopened letters and envelopes. \u201cHow can you know if you haven\u2019t gone through the post in months?\u201d</p><p>She plucked an envelope from the pile and turned it over in her hands. \u201cI could help you read and answer these, if you like. I served as my father\u2019s secretary for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your help.\u201d</p><p>He said it so sharply, she dropped the envelope.</p><p>\u201cLet me give you a little history lesson, since your father was so fond of those. My ancestors were granted a dukedom because they successfully held the Scottish border. For centuries. And they didn\u2019t do that by throwing up their hands and saying, \u2018Very well, then\u2019 whenever someone knocked at the gate and claimed this castle was theirs.\u201d</p><p>Izzy laughed a little. \u201cBut I\u2019m hardly a marauding band of Scotsmen. And we aren\u2019t living in the sixteenth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. We have laws and courts. So if you mean to stake a claim on this castle, go find a solicitor. Have him look over the papers and write to my solicitors. The two can argue back and forth. Chancery will hear the case eventually. Perhaps as soon as three years from now. That\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>Three years?</p><p>Izzy didn\u2019t have three years. If forced to leave, she wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d manage for the next three days. And she didn\u2019t have money for solicitors\u2014much less solicitors qualified to take on a duke.</p><p>She had no choice but to stand her ground. Behave as though the place was hers. If he succeeded in removing her today, she would never get her toe in the door again.</p><p>\u201cIf your solicitors would care to come here and examine the documents, they are welcome. But I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d The unscarred half of his brow furrowed. If he could properly glare at her, Izzy surmised, he\u2019d be giving her a glare hard enough to chip diamonds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use being stern,\u201d she told him. \u201cGlower all you like, but for heaven\u2019s sake, you gathered me into your arms and carried me in from the rain. I could swoon all over again just thinking of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mistake that for chivalry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPracticality. I couldn\u2019t have simply left you there. You would have attracted vermin.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOh, dear. All this and a sense of humor, too.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, no one had given him a compliment lately. He looked as though he\u2019d been thrown a grenade. Or a wet kitten.</p><p>He might be wealthy, powerful, angry, and big. But on at least one score, Izzy had him outmatched. Buoyancy. She knew how to handle prickly creatures, and she knew how to make the best of a less-than-ideal situation.</p><p>When thrown in the pond, she learned how to swim.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t such a quandary as it seems,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to stay. I want to stay. Until the legal matters are settled, we\u2019ll share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, share. This is a vast castle, built to house hundreds of people. I\u2019ll just take a spare tower or wing for my own. You won\u2019t even notice me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close. \u201cOh, I\u2019d notice you, Miss Goodnight. I\u2019d notice you. There\u2019s no castle big enough to keep a man like me from being aware, every moment, of a woman like you. You don\u2019t have to speak a word. I can hear the rustle of your petticoats. I can smell the scent of your skin. I can feel your heat.\u201d</p><p>Heavens. If he could sense her heat, he must feel it right now. She was hot everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Lord Archer,\u201d he went on in that low, seductive rumble. \u201cI\u2019ve never read your father\u2019s soppy stories, and you\u2019re not some little girl to me. I\u2019ve run my hands all over your body. And these hands have an excellent memory.\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . goodness.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known. She couldn\u2019t have known, sheltered as she\u2019d lived, and he couldn\u2019t have guessed. But he\u2019d just articulated everything she\u2019d been wanting for so long. To be noticed. Not merely known as a girl in some precious stories, but noticed, as a woman.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re mad if you think I\u2019ll back down from this now.\u201d</p><p>They stood in tense silence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said, at length. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving this place the same way you came in.\u201d</p><p>He ducked, caught her by the legs, and threw her over his shoulder\u2014with the ease of a man who\u2019d tossed many a woman over his shoulder. This was definitely not his first go at lady-tossing.</p><p>But it was definitely Izzy\u2019s first time being tossed, and she had no idea how to respond. Beat her fists against his back? Kick and scream? Later, she\u2019d think of a dozen things. Witty retorts and clever rejoinders. Right now, all the blood was rushing to her head, and her mind was a hot, throbbing blank. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He bounced her weight, plumping her backside with his forearm. \u201cThere\u2019s so little to you.\u201d</p><p>The dismissive words jarred her tongue loose.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal to me, Your Grace. More than you know. More than anyone supposes. You can carry me outside, if you like. I\u2019ll come back in. Again, and again. As many times as it takes. Because this is my castle now. And I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Ransom shook his head. A brave speech, for a tiny scrap of a woman currently slung over his shoulder. Miss Goodnight could say whatever she wished. The truth of it was, she was a defenseless, near-penniless, unmarried woman, and he was a duke. The decisions were his to make.</p><p>What remained of his logic\u2014and that smarting finger on his right hand\u2014insisted she was a problem. With his impaired vision, Ransom depended on an elaborate mental map of the place. That map included every room, every stair, every stone. It did not have room for scampering weasels or distracting, tempting women.</p><p>She needed to leave.</p><p>But now that he had her in his grasp again, with her breasts pressed against his back and her sweetly rounded bottom resting on his forearm, other parts of him\u2014parts located far from his brain\u2014were making other suggestions. Dangerous suggestions.</p> <p>Which meant she really needed to leave.</p><p>Even before his injuries, he didn\u2019t allow women close. Oh, he took a great many women to bed. But he always paid them handsomely for the indulgence\u2014with pleasure, gold, or both\u2014and then he bid them farewell. He never woke beside them in the morning.</p><p>The one\u2014and only\u2014time he\u2019d sought a more lasting arrangement, it hadn\u2019t ended well. He\u2019d landed here in this decrepit castle, blinded and broken.</p><p>But then, there was a part of him\u2014a withered, neglected corner of his soul\u2014that had grown painfully aware of how small and alone she was. And that for all her brave words, she was trembling.</p><p>Good Lord, Goodnight. What do I do with you?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let her occupy this castle. Any sort of \u201csharing\u201d arrangement was out of the question. But was this truly all that was left of him? A cruel, unfeeling brute who would cast a defenseless young woman out into the night?</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want to believe that. Not yet. He didn\u2019t surrender anything lightly, and that included what few shards remained of his broken soul.</p><p>He set Miss Goodnight back on her feet. As he lowered her to the floor, her body slid down his, like a raindrop easing down the surface of a rock.</p><p>Ransom knew he\u2019d regret the words he was about to speak. Because they were the decent thing to do, and if there was one thing he\u2019d learned in his life, it was that every time he did the decent thing, he paid for it later.</p><p>\u201cOne night. You can stay one night.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been a fool to waste all that time arguing legalities. The castle itself would do the convincing. Once she\u2019d spent a night in Gostley Castle, she wouldn\u2019t be able to run away fast enough.</p><p>Miss Isolde Goodnight was about to have a Very Bad Night indeed.</p><p>You can stay one night.</p><p>Izzy could have whooped with triumph, but she restrained herself.</p> <p>Instead, she stepped back, smoothing her skirts and hair. Her cheeks burned, but at least he couldn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cJust one night,\u201d the duke said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m only agreeing to that much because I expect one night in this place will be enough for you.\u201d</p><p>It was a small victory, admittedly, but it was a start.</p><p>\u201cCome along, then. I\u2019ll show you to a room. My manservant will bring your things later.\u201d</p><p>Izzy followed him out of the great hall and up a spiraling flight of stairs. The closeness of the stairwell made her shudder. Once darkness fell, these stone stairways and corridors would feel like a tomb.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want the finest chamber, no doubt. Since you seem to believe it\u2019s your castle now.\u201d</p><p>They emerged into a long corridor. Heavy steps carried him down the center of it. He didn\u2019t count aloud, but she could feel him taking the measurements in his head. His mastery of the space was a marvel.</p><p>At last he stopped, then made a brisk quarter turn.</p><p>\u201cHere you are. I expect this will suit.\u201d</p><p>When Izzy peered inside, she was surprised to find a richly furnished chamber. A massive bed occupied one half of it, situated on a raised dais with mahogany posts soaring nearly to the ceiling. Velvet and tapestries hung on all sides. The rest of the furniture didn\u2019t consist of much\u2014a chair with a caved-in seat, a few abandoned traveling trunks, and a dressing table covered in dust an inch thick. A gallery of arched Gothic windows lined the far wall, but the glass had been broken out of nearly all of them.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, struggling to take in the room\u2019s decrepit state. \u201cMy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it all in,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cView the full splendor of your supposed inheritance. Until I arrived some months ago, no one had resided in this place for decades. It\u2019s been looted thoroughly. There are only a few furnished rooms, all of them in states of decay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m grateful this many furnishings have survived.\u201d Izzy moved into the room. A patterned carpet covered the floor. A threadbare one, but to have lasted this long, it must have been well made. \u201cJust look at this bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight paces wide. Big enough for a duke and a half dozen women, besides. Makes a man yearn for the medieval ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for sleeping,\u201d she told him. \u201cAt least, it wasn\u2019t for . . . that. This would have been the castle\u2019s great chamber. The medieval lords conducted business from these beds, the way kings sit on thrones. That\u2019s why it\u2019s raised on a platform and built to such an impressive size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was an expert on these things.\u201d Izzy approached the bed, peering at the hangings. She pulled a face. \u201cIt looks as though the moths have feasted on these tapestries. What a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And the rats have had their way with the mattress.\u201d</p><p>Rats? Izzy jumped back. She put her hands over her face and peered through her fingers at the bed enclosed by shredded hangings. Yes, the mattress had been disemboweled\u2014its straw and horsehair contents strewn about and arranged into . . .</p><p>Oh, goodness, those could be nests.</p><p>If she stared hard enough, she could have sworn she saw the rotted straw moving.</p><p>She forced herself to say, \u201cSnowdrop will be happy. And very well fed.\u201d A distant moaning startled her. \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cProbably one of the ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a borderlands castle, Miss Goodnight. If you know about castles, you should know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Gostley Castle\u2019s original purpose would have been to quell Scottish rebellion. Quelling rebellion meant capturing rebels\u2014and not to keep them as houseguests. There was no telling how many people had been imprisoned in this castle, even tortured and killed, over the centuries. By the duke\u2019s own ancestors, no less.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in ghosts,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cGive it a night.\u201d</p><p>Night. It would be nightfall soon. Izzy\u2019s stomach twisted in a knot at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re pleased with your accommodations.\u201d He leaned one shoulder against the archway. \u201c \u2018Pleased\u2019 isn\u2019t the word.\u201d</p><p>The word was something more like \u201chorrified.\u201d The thought of spending the night in this room reduced her insides to a quivering, whimpering puddle.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t let on. That was just the reaction he hoped for. He wanted her to run away.</p><p>This would have to be home for tonight. Rats and moths and all.</p><p>She forced an enthusiasm she didn\u2019t quite feel. \u201cI\u2019m sure this will make an enchanting bedchamber, with a bit of work and imagination. The proportions are majestic. The bed only wants a new mattress and hangings.\u201d She walked to the row of windows. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lovely view of the sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor those who can view it.\u201d</p><p>Izzy winced, regretting her insensitive comment. \u201cI could describe it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019ve seen sunsets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen this sunset.\u201d</p><p>The prospect from the window was breathtaking. The cloud-covered sky had fragmented into puffs of gray, alternating with swatches of vibrant blue and rosy orange. From this vantage, one could see the castle walls rambling through romantic evening mists that curled all the way from the sea.</p><p>\u201cThe sun is setting just beyond the tower. But \u2018setting\u2019 is the wrong word for this. Too peaceful. This sun is struggling. Going down like a bloodied fighter in the jaws of a great, stony beast.\u201d</p><p>Heavy footsteps carried him to stand behind her. \u201cHas it disappeared yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. One final flash of gold, as it slips into the beyond, and . . .\u201d She released her breath. \u201cThere. It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rule about sunsets in this castle, Miss Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He turned her to face him. \u201cAnd a man and a woman standing in this very place are compelled to heed it. No choice. There\u2019s only one thing to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Her pulse stumbled. Surely he couldn\u2019t mean to . . .</p><p>He lowered his head and made his voice a seductive whisper. \u201cDuck.\u201d</p><p>Duck?</p><p>She was still blinking at him in confusion when a strange sound tugged her attention aside. It sounded like . . . a great amount of wet laundry, flapping on the line in a stiff breeze.</p><p>She turned away from the window.</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>Before her eyes, the vast bed canopy seemed to come alive. First, it began to shimmer, then to ripple\u2014like a quicksilver cloak caught by the wind.</p><p>Then small pieces of it began to break away, one by one, each following the other.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d She stiffened. \u201cThose can\u2019t be . . .\u201d</p><p>They were.</p><p>Bats.</p><p>An entire colony of them had been roosting in the highest reaches of the canopy. Now they took wing one by one, then ten by ten . . . and then hundreds all at once.</p><p>She turned\u2014just in time to see another black, swarming cloud pouring down the chimney. There must have been thousands.</p><p>And all of them were flooding straight for the windows.</p><p>\u201cDuck,\u201d he repeated. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately react, the duke wrapped his arms about her and hauled her toward the floor.</p><p>In seconds, the bats were everywhere, swarming above them in a roiling black cloud. Izzy ducked her head and took the shelter he offered. His chin tucked hard on her head, and she could feel his whiskers rasping against her scalp.</p><p>And through it all, his heart pounded, strong and steady. She clutched his shirt in both hands, burying her face in that constant rhythm, until it was all she could hear. No flapping. No screeching. Just thump-thump-thump.</p><p>At last, he lifted his head.</p><p>Izzy did the same. \u201cI thought you said this was the best room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all out. Won\u2019t be back until morning. It\u2019s safe now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, it was anything but safe. Now it was nightfall, and she was stuck in this haunted, infested castle. In the arms of this tormenting, intriguing, devious duke. She didn\u2019t know what to do with him. She didn\u2019t even know what to do with herself.</p><p>Flailing her hands and stammering were all that came to mind. Neither idea seemed useful in the least.</p><p>And then . . . she felt a little scratching sensation.</p><p>Just behind her ear.</p><p>And all she could do was shriek.</p><p>Ransom was just about to release her when she latched onto him with sudden force.</p><p>\u201cHelp me.\u201d Her whisper trembled. Her body did, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cB-b-bat.\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled despite himself. \u201cThe b-b-bats are all gone, Miss Goodnight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re not. There\u2019s one caught in my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in your hair. That\u2019s an old wives\u2019 tale. Bats don\u2019t get caught in people\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere. Is. One. In. My. Hair,\u201d she pronounced in distinct syllables, each word rising a halftone in inflection. And then, in one frantic high-pitched squeal: \u201cGetitout!\u201d</p><p>To be sure, bats didn\u2019t normally get caught in people\u2019s hair. But he\u2019d forgotten, hers wasn\u2019t normal hair. This curly mane of hers could snare a rabbit. Perhaps a horse.</p><p>Ransom worried, as he plunged his fingers into her dense, wavy locks, that this hair could possibly ensnare him.</p> <p>It had his curiosity entangled, that was certain. These locks must be dark. She sounded dark-haired, with that sultry voice, and most girls with hair this aggressively curly were dark. And if her hair was dark, her eyes were probably dark, too.</p><p>Before he could quash it, an image bloomed in his mind\u2019s eye. A raven-haired, dark-eyed beauty with plump, red lips.</p><p>\u201cKeep still,\u201d he said.</p><p>That goes for you, too, he told the stirrings in his groin.</p><p>He wove his fingers into her roots near the scalp and shook the curls apart. \u201cDid that free it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s still there. I can feel it.\u201d A shudder ran through her.</p> <p>\u201cI see how it is. You\u2019re a strong, independent woman of property. Right up to the moment something creeping or crawling comes along. Then it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, dear! Oh, help!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She growled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s small,\u201d he told her, having found the thing. \u201cNo bigger than a titmouse. Far more frightened of you than you are of it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhy do people always say that? It\u2019s never helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you to distract yourself by focusing on my face, but that wouldn\u2019t help. You swooned the last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t swoon because of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>He made a shushing noise and worked his fingers downward, separating and shaking free the tangled hair. He didn\u2019t want to hear her explanations or apologies.</p><p>With his free hand, he held her shoulder. He stroked his thumb up and down, soothing.</p> <p>Just to keep her still, he told himself.</p><p>Not because he cared.</p><p>He wanted her fearful. He wanted her to run away from this place, and from him. The way any young woman with sense would do.</p><p>He most definitely didn\u2019t want her to stay in his arms, warm and trusting, with her heart beating faster than a bat\u2019s wings.</p><p>He felt the moment the bat untangled itself and flapped free. The weight was gone from her hair, and now the unburdened locks filled his hand, soft and wild and sensual.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s flown away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew that would happen,\u201d she accused. \u201cThe sunset. The bats.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to deny it. \u201cConsider it repayment for the weasel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you . . . You . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel bastard?\u201d he suggested. \u201cHeartless rogue? Blackguard? Villain? I\u2019ve been called all of the above and more. My favorite is \u2018knave.\u2019 Fine word, \u2018knave.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ill-mannered wretch I importuned one rainy afternoon and then never pestered again.\u201d She pushed away from him and rose to her feet. \u201cYou can keep all the bats to yourself. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Really? She was leaving already?</p><p>This was almost too easy.</p><p>Ransom followed her out of the room and back down the corridor, to the stairs that led down to the great hall.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t leave this very moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least wait until my manservant returns. I can give you a bit of money, and he can find you a coach in the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a coach or money. I\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know some people in Newcastle. Newcastle can\u2019t be that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not far at all. Just . . . some twenty-five miles or so.\u201d</p><p>She paused midstep. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be walking for some time. I had better get started.\u201d</p><p>He followed her toward the entryway. Walking to Newcastle, his eye. What the hell was she thinking? Perhaps those fairy tales she\u2019d grown up with had rotted her brain. Was she planning to skip through the woodlands and meadows, plucking mushroom caps for parasols and letting friendly woodland animals guide her way?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think this is over,\u201d she informed him as she gathered up her caged weasel and valise. \u201cYou were right, I do have many friends. Influential friends. There are thousands of people scattered all over England who\u2019d love nothing more than to have little Izzy Goodnight as a houseguest. Some of them are surely solicitors.\u201d He heard the rustle of papers. \u201cSo I will be in contact with Mr. . . . Blaylock and Mr. Riggett, and I\u2019ll see you at Chancery in three years. Farewell, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>As she breezed past him, his arm shot out. He snagged her by the elbow.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast. What do you know of Blaylock and Riggett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir names are on the deed. I told you, I served as my father\u2019s secretary. I do know how to read a legal document. Now, if you\u2019ll kindly release me, I will bid you a not-very-fond farewell.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened on her arm. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ransom kept a firm grip on Miss Goodnight\u2019s arm. After what she\u2019d just said, he wasn\u2019t letting her go anywhere. Not tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused, Your Grace. You just put a great deal of effort into scaring me off.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had. But that was before he heard the names of his own most trusted solicitors fall from his lips. Blaylock and Riggett had been his men of business for years. They had power to manage everything in his absence. But they should never sign away a property without his knowledge and consent.</p><p>Something was going on. Ransom didn\u2019t know what it was, but he knew he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cYour efforts worked, Your Grace. Congratulations. I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019ve no desire whatsoever to spend a single night in that horrid room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little hiccup of laughter. \u201cAre you conceding your claim of ownership and forfeiting the property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not offering to host you as a guest in my house, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I fail to see what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offering you a post. As my secretary.\u201d</p><p>The silence with which she received this news was stony.</p><p>Hell, Ransom wasn\u2019t happy about it, either. But with those two words\u2014\u201cBlaylock\u201d and \u201cRiggett\u201d\u2014she\u2019d made it painfully clear that he needed someone to go read his correspondence for him. He had estates and responsibilities. If his solicitors were mismanaging his affairs in his absence, thousands would be affected. He needed to unravel just what was going on.</p><p>\u201cI will hire you to read through my correspondence for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s hardly the ideal arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder ordinary circumstances, I would never entrust a woman with the task. But time is of the essence, and there\u2019s no one else around.\u201d</p><p>He heard her inhale slowly.</p><p>\u201cI mean to compensate you handsomely,\u201d he said. \u201cFifty pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPer annum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPer day.\u201d</p><p>That breath she\u2019d inhaled whooshed out of her.</p><p>\u201cThink on it. You seem to have wits, if not the best ideas on how to apply them. Chances are, the answer to our little property dispute is somewhere in that pile of paper. When we confirm that the castle is still mine, you\u2019ll have the money to go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>He could sense her softening.</p><p>Or maybe his senses deceived him.</p><p>\u201cOne hundred,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want one hundred a day. I\u2019ll use it to fix up the castle once it\u2019s confirmed to be mine.\u201d A coy note crept into her voice. \u201cAnd I want you to say please.\u201d</p><p>He gave her arm a swift tug, drawing her to him.</p><p>She collided with his chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d he said low. \u201cYou need money. We both need answers. The arrangement makes sense for us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen release my arm. And ask nicely.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head until he felt a stray curl of her hair against his cheek. \u201cTwo hundred. Two hundred pounds per day is a very nice sum indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaying \u2018please\u2019 costs you nothing.\u201d</p><p>He kept silent, refusing to relent. If she was going to be his employee, she needed to learn that he alone gave the orders.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAre you truly so afraid of asking for help? It\u2019s that terrifying?\u201d</p><p>He balked. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you saying that.\u201d She pressed a hand to his shirtfront. \u201cBut this frantic, pounding thing in your chest is saying otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Little minx.</p><p>There was exactly one reason his blood was pounding, and it had nothing to do with \u201cplease.\u201d It had to do with \u201cyes\u201d and \u201dGod, yes\u201d and \u201cjust like that, but harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d The familiar voice came from the entryway. \u201cI seem to be interrupting.\u201d</p><p>Duncan.</p><p>Ransom gave himself a shake. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s obvious, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Obvious, and worrisome. It was a testament to this woman\u2019s effect on him that Ransom hadn\u2019t even noticed his valet\u2019s return.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I would say this, Your Grace, but it\u2019s strangely heartening to see you back to your old debauchery. I\u2019ll clear out of your way for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Miss Goodnight jumped to insist. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t misunderstand. This isn\u2019t debauchery. I was just lea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan, this is Miss Isolde Goodnight. My new secretary. Tomorrow, we will find her new lodgings. But tonight, she will stay here. She\u2019ll need a clean, comfortable room, a proper bath, and a hot dinner.\u201d He gave her wrist a squeeze before releasing it. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Izzy had always been raised to believe that \u201cplease\u201d was a magic word.</p><p>She\u2019d been misled.</p><p>Apparently, the magic word was \u201cdinner.\u201d In addition, the words \u201cbath\u201d and \u201ccomfortable room\u201d had their own particular charms. When spoken in quick succession, they had the power of an incantation. Izzy hadn\u2019t been able to say no.</p><p>\u201cI hope this will do for tonight, Miss Goodnight.\u201d Duncan showed her into a small, sparsely furnished chamber. \u201cI know it\u2019s meager, but it\u2019s the only proper bed in the castle. My own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow generous of you to offer it.\u201d And how strange, that it would be the only one. \u201cThe duke doesn\u2019t have a bedchamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Duncan sighed, as if to communicate that this was a point of frequent contention. \u201cHe sleeps in the great hall.\u201d</p><p>Izzy studied the manservant. He was tall and lean, with dark hair turned silver at the temples. Unlike the duke, he was turned out in a brushed black coat, a crisp neckcloth, and gleaming boots.</p><p>\u201cSo you are Rothbury\u2019s valet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Though it pains me to say it when his appearance is so willfully slovenly. It\u2019s an embarrassment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long have you been living here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven months, miss. Seven long months.\u201d</p><p>Heavens. Seven months was a long time. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow was the duke injured?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss Goodnight, I have served the family since before His Grace was even born. I am bound, by duty and honor, to avoid any gossip about my employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Forgive the liberty. But I had to ask.\u201d</p><p>Izzy supposed she would have to get the story from the duke herself.</p> <p>Over the course of several trips, Duncan brought up her valise, a tray of simple, yet hearty food, a ewer of warm water, and a basin.</p><p>\u201cIt is paining me, Miss Goodnight, that I cannot offer you finer accommodations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. This is lovely.\u201d Anything was lovely, compared to that chamber of horrors with the bats.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating. After long months of having my every attempt at proper valet service rebuffed, finally, we have a guest at Gostley Castle. A guest who ought to be cause for a proper guest suite and a seven-course dinner.\u201d He dropped his voice to an unnecessary whisper. \u201cYou are the Miss Izzy Goodnight, am I correct?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019ve heard of me. The duke hadn\u2019t. He said he isn\u2019t a reader.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he isn\u2019t. And wasn\u2019t. Neither am I, for that matter. I only had one year of schooling. But the housekeeper used to read your father\u2019s installments in the servant quarters. The Shadow Knight? Cressida and Ulric? Can you tell me anything?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head sadly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me the liberty. But I had to ask.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Everyone had secrets. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>He left and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Once she was alone, Izzy tried to make herself comfortable.</p> <p>Snowdrop, of course, might as well have died and gone to heaven. This castle, with its ready supply of rodents, was the little beast\u2019s equivalent of a stay at London\u2019s finest hotel.</p><p>As she went about undressing and plaiting her hair, she recalled the sensation of the duke\u2019s hands tangling through it. The prickling tension between their bodies as they\u2019d ducked together, hiding from the bats.</p><p>She still felt that tension simmering within her now.</p><p>He\u2019s not attracted to you, she told herself. He just wanted to intimidate her, and besides\u2014any flirtations he might engage in were predicated on a misunderstanding. He wouldn\u2019t be interested if he had his eyesight.</p><p>Before climbing into the narrow bed, she lit a stumpy taper with her flint, then fixed it on the floor with a dab of wax.</p><p>It was going to be a cold, lonely night. Izzy steeled herself to withstand it.</p><p>She\u2019d been given the deed to this castle. Now she had to stake her claim to it, earn her place as its mistress. And she would. Excepting her clothes and a set of seed-pearl earrings left to her by Aunt Lilith, Gostley Castle was the first thing worth more than a pound or two that Izzy had ever owned outright.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to give that up.</p> <p>Tonight, no bat, rat, ghost, or wounded duke would frighten her.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t escape the dark.</p><p>It was childish to be afraid of the dark. As a grown woman, Izzy understood this. She knew it with her mind, and she felt it with her soul\u2014but her gut. Oh, her gut could never quite be convinced. Much less her heart, which woke her with the sort of pounding that could drive nails.</p><p>She sat bolt upright in her bed, disoriented and sweating, despite the cold. Her candle must have burned itself out. All was black. A thick, oppressive sea of black without so much as a sliver of moonlight to sail by.</p><p>Her eyes strained, peering in every direction, unable to settle on any spark or shadow but unable to give up the search. She fumbled about for her flint and came up empty. Where had she left the dratted thing?</p><p>How she hated this. Her fear, and how stupid it made her. Yesterday, she\u2019d made a journey to Northumberland by herself, taken possession of a medieval fortress, and held her ground against a scarred, angry duke. She ought to feel like a strong woman, by any measure. But in the dark of the night, she was always\u2014always\u2014nine years old and terrified.</p><p>Distant memories came clawing back. She swallowed, and her throat felt raw. As if she\u2019d spent hours screaming.</p><p>She began to tremble. Drat.</p><p>Izzy tucked her knees more tightly to her chest and wrapped her arms around them, curling into a tight ball.</p><p>What o\u2019clock was it? She hoped that she\u2019d managed to sleep the majority of the night before waking, but in her bones she felt it was probably only midnight or some short time past. An eternity before dawn. Every heartbeat drawn into a lifetime. She would huddle here for hours and hours, staring into the black and feeling pure agony.</p><p>Just this night, she told herself. You only have to last this one night. And it will never be this bad again.</p><p>Then she heard it.</p><p>No ghostly moaning or groaning. Just a light, rhythmic scraping. Back, then forth.</p><p>Back . . . then forth. Raising every hair on her arms.</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>Izzy knew she had a choice. She could hide in her bedchamber and cower for the rest of the night, sleepless and miserable. Or she could go investigate. If she truly meant to stay in this castle, she needed to be its mistress.</p><p>She left her room on trembling legs, feeling her way down the spiraling stairs and into the main corridor. The scraping sound continued.</p><p>She moved toward it.</p><p>Probably just a branch or shutter moving in the wind, she told herself. Definitely not a ghost. Nor snakes. Nor the hanged body of a border rebel, left dangling from a rafter until it wasted and decayed to mere bones, swaying back and forth just enough that the toe bones scraped the floors. Leaving grooves in the stone, after centuries.</p><p>She stopped and shook herself. She could hear her father now.</p><p>God\u2019s blood, Izzy. You have the most gruesome imagination.</p><p>Yes, she did. It was a blessing on occasion, but in the dark, it was always a curse.</p><p>She moved along the corridor, hastening toward that faint yet promising red glow from the great hall. There was light and heat there. The fire in the hearth had to be burning still\u2014the duke had placed a small tree on it earlier, plus the remnants of the two splintered chairs.</p><p>All she needed was a bit of light. Once Izzy could see a little\u2014just a little\u2014she would feel so much better about everything. That was always the case.</p><p>She tiptoed into the great hall and peered hard toward the hearth. She glimpsed an unlit taper in a candlestick, perched atop the mantel.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>She padded across the floor, reaching for the candlestick. The thing weighed thirty pounds if it weighed an ounce. Giving up on the brass holder, she wrested the candle loose and lit it in the fire.</p><p>Glowing candle in hand, she could breathe easier. She stood in place for a solid minute, doing just that. Breathing.</p><p>\u201cMiss Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>Izzy jumped in her skin. She nearly dropped the candle.</p><p>\u201cMaking your escape already?\u201d he asked dryly. \u201cCan\u2019t even last one night?\u201d</p><p>She turned, gathering the open neck of her nightrail with one hand. There the duke stood, not five paces away, still fully dressed. Apparently, he\u2019d been awake. And walking. That must have been the sound she heard\u2014his footsteps, brushing over stone.</p><p>\u201cNo, I . . . I\u2019m not escaping at all.\u201d She tried to sound breezy. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo scared, I gather.\u201d He slid a flask into his coat pocket.</p><p>\u201cToo excited,\u201d she lied. \u201cI\u2019ve inherited a whole castle, and I\u2019ve barely seen any of it yet. I\u2019m keen to explore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the dead of night? Return to your chamber. You can\u2019t traipse about the place in the dark. It\u2019s not safe for you.\u201d</p><p>She moved to his side. \u201cDo you mean to join me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not safe, either,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Nevertheless, he put a hand on the small of her back, following close as she left the great hall and began to climb the stairs. At the top of the staircase, she turned down the corridor, retreating toward her chamber. She thought.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve already turned the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>Izzy stayed quiet, determined not to admit fault. \u201cI\u2019m not lost. I\u2019m exploring.\u201d</p><p>He made a disbelieving noise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m not afraid of rats. The bats are gone for now. And I don\u2019t believe ghosts are real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe I\u2019m real?\u201d he asked.</p><p>If she were honest, Izzy had her doubts. He seemed so larger-than-life. Even she, with her wild imagination, had never dreamed up anyone quite like the Duke of Rothbury.</p><p>As they moved down the corridor, his hand never left her waist. Her skin burned beneath his touch.</p><p>She poked her candle into a series of cavernous, mostly empty rooms. \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll make a thorough search of these and choose another to make my bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you propose to do that? You\u2019ll need fabrics, furnishings, servants. I\u2019m not advancing you any wages. You haven\u2019t any funds.\u201d</p><p>A sad truth. Izzy had considered that, of course. \u201cWhile I\u2019m making my survey tomorrow, I\u2019ll catalog any items of value. Surely there\u2019s something in this place worth selling.\u201d</p><p>His denial was swift. \u201cIf there were anything worth selling, it would have been looted ages ago. There\u2019s nothing of value here. Nothing worth saving.\u201d</p><p>Nothing of value? Nothing worth saving?</p><p>He didn\u2019t include himself in that assessment, did he?</p><p>Concerned, she turned to look at him. The flickering glow of the candle danced over the handsome planes on the left side of his face. But the scar on his right side defied illumination, shunned the taper\u2019s golden warmth. At night, his wound appeared even wider, more dramatic.</p><p>It looked unhealed.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI know every inch of this castle,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the lowest cellar to the highest tower.\u201d</p><p>A small, darkened arch beckoned to her left. Her eye was drawn to it, and to the coy whisper of a staircase beyond. A naughty little pigtail of intrigue, spiraling out of view.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an arch to the side,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you know the castle backward and forward, what\u2019s up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four stairs and a circular room at the top, some six paces across.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy,\u201d Izzy said, impressed. \u201cThat was a very specific answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount for yourself if you doubt me.\u201d</p><p>She left his side and followed that small, curling staircase up and up, lighting the way with her candle. The way was narrow, and even as slight-figured as Izzy was, she had to climb at an oblique angle. Broad-shouldered Rothbury fell behind.</p><p>\u201cThirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three . . .\u201d</p><p>He was right. Exactly thirty-four steps later, she emerged into a small, round room. There were no bats. No rats. No ghosts. Just a single slit of a window. She crossed the uneven stone floor in cautious steps and poked her head through the rectangular opening.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh, her heart.</p><p>She had to press a hand to her chest to keep it from jumping out of her body and crashing to the ground below.</p><p>How glorious.</p><p>The turret was high above the castle, offering a view unimpeded by trees or hills. A patch of sky had cleared just overhead. She was floating among the stars.</p><p>Glowing taper in hand, she could almost imagine she was a star. Isolated. Insignificant amid the multitudes. Yet every bit as afire with heat and heart.</p><p>Strange, how contemplating the vastness made her feel a little less alone. From far enough away, on some other world, perhaps she would appear to be part of a constellation.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d She spoke the words aloud, so there could be no taking them back. \u201cThis is mine. I don\u2019t care about the bats, the rats, the ghosts. This turret is going to be my bedchamber, and this castle will be my home.\u201d</p><p>The duke joined her, having climbed the thirty-fourth stair. \u201cFor the last time, you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She looked around the room. \u201cIs the turret structurally unsound?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. The peril isn\u2019t from crumbling walls. It\u2019s not from rats or bats or even ghosts.\u201d Skimming his fingers along the wall, he circled the turret perimeter, until his fingers just grazed her arm. \u201cIt comes from me.\u201d</p><p>He was a large man and a strong one. If he truly wanted to hurt her, there would be little Izzy could do about it.</p><p>But in her heart, she just didn\u2019t believe he would.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. But he\u2019d declined to hurt a weasel, and that seemed to say volumes more.</p><p>\u201cMiss Goodnight, I\u2019m a man who has spent a great deal of time in solitude. You\u2019re a defenseless, tempting woman. Do I have to spell it out for you? You\u2019re in D-A-N . . . ger.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a laugh. \u201cYour spelling is a bit scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ravish you.\u201d</p><p>He said it so solemnly. Now she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p> <p>His brow furrowed. \u201cYou think I\u2019m joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not laughing at you. Forgive me. I don\u2019t doubt your skill at ravishing women. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re quite accomplished at . . . at ravishing. Expert, even. I laughed because no one\u2019s ever threatened to ravish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t believe that. With this hair?\u201d His touch drifted to her neck. \u201cAnd this softness? You have the voice of a temptress.\u201d</p><p>What Izzy had was the beginnings of a cold, and she could have told him so. She could have explained that there was a very logical reason she\u2019d never been in danger of ravishment, and it was because she was plain.</p><p>But was she truly plain, here and now? With a blind man, in the dark?</p><p>If he was tempted . . .</p> <p>Didn\u2019t that make her a temptress?</p><p>She\u2019d always envied beautiful women. Not solely for the beauty itself but because when attributes were parceled out by whatever deity assigned them, beauty seemed to come tethered to confidence. She craved that more than anything.</p><p>He swept a touch up her spine, and his hand brushed aside her plaited hair to settle on her bare neck.</p><p>A rush of power went through her, magnificent and intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cWho lets a woman like this go untested?\u201d He caressed her nape. \u201cI won\u2019t believe no man\u2019s tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know how it is,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cIt must be the stunning degree of my beauty. It puts them off.\u201d Surely, he would catch her joking tone. And if he did take her to be serious . . . Whom could it possibly hurt? \u201cI suppose all the gentlemen are intimidated.\u201d</p><p>His thumb rubbed over her lips. \u201cI\u2019m not intimidated.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she didn\u2019t feel quite so bold.</p> <p>\u201cGoodness, think of the hour,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to set about improving this place tomorrow, I suppose tonight I ought to return to my\u2014\u201d</p><p>A drop of molten wax rolled downward, singeing her hand. Izzy dropped the candle. The flame was extinguished before it even hit the floor.</p><p>The turret was instantly plunged into darkness.</p><p>Her heartbeat began to race. Oh, drat. And just when she\u2019d been holding her own with him. So much for being a woman in his eyes. So much for being his temptress. He\u2019d laugh at her if he knew how she felt. How could this little girl hold a claim to any castle? She was a ninny who swooned in the rain and shrieked at bats and quivered helplessly in the dark.</p><p>Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t notice the quivering part.</p><p>His hands went to her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>Drat, drat, drat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just dropped the candle, that\u2019s all. If you\u2019d just be so good as . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cAs to show me back downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. The bottom dropped out of her stomach. He was going to leave her here. Alone. In this tiny room, up thirty-four steps, in the miserable, moving blackness. And that would teach her, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>But he didn\u2019t leave her. Instead, he took her in his arms.</p><p>And pulled her close.</p><p>Izzy didn\u2019t know how to resist. Those strong hands . . . they were her only anchor in the spinning dark. She was reeling with surprise, so very frightened.</p><p>Then suddenly . . .</p><p>She was so very kissed.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Ransom kissed her.</p><p>Framed her face in his hands, held her still, and claimed her lips with his own. No prelude, no finesse. Just a strong, unyielding press of his lips against hers.</p><p>She needed to understand a few things, and he was done trying to explain them with words.</p><p>The girl was so damned innocent. She\u2019d grown up on tales of chivalry and romance. She hadn\u2019t a clue what danger a man like Ransom could pose.</p><p>Very well. No great pain for him to demonstrate. This one uninvited kiss should send her fleeing to her chamber tonight\u2014and then, in the morning, away.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, breaking the kiss. \u201cYou seem to have me confused with some innately decent man. I hope that clears matters up for you.\u201d</p><p>He released her, giving her the space to run away.</p><p>Instead, she fisted her hands in his shirt and clung tight. \u201cDo it again.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t speak for a moment. Nothing made sense.</p><p>\u201cDo it again,\u201d she whispered. \u201cQuickly. And this time do it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you on about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my first kiss. Do you know how long I\u2019ve been dreaming of my first kiss?\u201d</p><p>Ransom didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>\u201cAll my life.\u201d Her fists pounded his chest for emphasis. \u201cAnd so help me, Your Grace, I won\u2019t let you ruin it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to understand. Destroying your romantic fancies was rather the point of that little exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d She drew closer, still clutching tight. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to make the best of what life gave me. When I was a girl, I longed for a kitten. Instead, I got a weasel. Not the pet I wanted, but I\u2019ve done my best to love Snowdrop just the same.\u201d</p><p>He took a step back.</p><p>She moved with him.</p><p>\u201cSince my father died, I\u2019ve been desperate for a place to call home. The humblest cottage would do. Instead, I\u2019ve inherited a haunted, infested castle in Nowhere, Northumberland. Not the house I wanted, but I\u2019m determined to make it a home.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her face to his. He could feel her breath against his neck. Soft wisps of heat.</p><p>\u201cAnd ever since I was a girl,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of my first kiss. I just knew in my heart that it would be romantic and tender and knee-meltingly sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you know you were wrong. By this age, you should be accustomed to disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d Her grip tightened on his shirtfront. \u201cI\u2019ve started fighting against it. You\u2019re not going to ruin my first kiss. I won\u2019t let you. You\u2019re going to kiss me again, right now. And make it better.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, incredulous. \u201cIt\u2019s over. It\u2019s already done. Even if I did kiss you again, it wouldn\u2019t be your first kiss anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt counts,\u201d she said. \u201cSo long as it\u2019s part of the same embrace, it all counts as one.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. Where did women come up with these rules? Did they keep them in a book somewhere? Sometimes he wondered if women were all lawyers, with an extensive code of Romantic Law that they kept stubbornly hidden from men.</p><p>\u201cStop dithering,\u201d she urged. \u201cSurely, that kiss wasn\u2019t the best you could do.\u201d</p><p>He bristled. \u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, you\u2019ve made love on horseback enough times to draw generalizations about it. You must know how to kiss better than that. I\u2019m not leaving this turret until\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her by the shoulders and kissed her again. Harder this time. Mainly just to quiet her prattling, but also to underscore the original meaning. If she wanted tender starlight interludes, Ransom was not her man. When it came to physical pleasure, he was aggressive, bold, and unashamed of it. If he had to make the point twice, so be it.</p><p>But as he kissed her, something went horribly, horribly wrong.</p><p>This time, she kissed him back. Not with mere curiosity or artless enthusiasm but with a sweet, unfettered passion that made his ribs ache.</p><p>His eyes flew open in shock\u2014not that it made a damn bit of difference. He still couldn\u2019t see, only feel.</p><p>Sweet God above, did he feel.</p><p>This was . . . This was not supposed to happen.</p><p>Her lips were even more tempting than he\u2019d dared suppose. Plump, wide, sensual. He savored each in turn, then swept his tongue between. She matched him kiss for kiss, taste for teasing taste.</p><p>He tugged her close with one arm. As he thrust his tongue deep, her mouth shifted and softened under his. Generous. Giving.</p><p>This was everything he\u2019d been craving for so damn long. Closeness, warmth, sweetness, surrender.</p><p>He might have confined himself to this castle in the months since his injury, but he hadn\u2019t stopped moving. He\u2019d walked this place every night, traversing the galleries, climbing the stairs, measuring the rooms in paces and learning the way his steps echoed off the stone. Hour after hour and day after day turned into month after month.</p><p>First, he\u2019d walked to rebuild the strength sapped from his limbs. Then he\u2019d walked to master the lay of this castle without his sight. He might be a wreck, he told himself, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d be an invalid.</p><p>But there was something else that kept him walking, prowling the corridors and towers of Gostley Castle. Even if he wished to rest, he couldn\u2019t. Not without indecent amounts of whisky, anyhow. He just never felt easy. He never knew true peace. He was beginning to think he never would.</p><p>And now . . . now, this woman grabbed that tormented, wandering part of him and kissed it. Like a long-lost lover welcoming him home.</p><p>Good God. Good God.</p><p>She kissed him with everything. As if she wanted to. As if she\u2019d always wanted to. As if her small, slender body were nothing more than a cunningly crafted decanter of some bewitching potion. An essence of desire, aged and corked and waiting for years. As if in one single kiss, she\u2019d sensed her chance to foist it all on him because she was weary of the burden.</p><p>Take this sweetness, her kiss said. Take this passion. Take all of me.</p><p>He explored her mouth thoroughly, desperate for more.</p><p>He should have refused those reckless gifts. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to pull away. His desires had been caged a long time, too. He couldn\u2019t evade the longing she kindled. Couldn\u2019t deny the hard, hot response of his body\u2014not with his cock throbbing vainly against his buckskin falls.</p><p>God, he felt alive. Fully alive, for the first time since . . .</p><p>Since dying.</p><p>Ransom didn\u2019t know if this Beware-My-Dangerous-Kisses ploy was having any effect whatsoever on Izzy Goodnight, but he knew this much.</p><p>This kiss had him rattled to his boots.</p><p>Well, Izzy thought, her first kiss wasn\u2019t everything she\u2019d hoped and dreamed it might be.</p><p>It was a thousand times more.</p><p>Now this was a proper kiss.</p><p>Not just a harsh press of bruising lips, but a real, true kiss, by a man who knew what he was doing. He was kissing her with not only skill but with passion. And ardor.</p><p>And tongue.</p><p>Best of all, she was somehow managing to acquit herself in a manner that had him growling against her lips. Pure luck there, she had to imagine. Or maybe he was the kissing equivalent of those London dancing masters\u2014the ones who made a girl look graceful and competent when she was just following his lead.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. She was being kissed, and she was kissing in return, and thus far, it wasn\u2019t a humiliating disaster.</p><p>This . . . was . . . glorious.</p><p>For the second time in a single day, he made her knees go weak.</p><p>She threw her arms around his neck for balance. And then she kept them there for the sheer pleasure of lacing her fingers at the nape of his neck and sifting through the heavy locks of his hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smelled so good. So simply, and so masculinely, good. It made no sense to her, how the most humble, unlikely scents could add up to an exotic cologne. If one gathered a flask of whisky, a strop of old leather, and a cake of plain soap, then tied it all together with a few wisps of dog hair\u2014no one would expect the resulting \u201cbouquet\u201d to smell more enticing than an armful of roses. But somehow it did.</p><p>And then there was his heat. He seemed made of it. The man was a coal-fired furnace. He radiated warmth through his grasping hands, his hard chest, his lips.</p><p>Oh, his lips. The whiskers dotting his chin and jaw were abrasive, but his lips were . . . not soft, exactly. Soft meant pillows or petals, but his lips were the perfect blend of resilience and gentleness. Give and take.</p> <p>When at last he reached her mouth again, his taste was easy to name. Whisky and tea. And when he thrust his tongue deep, whisky and need.</p><p>So much need.</p><p>That was the most stirring, intoxicating part. Everything about his embrace told her that he needed, and what was truly astonishing\u2014that he sought something he needed in her. He twisted his hand in the back of her nightrail and kissed her more deeply, relentless, as if chasing that something. Searching for it.</p><p>And part of her wanted nothing more than to surrender. To offer whatever he needed of her, and gladly.</p><p>Be careful, Izzy.</p> <p>\u201cEnough.\u201d With that gruff pronouncement, he released her. So quickly, she almost stumbled.</p><p>The sounds of labored breathing filled the turret.</p><p>At length, he cursed. \u201cThat was a disaster.\u201d</p><p>Izzy put her hand to her temple. She was alone in the dark again, and her head was spinning. This was the moment for a witty, sophisticated retort.</p><p>What came out of her mouth instead was, \u201cYou kissed me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kissed me back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then you kissed me more.\u201d She sighed. So much for sophisticated banter. \u201cI won\u2019t make too much of it if that\u2019s your concern. I know you only kissed me to intimidate me. But you should know this. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it did work.\u201d He pulled her close again. \u201cI felt your heart pounding.\u201d</p><p>Well, if a pounding heart was a sign of fear . . .</p><p>She flattened one hand against his chest, covering the thumping beat there. The man must be terrified.</p><p>Izzy felt a strange pang of sympathy for him. Growing up as Sir Henry Goodnight\u2019s daughter had taught her all about male pride. Her father had labored for years in obscurity as a poorly paid, frustrated scholar. Once the stories found success, the adulation of readers was the food that sustained him. He couldn\u2019t last a week or more without another meal of fawning praise.</p><p>And if pride was that important to a middle-aged scholar, Izzy could only imagine how vital it must be to man like the Duke of Rothbury. How difficult adjusting to blindness must be for a man like him, young and strong and in his prime of life. For the first time, he was forced to rely on others. He must hate that feeling.</p><p>So he\u2019d learned Gostley Castle, pace by pace, month after month, building a painstaking map of every room in his head. By now this castle was a fortress to his pride. The one place he still felt in control.</p><p>And today . . . thanks to some legal quirk, he\u2019d lost it. To a plain, penniless spinster.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t any great wonder he despised her.</p><p>But just because Izzy understood and sympathized, that didn\u2019t mean she would give up. She couldn\u2019t surrender her own interests just to soothe his pride. She\u2019d made that mistake before, and it was why she found herself here, penniless and stranded in a crumbling castle with nowhere else to go.</p><p>She had to look out for herself. No one else would.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t be anxious, Your Grace. We will do whatever it takes to sift through the papers and legalities. In the meantime, I promise, I won\u2019t be much trouble.\u201d She gave his chest a gingerly pat.</p><p>His hand closed on her forearm and pushed it away. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll be in the morning, Miss Goodnight, is gone. I will see you back to your bedchamber now. And when morning comes, I will find you somewhere else to stay.\u201d</p><p>Izzy relented, saving her strength for tomorrow. In the morning, he would try to make her leave. He might scare her, shout at her, ply her with threats or kisses.</p><p>She would be strong as these castle walls.</p><p>She would not give one inch.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The next morning, Ransom awoke with a surplus of inches\u2014all of them straining against his breeches falls.</p><p>Hazy, dreamlike images lingered in his mind. Images of dark hair spilling through his hands and a lush mouth moving under his. A soft hand splayed against his chest.</p><p>He turned on his side and groaned. God, that kiss. That stupid, ill-conceived, arousing, soul-rearranging kiss.</p><p>She could not spend her nights in this castle. He had to find her other lodgings. Today.</p><p>Sitting up, he pushed both hands through his hair. A bath was in order. Preferably a cold one.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d he called.</p><p>No answer. No valet-sounding noises, either.</p><p>He made his way out to the cistern just off the courtyard and drew a bucket of water. Then he stripped to the waist, lifted the bucket high, and poured its freezing contents straight over his head and torso.</p><p>Lust be drowned.</p><p>The cold shock of his dousing was just starting to wear off when Magnus joined him by the cistern. Ransom drew some water for the dog and gave him a scratch behind the ears.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Damn. One day, and he\u2019d know that voice anywhere. Husky. Soft. Much too close. How did this woman keep sneaking up on him?</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Her footsteps crossed the courtyard, destroying his calm beat by beat.</p><p>Ransom braced himself for his first sight of her.</p><p>No one knew it but Duncan and a few useless surgeons, but his injury hadn\u2019t left him completely blind.</p><p>Oh, he was mostly blind, most of the time\u2014blocky shapes and shadows were the best he could make out. And sometimes, he was fully blind. Everything was a dark, murky gray.</p><p>But then there were a precious few hours of the day when he was only partly blind.</p><p>In those hours, he had the vision of a nonagenarian with no spectacles. He could make out vague contours and a few muted colors. A tree might appear as a fuzzy, irregular patch against the sky, its foliage a gray-green shade, like mold on cheese. If he stared at the page of a book, he could force a dark square of text to separate into lines. But he couldn\u2019t make out any words or letters. He could get a vague idea of a face\u2014the most prominent features standing out, like the simple face of a child\u2019s rag doll. Two button eyes, a slash of mouth. No subtleties of expression.</p><p>That was how much he could see at his best. And for once, that seemed like a blessing. He might have been addled by the feel, scent, and taste of Miss Goodnight last night . . . but at least he wouldn\u2019t be overwhelmed by the sight of her. At best, she\u2019d appear to him as an anemic, pale column with dark hair. Bland and uninspiring.</p><p>He was counting on it.</p><p>But as she entered his view, she had the wretched luck to pause just in front of the castle\u2019s eastern archway, which was flooded by morning sun.</p><p>His first glimpse of Izzy Goodnight was to see her bathed in gold. The sunlight showed him, in blazing relief, a slender, gracefully curved silhouette and a corona of wild, loose hair that seemed to be afire.</p><p>Holy God.</p><p>If he\u2019d been standing, he might have dropped to his knees. He was sure he heard a choir singing. This was the kind of beauty that one could rightly call \u201cstriking.\u201d</p><p>As in, he felt struck by a brick.</p><p>Move, he silently begged her. Take two steps to the right. Or the left. No, no. Just leave entirely.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were awake,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m awake.\u201d He saw a smile\u2014a wide, reddish curve\u2014bloom across her face.</p><p>He ran his gaze down her body, taking in the hazy but quite evident curves of her bosom and hips. He\u2019d held all that against him last night. And now he couldn\u2019t fathom why on earth he\u2019d let it go.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been awake since the batwing crack of dawn. I\u2019ve been exploring my castle.\u201d</p><p>Right. That was why.</p><p>With a whistle to Magnus, he headed back inside.</p><p>She followed him, of course. All the way into the great hall.</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, yawning a sultry yawn, \u201cthis place really is lovely in the morning. The way the sunlight comes through the windows, taking all that dust in the air and whirling it into gold. We had a rocky start yesterday, but today . . . Gostley Castle is starting to feel like home.\u201d</p><p>No, no, no. This was not home. Not for her, and most definitely not for them.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . want to put on a shirt, Your Grace?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>In reply, he crossed his arms over his bare chest. He wasn\u2019t doing anything to make her more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make tea,\u201d she said, moving toward the hearth. \u201cOh, look. Fresh bread.\u201d When next she spoke, she did so with her mouth full of it. \u201cDid Duncan fetch this, or does someone bring it up? I know there was milk yesterday.\u201d She poked around, making busy clanging noises. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there are eggs? If I do say it myself, I make a very good pancake.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. This just grew worse and worse.</p><p>I make a very good pancake.</p><p>Appalling.</p><p>What was even more appalling was that Ransom found himself suddenly hungry for a very good pancake. Starving. Ravenous. Damn it, he was faint with yearning for a very good pancake.</p><p>Any self-respecting rake had two kinds of women in his life: those he took to bed at night and those who made him a pancake in the morning. If he suddenly wanted both from the same woman, it was a warning flag. One big and red enough for even a blind man to see.</p><p>Get out now. The threat is coming from inside the castle.</p><p>\u201cKeep your breakfast simple,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd quick. Duncan will take you to the village this morning. We\u2019ll see about finding you lodging in the inn, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d love to go into the village,\u201d she said. \u201cBut only for provisions. What sort of fish do you have hereabouts? I\u2019d wager there are some lovely trout in the river.\u201d</p><p>Ransom gritted his teeth. There were, indeed, lovely trout in the river. Miss Goodnight was never going to taste them.</p><p>He rose to his feet. \u201cYou need to understand. You cannot stay here. Not after what happened between us last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYes. Do you mean the part where you tried to frighten me off from a property that\u2019s legally mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean the part where we kissed like illicit lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She drew out the word. \u201cThat. But we both know that was nothing.\u201d</p><p>Nothing? Offended, he pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cThat was not nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one kiss. One kiss doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course one kiss changes things. If it\u2019s done right, a kiss changes everything. A kiss is the first step on a long, winding, quite perilous path of sensuality. This morning, Miss Goodnight, is where you turn back.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI promise, Your Grace. I won\u2019t fling myself at you again. I wanted a kiss, and you gave me one. You are safe from my curiosity.\u201d</p><p>God. So that\u2019s what this was. The girl was letting him down gently. In his eagerness to get a first glance at her, he\u2019d forgotten that she\u2019d be doing the same\u2014taking her first well-lit look at him, and all his scars. Or her second proper look, if he included the time she\u2019d swooned.</p><p>You\u2019re not a handsome, swaggering buck anymore, you fool.</p><p>She went on, \u201cWhen we\u2019re not at work with your correspondence, the castle will keep me fully occupied. There\u2019s a great deal to be done here. Rooms to survey. Vermin to purge. A proper bedchamber to furnish.\u201d She dropped into a chair nearby. \u201cBread?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She touched his hand with a hunk of bread. He took it, resentfully, and tore off a bite with his teeth.</p><p>He was beginning to think he\u2019d have to go back to his first strategy\u2014tossing her over his shoulder and toting her away. The problem was, considering how much he enjoyed tossing her over his shoulder, he wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d get very far.</p><p>\u201cBut before I can think of anything else\u201d\u2014her head turned, and that mass of unbound curls became a fiery whirlwind\u2014\u201cI must find my hairpins. Do you know where you placed them yesterday?\u201d She reached and prodded the cushions to his side. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re in the sofa.\u201d</p> <p>He tried\u2014and failed\u2014to ignore the scent of rosemary.</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d She jumped with discovery, and her arm brushed his. \u201cHere\u2019s one of them. And another.\u201d</p><p>Damn her hairpins. He pushed to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, you\u2019ve made a valiant effort at scaring me off, but you\u2019ve thrown your worst at me, and it didn\u2019t work. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to give up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He jabbed a finger in his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t give up. On anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t give up?\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cForgive me, but from what I can gather, you were injured many months ago, and you haven\u2019t left this castle since. People in London think you\u2019re dead. Your post has gone unanswered, your servants aren\u2019t allowed to serve you, and you haven\u2019t done a thing to improve your living conditions in a moldering, decrepit castle. I don\u2019t know what definition of \u2018giving up\u2019 you\u2019re using, Your Grace, but this looks rather like mine.\u201d</p><p>Ransom fumed at her. How dare she? She had no idea what he\u2019d been through. She had no notion of how hard he\u2019d had to work in those first few months to regain the simplest of capabilities. The ability to walk without stumbling. To count higher than thirty. Damn, it had taken him ages just to relearn how to whistle for his dog. And he hadn\u2019t needed any cosseting, nor any managing female to cheer and goad him on. He\u2019d done it on his own, step by excruciating step. Because the alternative was to sit down and die.</p><p>He ground out his words. \u201cI . . . don\u2019t . . . give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove it.\u201d</p><p>Easy, Izzy told her galloping heart. Go easy now.</p><p>The next few minutes called for extreme caution.</p> <p>In truth, she needed to watch her every step, move, word, and breath with this man . . . but this was different.</p><p>Rothbury stood over her. He was shirtless, wet, wild-haired. Handsome as sin and angry as Lucifer. A duke accustomed to having his way. Now she\u2019d not only defied him, she\u2019d directly challenged him.</p><p>His words were low and even, but they smoldered like a fuse burning toward gunpowder. \u201cI don\u2019t need to prove anything to you.\u201d</p><p>He propped his hands on his hips. One of his pectoral muscles twitched angrily. As if registering an indignant harrumph. A little rivulet of water slalomed through the golden brown hairs on his chest.</p><p>Izzy clutched her hairpins so hard, they bit into the soft flesh of her palm.</p><p>She rose to her feet. Because that\u2019s what one did when moved to genuine awe.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Your Grace,\u201d she replied, speaking as calmly she could to his incensed left nipple. \u201cBut there are things that need proving. Such as the validity of the property transfer and the . . . and the . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh, heavens. Now her own nipples decided to have their say in this conversation. Standing this close to him brought back all the memories of their embrace last night. Distracting sensations coursed through her body. Not to mention all those pent-up emotions she\u2019d poured into their kiss.</p> <p>She crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cI have a strong hand, literacy in several languages, only two of which are dead\u2014and an abundance of discretion. I will help you sort through all your affairs, and we\u2019ll solve the mystery of just how this castle was sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t be pushed about.\u201d Izzy opened her eyes. Good heavens, the man was stubborn.</p><p>It must have been the nerves raised by proximity, but she had the uncanny sense that he was looking at her. Or through her. And she suddenly felt very embarrassed for staring at his chest.</p><p>She tried gentling her voice. \u201cI know you\u2019re apprehensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apprehensive.\u201d He pushed a hand through his hair. His arm muscles bunched and flexed in distracting ways. \u201cGood grief, Goodnight. You are the most vexing woman.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, Izzy smiled to herself.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. He\u2019d called her a woman.</p><p>\u201cThe two of us residing in this castle . . . it\u2019s not possible. If you meant to set up house here, you\u2019d need more than brave words. You\u2019d need furnishings, servants. Most importantly, a companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy a companion? There\u2019s Duncan. And there\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019m no chaperone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it still that silly kiss that\u2019s concerning you? I thought we\u2019d reached an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that kiss gave me plenty of understanding.\u201d He moved close and lowered his voice to a growl. The air heated between them, and she could have sworn the beads of water on his chest sizzled and became steam. \u201cI understand how your body feels against mine. I understand how sweet you taste. And I understand\u2014precisely\u2014how good we could be together. In bed. Or atop a table. Or against a wall. The problem with understanding seems to be yours.\u201d</p><p>The air left Izzy\u2019s lungs in a breathy, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She stared up him. The poor, confused man. He seemed to believe this sort of growly, lewd declaration would send her running and screaming into the countryside. Instead, his words had the opposite effect. With every carnal suggestion he made, her confidence soared to a new, dizzying pinnacle.</p><p>He wanted her. He wanted her.</p><p>And she wanted to do a little dance.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d A bright, feminine voice trilled up from the courtyard, like birdsong. \u201cDo be calm. I\u2019m on my way. Whatever it is you need, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Ransom jerked into motion. Whirling away, he reached for a shirt thrown over the sofa\u2019s back. It took him a few seconds of fumbling to lay his hand on it.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Izzy asked, gathering his coat in advance.</p><p>Whoever the visitor was, he wanted to look presentable for her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miss Pelham.\u201d He jerked the shirt over his head, punching in different directions to work his arms through the sleeves, then accepted the coat she offered. \u201cThe vicar\u2019s daughter. Another interfering woman I can\u2019t seem to be rid of.\u201d</p><p>Good heavens. Even vicar\u2019s daughters were throwing themselves at him? Izzy didn\u2019t find it hard to believe, but she found it a bit disappointing.</p><p>Oh, listen to her. It wasn\u2019t as though she had some claim on the man. One kiss in the dark, and she\u2019d become a jealous harpy. She pushed the envy aside.</p><p>Then a young woman entered the great hall, and the envy pushed right back.</p><p>Izzy had been to Court, many parties, and even a London ball or two. She could honestly say this was the most beautiful woman she\u2019d ever seen. Golden hair, with little ringlets placed artfully about her face. Ribbons streaming from her blue muslin frock. Pleasing figure. Practiced smile. Immaculate lace gloves.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d The young woman breathed the words as a sigh of relief, pressing a hand to her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re well. Thank the Lord. I expected to find you prostrate and delirious from fever, after the tale I heard from Mr. Duncan. It simply can\u2019t be true. Surely you haven\u2019t recently received a visitor by the name of\u2014\u201d Then her eyes landed on Izzy, and she halted abruptly. \u201cOh it is true. She is here.\u201d</p><p>The basket Miss Pelham carried dropped to the floor, and she clapped both hands to her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re Izzy Goodnight?\u201d</p><p>Izzy dropped a slight curtsy.</p><p>\u201cThe Izzy Goodnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The young woman gave a small cry of excitement. \u201cForgive me. I just can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. Really here, so close to my own home. Oh, please say you\u2019ll call at the vicarage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m sure I\u2019d like that very much, Miss Pelham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an honor, truly. But I can\u2019t imagine what brings you to Northumberland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this.\u201d Izzy gestured about them. \u201cGostley Castle. I have inherited the property from the late Earl of Lynforth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInherited? This?\u201d The young woman\u2019s eyes flew wide. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Izzy smiled. \u201cIt was a shock to us all, I believe. His Grace and I have been negotiating our landlady-tenant relationship.\u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham bounced in place, and her heels clicked on the stone floor. \u201cI\u2019m going to be neighbors with Izzy Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Pelham . . .\u201d the duke interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read all the Tales, you know. So many times. When I was younger, I cut each installment from the magazine and pasted the pages into a book. I brought it with me just in case the rumor was true.\u201d She reached into her basket and pulled out a large, loosely bound volume. \u201cI\u2019d be ever so honored if you\u2019d sign your name to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Pelham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t help but ask,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cCan I have a lock of your hair, Miss Goodnight? For the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Pelham,\u201d he interrupted, jarring them both. \u201cMiss Goodnight is under the mistaken impression that it would be safe for her to reside here at the castle until our property dispute is settled. Kindly help me persuade her that this is not the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Miss Pelham said, drawing out the sound. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>The young woman laid the folio aside. As she drew near, her scent was overpoweringly sweet. Izzy recognized vanilla and . . . gardenias?</p><p>Her white lace glove closed protectively on Izzy\u2019s wrist. She whispered, \u201cMiss Goodnight, you can\u2019t live here alone with him. I\u2019ve been visiting for months with no inroads. The man is the worst sort of rogue.\u201d</p><p>Izzy stared at her with amusement. Did she think the duke couldn\u2019t hear her whispers?</p><p>Rothbury went on, \u201cNow tell her that most of the castle is barely habitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Miss Goodnight. I\u2019ve lived down the hill all my life, and it\u2019s a shambles in places. Rotted timber, vermin. Most unsafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood and good,\u201d he said. \u201cNow kindly explain that this is not London or York. This is the country, and people hold to traditional values. An unmarried woman cannot take up residence with an unmarried man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all true,\u201d Miss Pelham confirmed. \u201cThere would be vicious gossip. The villagers wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Rothbury crossed his arms. \u201cWell, then. It\u2019s settled, Miss Goodnight. You cannot remain here, living alone with me. It simply can\u2019t happen. I\u2019m sure Miss Pelham will be glad to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me?\u201d Izzy interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His chin jerked in surprise.</p><p>Oh, this was good. She had all the advantage now.</p><p>\u201cMiss Pelham could stay with me,\u201d she explained. \u201cAs my companion, just for a few weeks. If she\u2019d be so kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay? As companion to the Izzy Goodnight?\u201d Miss Pelham squeezed Izzy\u2019s arm to the point of inducing pain. \u201cBut I\u2019d love nothing more than to help you with whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>It was becoming evident that Miss Pelham was a very helpful sort of young lady. Even when her help wasn\u2019t strictly needed or desired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be most grateful, Miss Pelham,\u201d Izzy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Father can spare me. What an excellent solution for all concerned.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe should thank the duke.

It was like you became an entirely different person.\u201d He mimicked her girlish lilt. \u201c \u2018Oh, yes, Miss Pelham.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d be so grateful, Miss Pelham.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to be concerned about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not concerned. I\u2019m envious. Why does she get the compliant Miss Goodnight, and I get the weasel-wielding harridan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s a Moranglian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Moranglian. My father\u2019s stories took place in a fictional country called Moranglia. His most devoted admirers call themselves Moranglians. They have clubs and gatherings and circular letters. And they expect a certain wide-eyed innocence from Izzy Goodnight. I don\u2019t want to disappoint them, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He tapped his fingers on the back of a chair. \u201cSo. If I read these stories of your father\u2019s, does that mean you\u2019ll be meek and docile with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She was never going to be meek or docile with him, and she was never going to let him read The Goodnight Tales. The possibility was out of the question. In fact, the possibility was so far out of the question, the possibility and the question were on separate continents.</p><p>\u201cEven if you did read my father\u2019s stories, I doubt you\u2019d enjoy them. They require the reader to possess a certain amount of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGullibility?\u201d he suggested. \u201cInexperience? Willful stupidity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeart. They require the reader to possess a heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re right. They\u2019re not for me. And I\u2019m certainly never going to style myself a Mordrangler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoranglian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he said, clearly annoyed. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. Not to you.\u201d She moved to the table. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have time to be reading stories anyhow. Not with all this correspondence to go through.\u201d</p> <p>She surveyed the snowdrifts of letters and packets, debating how best to proceed.</p><p>\u201cIt looks as though they\u2019re somewhat chronological. The older letters are the ones nearest to me, and the newer ones spill toward the far end of the table. Do you want to begin with the old or the new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to understand just what\u2019s going on here, I need to start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Going through every bit of this correspondence would likely take weeks, but Izzy wasn\u2019t going to complain. More work meant more money for her fix-the-castle fund. And if she was being honest, as difficult as the Duke of Rothbury was to live with, she wasn\u2019t terribly eager to be left alone in the place. Not until it had a good scrubbing. Perhaps an exorcism.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll start here at the beginning. As I read, we\u2019ll sort papers into two piles: Significant, to be revisited later, and Insignificant, to be set aside. Does that plan meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He reclined on the sofa, sprawling across the full length of it. It was a largish sofa, but he was an even more largish man. Magnus curled in a heap nearby.</p><p>\u201cSo while I read, you\u2019re just going to lie there. Like a matron reclining on her chaise longue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to lie here like a duke, reposed in his own castle.\u201d</p><p>Hah. He ought to recline while he still could. This wouldn\u2019t be his castle for long.</p><p>Making use of a nearby letter opener, Izzy started breaking seals and prying open old envelopes. She opened the first, and fattest, one her fingers could locate.</p><p>It would seem she\u2019d chosen well. A long list of lines and figures and sums fell out.</p><p>\u201cThis one looks promising,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t tease, Goodnight. Just read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018May it please Your Grace,\u2019 \u201d she began. \u201c \u2018We were most distressed to hear news of your recent injury. Please accept our wishes for your speedy recovery and a return to good health. Per your request, we will forward all estate-related correspondence to your holding in Northumberland, Gostley Castle, until such time as we are given other notice. Enclosed, please find a list of all bills and payments drawn on estate accounts in the previous\u2014\u201d</p><p>The duke interrupted. \u201cAre you aware that you\u2019re doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReading in voices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing any such thing.\u201d Her cheeks warmed. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You are. I never knew my accounting clerk sounded just like Father Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Very well. She had been reading the letter in a puffed, clerkish baritone. What of it? Izzy didn\u2019t believe he had any cause for complaint.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s more amusing when read in voices.\u201d With a mild shrug, she carried on. \u201c \u2018Enclosed, please find a list of all bills and payments drawn on estate accounts in the previous fortnight.\u2019 And then the list follows. One hundred fifteen pounds paid to the wine merchant. Horseflesh purchased at auction, eight hundred fifty. Monthly credit at the Dark Lion gaming club, three hundred.\u201d</p><p>Wine, fast horses, gambling . . .</p><p>The further she scanned, the less favorable a portrait this list painted.</p><p>However, she perked with interest at the next line. \u201cCharitable subscription to support the Ladies \u2018Campaign for Temperance\u2019 . . .\u201d She looked over the page at him. \u201cTen whole guineas. What generosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever let it be said I do nothing for charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are lines for servants\u2019 wages, the costermonger . . . Nothing strikes me as out of the ordinary.\u201d Izzy squinted at a scribbled line. \u201cExcept this. One hundred forty paid to The Hidden Pearl. What\u2019s that, a jeweler\u2019s shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That now-familiar smirk curved his lips. \u201cBut they do have lovely baubles on display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>The meaning behind his sly answer and devilish expression sank in. The Hidden Pearl was a bawdy house, of course. And she was a fool.</p><p>\u201cYou could call it a charitable establishment, if it helps,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of those poor women have hardly anything to wear.\u201d</p><p>Izzy ignored him. She held up the letter. \u201cSignificant or Insignificant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSignificant,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything to do with money is significant.\u201d</p><p>She set the letter on a clear patch of table, making it the base of what would become a small, yet steadily growing stack.</p><p>They worked through the envelopes, one by one. A few invitations for long-ago events went into the Insignificant heap, as did the months-old newspapers and charitable appeals. Estate reports and accounting tables went in the Significant pile.</p><p>Izzy pulled a thin envelope from the sea of unread letters. \u201cHere\u2019s something that was franked by a member of Parliament. It must be very important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think every letter bearing an MP\u2019s frank is important, you have fairy-tale notions of government, too. But by all means, read.\u201d</p><p>As she opened the letter, a hint of stale, soured perfume assaulted her senses. The penmanship within was scrawling and florid\u2014very feminine. It would seem the letter was not written by the MP himself. Most likely by his wife.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Rothbury,\u2019 \u201d Izzy began aloud.</p><p>Well, there was a remarkably familiar salutation. The letter must come from someone who knew him well.</p><p>She continued. \u201c \u2018It will shock you to hear from me. It\u2019s been months, and we are not the sort to exchange tender missives. But what is this news of you suffering a mysterious injury? In Northumberland, of all the godforsaken places. I hear a hundred rumors if I hear one. Some report you\u2019ve lost an eye, your nose, or both. Others insist it was a hand. I, of course, care little which appendages you might lop off, so long as no harm comes to that marvelously wicked tongue of yours, and no inches disappear from your magnificent\u2014\u201d</p><p>Izzy froze, unable to read further.</p><p>\u201cDo go on,\u201d the duke said. \u201cI was enjoying that one. And I\u2019ve changed my mind\u2014feel free to be creative with the voices. Something low and sultry would be excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for me to read on. Clearly this letter belongs in the Insignificant pile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Miss Goodnight.\u201d His unmarred eyebrow arched. \u201cWeren\u2019t you paying attention? There\u2019s nothing insignificant about it.\u201d</p><p>She burned with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll shame me with your prim silence. I\u2019m not ashamed in the least. Just because you make friends by acting as though you were found under a turnip leaf and raised by gnomes, it doesn\u2019t mean everyone takes pleasure in being prudish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrudish?\u201d she echoed. \u201cI\u2019m not a prude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. The reason you stopped reading that letter had nothing to do with being England\u2019s innocent sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He laced his hands behind his neck and propped his boots on the opposite arm of the sofa. If an artist were to capture this image, it would have been labeled, Smugness: A Portrait. She wanted to shake him.</p><p>\u201cCock.\u201d She blurted it out. \u201cThere. I said it. Aloud. Here, I\u2019ll say it again. Cock. Cock, cock, cock. And not just any cock.\u201d She glanced at the paper and dropped her voice to a throaty purr. \u201c \u2018Your magnificent cock, which I long to feel deep inside me again.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He went quiet now.</p><p>She released her grip, letting the paper drop from her hand. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Goodnight . . .\u201d He sat up on the sofa, shifting awkwardly. \u201cI am the furthest thing from satisfied. And heartily sorry I pressed the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Izzy huffed a breath, dislodging a stray curl from her forehead. Her whole body was hot and achy, and a low throb had settled between her thighs.</p><p>Worst of all, her mind was a buzzing hive of curiosity. When it came to a man\u2019s organ, just what constituted \u201cmagnificence\u201d anyhow? There were clues in the letter, she supposed. Something about precious inches and the ability to reach depths.</p><p>She propped her elbows on the table and extended one index finger into the air. How long was that, she mused? Perhaps four inches, at the most? Four inches didn\u2019t strike her as a measurement one associated with magnificence.</p><p>She extended both index fingers toward one another, letting them touch at the tips. Their combined length was more impressive. But also a little bit frightening.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>Her elbow slipped, sending a sheaf of papers cascading to the floor. Thank heaven he couldn\u2019t see her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to carry on with your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, Your Grace. Of course. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Enough with these missives from his former lovers.</p><p>Izzy searched through the letters, hoping to choose something dry and boring. A report on the state of his tenants\u2019 barley crop. Something with absolutely no evidence of his career as a virile, unapologetic, magnificent libertine.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s something that was sent as an express,\u201d she said, plucking a battered envelope from the bottom of the heap. \u201cIt was addressed to you in London, but your people must have forwarded it here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat up, giving her his full attention. \u201cRead it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Your Grace,\u2019 \u201d she began.</p><p>But before she could read further, she lowered the letter. \u201cSo strange. I must have opened twenty of these now. Not one of them has begun with a warm salutation. Not a \u2018My dear duke\u2019 or \u2018Dearest Rothbury\u2019 in the bunch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s the way things are.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cBut not always, surely. Somewhere in these hundreds upon hundreds of letters, there\u2019s got to be one that\u2019s mildly affectionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free to think so. I wouldn\u2019t advise holding your breath.\u201d</p><p>Truly? Not one?</p><p>Izzy bit her lip, feeling like a heel for bringing it up. But if no one dared to address him with warmth, it could only be because he forbade it with that stern demeanor. Surely someone, somewhere found him lovable\u2014or least admirable. Hopefully, for a reason that had nothing to do with his financial or physical endowments.</p> <p>She went back to the letter at hand. Within a few lines, she realized that this was a very different letter than any of the ones she\u2019d read before.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Your Grace. By now, you will know I have gone. Do not think I will have regrets. I am sorry\u2014most heartily sorry\u2014for only one thing, and that is that I lacked the courage to tell you directly.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The duke\u2019s boots hit the floor with a thud. He rose to his feet. His expression was forbidding. But he didn\u2019t tell her not to continue.</p><p>\u201c \u2018I realize,\u2019 \u201d Izzy read on, clearing her throat, \u201c \u2018forgiveness will be beyond you in this moment, but I feel I must offer some explanation for my actions. The plain truth of it is, I could never lov\u2014\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The paper was ripped from her hands.</p><p>Rothbury crumpled it in one hand and tossed it in the grate. \u201cInsignificant.\u201d</p> <p>Insignificant?</p><p>Balderdash.</p><p>Izzy knew the contents of that letter had been significant. So significant, he couldn\u2019t even bear to confront them, so he\u2019d snatched them from her grip and destroyed the truth.</p><p>But there was another significant fact to be dealt with, and it had nothing to do with correspondence at all.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou deceitful rogue. You\u2019re not blind.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>You\u2019re not blind,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>The statement took him by surprise, but not in an unwelcome way. He would discuss his wretched eyesight all day long if she forgot ever opening that damned letter. The foolish chit who\u2019d penned it should have saved her ink. If forgiveness had been beyond him then, it was utterly hopeless now.</p> <p>\u201cI am blind,\u201d he informed Miss Goodnight. \u201cWhy would I pretend it if I weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just crossed those five paces and ripped a page directly from my hand, with no hesitation. No fumbling.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd every so often, the way you look at me . . . I\u2019ve wondered. Sometimes it seems you\u2019re completely blind, and at other times it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because sometimes I am completely blind, and other times I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, and the entirety of the medical establishment. There\u2019s some damage to the nerve, I\u2019m told. Inside. It\u2019s variable. At certain hours of the day, I can make out shapes and shadows. A few muted colors. On my left side, particularly. Other times, it\u2019s all a dark fog. I\u2019m at my best in the mornings.\u201d</p><p>She slowly pushed back in her chair and stood. \u201cWhat do you see when you look at me? Precisely.\u201d</p><p>He let his eyes flitter over her. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything \u2018precisely.\u2019 I can tell you\u2019re slender. I can see you\u2019re wearing white, or some light color. Your face is pale, your lips are reddish. And there appears to be a dark brown octopus attacking your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my hair.\u201d</p><p>Ransom shrugged. \u201cYou asked what I see. I see tentacles.\u201d</p><p>He could sense her irritation with that answer, and he was glad of it. What was she expecting, compliments? He wasn\u2019t about to tell her that her mouth was a splash of wine he wanted to lick. Or that her rounded curves made his hands ache to cup and stroke. Even if those things were the truth.</p><p>\u201cWho else knows the full extent of your injuries?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly a few useless doctors, Duncan, and . . . and now you.\u201d</p><p>Ransom intended to keep it that way. He\u2019d had enough trouble wrestling his own stupid hope into submission. He couldn\u2019t contend with others\u2019 expectations, too. If Abigail Pelham knew he could sometimes see, for example, she\u2019d be forever pestering him. She\u2019d write to London specialists for eye-training exercises, and she\u2019d ask him a thousand questions.</p><p>Is it getting better yet?</p><p>Do you notice some improvement?</p><p>Does this make any difference?</p><p>How about now?</p><p>And now?</p><p>And, of course, the answers would be nothing but no, no, no, no.</p><p>And no.</p><p>\u201cEnough about my eyes. There are only two things you need to know. One, I can navigate this castle better than you can. Two, I can\u2019t read those letters on my own.\u201d Ransom returned to the sofa and took his seat. \u201cSo pick up the next and get on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Happily, this time she selected a dry, boring report from one of his land agents. Timmons, at the Surrey estate. A very thorough man, bless him. There were pages upon pages of sheep-health advisements and crop-rotation plans.</p><p>He could have cut her off one page into the reading. There was nothing he expressly needed to hear about improvements to the old stables. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop her.</p><p>He liked listening to her read. He liked it far too much. Listening to her voice was like floating along a river. Not a babbling stream, bouncing over rocks and such, but a river of wild honey with depth and a low, sweet melody. To keep afloat, he would have let her read just about anything. Even those soppy stories from Menstrualia, or whatever it was called.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s another from the accountant,\u201d she said, after some time had passed.</p><p>Excellent. Another long, meaningless list of information for her to read. However, she hadn\u2019t progressed very far into it before stopping.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour expenses with the costermonger have quadrupled when compared to the previous report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of it? It\u2019s the costermonger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes . . . and it\u2019s not exactly a great sum. But it\u2019s odd that your housekeeper would have suddenly spent four times as much on vegetables. You weren\u2019t even in residence by then.\u201d</p><p>Ransom supposed it was a bit odd.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said. \u201cI only notice because I always paid those sorts of household accounts. The butcher, the costermonger, the laundress. It wouldn\u2019t be important to you.\u201d</p><p>No, it wouldn\u2019t. Such an expense would have been completely beneath Ransom\u2019s notice. Which suggested one thing: If someone was trying to steal from him, padding the costermonger bill was the perfect way to do it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s compare the two reports again.\u201d He walked over to the table and joined her. \u201cIn detail, slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment to find it.\u201d</p><p>Miss Goodnight wasn\u2019t the secretary he would have chosen. But she might have just the critical eye he needed. Considering the amounts of money his solicitors had access to use\u2014and potentially misuse\u2014she could turn out to be a bargain.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t have a chance to begin their scrutiny of the accounts.</p><p>\u201cMiss Goodnight!\u201d</p><p>Ransom groaned. Miss Pelham was back.</p><p>\u201cMiss Goodnight, doubt not! We have returned. I have all my things from the vicarage, and our cook and housemaid will be coming along shortly to help us get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Miss Goodnight called back, rising from her chair. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d To Ransom she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to continue this tomorrow, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold a moment,\u201d Ransom objected. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no choice.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s where she was wrong. He was a duke. He always had the choice.</p><p>Through gritted teeth, he told her, \u201cYou have a post as my secretary. I\u2019m not paying you two hundred pounds a day to rearrange furniture and hang drapes. Now, sit back down and find that list of payments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I hear a please?\u201d She waited a beat. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDock my wages for the afternoon, if you like.\u201d She began walking away. \u201cThe accounting will have to wait for tomorrow. If you don\u2019t allow me and Miss Pelham to prepare a warm, comfortable, rat-and-bat-free bedchamber before nightfall, I promise you\u2014there won\u2019t be a tomorrow at all.\u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham called down from the gallery. \u201cDo come along, Miss Goodnight! Let\u2019s set about making this castle into a home.\u201d</p><p>A home.</p><p>Those words sent dread spiraling through him.</p><p>There was no use fighting it any longer. Miss Goodnight was settling in. Making a home. Just bloody wonderful.</p><p>Ransom began to wonder if he\u2019d made such an excellent bargain after all.</p><p>As young ladies went, Miss Abigail Pelham was everything that made Izzy despair. From the moment the vicar\u2019s daughter had walked\u2014nay, floated\u2014into the great hall, Izzy had known they were creatures of different breeds.</p><p>Miss Pelham was the sort of young woman who had plans, made lists, kept a beauty regimen. The sort who knew, somehow, which straw bonnets in the milliner\u2019s shop would suit her and never ended up looking a beribboned scarecrow. The sort who always smelled of vanilla and gardenias, not because she liked baking or working in the garden\u2014but because she\u2019d decided it was her signature scent, and she kept sachets tucked between her stored undergarments.</p><p>She was competent in the art that motherless, awkward Izzy had never mastered. The art of being feminine. If she had met Miss Pelham at a party, they would have had less to say to each other than a bright-winged parrot sharing a perch with a common wren.</p><p>Luckily, this was not a party. This was a housecleaning, and it became immediately clear that in this endeavor, Izzy couldn\u2019t have asked for a more enthusiastic partner.</p><p>Miss Pelham surveyed the ducal chamber, sniffing at the moth-eaten hangings. \u201cIt was horrid of the duke to put you in this chamber. This room isn\u2019t without its potential. But it\u2019s hardly the place to start, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Izzy said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make a tour of the whole castle this morning.\u201d Miss Pelham left the room in a brisk swoop. \u201cThis afternoon, we\u2019ll choose one room to begin with,\u201d she went on. \u201cOne that\u2019s small and easy to clean. We\u2019ll sweep it out, fit it with a proper bed by tonight. Check the chimney, of course. Some of them are clogged with birds\u2019 nests and only the good Lord knows what else.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in her paces, shivered\u2014and squealed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how excited I am to be doing this. At last. It\u2019s been torture, living down the hill from this wonderful castle all my life and watching it slip further and further into ruin. And, finally, we will have some jobs and custom for the local parishioners.\u201d</p><p>Izzy followed the relentless ribbon of chatter, amused. If Miss Pelham was at all winded by their pace, she didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>For her part, Izzy kept her mouth shut and her eyes open. As they moved through the corridors, the daylight revealed most of the chambers to be in a discouraging state. Many of the windows were broken out. Everything that could be chewed by moths or mice, had been. Dust and cobwebs coated the rest, like a blanket of grayish snow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to set reasonable goals,\u201d Miss Pelham continued. \u201cThis castle wasn\u2019t built in a day, and it won\u2019t be made livable in one day, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudging by the architecture, building it took a few hundred years,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cI hope making it livable doesn\u2019t take that long.\u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham turned at the bottom of the stairs and smiled. \u201cYou must know so much about castles. From dear Sir Henry, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Here we go.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Izzy pasted a sweet smile on her face. \u201cI always loved hearing my father give his lectures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow lucky you were to have him.\u201d Miss Pelham looked her over. \u201cAnd how clever you are today. I\u2019ll have to change into my work smock, but here you\u2019ve had the foresight to wear yours already.\u201d</p><p>Izzy touched the skirts of her frock\u2014her best morning dress\u2014and tried to smile.</p><p>As they turned a corner, she recognized a familiar set of stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s go up here.\u201d</p> <p>Miss Pelham followed reluctantly. \u201cThere can\u2019t be much up here. The stairs are too narrow. We\u2019ll have to resist the urge to explore every nook just yet, or we\u2019ll never complete our survey of the castle. We\u2019ll walk through the main towers today, and by afternoon, we should be able to narrow down the options for your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-two, thirty-three . . .</p><p>\u201cThis one,\u201d Izzy said, emerging into the turret room. \u201cThis is the room I\u2019ve chosen.\u201d</p><p>The turret room was even more enchanting by day than it had been by night. The vaulted ceiling tapered to a point above, and a golden shaft of sunlight pierced the sole window.</p><p>As Izzy went to the window, her heart beat faster. An inspiring green vista of rolling hills and castle walls spread below. Oh, there was even ivy climbing the walls, with songbirds nesting in it.</p><p>\u201cThis one?\u201d Miss Pelham didn\u2019t sound as though she saw the room\u2019s charms. \u201cThis would be terribly impractical, what with all those stairs. Drafty, too, I\u2019m sure. There isn\u2019t even a hearth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo hearth means we wouldn\u2019t have to clean out a chimney.\u201d No hearth means no bats. \u201cAnd it\u2019s summer. I can make do with blankets.\u201d Izzy circled the room. \u201cThis must be my chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly are little Izzy Goodnight, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Miss Pelham smiled broadly. \u201cOh! Shall we paint the ceiling with silver moons and golden stars?\u201d</p><p>She referred to Izzy\u2019s bedroom in The Goodnight Tales\u2014the one with a purple counterpane and the starry heavens painted on the ceiling. The room that had never even existed.</p><p>\u201cNo need to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cAt night, I can see the real stars.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to feel like a little girl in this room. In this room, she was a woman. A temptress. This was where she\u2019d had her first true kiss.</p><p>A kiss from a roguish, impossible duke, who\u2019d only kissed her under duress. But it was a kiss nonetheless, and one she still felt at the corners of her whisker-rasped lips.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Miss Pelham said, \u201ceventually, on the floor below we should make you a proper suite, with a sitting room and quarters for your lady\u2019s maid. But I suppose this room will do for a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike it?\u201d She linked arms with Izzy and squeezed tight. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased, I could squeal.\u201d</p><p>Please. Please don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe have a hard day\u2019s work ahead of us,\u201d Miss Pelham said. \u201cBut tonight, we\u2019ll have a proper bedchamber. We\u2019ll plait each other\u2019s hair. Dive beneath the coverlet and tell tales until an ungodly hour. Oh, this will be such fun.\u201d</p><p>And it was fun, for an hour or two.</p><p>But in the end, that night was just like every other night of Izzy\u2019s life.</p><p>Once again, she woke to darkness, her heart pounding with terror and her throat scraped raw.</p><p>Strange noises assailed her from all sides.</p><p>I am not alone, she told herself, struggling to master her breath. I have Miss Pelham here with me.</p><p>But she would feel much better if Miss Pelham were awake, too. Izzy tossed back and forth on the bed, hoping her movements would wake her companion.</p><p>When Miss Pelham didn\u2019t stir, she moved on to direct methods. She laid a hand on the young woman\u2019s shoulder and gave it a brisk shake.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cMiss Pelham. Miss Pelham, I\u2019m sorry to disturb you. Please wake.\u201d</p><p>The vicar\u2019s daughter snored, once. Loudly.</p><p>But she did not wake.</p><p>Good heavens. Just before bed, she\u2019d opined that she wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts. That good Christians had no reason not to sleep soundly. She hadn\u2019t been joking about that sleeping soundly bit. The woman slept like a rock.</p><p>Which now struck Izzy as highly unjust. Had she been a bad Christian all her life? She didn\u2019t attend church so often as she likely should, but she wasn\u2019t precisely a heathen.</p><p>Although, to be fair, in the past twenty-four hours, she\u2019d shamelessly kissed a duke and spent a great deal of time pondering the idea of . . . magnificence.</p><p>A distant wailing rattled her to the bones.</p><p>That was it. She was getting out of bed. That noise was definitely not her imagination.</p><p>Izzy shook Miss Pelham\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMiss Pelham. Miss Pelham, wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Miss Goodnight?\u201d The young woman turned over lazily, hair mussed from sleep. It gave Izzy a small sense of satisfaction to see Miss Pelham with her hair mussed.</p><p>Then the moaning began again, and she lost all interest in coiffures.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Izzy asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very loud nothing. Hush. There it is again.\u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham frowned and listened. \u201cYes, I see what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. I\u2019m not going mad.</p><p>\u201cWhat could it be? I\u2019ve heard that there are wild cattle in the park, but that noise sounds much too close.\u201d</p><p>They listened to it again\u2014that low, broken howl.</p><p>Miss Pelham sat up. \u201cA shepherd blowing his horn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this time of night? Over and over?\u201d Izzy shuddered.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a ghost. I don\u2019t believe in ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I until I moved in here.\u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out. We\u2019ll investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust we?\u201d Izzy asked. \u201cOn second thought, I can live without knowing. Let\u2019s just go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the one who woke me, Miss Goodnight. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll sleep well until we\u2019ve put the mystery to rest.\u201d</p><p>Izzy was afraid she\u2019d say that. \u201cPerhaps someone is just playing tricks on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible.\u201d Miss Pelham reached for her dressing gown. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past the duke. No doubt he wants to lure us out of our bedchambers in our shifts. Be sure to close your dressing gown with a very tight knot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s blind. How would he be able to tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Izzy supposed he would.</p><p>Though Izzy wasn\u2019t thrilled at the prospect of skulking through the castle at midnight again, she felt more confident knowing that Miss Pelham would be joining the sally.</p><p>Once they\u2019d each knotted their dressing robes and donned boots, they lit candles. Izzy patted her pocket. Empty. Snowdrop must be out hunting or curled in her nest.</p><p>Lucky Snowdrop.</p><p>They took the stairs together, proceeding slowly in the dark. One after the other. Sometimes Miss Pelham would speed up and turn the corner before Izzy, and her figure and candlelight would drift from view. Then Izzy would hasten to catch up, sure she could feel ghostly fingers on the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you see anything that way?\u201d Miss Pelham asked, once they emerged into the corridor.</p><p>Izzy held the candlestick high with her right hand and peeked through the fingers of her left. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to this side, either.\u201d</p><p>The noise came again.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, Miss Goodnight. Old buildings like these make all sorts of strange sounds. No doubt it\u2019s just timbers settling, or a door creaking back and forth on rusted hinges.\u201d</p><p>Both those explanations sounded reassuringly plausible.</p><p>They emerged into the courtyard, and were nearly across it when an immense figure emerged from the shadows, stopping them in their path.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d Izzy gasped, pressing a hand to her thumping heart. \u201cYou scared us.\u201d</p><p>The valet held his lamp aloft, illuminating the stark lines of his face. \u201cWhat are you ladies doing out of bed?\u201d</p><p>Once again, a keening howl rose up into the night, lifting every hair on Izzy\u2019s arms with it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing out of bed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat can it be?\u201d Miss Pelham asked.</p><p>Duncan shook his head. \u201cLikely cats wailing or foxes having a fight. Whatever it is, I\u2019ll scare it off. You ladies should return to your chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming with you,\u201d Izzy said.</p><p>They\u2019d ventured this far. She\u2019d rather face whatever it was with Duncan present than make that walk back to their chamber alone.</p><p>\u201cReally, Miss Goodnight. It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish his warnings, Miss Pelham shrieked and pointed. \u201cA ghost!\u201d</p><p>A white, filmy apparition came streaking out of the tower. It writhed and howled, twisting its way across the courtyard like a wraith.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a ghost.</p><p>It was Magnus.</p><p>Poor wolf-dog Magnus, caught in a Holland cloth they\u2019d hung up with the washing. He was moving so swiftly, it took Izzy a few moments to discern the reason for his distress.</p><p>But she ought to have guessed at the cause.</p><p>Snowdrop.</p><p>The ermine had gone hunting, all right\u2014hunting for big game.</p><p>She was attached to the end of Magnus\u2019s tail, holding on by the strength of her vicious teeth. The dog caromed around the courtyard, whipping and howling in an effort to shake her off.</p><p>\u201cOh, the poor thing.\u201d Laughing, Izzy set off in pursuit. \u201cDuncan, can you catch him?\u201d</p><p>It took some doing, but eventually they managed to corner the beasts. Duncan held the dog still while Izzy pried Snowdrop\u2019s jaws from his tail.</p><p>\u201cThere. You little menace.\u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham winced as she studied the bite wound on the dog\u2019s tail. \u201cI\u2019ll see to bandaging the poor dear. It\u2019s a deep wound. In my kit, there\u2019s some salve that will help. It\u2019s in the great hall. Duncan, we\u2019ll need bandages.\u201d</p><p>Duncan started off before she even finished. \u201cOf course, Miss Pelham.\u201d</p><p>Izzy cradled the ermine in her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll take Snowdrop back up to the turret and make sure she can\u2019t escape, and then I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>The plan established, they parted and went their separate ways.</p><p>Izzy mounted the stairs, Snowdrop tucked securely in the pocket of her dressing gown. The ermine seemed to have tired from the chase, and she went to sleep at once.</p><p>\u201cThe duke will be most put out with you,\u201d Izzy chided, locking the animal into her gilded ball. \u201cAnd put out with me, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Where was Rothbury, anyhow? He couldn\u2019t possibly have slept through all that howling. And even if he could, he ought have noticed that the commotion involved his own dog.</p><p>Despite her questions, Izzy\u2019s steps were light and carefree as she made her way back down to the great hall. Now that their keening, wailing ghost had been unmasked and proved to be something so benign, she felt a new sense of bravery welling in her chest.</p><p>She truly could do this. She could make this place her home.</p><p>And then . . .</p><p>While breezing down the corridor, Izzy caught a glimpse of something in one of the vacant rooms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A glimpse of something pale and writhing.</p><p>And moaning.</p><p>Her heart made an impulsive attempt to escape her body by way of her throat. But she didn\u2019t run away. She inched closer, holding the candle tight.</p><p>Slowly, the ghostly apparition came into focus.</p> <p>Izzy blinked. \u201cYour Grace?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Damn, damn, damn.</p><p>Ransom winced as her familiar voice sliced through his throbbing skull.</p><p>She would have to find him here, see him like this. Down on the ground, his knees cut out from under him. Crippled by searing pain.</p> <p>Why had he ever agreed to a duel with swords? He should have insisted on pistols. He\u2019d be dead now, of course. But in times like this, dying seemed preferable to one more minute of this burning, shooting pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you unwell?\u201d</p><p>She padded across the floor and crouched at his side.</p><p>\u201cGo away. Leave me.\u201d He rolled onto his side, curling his knees to his stomach and pressing his skull against the cool, smooth stone.</p><p>\u201cAre you having some sort of attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . .\u201d He flinched as a fresh burst of pain ripped from his eye socket to the back of his skull. \u201cJust a headache.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just a headache. It was a headagony. The pain ripped from the back of his skull, curving around one side of his scalp to stab him just behind the eye.</p><p>Again and again and again.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBy leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that. You didn\u2019t leave me when I swooned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t kindness. I know, I know. Something about vermin. If you don\u2019t want me, shall I fetch Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He managed to pronounce the word with gunshot force, but it had a wicked recoil. White streaks of pain flared behind his eyelids.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t leave him. \u201cDo you need water? Whisky? Some sort of powder?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth and gave a tight shake of his head. \u201cNothing works. Have to wait it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>An hour that would feel like a lifetime. A lifetime of being stabbed through the base of his skull with a spike. Repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her hand settled on his shoulder, and the touch sent a shiver through him.</p><p>Ransom was accustomed to dealing with pain on his own. In his early life, he hadn\u2019t been given a choice. His mother had died less than an hour after his birth. His father had showed no patience with tears he might shed over stubbed toes and scraped knees. If he hurt himself or fell ill, the old duke thought he should overcome the pain on his own. The nursemaids and house staff were forbidden to give him so much as a hug. No coddling. No small mercies. His father had insisted on it.</p><p>And his father had been right. By learning to recover on his own, Ransom had grown into a strong, independent man. Untouchable. Invincible.</p><p>Right up until the moment a short sword caught him across the face.</p><p>Her fingers brushed over his ruined brow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You\u2019re a big, strong, manly duke, and you don\u2019t need anyone, I know. I\u2019m not here for you. I\u2019m here for me. Because I need to stay.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, he gave in. He hadn\u2019t the strength to argue it further.</p><p>She settled beside him and drew his head into her lap. \u201cThere, now. Be easy. Be calm.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers drifted through his hair, tracing delicious furrows on his scalp. Each caress seemed to stroke away a bit of the pain.</p><p>Her touch was like magic\u2014or the closest thing to a miracle a man like him could ever credit. She found the sharp edge of his pain and dulled it with gentle sweeps of her fingertips.</p><p>And her voice. That deep, sweet river of her voice, carrying him away from the pain.</p><p>It was so foreign to him, this unsolicited tenderness. Incomprehensible. And much as he craved it, it scared him like hell. With every caress he permitted, he was piling up debts he could never repay.</p><p>You don\u2019t deserve it, came that dark, unforgiving echo. He\u2019d heard the words so many times, they were part of him now. They lived in his blood, resounding with each hollow beat of his heart. You don\u2019t deserve this. You never could.</p><p>Her thumb found a knot at the base of his skull and pressed. He moaned.</p><p>She immediately stilled. \u201cAm I distressing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes.\u201d He turned so that his head lay in the cradle of her lap, and he stretched one arm about her waist, shameless. \u201cJust . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d He sucked in his breath as a fresh wave of pain nearly knocked him cold. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Izzy\u2019s heart twisted. There was something so moving about seeing a man so big, so powerful, curled up like a puppy on the floor, damp with perspiration and writhing in evident pain.</p><p>His arms laced tight about her waist.</p><p>She\u2019d been alone for a long time. In some ways, since well before her father died. And she was well-enough acquainted with loneliness to understand that the worst part wasn\u2019t having nobody caring for you\u2014it was having nobody to care for.</p><p>Izzy didn\u2019t know if these gentle sweeps of her fingertips could erase his pain\u2014but they were dismantling the safeguards around her heart.</p><p>She soothed her touch over his brow and scalp, making shushing noises and whispering what she hoped were comforting words.</p><p>What happened? she longed to ask. What happened tonight? What happened all those months ago?</p><p>\u201cSpeak,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall I speak of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>How strange. Izzy found herself on the receiving end of questions daily, but she was never asked to talk about . . . anything on her mind. Now that he\u2019d requested it, she didn\u2019t even know what to say.</p><p>She stroked his hair again.</p><p>\u201cTalk of anything,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me a story, if you must. One from Mudpuddlia.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019d rather not. My life\u2019s work was helping my father. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a little girl living in his tales. To be sure, I enjoy a romantic story, but I also like newspapers and sporting magazines.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her touch to his neck and began to work loose the knots of muscle there, working in gentle circles.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>She stilled her fingers. \u201cShall I stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just keep talking. Which sport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a girl, I followed all of it. My father was just a tutor then, and I was a girl who read anything she could lay hands on. One of his pupils passed along stacks of magazines. Boxing, wrestling. Horseracing was my favorite. I would read every article, study every race. I\u2019d pick horses, and my father would place the bets. We could always use the extra money.\u201d</p><p>She reclined her weight on one outstretched arm and settled in to tell him all about the year she picked the winners in both the Ascot and Derby, sparing no detail of her bloodline research and odds calculations. He just wanted her to keep talking, and so she did.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow,\u201d she finished, minutes later, \u201cwe did well with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as though you did well with it.\u201d He released a long, heavy sigh and turned onto his back, so that he faced her.</p><p>\u201cIs the pain any better, Your Gr\u2014\u201d She cut herself short, unable to complete the proper form of address. She held his head in her lap, and she\u2019d just babbled on about her boring life. This was the least ducal or graceful moment imaginable. What point was there in formality?</p><p>She thought of all those letters she\u2019d pored over that morning. How they all began with \u201cYour Grace\u201d or \u201cMay it please the duke\u201d or something similarly cold.</p><p>He needed someone to treat him like a person. Not an untouchable duke but a man worth caring for. And as she could imagine Duncan would prefer to swallow bootblack before breaking with his traditional role, Izzy decided that person would have to be her.</p><p>\u201cRansom,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t object, so she tried it again.</p><p>\u201cRansom, are you better?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, putting one hand over his eyes and massaging his temples. \u201cBetter. Somewhat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have these headaches often?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot so often anymore. They\u2019re just . . . sudden. And vengeful. This one cut my legs out from under me. At least when it\u2019s over, the pain leaves as swiftly as it arrived.\u201d</p><p>He began struggling to a sitting position. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Duncan,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll insist on sending for a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a doctor would be a good idea,\u201d Izzy replied.</p><p>Ransom shook his head, wincing as he did. \u201cNo. There\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d</p><p>He pushed to a standing position. Izzy stood, too. And then watched, cringing, as the six-foot-tall column of duke slowly pitched to the right.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d She lunged into action, using both hands and all her body weight to prop him back up. \u201cYou should rest, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo should you.\u201d His hand stroked up and down her arm. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed anyhow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . er . . .\u201d She hesitated, not knowing how to explain the \u201cghost hunt,\u201d and not wanting to tell him her weasel had nearly bitten off his poor dog\u2019s tail.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t appear ready to comprehend the story anyhow. \u201cAre you certain you\u2019re well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always this way.\u201d He steadied himself with one hand on her shoulder. \u201cEven after the pain is gone, my mind doesn\u2019t work properly for an hour or two. It\u2019s like being drunk.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the heavy weight of his hand on her shoulder. At last, he was accepting a small measure of assistance from her, unforced and unprompted.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you\u2019re a friendly drunk,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s that. In fact, I think I might like you much better this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you too much.\u201d His slurred, mumbled words were almost too low to hear.</p><p>They were too ludicrous to be trusted.</p><p>I like you too much.</p><p>Izzy flushed with heat. He couldn\u2019t really mean that. He wasn\u2019t himself right now. That was all.</p><p>\u201cYou really should rest,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me take you down to the great hall so you can sleep.\u201d She started to drape his arm over her shoulders like a yoke.</p><p>He turned to face her. Instead of draping over her shoulders, his arm slid around her back. \u201cAt least kiss me good night.\u201d</p><p>Heavens. He truly was behaving as if he were drunk. He probably wouldn\u2019t even remember this encounter in the morning.</p><p>In which case . . . Why not?</p><p>Stretching up on her toes, she kissed his unshaven cheek. \u201cGood night, Ransom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He drew her close, and together they wobbled back and forth. \u201cNot what I meant. Isolde Ophelia Goodnight, kiss me. With every ounce of passion in your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Flustered, she swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I even know how.\u201d</p><p>The quirk of his lips was shameless. \u201cUse your imagination.\u201d</p><p>Now that was an invitation she\u2019d been waiting a lifetime to hear.</p><p>She pressed her lips to his, softly. He remained still, letting her do the kissing. She laced her arms around his neck, leaning close. She brushed lingering kisses over his upper lip, then the bottom. Just lightly, tenderly. Again and again.</p><p>These kisses . . . they were confessions. Tastes of everything she had stored inside her. Everything she could give a man if he was brave enough to accept. Kiss by kiss, she was baring herself to the soul.</p><p>Here is my soft caress.</p><p>Here is my patience.</p><p>Here is my understanding.</p><p>Here is my tender, beating heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He whispered her name, and the raw emotion in his voice undid her. His hands cinched the fabric at the small of her back. As though he needed her. Not only to remain standing, but to go on existing at all. \u201cIzzy.\u201d</p><p>Light footsteps sounded from the far end of the corridor.</p><p>\u201cMiss Goodnight?\u201d Miss Pelham\u2019s voice.</p> <p>Izzy pulled away from the kiss. His brow rested against hers. This was madness.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t be discovered like this. It would require too many explanations that would embarrass them both. \u201cMiss Goodnight, are you there?\u201d Miss Pelham was closer now.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace. I must go.\u201d</p><p>He held her tight, forbidding her to move. His breathing was still labored.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, he lifted his head. His eyes, unseeing as they were, seemed to narrow.</p><p>He\u2019d jolted back to himself, she could tell. A sudden lightning bolt had filled him with realizations: who he was, and who she was, and every reason he shouldn\u2019t be holding her.</p><p>With familiar brusqueness, he released her. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>That night, Ransom dreamed of dark hair and a lush, red mouth. And heat. Tight, wet heat moving over him, under him.</p><p>Yes.</p> <p>No.</p><p>No, no, no. He was waking.</p><p>Don\u2019t wake, he told his mind. Not all the way. Not yet.</p><p>He rolled onto his side. Keeping his eyes shut tight, he unbuttoned his breeches and curled a grip around the rigid column of his cock. He rarely felt like a frig anymore, despite how long he\u2019d gone without a woman.</p><p>Maybe release wouldn\u2019t elude him this time.</p><p>He stroked his hand up, then down. Slowly, at first. Then faster.</p><p>In his half-dream trance, he felt it as her grip. And then as her mouth. And then as her sweet, wet, tight . . .</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d</p> <p>Ransom jolted fully awake. Damn him to hell. He knew that husky voice.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Her tone was distracted.</p><p>What was she doing down here at this hour? Hopefully not watching with schoolgirl curiosity as he tugged away at his cock. He wasn\u2019t ashamed, precisely, but he wasn\u2019t eager to explain himself, either.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that your family\u2019s history is so fascinating.\u201d</p><p>He heard the flip of a page.</p><p>She\u2019d been reading a book. Not watching him.</p><p>He stretched back on his pallet and released a string of profanity. \u201cGood grief, Goodnight. It\u2019s too damn early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s morning. Almost. And I\u2019m reading this book Miss Pelham gave me about the history of the area. The Rothbury story is just marvelous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad my family\u2019s centuries of bloodshed, tyranny, and conniving amuse you.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, trying to make some sense of her. Visually, if not rationally.</p><p>She sat in profile, silhouetted by firelight, tucked into an armchair not five feet away. Her whole body made one pale, sensuous, spiraling curve. He glimpsed a bare foot dangling just over the seat\u2019s edge, twisting idly to and fro.</p><p>Her foot stopped. Stretched forward, with tantalizing slowness.</p><p>She turned another page. \u201cI\u2019ve only read through the fifth duke\u2019s imprisonment for treason. What happens next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was held in the Tower of London for years. Queen Mary held the throne just long enough to remove the charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cA stroke of luck there. I suppose they had to recover the castle by purchasing it back. That must be why the property was no longer entailed?\u201d</p><p>Ransom struggled to a sitting position, his loins still pulsing with unspent lust. He reached for his boots and began tugging them on. Judging by the faint gray cast of his vision, it had to be damned early. Barely daybreak. And if she\u2019d been sitting there reading for some time, as her cozy posture indicated, that must mean she\u2019d come down while it was still night.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling well this morning?\u201d Her question was cautious.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His answer was curt. Ransom left no room for further discussion. He couldn\u2019t abide thinking about last night\u2014couldn\u2019t begin to even make sense of it.</p><p>She set aside her book. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019ll only work until noon today. Miss Pelham is hiring housemaids in the village this morning, and we have plans to clear a dressing room in the afternoon. You\u2019re welcome to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he said in a low, warning tone. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to waste more time cleaning house.\u201d</p><p>She set the book aside. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with a goal here, Your Grace. You want to find out what\u2019s happened to your business affairs? Well, I want a home. Mornings will be correspondence, afternoons will be castle. If we do this my way, we both get what we want.\u201d</p><p>Ransom pushed a hand through his hair. He wanted about a thousand things he wasn\u2019t getting, and approximately nine hundred of them involved her lips.</p><p>If she was so interested in a cozy home, why wasn\u2019t she up in her room?</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong with your turret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all. I woke and . . . I suppose I was just a little cold. I came down to sit by the fire.\u201d</p><p>Then she made a strange, small sound.</p><p>\u201cTsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat noise you made. It sounded like a flea in the throes of passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. It was nothing. Just a sneeze.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a sneeze. No one sneezes like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, apparently.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cOh, dear. I\u2019m going to do it again.\u201d</p><p>Another muffled, high-pitched paroxysm, like a mouse shushing a vole. Then another.</p><p>\u201cTsh. Tsh.\u201d</p><p>Ransom winced at each one. \u201cGood God, that\u2019s disturbing.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be healthy. If you need to sneeze, sneeze properly.\u201d</p><p>She did it again. Three of them this time. Little twitchy sounds.</p><p>\u201cTsh! Tsh! Tsh! This is just how I sneeze,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. This castle is dusty. And the turret has a draft.\u201d</p><p>Now this was a problem. She couldn\u2019t do any secretarial work if she fell ill. And Ransom couldn\u2019t survive this cohabitation much longer unless she stayed in her room the whole night.</p><p>Very well. He would permit her a few afternoons of housecleaning. And tonight, he vowed, she would be warm and comfortable in her bed, and, most importantly, far away.</p><p>He made a mental note.</p><p>Procure some blankets. Thick ones.</p><p>He did procure blankets. Thick ones.</p><p>But the next morning, there she was again. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>And once again, Ransom jolted awake, with an aching cockstand and furious temper. He swore for a minute straight.</p><p>\u201cReading more history books?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWriting a letter.\u201d Her pen scratched across the page. \u201cI do have correspondence of my own, you know. Would you rather fight one hundred rat-sized elephants or one elephant-sized rat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, trying to clear it. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a question. If you had the choice, which would you rather do battle against? A hundred elephants the size of rats, or one rat the size of an elephant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be under the impression that you\u2019re making sense. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a practical question, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just for discussion. Lord Peregrine and I have been corresponding for years. In his letters, he always poses these silly conundrums, and we debate them back and forth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait. There\u2019s some lecherous old stick who writes you these letters directly? Why don\u2019t you tell the presumptuous rogue to go to the devil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s bedridden, poor thing. And he doesn\u2019t think of me as a woman, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>So this Lord Peregrine fellow had the imagination to picture battles with elephant-sized rats and rat-sized elephants, but he couldn\u2019t possibly think of Izzy Goodnight as a woman? On that point, Ransom was skeptical. Even if a man was bedridden, he was still a man.</p><p>With his injuries, there were many who\u2019d consider Ransom an invalid. He was still a man. Every morning that he woke to the husky softness of her voice, his cock went granite-hard in response.</p><p>\u201cSo which would it be?\u201d she went on. \u201cThe plague of tiny elephants or one giant rat? And as a corollary, what weapons would you choose?\u201d She tapped her pen nib against the table. \u201cI\u2019m torn, myself. The giant rat would seem easier to kill if I could thrust a sword straight in its heart. But then, what if I missed? Then I\u2019d be facing an enraged, wounded, giant rat.\u201d</p><p>Ransom had to give this Lord Peregrine one thing. His letters were excellent at withering lust.</p><p>\u201cTiny elephants would seem less lethal,\u201d she went on. \u201cHow much damage could two hundred miniature tusks wreak on a person, anyhow? Perhaps they\u2019d tire themselves out if I had good shin-plates. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re debating what sort of armor to wear to a miniature-elephant attack. I think that\u2019s madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you call madness, I call . . . creative thinking. You could benefit from some of that, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>He speared both hands through his hair. \u201cWhy are you down here at all? Write your letters upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a writing desk upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Today\u2019s task: Procure a writing desk.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>Ransom rubbed his face. \u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. This had to stop.</p><p>It had been almost a week now. Every day since she\u2019d arrived, he woke to the sounds of Izzy Goodnight all too near.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what time of night she was sneaking down here. He didn\u2019t want to know. He\u2019d taken up drinking himself into a nightly stupor to avoid knowing.</p><p>In the past few days, he\u2019d arranged for her to have a companion, blankets, a brazier, a writing desk. What more would it take to get her to stay in her damned room until a decent hour of morning?</p><p>A lock and chain, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cI thought of something,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cIt came to me last night, in bed. R-A-N-S-O-M.\u201d</p><p>He stretched a knot from his neck. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat first night, you said, \u2018Do I have to spell out the danger?\u2019 But then halfway through, you forgot how to spell danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget how to spell the word,\u201d he objected. \u201cI just got bored with the spelling of it.\u201d</p><p>The truth was, he wasn\u2019t as quick with words as he\u2019d once been. Especially when he grew fatigued.</p><p>These predawn conversations with Izzy Goodnight were extremely fatiguing.</p><p>\u201cWell, anyway. That\u2019s what you should have said.\u201d She lowered her voice to mimic his. \u201c \u2018Do I have to spell out the danger for you? R-A-N-S-O-M.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He scrubbed the sleep from his face with both hands. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019d never say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s perfect. Your name is the one word you can\u2019t forget how to spell.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, frowning. \u201cThis argument was days ago now. It\u2019s over. And you\u2019ve been thinking about this spelling nonsense ever since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s absurd. But that\u2019s always the way for me. I never think of the right thing to say until days later.\u201d She drifted closer to where he sat on his pallet. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to get back in the spirit of the moment now. But believe me, \u2018R-A-N-S-O-M\u2019 would have been the perfect retort.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t begin to decide how to answer that. So he didn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI made tea,\u201d she said.</p><p>She drew very near him. Too near. His whole body went on alert, and his blood pounded in his ears.</p><p>Then she bent down and set the mug of tea on the table. \u201cJust to the right of your elbow.\u201d</p> <p>He could feel heat. Probably the tea, but maybe her. He was vibrating between the desire to clutch her close and the instinct to push her away. A muscle quivered in his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou have a bit of fluff just here.\u201d Her fingers teased through his hair, sending ripples of sensation down his spine. When he flinched, she said softly, \u201cHold still. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>No, you won\u2019t.</p><p>He caught her wrist. And then he caught her in his arms, tugging her down to his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, breathless.</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I doing? What the devil are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Her hips wriggled, taunting him.</p><p>He held her tighter still, immobile. \u201cYou come down here and torment me at the crack of every dawn. Now you\u2019re making me tea. And flicking fluff. Is this some kind of coddling? I don\u2019t want any coddling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not coddling. It\u2019s not meant to be tormenting, either. I just . . . enjoy greeting you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>Ransom would have believed just about any other excuse. But she couldn\u2019t expect him to credit that she stole down here in the misty, early dawn for the pleasure of his company.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Every time you wake up, you let fly the most marvelous string of curses. It\u2019s never the same twice, do you know that? It\u2019s so intriguing. You\u2019re like a rooster that crows blasphemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s a cock crowing, all right,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She smiled, and he heard it. Or felt it, somehow. The warmth was inside him before he could shut it out.</p><p>She said, \u201cBut that\u2019s what I like most, you see. No one ever talks that way to me. You\u2019re so crude and profane. I . . . I know it\u2019s absurd, but I can\u2019t help it. I find it perversely delightful.\u201d</p><p>She liked crude? She wanted profane?</p><p>Very well, then. Crude and profane he could give her.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. When a man wakes, he wakes wanting. He wakes hard and rude and aching with need.\u201d He shifted, pressing his massive erection against her hip. \u201cDo you feel that?\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wants in you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn . . . in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In you. Hard, deep, fast, and completely. Now don\u2019t wake me at this hour again unless you\u2019ve found the perfect retort to that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Good.</p><p>He hoped this time she was well and truly alarmed. Because he was alarmed. The pent-up need in his body felt near some kind of breaking point, and he had enough broken parts already.</p><p>The most frightening part of all?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to let her go.</p><p>In all his years of bedding women by night, Ransom made certain he never woke up with them in the morning. Now he was waking up to this woman\u2014this strange, eccentric, tempting woman\u2014every morning, and he wasn\u2019t even getting the pleasure of bedding her first.</p><p>It was intolerable. Unjust. And very worrisome. Because he was starting to grow accustomed to her.</p><p>Damn, he was starting to like her. It felt so easy, sitting here, wreathed in the aromas of tea and morning mist. One arm about her slender waist, whilst with the other hand he teased her\u2014</p><p>Bloody hell.</p><p>Somehow, he\u2019d wound a lock of her hair about his finger. There it was. Right This Moment. And he had no recollection of doing it, either.</p><p>What was he coming to, when a woman sat in his lap, he gave her a stern what-for . . . and then ten seconds later, oopsy-daisy and la-di-dah, he went and twirled a finger in her hair?</p><p>That was not ducal behavior. It certainly wasn\u2019t normal behavior for him.</p><p>He tried to nonchalantly withdraw his finger from its embarrassing predicament, but he recoiled too quickly. The curling strand of hair tightened around his knuckle like a slipknot.</p><p>He tried again, pulling harder. Panic began to build in his chest.</p><p>Dear God, it wouldn\u2019t let him go.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered, shushing him. \u201cDo you feel that?\u201d</p><p>He felt a lot of things. Far too many things.</p><p>\u201cIt almost seems as if the ground is trembling.\u201d</p><p>Oh. That. Yes, now that she mentioned it, he did feel the shiver in the soles of his feet. The ground was trembling. Someone was approaching in the drive.</p><p>Not just someone, but many someones.</p><p>He discerned not only hoofbeats but the smoother clack of carriage wheels.</p><p>Ransom shut his eyes and quickly reviewed England\u2019s recent military history. The Danes, Napoleon, the Americans . . . all those conflicts had been settled, last he knew. But then, he had been living in isolation.</p><p>He asked, \u201cIn the past seven months, has England entered any new wars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because by now the vibration had become so intense, he could have believed the castle was under siege.</p><p>She clutched his arm. \u201cGoodness. What is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going mad, or . . . ?\u201d He trained his ear. \u201cWas that a trumpet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d she breathed. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss the ominous note in her voice. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She leapt from his embrace and began pacing the floor. \u201cI knew it. I knew it would happen eventually, but I didn\u2019t think it would be so soon.\u201d</p><p>He stood and took her by the shoulders, holding her in one place. He might be blinded, weakened, and on the verge of madness\u2014but while there was still life in him, no harm would come to a woman living under his roof.</p><p>\u201cBe calm,\u201d he said. \u201cJust tell me what you\u2019re on about. At once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them. They\u2019ve found me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Who\u2019s found you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Izzy winced at the prospect of spilling the truth. Within minutes, there wouldn\u2019t be any hiding it. But the duke wasn\u2019t going to like this. Not at all.</p><p>She was preparing to explain when Ransom took her by the shoulders.</p><p>His brow was stern. \u201cNow listen to me. I don\u2019t know who they are or what they want from you. But while there\u2019s breath in my lungs and strength in my body, I swear this much: I won\u2019t let you come to harm.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>There he went again, making her knees go weak. Never in her life had Izzy been on the receiving end of such a pledge. At least, not one made spontaneously, and most certainly not delivered by such a man as this.</p><p>Words were momentarily beyond her. His protective promises had left her feeling rather dizzy. And a little bit guilty for worrying him so.</p><p>But only a little bit.</p><p>\u201cIt is an invasion,\u201d she said, \u201cbut a friendly one. We\u2019re getting a visit from the Moranglian Army. Come see, if you can.\u201d</p><p>She brought him to the gallery of windows that looked out onto the courtyard.</p><p>There, visible through the archway, were approximately a score of mounted riders, followed by three coaches drawn by teams. The armored riders dismounted in unison, and the carriage doors opened, spilling forth about a dozen young ladies in medieval dress. Banners waved briskly in the morning breeze. Izzy couldn\u2019t make out the words emblazoned on them, but she didn\u2019t need to. She knew what they said.</p><p>Doubt not.</p><p>\u201cWho are these people?\u201d Ransom asked, as the riders and ladies walked through the archway and into the courtyard. \u201cWhat the hell do they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, my father\u2019s more enthusiastic readers call themselves Moranglians. They have clubs and circular letters to share their news. And the particularly dedicated Moranglians . . . well, some of them take it a bit further. They enjoy dressing as the characters, acting out battles and scenes. They\u2019re very well organized. There\u2019s an oath they take, and badges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that god-awful clanking I hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s armor.\u201d</p><p>She risked a glance at the duke\u2019s face.</p><p>As expected, he looked revolted. \u201cArmor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it makes no sense to you.\u201d She reached for her embroidered shawl. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to approve of it. Just don\u2019t disparage them.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping her shawl about her shoulders, Izzy leaned out the window and waved. \u201cGood people of Moranglia!\u201d</p><p>All the young men and women assembled in the courtyard turned and looked up at her. The knights, with their makeshift armor, fell into a formation.</p><p>One stepped forward and performed a deep genuflection. \u201cMy lady. I am Sir Wendell Butterfield, first knight of the West Yorkshire Riding Knights of Moranglia, also representing our sisters, the local chapter of Cressida\u2019s Handmaidens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your party have traveled far, Sir Wendell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have. Do I have the honor of addressing Miss Izzy Goodnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s I,\u201d she called down, smiling. \u201cMiss Izzy Goodnight. Your knights and ladies are most welcome here.\u201d</p><p>While the crowd below cheered, Ransom made a gagging noise. \u201cThere you are with that treacly voice again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she chided, speaking out of the corner of her mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t spoil it for them. They mean well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they mean well, showing up unannounced this early in the morning? What on earth can they want of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a visit, most likely. Perhaps a quick tour of the castle. But I won\u2019t know for certain until I go ask, will I?\u201d</p><p>She called down to Sir Wendell. \u201cGood Sir Wendell, please be at ease. I\u2019ll come thither anon.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her. \u201cWait. You can\u2019t let all those fancy-dress fools tromp through my castle. Thithering and anon-ing. I\u2019m not having it, Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my castle. And I\u2019m not inviting them for a house party, but I will show a modicum of hospitality toward my guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are not guests. They\u2019re uninvited intruders. Don\u2019t ask them anything. Tell them to go.\u201d He gestured in the direction of the dwindling, yet still-massive, heap of correspondence. \u201cIf you mean to claim this as your castle, there\u2019s a great deal of work to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork will have to wait.\u201d She shrugged away from him, moving toward the front entrance. \u201cThey\u2019ve come all this distance. I can\u2019t turn them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly you can. It\u2019s bad enough that they pester you with letters and questions. Draw a line, Goodnight. Go out there and tell them you\u2019re a grown woman who can sling about the word \u2018cock\u2019 with the ease of a courtesan, and you don\u2019t appreciate unannounced visits. Then invite them to sod off, the bunch of clanking idiots. If you won\u2019t, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Panicked, Izzy put a hand to his chest, stopping him in his paces. \u201cYour Grace, please. I won\u2019t invite them inside the castle if you don\u2019t like. I\u2019ll send them away as quickly as I can. Just promise me you\u2019ll stay upstairs, out of sight. Let me deal with this. Trust me when I tell you, you don\u2019t want these people to see your face.\u201d</p><p>Ransom clenched his jaw.</p><p>So. His wrecked face wasn\u2019t as disgusting as he\u2019d been thinking all these months.</p><p>It was worse.</p><p>Apparently, he was such a horrifying monster, he needed to be locked away in the tower, lest he frighten the tenderhearted fools currently filling his courtyard.</p><p>Well. At least now he knew.</p><p>And today, his terrifying looks would be put to some use. He was going to clear out these intruders himself.</p><p>He pushed past her and exited the great hall, heading for the exterior stairs.</p><p>\u201cWait. Ransom, please.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, striding forward to stand on the topmost step. The crowd hushed at once. He heard a few gasps, and not all of them feminine, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Good.</p><p>\u201cThis is my castle.\u201d His voice rang from the stones. \u201cRouse yourselves and begone.\u201d</p><p>He swept his vision over the assembled inanity. The young ladies at the edges were a colorful assortment of blurs. Their gowns trailed behind them on the ground. The \u201cknights\u201d were a clash of metallic glints and silver flares.</p> <p>Any moment now, they\u2019d all run away. Exit through the archway like a rainbow pouring through a sieve. Any moment now.</p><p>Moments later, he was still waiting. They didn\u2019t run away.</p><p>At last, the one called Sir Wendell found his voice. \u201cAll knights, salute!\u201d</p><p>A bang echoed through the courtyard, as if they\u2019d all thumped their fists against their armored chests in unison.</p><p>\u201cAll knights, kneel.\u201d</p> <p>With a wince-inducing clanking, the knights went down on one knee.</p><p>\u201cOur liege. We are honored.\u201d</p><p>What . . . the . . . devil.</p><p>They were supposed to run away screaming. Instead, they were kneeling and saluting. Ransom couldn\u2019t understand it. Just what was going on here?</p><p>Miss Goodnight joined him, but she didn\u2019t offer any explanation. \u201cSir Wendell, how can we be of help this morn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are on our way to the annual North Regional tournament, Miss Goodnight. Someone informed us of your presence in the neighborhood, and we couldn\u2019t resist stopping by. We had . . . no idea.\u201d</p> <p>No idea of what, Ransom wondered. No idea of decorum? No idea of common sense?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be on our way,\u201d Sir Wendell promised. \u201cBut might we trouble you for so long as it takes to rest and water our horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please do visit the village!\u201d Miss Pelham joined them on the step, breathless. She must have thrown on her frock and dashed down the stairs. As usual, she wouldn\u2019t miss any chance to promote the goods and services of the parish.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a half mile down the road,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way. The stables here at the castle are small, but the inn in Woolington can offer you fresh water, hay. There\u2019s a smith, if you need him. And a pub that serves a fine breakfast. The village would be most happy for your custom.\u201d</p><p>Sir Wendell bowed. \u201cAn excellent suggestion. Thank you, Miss . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPelham. Miss Abigail Pelham. My father is the local vicar.\u201d</p><p>Yes, indeed, Ransom silently concurred. Thank you, Miss Pelham. By this point, he didn\u2019t care who convinced these people to go. Just so long as they went.</p><p>As the knights gathered and made plans to depart, one of the young ladies approached them on the stairs. \u201cMiss Goodnight, please. While the men take the horses to the village, might we stay here? We would so love to have a visit with you. Perhaps a chance to see your castle?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the castle isn\u2019t fit for visitors just yet,\u201d Miss Goodnight answered quickly, and sweetly. \u201cBut perhaps you\u2019d be so good as to join me for a walk in the castle park? There are some romantic-looking ruins I\u2019ve been yearning to explore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! That sounds divine.\u201d The girl motioned to her friends, and all dozen of them rushed up the stairs.</p><p>A girl in some shade of blue or violet sidled up on Ransom\u2019s right. \u201cYou will walk with us, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you must join us.\u201d A young woman in white took his left side, boldly threading her arm through his.</p><p>Before he knew what was happening, Ransom was swept along as they set out on a walk through the castle park. Magnus trotted along at his heel.</p><p>Damn his eyes. Why was he taking a walk? He didn\u2019t want to take a walk. But no one left him a choice. He was surrounded. And very confused.</p><p>He\u2019d never had difficulty attracting female attention before his injury. But those attracted to him were women\u2014worldly and self-possessed. Not impressionable, silly girls. And was he going mad, or had they simply not noticed the scar mangling one side of his face?</p><p>Good Lord. One of them pinched his arse. Then all of them giggled.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you say it for us?\u201d the girl in blue urged him.</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she whispered coyly. \u201cSay \u2018Doubt not.\u2019 Won\u2019t you, please? We\u2019ve been dreaming of it since we were little girls.\u201d</p><p>Their group drew to a halt in the overgrown garden. The whole gaggle of ladies went breathless with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cDoubt not,\u201d he echoed, hardly understanding why.</p><p>A chorus of feminine sighs rose up.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d swooned one. \u201cThat voice. Be still my heart. It\u2019s so romantic.\u201d</p><p>God above. This couldn\u2019t be real. It had to be some kind of nightmare.</p><p>\u201cHandmaidens,\u201d Miss Goodnight called out in that childish, innocent voice, \u201cdo you see it there in the distance? The ruined folly. Do dash ahead, if you will. I\u2019m so keen to see who can pick the largest posy of briar roses by the time I meet you there.\u201d</p><p>With a little squeal, the dozen young ladies picked up their skirts and dashed ahead, racing one another toward the horizon.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Miss Goodnight said. \u201cThey\u2019re occupied for a few minutes, at least. Now I can explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had better explain. What the hell is going on? What\u2019s this \u2018doubt not\u2019 nonsense?\u201d</p><p>She took his arm, and they began walking toward the folly. Slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a famous speech from The Goodnight Tales. Ulric recites it to Cressida just before he leaves on a quest. \u2018Doubt not, my lady, I shall return.\u2019 It goes on and on. Doubt not my steel, my strength, my heart . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do they want me to say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t like to hear this,\u201d she said, sounding doleful. \u201cBut you bear a certain resemblance to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I look like Ulric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Just uncannily so. Broad shoulders, longish golden brown hair, unshaven . . . You\u2019re a near-perfect match, straight down to the weathered boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Ransom frowned. So this was why she wanted him to hide upstairs. \u201cSurely this Ulric character doesn\u2019t have a scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does, as a matter of fact. Ever since episode thirty-four, when he battled the Shadow Knight in the forest of Banterwick.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled slowly. This was all starting to make sense to him. Sick, stomach-turning sense.</p><p>He pulled her to a halt, turning her to face him.</p><p>His eyes were good this morning. As good as they ever were now. He could avoid the stump in his path and make out the vague shapes of the trees and ruined archways, if not the color or form of the birds winging through them.</p><p>It was the cruelest of temptations, seeing this much of her and knowing he\u2019d never see more.</p><p>He could make out the wide, reddish curve of her mouth and that aura of dark hair, set against the pale . . . was it yellow? . . . of her frock. But he couldn\u2019t see well enough to judge her emotions.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all a little story in your mind. Since the day you arrived, you\u2019ve been living out some bizarre fantasy. Your own little castle, and your own scarred, tortured Ulric. That\u2019s why you won\u2019t leave this place and why you won\u2019t let me be. Why you come down every morning and watch me sleep. I\u2019m like a plaything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested. He could see her head shake vigorously. \u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019m not living in a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet one thing clear, Miss Goodnight. You had better not be forming expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpectations of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf me. Of us. Of romance. Just because you grew up on all those fanciful stories, don\u2019t think this is one of them. I won\u2019t be a party to any of this. I\u2019m not the shining hero in disguise.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled audibly. \u201cI know. I know. You\u2019re a dangerous ravisher, with brothel bills as long as my arm. Really, I can\u2019t imagine you have any remaining ways to communicate the message, short of stitching \u2018A WARNING TO WOMEN\u2019 on your breeches placket. I\u2019m not a ninny. It\u2019s understood. I have not cast you in any chivalric fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no? Then why did you kiss me like that the first night?\u201d</p><p>Her reply was slow in coming. \u201cJust . . . how did I kiss you the first night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wanted to,\u201d he accused. \u201cLike you\u2019d always wanted to. Like you\u2019d spent years waiting for just that kiss. From me.\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with one hand and moaned. \u201cWhy must this be so mortifying? Oh, that\u2019s right. Because it\u2019s my life.\u201d</p><p>Ransom kept silent, waiting for an explanation.</p><p>She lowered her hand. \u201cBelieve me, Your Grace. You will never meet another woman with fewer expectations of romance. You\u2019ve seen how Lord Archer and Miss Pelham and all these people treat me\u2014like a na\u00efve little girl. Everyone\u2019s always treated me that way. I\u2019ve never had even one suitor. So yes, I kissed you like I\u2019d been waiting to kiss you all my life. Because I\u2019d been waiting to kiss someone all my life. Yours just happened to be the lips that met mine.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kiss me like that was your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She turned and resumed walking. \u201cI kissed you like it would be my last.\u201d</p><p>Her last?</p><p>The words kept tumbling through his mind as they walked toward the ruined folly. He could scarcely fathom the absurdity of them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve crammed your brain so full of fairy tales, you\u2019ve squeezed out all the common sense. You\u2019re clever, quick, attractive. Men should be clamoring for you.\u201d</p><p>She took his arm and nudged him to the side, around an obstacle in their path. \u201cMy life thus far has featured a distinct lack of any such clamoring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only because you\u2019re stuck living in your father\u2019s soppy stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only that.\u201d She started to drift away.</p><p>He tightened his arm, keeping her close at his side. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, she had to be made to understand. He couldn\u2019t let her go walking about the world, believing that no more kisses were waiting for her. Or worse\u2014that she shouldn\u2019t go searching them out. She didn\u2019t belong in this castle, hiding away for the rest of her life until she withered to dust. That was his fate, not hers.</p><p>\u201cRansom,\u201d she whispered, \u201cdon\u2019t you understand? It doesn\u2019t matter what these girls suggest or giggle about. I don\u2019t see you as Ulric. Ulric is honorable and decent, and you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot.\u201d With an impatient wave of his hand, he batted her words away. \u201cWe\u2019ve established that.\u201d</p><p>She tried again. \u201cIn the stories, which every reasonable person knows are just stories, Ulric loves Cressida with a pure, gallant, ridiculously chaste heart. They trade longing glances from opposite turrets. They send little notes back and forth through their servants. In twelve years, they\u2019ve kissed exactly twice. If I wanted a man who was anything like Ulric, I wouldn\u2019t have thrown myself at you that first night. I wouldn\u2019t sit pondering the exact measurements that make up \u2018magnificence.\u2019 And I surely as anything wouldn\u2019t spend hours staring into the darkness every night, dreaming of how your hands would feel against my bare skin.\u201d</p><p>What? Her confessions bounced right off his defensive bluster.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense.\u201d</p><p>She growled in frustration. \u201cI know I\u2019m not. It makes no sense at all. I\u2019m not a silly little girl who dreams of knights. I\u2019m a woman. A woman who\u2019s inconveniently, completely, and for the first time in her life, in lust. Just burning with desire for the worst possible man. A profane, bitter, wounded duke who refuses to leave her house. Oh, you are dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want my hands on your body.\u201d</p><p>A faint whimper escaped her throat. \u201cEverywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Desire pounded through his veins. He was seized by the urge to tumble her into the grass, right then and there, and strip her of every scrap of clothing. She wanted to be touched. He wanted to touch her. There was nothing holding them back.</p><p>Nothing, that was, save for a dozen giggling, foolish handmaidens who wanted to sprinkle them with wild-rose petals.</p><p>How did one get rid of these girls? They were like fanned-away horseflies. They just kept coming back.</p> <p>He raised his voice. \u201cHandmaidens, gather round.\u201d</p><p>Once they\u2019d assembled in a loose, giggling circle, he clapped his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s have a game, shall we? We\u2019ll call it \u2018Rescue the Maiden.\u2019 Miss Goodnight will count to one hundred. All of you, go run and hide\u2014and wait for your dashing Ulric to save you. No cheating, now. You mustn\u2019t peek.\u201d</p><p>The handmaidens disappeared before he could have counted three, laughing and tripping over their hems as they darted through archways and ducked around hedges.</p><p>Izzy shook her head. \u201cVery well. You win this point. I will concede, these particular girls may be just a little bit stupid.\u201d</p><p>Ransom wasn\u2019t interested in scoring points on silly girls. The moment all the handmaidens were gone, he caught Izzy in his arms and dragged her inside the ruined folly.</p> <p>\u201cWe have until one hundred. Start counting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. Two. Thr\u2014\u201d</p><p>He drew her close and claimed her mouth with his. He gave her no chance to demur but boldly swept his tongue between her lips, stealing her breath. He tilted his head, pushing deeper.</p><p>And once again, she kissed him back. If he\u2019d been standing, his knees would have buckled.</p><p>She was so instinctively passionate. So unbearably sweet.</p><p>This was madness. He knew it. She knew it, too. If he gave her a moment to reply, she would likely tell him so.</p> <p>But nothing needed to make rational sense. There were no minds in this, only bodies and heat. This was something both of them wanted. Hell, it was something he needed. To touch, to tease, to taste. To explore her with his mouth and hands. Kiss her breathless. Feel powerful and alive.</p><p>Because there\u2019d been a time, not so long ago, when he thought he\u2019d never get back to this place: A woman\u2019s body soft and yielding against his, and the warm summer sun beating down on them both.</p><p>This was life.</p><p>Bright, brilliant life amid the ruins.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>This was some kind of miracle.</p><p>Here they were, in this ruined folly, where so many couples before them must have kissed and embraced. She was surrounded by true romantic legacy\u2014and for once, Izzy wasn\u2019t left out of it.</p><p>Not anymore.</p> <p>She relaxed, letting her weight rest against the mossy stones as Ransom trailed hot kisses along her neck.</p><p>He drew his hand along her body, sweeping a possessive touch over her waist and hip before settling his palm over her breast.</p><p>He paused there, as though he expected her to flinch or pull away.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to do either. His touch awakened all her senses to anticipation, possibility.</p><p>Around them, birds whistled and chirped. All sorts of mosses, ferns, and ivies had sunk their green teeth into the stones, sprouting life from the smallest, most inhospitable places. Flowers poured their perfume into the air.</p><p>Izzy seemed to be blossoming, too. Her whole body felt flushed and pink. Ripe for his touch.</p><p>This was her summer, after years and years of spring.</p><p>She went on counting in a fevered, insensate whisper. \u201cSixteen, seventeen, eightee\u2014\u201d</p><p>When he kissed her again, she tilted her head and slid her tongue forward to toy with his.</p><p>He moaned. And his fingers curled around her breast, gently kneading her softness through the fabric.</p><p>As he touched her, Izzy did some touching of her own. She explored the muscled contours of his forearm, all roped strength and corded sinew. She slid her hand higher, feeling the massive biceps beneath his coat sleeve. He flexed the muscle on instinct. Or on purpose. Who could tell with this man? Either way, Izzy found it ridiculously thrilling. All that power in his body, and the way he could use it to explore and pleasure her.</p><p>A soft, surprised laugh escaped her. \u201cI\u2019d given up on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven up on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis. All of this. Surprise benefactors, mysterious castles, romantic ruins, forbidden kisses.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her neck. \u201cWhat else have you given up on, Izzy Goodnight? This?\u201d He flicked her earlobe with his tongue. \u201cMaybe this?\u201d He nipped with his teeth. \u201cMake a list, and we\u2019ll go through it line by line.\u201d</p><p>She let her head fall to the side, offering him more of her neck to kiss. \u201cWhat haven\u2019t I given up on? Marriage, children, lasting love, manageable hair. Being truly understood by anyone.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the poor man. He recoiled, his face ashen.</p><p>Izzy was utterly convinced. Never mind Arabian horses, African cheetahs. No creature in the world could bolt so quickly as a rake confronted with the word \u201cmarriage.\u201d They ought to shout it out at footraces rather than using starting pistols.</p><p>Ready, steady . . . matrimony!</p><p>\u201cI was joking,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cI knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to ever marry. I certainly wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever\u2014\u201d Gads, now she was making him sound unlovable. \u201cNot with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Exactly. And I don\u2019t know a damned thing about ladies\u2019 hair.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cGoodnight, this isn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis. It\u2019s only this. I know.\u201d She put her arms around his neck. \u201cNo expectations. Just go back to touching me?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled with relief. \u201cThat I can do.\u201d</p><p>Yes. That he could do very well indeed.</p><p>His thumb found her nipple, and he teased it through the muslin, drawing the peak to a taut, aching nub. The sensations coursing through Izzy\u2019s body were unlike anything she\u2019d ever known. How was it possible, that his thumb could idly slide back and forth across that one tiny part of her, and she could feel it in the roots of her hair and the backs of her knees?</p><p>When his thumb abandoned the peak, and she wanted to weep.</p><p>But then he slid his touch to the other side, and the sweet torture began all over again. She was afraid her knees would buckle with it, so she clung tight to his neck, weaving her fingers into his hair.</p><p>He was driving all thoughts from her head, leaving her with the intellect of a pudding. She was just a quivering mound of sensation, capped by that red, ripe berry of a nipple that he rolled beneath his thumb. Again and again and again.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Just when she thought she\u2019d dissolve into a puddle at his boots, his hands slid to her waist. With a low, thrilling growl, he pressed her against the stone wall, pinning her there with his body.</p><p>Izzy was breathless. Trapped. This should have made her wild to get free. But she loved the feeling, bracketed by such intoxicating strength. The stones at her back had stood in place for centuries, and the man before her had survived unknown trials. She could melt with fear or bliss, and they would hold her together\u2014this wall, this man.</p><p>He groaned, clutching her hips. A hard, heated something pressed against her middle.</p><p>Her eyes flew open. Her knowledge of lovemaking was rather like a sieve. She caught the general idea, even if detail and nuance slipped through. Still, she understood this much. That a man\u2019s organ grew . . . emboldened . . . when he wished to make love.</p><p>This firm, long ridge of heat against her belly . . .</p><p>It meant he wanted her. Magnificently.</p><p>He pushed her shawl from her shoulders. It fell to the ground. He slid his fingers along her collarbone, dipping under the edge of her sleeve and slipping it down her bare shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou stopped counting,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow can I count when you\u2019re\u2014\u201d She gasped as he scooped her breast straight out of her stays. Cool air rushed over her exposed nipple. \u201cHow can I count when you\u2019re doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll help.\u201d He bent his head, trailing kisses down her chest until he reached her bared breast. His tongue flickered over her nipple. \u201cThirty-one.\u201d Another lick. \u201cThirty-two.\u201d Lick. \u201cThirty-three.\u201d</p><p>The alternating heat of his mouth and the coolness of the air . . . She must have gooseflesh everywhere, including the soles of her feet. If he\u2019d continued on in such a manner, Izzy might have incinerated before she reached the count of forty-five.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t continue. Instead, he drew her nipple into his mouth and suckled hard.</p><p>After that, numbers had no meaning.</p><p>How many counts were in forever? That\u2019s how long she wanted this to last. His tongue made lazy, delicious circles around her nipple, driving her mindless with pleasure. Oh, he was good at this. Very good indeed.</p><p>Then he sank to his knees, sending one hand to delve under her skirts.</p><p>When he grasped her leg, Izzy panicked.</p><p>She clutched at his shoulders, holding him off. \u201cNinety-nine, one hundred.\u201d</p><p>He paused, one hand frozen in the act of rucking up her petticoats and the other encircling her ankle.</p><p>\u201cYou said everywhere,\u201d he reminded her, in a low, wicked voice.</p><p>\u201cI did say everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thundered in her chest. He was giving her the chance to refuse, and everything in her upbringing screamed at her to take it.</p><p>But she only had this one life. And so far, in this one life, she had only had this one man show the least bit of interest in tossing her petticoats to her waist.</p><p>This could be her one and only chance.</p><p>It was just a bit of touching, she told herself. Harmless. It wasn\u2019t as though he could deflower her here, with a dozen handmaidens hiding nearby.</p><p>\u201cHave you changed your mind?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something that sounded like, \u201cThank God.\u201d He gathered her skirts in one hand and hiked them to her waist with a single, expert motion.</p><p>Izzy reclined against the wall and stretched her arms overhead, feeling wanton and daring. As he ran his hands over her stockinged calf and up her thigh, she let her legs fall just slightly apart.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he groaned. \u201cOpen for me. Just like that. Lovely, lovely.\u201d</p><p>Impossible, impossible.</p><p>That\u2019s what Izzy would have thought about this entire scene just a fortnight ago. She felt like a pagan goddess in an ancient temple. Reclining against the ivy-covered wall of a ruined folly, being ravished in full morning light by a scarred, sensual duke.</p><p>This was beyond anything she\u2019d ever dreamed. And Izzy had a vivid imagination. She reeled from the sheer joy of his touch and the exquisite wickedess of . . . of everything.</p><p>A new, throbbing pulse started to thrum between her legs. Hurry, it beat. Hurry, hurry.</p><p>His hand slid up her thigh, skipping over the garter and proceeding on to the smooth slope of her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cSo soft.\u201d He kissed her just above the knee. \u201cLike satin.\u201d</p><p>As his touch swept closer to her sex, the building crescendo of pleasure was unbearable.</p><p>Higher . . . higher . . . and a little higher still.</p><p>Until his thumb grazed her there.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>A rocket of bliss shot through her, racking her from toes to scalp. She clenched her fists, tugging on the ivy branches for support lest her quivering thighs give away.</p><p>A dusting of white grit showered down on them both.</p><p>Ransom looked up. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. I think a bit of the wall is crumbling.\u201d She released her grip on the ivy, but another few pebbles shook loose.</p><p>\u201cThen come away from there.\u201d He rose to his feet, letting her skirts fall back to the ground, and tucked her close to his chest.</p><p>Thunk. An apple-sized chunk of wall tumbled loose and hit him square on the head.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness! Ransom!\u201d</p><p>He cursed and recoiled, pressing the heel of his hand to the wound as he staggered backward to sit in the grass. Magnus circled him, whining. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Izzy rushed to kneel by his side. A fresh bump was already swelling, and a small patch of his skin was scraped raw. It was on the unscarred side of his brow. She didn\u2019t know whether that made things better or worse.</p><p>It was almost funny when she considered it. She\u2019d been rescued from ruination by . . . ruins.</p><p>She picked up her forgotten shawl and pressed the folded edge to his brow. \u201cAre you all right? Are you dizzy? Look at me, and tell me how many\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She bit off the absurd question. Of course he couldn\u2019t tell how many fingers she was holding up.</p><p>Unless . . .</p><p>Unless he\u2019d experienced some sudden cure. She\u2019d heard it could happen. Soldiers blinded in battle, having their vision returned to them after one good knock on the head.</p><p>\u201cDo you have all your usual faculties?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p><p>He clenched his jaw. \u201cMy ears are ringing, and my head is a throbbing knot of pain. But I can\u2019t see any more or less than I could ten minutes ago. If that\u2019s your question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Good. I mean, not good, of course. I just hope you\u2019re not too hurt, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Izzy sighed. She was a horrible, horrible person. He told her he hadn\u2019t experienced a miraculous restoration of his vision, and her first, instinctive reaction was relief? What kind of person would actually wish for a man\u2019s continued blindness?</p><p>A plain kind of person. One who was enjoying feeling attractive for the first time in her life.</p><p>But that was no excuse.</p><p>In an attempt to atone for her selfishness, she brushed aside his overlong hair and began dabbing at the bloody scrape on his head.</p><p>He shied away. \u201cYou\u2019re always fussing over me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not fussing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m blotting. If you like, I can disparage you while I do it. How about this: Ungrateful man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBewitching she-devil.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. It would seem his personality was intact, and she was glad of it. No member of the Moranglian Army would ever call her \u201ctemptress\u201d or \u201cbewitching.\u201d And coming from lips so finely formed, she didn\u2019t even mind \u201cshe-devil.\u201d</p><p>He took the wadded shawl from her grasp and applied to his own head. \u201cFirst weasels, now stoning. Are you working from a list of archaic torture methods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must admit, you are bleeding through my supply of clean linen at an alarming rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy face is already a wreck. Another lump can only improve it.\u201d He lowered the cloth. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>She tested his bruise with her fingertips. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a bump, but the swelling isn\u2019t too awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that.\u201d He turned his head, giving her his profile\u2014and a full view of his twisting scar. \u201cThe rest. How bad is it? Tell me honestly.\u201d</p> <p>Izzy fell quiet, stunned by his sudden earnestness. He was anxious about his looks?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see it for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered where I rank in the spectrum between flawed Adonis and ghastly horror. Clearly, I can\u2019t judge by these silly chits\u2019 reactions, addled as they are by your father\u2019s writing. It will have to be you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart twisted in her chest. How could he doubt himself? In full daylight, he was magnificent. His skin seemed to be bronzing by the moment, soaking up every bit of the day\u2019s warmth. The sunlight caught the golden streaks in his hair\u2014hair that was overlong, sprawling over his brow in a rakish fashion. She wondered now at the reason. Was it that he simply couldn\u2019t be bothered to let Duncan cut it, or did he purposely grow it long to obscure his scarred face?</p><p>Reaching forward, she brushed the sweep of tawny hair from his brow. \u201cWill you tell me how it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was struck. With something big and sharp.\u201d</p><p>Izzy supposed that was what she deserved. Ask a straightforward question, receive a straightforward answer.</p><p>She traced the scar with her fingertip, all the way from his brow to his cheekbone, then let her touch linger on his unshaven cheek. How ironic that the blow had just missed his right eye but taken the sight from both.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s plain to see that you were once a devastatingly handsome man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow . . .\u201d She sighed. \u201cI really hate to say it. Don\u2019t make me say it.\u201d</p><p>His hand caught her wrist. \u201cJust say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you are a devastatingly handsome man with an impressive scar. That is the unhappy truth. I wish I could tell you otherwise. You will be impossible now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d He released her, looking bewildered. \u201cBut that first day. When you saw me, you swooned.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cYour face did not make me swoon. I was already feeling faint. I hadn\u2019t eaten anything but a few crusts of bread for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the scars don\u2019t frighten you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>The words were a lie. The truth was, his scars did frighten her\u2014but only a little, and only because they tempted her to care. Even now, her heart was softening in her chest, faster than a lump of butter left in the sun.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let this happen. It was all well and good to say \u201cno expectations,\u201d but Izzy knew how her affection-starved heart worked. She was so desperate to love and be loved, she could sprout tender feelings toward a rock. And rocks didn\u2019t call her \u201cbewitching\u201d or \u201ctemptress.\u201d Rocks didn\u2019t have touchable golden brown hair.</p><p>But rocks and Ransom did have something in common.</p><p>Neither one would love her back.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been at least one hundred counts, and the girls are waiting.\u201d</p><p>He stood and brushed dust from his breeches and coat. \u201cI\u2019ll make my own way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d The moment the words left her lips, Izzy cringed, regretting how they sounded. Of course he was able to walk back on his own. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the handmaidens are waiting for their hero to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019d best keep waiting for some other man.\u201d He moved past her. \u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s hero, Miss Goodnight. You\u2019d do well to remember it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Miss Goodnight. Is that you?\u201d</p><p>Izzy froze, perched on tiptoe.</p><p>Drat.</p><p>After several hours of walking, talking, counting wild roses, and fending off questions about two Ulrics, Izzy had finally bid a warm farewell to the handmaidens and the Knights of Moranglia. She\u2019d been hoping to sneak back into the castle unnoticed. So much for that plan.</p><p>At least it wasn\u2019t the duke who\u2019d caught her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that in your hands, Miss Goodnight?\u201d</p><p>Izzy glanced down at her wadded, soiled shawl. She\u2019d been carrying it around ever since her interlude with Ransom that morning.</p><p>Embarrassed, she thrust the thing behind her back. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your shawl?\u201d</p><p>The man had a marksman\u2019s eye when it came to laundry.</p><p>She sighed, drawing it out again. \u201cYes. I . . . You see, there was a bit of a mishap.\u201d</p><p>Lord, how did she begin to describe what had happened to the thing? She ought to have pitched it in the moat. It wasn\u2019t as though it could be salvaged.</p><p>\u201cGive it here.\u201d The valet took it from her hand. He shook out the frail, tissue-thin fabric and examined it, clucking his tongue. \u201cDirt . . . grass . . . My word. Are these bloodstains? On silk embroidery?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, praying that he wouldn\u2019t be angry with her for the duke\u2019s recent injury. Or worse, demand a full explanation of how it had occurred.</p><p>\u201cMiss Goodnight, I don\u2019t know what to say. This . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThis is marvelous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He gripped the fabric in both hands. \u201cThis is what a valet lives for. Removing stubborn stains from quality fabric. It\u2019s been months since I had a challenge like this one. I must away to the laundry, at once. If the stains have any longer to set, I\u2019ll never get them out.\u201d</p><p>Amused, Izzy followed him down to the room designated as a laundry. He stoked the fire, put a kettle on to boil, and gathered soap, an iron, and pressing cloths.</p><p>\u201cThese grass stains will be the most stubborn.\u201d He laid the shawl out on the worktable, assessing every little spot and stain. \u201cLemon juice and a cool rinse first. If that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll try a paste of soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Miss Goodnight.\u201d He looked faintly horrified. \u201cYou\u2019d spoil my amusement. But you\u2019d be most welcome to keep me company.\u201d</p><p>Izzy took a seat and watched, quite amused herself by his careful campaign to attack the stains. He scraped them first with a knife. Then rubbed them with a soft-bristled brush. Only then did he reach for his small, brown-glass bottles of spirits and salts. She felt as though she were watching a surgeon at work.</p><p>\u201cDuncan, how did it happen? The duke\u2019s accident.\u201d</p><p>The valet paused in the act of dabbing vinegar on a grass stain. \u201cMiss Goodnight,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI know we discussed this. A good manservant does not gossip about his employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know, and I\u2019m sorry to pry, but . . . now I work for him, too. Isn\u2019t this what employed people do? Gossip about their employer?\u201d</p><p>He arched one brow in silent censure.</p><p>She hated seeming so petty, and she didn\u2019t want to break her word to Ransom and disclose his headache the other night. Or mention the letter he\u2019d crumpled and tossed in the grate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just concerned, that\u2019s all. The duke\u2019s so . . .\u201d Stubborn. Wounded. Maddeningly attractive. \u201cSo angry. At the world, it seems, but especially at me. He\u2019s so determined to interpret everything in the worst possible way, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only his injury. I wish I understood it.\u201d</p><p>Duncan took a break from his scrubbing to attend the whistling kettle. \u201cMiss Goodnight, it wouldn\u2019t be fitting for a valet to tell tales about his employer.\u201d</p><p>Izzy nodded. She was disappointed, but she wouldn\u2019t press him further. He was saving her best shawl, after all.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d the silver-haired man continued, \u201cseeing as you are Miss Izzy Goodnight, and so fond of a story, perhaps I could tell you a tale about . . . an entirely different man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She straightened in her chair, trying not to betray her excitement. \u201cA fictional man. One who isn\u2019t Rothbury at all. I would so love to hear a story like that.\u201d</p><p>The valet cast a wary glance around the room.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone, I swear it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll even start. Once there was a young nobleman named . . . Bransom Fayne, the Duke of Mothfairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMothfairy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDid you have something better?\u201d</p><p>He set the kettle on the hob. \u201cHe can never hear of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cHow could he? This man we\u2019re discussing doesn\u2019t exist. But this is the tale of his tragic past. In his youth, the nonexistent Duke of Mothfairy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas alone. A great deal. His mother died in childbirth.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. This much, she\u2019d learned from the man himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd his father might as well have died the same day. The old duke shut himself off from the world to grieve, and he treated his son very coldly. Once this \u2018Bransom\u2019 was old enough, he frequently sought out . . . company.\u201d The valet\u2019s face contorted as he searched for words. \u201cThe female kind of company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sewed his wild oats, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntire plantations of them. Good heavens. He made oat-sewing an industry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Izzy could believe it.

The two were engaged soon thereafter.\u201d</p><p>Izzy\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cRansom was engaged?\u201d</p><p>Now she understood why he\u2019d panicked at her foolish utterance of the word \u201cmarriage\u201d earlier.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Duncan threw her a stern look. \u201cBransom was engaged. The Duke Who Doesn\u2019t Exist. He was engaged to a young lady by the name of Lady Emi-\u201d A distressed look crossed his face. \u201cLady Shemily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Shemily?\u201d Izzy smiled to herself. He was getting into the spirit now.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Lady Shemily Liverpail. Daughter of an earl.\u201d The valet returned to his work. He uncapped a small bottle of something that scented strongly of lemon. \u201cWhen the engagement was announced, the duke\u2019s long-suffering servants were delighted. Some of the house staff had served the family for thirty years without a duchess. They were eager for a new lady of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding his trusty and distinguished valet?\u201d she guessed. \u201cWho went by the name of . . . Dinkins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially his trusty and distinguished valet. Dinkins was looking forward to removing fewer remnants of rouge from the duke\u2019s garments. Devilish tricky to remove, rouge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d Izzy wondered what kind of woman could tempt the duke away from all that debauchery. \u201cThis Lady Shemily Liverpail . . . What was she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019d imagine a successful debutante to be. Beautiful, accomplished, well connected. And young. Just nineteen years old.\u201d</p><p>Izzy suppressed a plaintive sigh. Of course. Of course Lady Shemily would be all those things.</p> <p>\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cFictionally. In this completely fabricated story that you\u2019re only concocting to amuse me because you know how I love a tale of star-crossed love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything was arranged,\u201d he said. \u201cWedding, honeymoon, a well-appointed suite for the new duchess. And then, less than a fortnight before the wedding date, the bride-to-be vanished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She disappeared from her bedchamber in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>Izzy leaned forward, propping her chin on her hand. This story was getting rather exciting. And it seemed Duncan was relishing the chance to tell it at last. Poor man, confined here for months with all this melodrama and no one to talk to. And very few stains.</p><p>\u201cLady Shemily,\u201d he said, his voice oozing dramatic tension, \u201chad eloped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEloped? But with whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tenant farmer from the Liverpail country estate. Apparently the two had been concealing their affections for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a scandal. What did Ro\u2014\u201d She shook herself. \u201cWhat did Mothfairy do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing prudent. He should have let the silly chit run off and ruin herself. Loudly disdain her upbringing to all who asked, joke cleverly about his close escape. And then next season, find a new bride. But his pride wouldn\u2019t allow it. He rode off in furious pursuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout his trusty and distinguished valet?\u201d</p><p>He sighed testily. \u201cDinkins followed in the coach. And Dinkins fell, sadly, more than a day behind. Too late to stop the tragedy unfolding.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, already cringing. \u201cDid the duke fall from his horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Some twenty miles south of the Scottish border, Mothfairy came upon his would-be bride and her lover in a coaching inn. A confrontation ensued, blades were drawn . . .\u201d</p><p>She winced, as though she could feel the full length of Ransom\u2019s scar burning from her scalp to her cheekbone. \u201cI think I can imagine the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have to imagine it. I can\u2019t tell you precisely what occurred. I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Duncan dropped all pretense of storytelling. He braced his hands flat against the worktable. \u201cWhen I found him, he\u2019d spent two nights in a closet at that damned coaching inn. No surgeon had been called. The innkeeper was simply waiting for him to die. I had to stitch him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnconscionable,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cWhat about his intended bride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready gone. Little flibbertigibbet.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t well enough to risk traveling back to London, so I brought him here. It\u2019s been more than seven months. He refuses to leave. He refuses to even let me perform my duties as a valet. His appearance is an embarrassment.\u201d</p><p>Izzy hedged. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d say that.\u201d She rather liked the duke\u2019s rugged, unkempt appearance. And a dozen sighing handmaidens couldn\u2019t be wrong.</p><p>\u201cHalf the time, he refuses to wear a cravat. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShameful indeed,\u201d she echoed. She could agree on that point. The duke\u2019s open collars gave her quite shameful thoughts.</p><p>Duncan set the iron aside and held up her pristine shawl for examination. \u201cThis little task has preserved my sanity for another day,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you. You can\u2019t know how unbearable it is to spend your life on one profession and then be forced to abandon it.\u201d</p><p>Izzy didn\u2019t reply. But she could understand that feeling better than he might think. When her father died, her work had died, too.</p><p>He folded the shawl and handed it to her. \u201cI\u2019ve been so out of sorts, it\u2019s driven me to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know. That\u2019s the problem, Miss Goodnight. I\u2019ve tried a half dozen different vices, and none of them satisfy. Cheroots are revolting. Snuff isn\u2019t much better. I can\u2019t abide the taste of strong spirits, and I don\u2019t like to drink alone. What\u2019s left? Gambling? With whom?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s always women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnoriginal,\u201d he declared. \u201cIn this house, that particular vice is taken.\u201d</p><p>An idea came to her. She dug into her pockets and handed him a clutch of paper-wrapped sweets. \u201cHere. Sweetmeats.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the sweets in her hand.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she urged. \u201cYou\u2019d be doing me a favor. People foist the things on me in handfuls. After my morning with the handmaidens, I have more than I could possibly want.\u201d She pointed to one. \u201cI think this one\u2019s a honeyed apricot.\u201d</p><p>He took the sweet, unwrapped it, and popped it into his mouth. As he chewed, his shoulders relaxed.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter. Thank you, Miss Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d She left the remaining sweetmeats on his worktable. \u201cThank you for rescuing my shawl and for telling me the truth. I mean, not the truth. A fascinating story.\u201d</p><p>Everything made more sense to her now. Naturally, a man who\u2019d been jilted so callously and nearly died in the bargain would take a dim view of love and romance. But was his pride the true casualty, or had his heart been broken, too?</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d he murmured, unwrapping a second sweetmeat.</p><p>\u201cDid . . . ?\u201d She screwed up her courage and asked. \u201cDid he love her?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Oh, drat. That would teach her to ask a delicate question just as someone stuffed a sweetmeat in his mouth. Duncan made a wait-a-moment gesture, working his jaw. Meanwhile, Izzy\u2019s gut twisted itself into knots.</p><p>Worse, she had time to question herself.</p><p>Why did it even matter whether the duke had loved his intended or not? Why did she care so much? It wasn\u2019t as though he was ever going to marry her.</p><p>An eternity later, Duncan swallowed the morsel. But apparently she\u2019d waited all that time for nothing.</p><p>He said simply, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Astonishing. In the morning, when she sat working at that table of correspondence, silhouetted by sunlight . . .</p><p>Her hair truly did look like an octopus.</p><p>It was the way she wore it, he thought. Or maybe the way it wore her. It all sat perched atop her head in that big, inky blob. And no matter how strenuously she pinned it, dark, heavy curls worked loose on all sides, like tentacles.</p><p>Of course, it was an entrancing, strangely erotic octopus. Ransom worried this might be how fetishes developed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me, Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>Her dark head lifted from her work. \u201cI have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You have.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cYour Grace, my presence in this room right now\u2014and this very conversation we\u2019re having\u2014would seem to argue against it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I blame you.\u201d He reclined on the sofa and propped his laced hands behind his neck. \u201cIf it were in any way physically possible, I would avoid myself, too.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the next envelope and cleaved the seal with a savage slice of the letter opener. \u201cI\u2019m not avoiding you, Your Grace. I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Little liar. She knew very well what he meant.</p><p>Ever since the Invasion of the Idiots, and that sublime, stolen embrace in the folly, Ransom had noted a marked change in Izzy Goodnight\u2019s demeanor.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been any more surprise visitors, and as many hours as Ransom walked the castle at night, he never bumped into her again. She was always waiting nearby when he awoke, but there were no more queer conversations on elephant-sized rats or rat-sized elephants.</p><p>And, queerly enough, Ransom found himself missing them.</p><p>Or perhaps just missing her.</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d he said, interrupting her reading of an assessment regarding some new finance scheme with steam engines. \u201cAre there dragons in Merlinia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoranglia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there are, why do you care?\u201d she asked, sounding wary.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust wondering what further madness to expect, that\u2019s all. Whether I\u2019ll have a herd of unicorns visiting some morning, or discover trolls camping under my bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, Your Grace. No dragons, unicorns, or trolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. She hadn\u2019t made it through another paragraph before he interrupted again. \u201cWhat news do you have from Lord Bedridden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that would interest you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d The flat side of her fist met the tabletop. \u201cYour Grace, you\u2019ve hired me to read your correspondence. Not discuss my own.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands in surrender. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Ransom could see what was happening. She was putting distance between them. Which meant she was a sensible, clever woman. Which made her even more attractive. Damn it all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be churlish,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . I discuss my father\u2019s stories with everyone. And I don\u2019t mind it, but I rather look forward to speaking of something\u2014anything\u2014else when I\u2019m with you. Even if it\u2019s the financial prospects in steam-powered farm machinery.\u201d</p><p>He supposed that made sense. He was beginning to understand how those ridiculous tales had made her a prisoner of others\u2019 expectations.</p><p>She would need to break free of that prison soon. Because they were halfway through the formidable heap of letters and packets, and Ransom was certain he knew what was happening.</p><p>Someone was stealing from him. And that someone had been getting bolder. The amounts of the discrepancies had been small at first, but they were growing into the tens and hundreds.</p><p>He had a theory developing. The culprit must be some clerk in his solicitors\u2019 offices, he surmised. Or even one of the solicitors. Whoever the thief was, he has a gaming habit\u2014cards or horses, maybe. Perhaps an expensive mistress. Or maybe he\u2019d decided he deserved better than whatever measly salary his employers paid. So he began by pilfering small amounts, where no one was likely to suspect it. When those went unnoticed, he progressed to larger sums. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then, one day, he saw his chance to rake in something bigger.</p><p>The old Earl of Lynforth\u2019s men must have inquired about purchasing Gostley Castle for his goddaughter. Of course, any such offer would have been summarily refused. Everyone knew Ransom would never agree to sell an ancestral property. But if the thief drew up false papers and took them directly to Lynforth\u2019s bedside\u2014he could bilk a dying man out of a tremendous sum.</p><p>So far, it was merely a theory, but it made more sense than any of the alternatives. And if Ransom\u2019s guesses were right, that would mean the sale was invalid.</p> <p>Soon, Izzy Goodnight would find herself without a home. Again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be finished here in a matter of weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you given any thought to where you\u2019ll go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ought to ask you that,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you should. That\u2019s the thing, Goodnight. You should go places.\u201d He sat up and leaned forward, bracing his forearms on his knees. \u201cThe wars are over. Those who have money are beginning to travel again. Find some naughty old relic who wants to do the Grand Tour. One who needs a companion to read aloud in voices on tedious ship crossings, make sketches of nude sculptures for her keepsake box, and walk her lapdog twice a day. You could visit Paris, Vienna, Athens, Rome.\u201d</p><p>Even from his seat on the sofa, he could see her wide, claret-red mouth curve in a smile. It was the first smile he\u2019d seen from her in days.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t know any wealthy, naughty old ladies with lapdogs,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that does sound like a lovely adventure.\u201d</p><p>It was settled then. He didn\u2019t know any old women who met the description, either. But he\u2019d find one. If need be, he\u2019d hire a Drury Lane actress past her prime to play the part of Aunt What\u2019s-her-face, and he\u2019d foot the bill for the entire journey.</p><p>It was time for Izzy Goodnight to stop living in other people\u2019s storybooks. She needed to see more of the world than dusty castles and quaint English villages. Ransom couldn\u2019t offer her everything she needed or deserved. But he could do this much.</p><p>The decision eased his conscience as he watched her pluck another letter from the heap, reducing her time remaining in this castle by a few minutes more. One more grain of sand slipping through the hourglass.</p><p>Sometime later, she put her work aside. \u201cThat will have to do for today.\u201d Her voice brightened as she said, \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to dress for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dressing for dinner?\u201d</p> <p>This was new. There was never any formal dinner. She and Miss Pelham took their meals in the kitchen with Duncan, or so he assumed. Ransom never joined them.</p><p>\u201cWe finished the dining room yesterday. Duncan, Miss Pelham, and I. So we decided to take a holiday from dusting and celebrate with a formal dinner tonight.\u201d She rose from her chair. \u201cMiss Pelham has been working on the menu all day.\u201d</p><p>He scratched the thick growth of whiskers on his chin. \u201cNo one mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her voice softened to that soothing, wild-honey tone. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I should have thought to tell you. Are your feelings hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. My feelings\u2014not that I\u2019m admitting to possessing any, mind you\u2014are not hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean for you to feel left out. You\u2019re welcome to join us, of course. It\u2019s just . . . you never do. You never take dinner with us at all.\u201d</p><p>It was late in the day, and his vision had faded. She was just a roving patch of darker gray in a sea of light gray mist. He couldn\u2019t tell whether her invitation was sincere or pitying.</p><p>But then, it didn\u2019t matter. She was right; he never dined with their group. For good reason.</p> <p>He rose to his feet. \u201cGoodnight, I do appreciate your generous invitation to attend this dinner that my money paid for, in my own home, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please do come.\u201d</p><p>The words rushed from her, impulsive\u2014but they were no more reckless than her concurrent gesture.</p><p>She took his hand.</p><p>She took his hand in hers and squeezed it. Sweetly. As if he were a reluctant child who needed a bit of compassion and encouragement.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what he assumed those gestures felt like. His own childhood had been utterly devoid of compassion or encouragement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be very glad if you joined us for dinner, Ransom. If only because it means one person at the table who couldn\u2019t care less about the true identity of the Shadow Knight.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s a Shadow Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She squeezed his hand again. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing anyone\u2019s said to me in ages. Do come to dinner and be your ill-tempered, unromantic self. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told the duke about our dinner this evening.\u201d Izzy sucked in her breath as Miss Pelham gave her corset laces a firm tug. \u201cI invited him to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Miss Pelham tugged again.</p><p>\u201cHe declined.\u201d</p><p>Another tug. \u201cOh. Too bad.\u201d</p><p>Izzy wondered how many more times she could muster the courage to reach out to him. He was so obstinate and determined to isolate himself. Ever since Duncan\u2019s story, she didn\u2019t know what to think. Was he heartbroken over his lost intended? Angry about the loss of his sight and independence? Or was he merely a jilted man licking the wounds to his pride?</p><p>In any case, he needed to make his way into the world again\u2014and soon.</p><p>She\u2019d read through more than half his correspondence now, and Izzy was forming suspicions. Without conclusive proof, she didn\u2019t dare mention the idea. But she was almost certain the duke\u2019s solicitors were conspiring against him. For what reason, she couldn\u2019t imagine. But he stood to lose far more than this castle if he didn\u2019t rejoin the England of the living soon.</p><p>Tonight\u2019s dinner could have been a step in the right direction.</p><p>If only.</p><p>Miss Pelham gave the corset laces another yank. When Izzy winced, she apologized. \u201cSorry, Miss Goodnight. But I have to cinch it tight, or the gown won\u2019t fit you.\u201d</p><p>She helped Izzy into a gown of poppy red silk. It was Miss Pelham\u2019s gown, of course. Izzy\u2019s wardrobe offered nothing appropriate for a dinner like this one.</p><p>\u201cOh, that color does look well on you. Even if the fit is too tight up top.\u201d</p><p>The bodice was tight. Her breasts were pale, quivering scoops overflowing the neckline. Rather scandalous attire, for little Izzy Goodnight. But she had a shawl, and it was only Miss Pelham and Duncan.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to overeat.\u201d Izzy smoothed her palms over the luscious red silk. \u201cThank you so much for the loan of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m glad to help.\u201d Miss Pelham pulled on the first of her elbow-length gloves, then held it out for Izzy to button. \u201cIt is taking a dreadfully long time for your belongings to arrive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d As Izzy worked the tiny buttons, a pang of guilt twisted in her chest.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, Miss Goodnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that I wish . . .\u201d</p><p>Only that I wish I didn\u2019t have to lie to you. Only that I\u2019m wickedly envious of your golden hair and blushing cheeks and confidence. And I wish I could make you the tiniest bit envious of me by confessing everything I\u2019ve done with the duke.</p><p>\u201cOnly that I wish you\u2019d call me Izzy.\u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham\u2019s fan clattered to the floor. Her face lit with a radiant, sunbeam smile. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must call me Abigail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham\u2014Abigail\u2014caught her in a tight hug. \u201cOh, I knew it. I knew we would be best of friends.\u201d</p><p>Friends.</p><p>So strange. Izzy would have never believed she could be close friends with a woman like Abigail. The Abigail Pelhams of her youth had treated shy, awkward Izzy with disdain, even cruelty. They called her Frizzy Izzy, Witch\u2019s Broom, Mop Head, Funny Face . . . the list went on and on.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t her youth, she reminded herself. She and Abigail were grown women, and perhaps it had been unfair of Izzy not to give their friendship a chance.</p><p>Abigail pulled back from the hug. \u201cNow that we\u2019re friends, will you let me do your hair?\u201d She took one of Izzy\u2019s wayward curls and regarded it pityingly. \u201cI have a recipe for an egg-yolk and rosewater preparation that will have this smooth as pressed satin.\u201d</p><p>Izzy started to protest that it wouldn\u2019t work. She\u2019d tried every preparation known to womankind, and none of them had worked.</p><p>But Abigail would hear none of it.</p><p>She turned Izzy toward the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. With the right coiffure and a bright new ribbon . . . this could be almost pretty.\u201d</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Izzy reached for her shawl, trying to ignore the unintended slight. \u201cLet\u2019s go down to dinner, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Abigail took her arm. \u201cYes, let\u2019s. I have some questions I\u2019ve been saving for tonight.\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear.</p><p>To her credit, Abigail made it almost through the soup course before beginning the interrogation.</p><p>An apologetic smile tipped her mouth. \u201cYou must know what I\u2019m going to ask.\u201d</p><p>I have a feeling I do.</p><p>\u201cForgive me. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Abigail lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cThe Shadow Knight. Who is he, really? Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t ever tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>Izzy allowed the suspense to build while she swallowed her mouthful of creamy parsnip soup and took a moment to enjoy the splendor.</p><p>They\u2019d worked for two full days on this dining room, washing down the walls, beating the carpet, polishing the furniture, and recovering the chairs. By day, one could still see the faded patches on the carpet and the nicks on the paneling.</p><p>But by candlelight . . . ? Oh, it looked magical.</p><p>The whole room glittered. The table was laid with crisp, pressed white linen, and every object\u2014from the tiniest spoon to the largest candlestick\u2014had been polished until it gleamed. It could not have been more beautiful if it had been laid with diamonds. The crystal was borrowed from the vicarage, but everything else belonged here. Duncan had found a chest of silver and two crates of straw-packed china that had escaped looting, having been stashed under boards in the cellar.</p><p>The soaring ceilings overhead gave the impression of grandeur, but the general aura was one of warmth and welcome, and the scent of roasted lamb curled through the air.</p><p>It felt like a home.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Abigail prompted.</p><p>Yes, yes. The Shadow Knight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cMy father never told me. I don\u2019t know any more than was printed in the magazine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Cressida and Ulric, either? Oh, I can\u2019t stand it that they haven\u2019t reunited. Do they marry and have babies, the way I always hoped and dreamed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hoped and dreamed it, then perhaps they did. I know readers were disappointed that the stories are unfinished. But to me, there\u2019s a certain beauty to the fact that Ulric was left hanging, literally. This way, the characters can have as many happy endings as readers can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully, that would put the matter to rest.</p><p>\u201cOh, but it\u2019s just not enough.\u201d Miss Pelham sighed. \u201cWhat about that eunuch? I had suspicions about him. I don\u2019t suppose Sir Henry ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God. Leave her be.\u201d</p><p>This irritable outburst took everyone by surprise.</p><p>Because it came from the duke.</p><p>Ransom stood in the doorway. And Izzy regretted using up the words \u201cgrandeur\u201d and \u201csplendor\u201d on the dining room because now she was all out of words to describe how he looked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, perhaps there was one word left.</p><p>Magnificent.</p><p>Clean-shaven, freshly bathed, and turned out in a black tailcoat that fit him snug as poured ink. And he must have done it all unaided, judging by the shocked expression Duncan wore as he rose to his feet. Poor fellow probably worried he\u2019d been replaced in his duties.</p><p>But Izzy didn\u2019t believe that was the case, judging by the inadvisable color of the duke\u2019s waistcoat and the fresh, paper-thin scrape along his jaw.</p> <p>It was silly, perhaps. But Izzy found that thin red line even more brave and endearing than the scar slashed across his brow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him,\u201d Abigail whispered across the table. \u201cThe duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Izzy murmured back.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he come down? Do you think he fancies you?\u201d</p><p>Izzy pinched the bridge of her nose. Goodness. Why didn\u2019t this girl understand that Ransom could hear everything she said?</p> <p>\u201cHe must fancy you,\u201d Abigail whispered on. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be exciting? You could make him believe in romance and lo\u2014\u201d</p><p>The duke cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cForgive me. We weren\u2019t expecting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d Ransom found the chair at the head of the table and drew it out. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make you work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like some soup?\u201d Abigail motioned to the serving maid, one of the newly hired servants.</p><p>\u201cJust wine. I\u2019m not here to eat, either.\u201d</p> <p>Silence fell as they all pondered the question no one dared to ask aloud. If he wasn\u2019t here to eat or be served . . . why was he here at all?</p><p>\u201cGive Miss Goodnight a rest about Morbidia.\u201d He took a seat. \u201cSurely there\u2019s something else to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Izzy said, trying to contain the damage to the evening\u2019s pleasant atmosphere. \u201cReally. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mind on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>Ah. So that\u2019s why he\u2019d come to dinner. To stand up for her. To be her surly, ill-mannered champion. If it wouldn\u2019t have spoiled her lovely soup, Izzy could have burst into tears.</p><p>He tapped his fork against the plate. \u201cI thought tonight\u2019s dinner was meant to be a holiday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a holiday, Your Grace,\u201d Abigail answered.</p><p>\u201cThen I would like a holiday from fairy stories. Unless the knights and maidens tumble into bed and do carnal things to each other, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d</p> <p>Abigail\u2019s cheeks turned a subtle shade of pink. \u201cYour Grace. They do nothing of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you have it, Miss Pelham,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cThe duke is not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the duke doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s missing. He needs to experience the stories themselves. We can read from them after dinner.\u201d</p><p>The serving maid removed the soup and placed a platter in front of the duke. She whisked away a silver dome to reveal a beautifully browned rack of lamb.</p><p>Ransom sipped his wine. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not waiting for me to carve it.\u201d</p><p>Chastened, Duncan reached for the carving knife and began to saw the chops apart, offering a serving to each of the ladies before taking his own portion. Ransom refused to take any for himself.</p><p>Izzy couldn\u2019t help feeling awkward for him. So this was why he never joined them for meals. As the gentleman of rank at any given table, it was his task to carve the game and roasts\u2014something that would be difficult for him to do well. Especially toward the end of the day, when she knew his vision waned dramatically.</p><p>She looked down at the lamb chops before her. Even a plate of food must feel like a test he was set up to fail. She briefly closed her eyes and tried to imagine going about cutting her meat into pieces without the benefit of sight. She might be able to manage it, with practice. But manage it with grace and ducal manners? That was less certain.</p><p>The passing and consuming of various dishes occupied them for some time. Ransom just kept drinking, which Izzy feared didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>As the dessert course\u2014a lovely fresh berry tart\u2014was served, Abigail rose from the table and returned shortly, carrying her giant bound folio. Evidently she hadn\u2019t forgotten her promise to read.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d she announced. \u201cThe Goodnight Tales. We\u2019ll start at the beginning tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ransom muttered a curse. \u201cIs there no escaping this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t read them,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cHe needn\u2019t hear them at all. But if you do read, spare him the beginning, at least. My father was always embarrassed by those installments from the first few years. He didn\u2019t consider them his best work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re the beginning. One must begin at the beginning. Mark my words, Your Grace. Soon, you\u2019ll be swept up in the story of Cressida and Ulric.\u201d</p><p>As Miss Pelham opened the cover of the book, Izzy was struck by the powerful urge to sweep herself under the carpet. Perhaps live there for the next several years. She could reign in beneficence as the almost-pretty Queen of the Dust Mites.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Part the first,\u2019 \u201d Miss Pelham read aloud. \u201c \u2018Night has fallen over England. In a small village in the countryside, there is a cottage. A cottage with a slate roof and a candle in every window. And in that cottage is a room. A room with silver moons and golden stars painted on the ceiling. And in that room is a bed. A bed with a quilted purple counterpane. And in that bed is a girl. A girl named Izzy Goodnight, who will not go to sleep.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Cringing, Izzy glanced toward Ransom at the head of the table. Perhaps it was for the best that he hadn\u2019t eaten anything. He looked as though he would be struggling to keep his meal down.</p><p>Miss Pelham read on, adding voices. \u201c \u2018Papa, won\u2019t you tell me a story,\u2019 the little girl pleads. \u2018The hour is late, my Izzy,\u2019 I reply. \u2018Please, Papa. The dark frightens me. But your tales give me such happy dreams.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Now he groaned. It was a faint groan, but a definite groan nonetheless. Izzy groaned, too.</p><p>And the whole mortifying experience was about to get worse. Much worse.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Very well,\u2019 \u201d Abigail continued. \u201c \u2018Put out the light, my darling Izzy, and I will tell you such a tale. Once, in the time of brave knights and fair ladies, there lived an elegant and intrepid young lady by the name of Cressida. She had emerald green eyes and amber hair, sleek as silk.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Izzy braced herself. Here it came. Her three-word, lifelong curse. She mouthed the words as Miss Pelham read them aloud:</p><p>\u201c \u2018Just like yours.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Miss Pelham looked up from the book and made eye contact with Izzy. \u201cIsn\u2019t that curious? I must admit, I\u2019ve wondered about it ever since we met. Didn\u2019t you wonder, too, Duncan?\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, Miss Pelham, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIzzy, this is a question you can surely answer. Why did your father write you as having emerald eyes and sleek amber hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. Izzy never knew how to explain this. Shouldn\u2019t the answer be obvious? The Izzy of the stories had to be different. Because no one wanted to read a story about a funny-looking girl with a mop of dark, tangled hair and pale blue eyes. Much less imagine themselves in her place. Because she, the real Izzy Goodnight, could only ever hope to be, at best, almost pretty.</p><p>Because she wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>\u201cBecause her father was a jackass,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>Abigail and Duncan gasped in unison.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Abigail said. \u201cYou\u2019re so very wrong, Your Grace. Sir Henry was . . . well, he was the most gentle, loving father a girl could hope to have. Wasn\u2019t he, Izzy?\u201d</p><p>Once again, Ransom spared her the awkwardness of a reply. \u201cVery well, I revise my statement. He was a shrewd jackass. Had everyone fooled. But if good Sir Henry was such an amiable fellow and doting father, why couldn\u2019t he be bothered to leave his daughter the security of an income and a comfortable home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, his death was so unexpected,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cA tragedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was sudden,\u201d Izzy put in.</p><p>Abigail reached across the table to take Izzy\u2019s hand. \u201cIt must have been devastating. The whole country was in mourning with you.\u201d</p><p>Ransom shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse. There are few true eventualities in life, but death is one of them.\u201d He waved for more wine. \u201cIf you ask me, this Sir Henry Goodnight was no better than a cut-rate gin peddler or opium trader. He hooked people on his soppy stories, then just kept shoveling them more, not caring how many people drowned their powers of reason in that treacly swamp.\u201d</p><p>Izzy thought that was going a bit too far.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to admire my father\u2019s stories,\u201d she said. \u201cBut don\u2019t disparage the readers, or the notion of romance. Cressida and Ulric are just characters. Moranglia is entirely made up. But love does exist. It\u2019s all around us.\u201d</p><p>He put down his wineglass and turned his head, as if to survey the room. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to answer. \u201cAm I supposed to point it out like an architectural feature? There it is, framed and hanging on the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said love is all around us. Well, where is it? There are four of us at this table, all grown adults. Not one romance. Not one instance of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what? Everyone knows your situation, Miss Goodnight. Doomed to spinsterhood by your father\u2019s stories.\u201d He gestured at his valet. \u201cDuncan here spent ten years pining for one of the London housemaids. Irish girl with bouncy curls and a bouncier bosom. She never took a second look at him.\u201d</p><p>Duncan made a halfhearted attempt at protest, but Ransom ignored it.</p><p>He turned to Abigail. \u201cWhat about you, Miss Pelham? You seem lively, and by all accounts, pretty enough. Your father is a gentleman. Where are your suitors?\u201d</p><p>Abigail stared at her half-eaten tart. \u201cThere was someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. And where\u2019s the someone now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left for the navy,\u201d she answered. \u201cMy dowry is slight, and he was a second son with no fortune of his own. Matters never progressed beyond friendship.\u201d She gave a little smile. \u201cI suppose it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Ransom propped his boot on the chair leg. \u201cThere. You see? Once again, cold reality trumps feeling.\u201d He waved from Izzy to Abigail to Duncan. \u201cOverlooked, unwanted, rejected. Not a happy ending in the lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Izzy protested. \u201cOur own stories haven\u2019t ended. And even so, we are but four souls in a vast world. I receive letters from my father\u2019s readers every day. People from all walks of life who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are desperate and deluded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho believe in love.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, nonchalant. \u201cSame thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the same thing at all.\u201d</p><p>Izzy stared at him. She didn\u2019t know why arguing this point had become so important to her. If he wanted to live out the remainder of his life bitter and alone, she supposed he had that right. But his smugness made her so prickly all over. And he wasn\u2019t merely insulting love and romance. He was insulting her friends and acquaintances. Her own hard work.</p><p>The innermost yearnings of her heart.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t an academic argument. It was personal. If she didn\u2019t defend the idea of lasting happiness, how could she hold out any hope for her own?</p><p>She tried again. \u201cEveryone . . . well, almost everyone . . . understands that my father\u2019s stories are merely stories. But love is not a delusion.\u201d To his disbelieving snort, she insisted, \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>An idea came to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d She rose from the table and began walking backward, toward the corridor. \u201cWait right there one moment, and I will prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>She hurried up to the next floor, then down the corridor, and tapped her way up all thirty-four stairs to the turret. There, she rummaged through her saved correspondence until she found the envelope she wanted, and clutching it, raced back down.</p><p>She arrived breathless and triumphant.</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, clutching the weathered envelope. \u201cRight here in my hand, I have proof that my father\u2019s stories made a difference in people\u2019s lives. Proof that true love will always triumph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall brace myself.\u201d The duke lifted his wineglass and drained it in one swallow. \u201cCarry on.\u201d</p><p>Izzy unfolded the letter and began to read.</p><p>My dear Miss Goodnight,</p><p>We have never met, and yet I think of you as a close friend. Perhaps even as a sister. My governess began reading me your father\u2019s stories when I was but a girl of six, and for as long as I can remember, the good people of Moranglia have populated my dreams\u2014just as I imagine they have populated yours. When I learned of Sir Henry\u2019s untimely death, I wept tears for you every night for months.</p> <p>I am grown now, as you must be. This year, my father engaged me to a suitor not of my choosing. He is not a cruel or violent man, but he is unfeeling and cold. I am sure he does not love me and probably never could. He intends to acquire me, and he has gone about his goal with less feeling and attention than other men display when buying a horse. I dread the prospect of a life with him.</p><p>This will all sound so familiar to you. Am I not just like Cressida in the thirty-fifth installment, when her father betrothed her to that horrid Lord Darkskull? Excepting the windowless tower and the helpful mice, of course.</p><p>And, in the same way as Cressida, my heart has belonged to another for years. Oh, Miss Goodnight. I wish you could know him. Like Ulric, he comes from humble circumstances. But he has proved his worth time and again, displaying such understanding and devotion as I have never known from my closest friends and family. I love him with everything in my soul.</p><p>I face a fearsome choice. But I have sought the counsel of my heart and come to a brave decision.</p><p>I will follow Cressida\u2019s example and escape. With or without the helpful mice.</p><p>Doubt not. Tomorrow I shall be with my true love, and together we will embark on our life\u2019s adventure. All thanks are due to you, Miss Goodnight, and to your dear father, who lives on in his tales and in a nation\u2019s hearts.</p> <p>A tear burned at the corner of Izzy\u2019s eye as she lifted her head. \u201cAnd it\u2019s signed, \u2018Yours in boundless gratitude, Lady Emily Riverdale.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She lowered the letter on a note of victory. There, now. He couldn\u2019t possibly listen to that letter and be unmoved.</p><p>He was moved, indeed.</p><p>Without a word, Ransom rose from his chair. He loomed at the head of the table, big and dark and ominous as a human thundercloud. His hands were clenched in fists. She expected at any moment he would start launching lightning bolts.</p><p>The hairs on the back of Izzy\u2019s neck prickled.</p><p>Ever-proper Duncan was waving both arms in a frenzy, gesturing for Izzy\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered to the valet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes widened as he pointed at the letter in her hand and mouthed, That.</p> <p>This?</p><p>As the duke stormed from the room, she searched the letter again, trying to find the words that would cause such dramatic offense. Nothing, until . . .</p><p>Until her eye landed on the sender\u2019s name. Her heart and her stomach switched places.</p><p>Oh, no. No.</p><p>Emily Riverdale.</p><p>Lady Shemily Liverpail.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Lord, but she was an idiot.</p><p>The letter in Izzy\u2019s hand was from Ransom\u2019s own intended. The flibbertigibbet. The same woman who\u2019d run off with a farmer, leading to the duke\u2019s disfigurement and brush with death. And she\u2019d just read this letter aloud to him as proof of everlasting love.</p><p>Izzy gave the letter to Duncan in passing. Then she picked up a candlestick in one hand and her silk skirts in the other.</p><p>\u201cI must go after him.\u201d</p><p>Moving as fast as she could in her sausage casing of a gown and corset, she chased him down the corridor. \u201cRansom, wait.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t break stride, firing a warning over his shoulder. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>The words hit her square in the sternum, stopping her in place. His wasn\u2019t a tone one could easily ignore. Eleven generations of ducal authority rang out in that command.</p><p>He was angry, hurt, and on a very short fuse to explosion.</p><p>Izzy gathered her nerve and followed anyway.</p><p>She struggled to keep pace with him. He knew these rooms and corridors so well, having walked them every night in the dark.</p><p>At last, he turned into a room, and Izzy knew she would have him cornered.</p><p>He\u2019d ducked into the library.</p><p>Ironically enough, the library was one room Izzy had avoided thus far. Though the vastness of the space and the floor-to-ceiling mahogany bookshelves were grand, for a true lover of books, the scene was unbearably sad. A cursory glance on the first day had revealed that any books of interest or value had been removed or looted. The only volumes remaining were dry agricultural treatises or outdated almanacs, and even those had been mildewed or chewed to the point of being unreadable.</p><p>Someday, Izzy had told herself, she would find the money to clean this out and fill it with lovely books again. Books bound in every available shade of rich, buttery leather: green, blue, red, brown. Someday, she would pass a rainy day sitting by that massive stone hearth, cuddled up in an overstuffed armchair and caught in the grips of a thrilling gothic novel.</p><p>Tonight, she would have to settle for living in one.</p><p>She stopped in the center of the room and placed the candlestick on a forgotten, dusty table. \u201cRansom, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held her off with an outstretched hand. \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Goodnight. Don\u2019t push me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I don\u2019t want to argue. Just allow me to apologize. I\u2019m so, so sorry. It was terribly thoughtless of me to read that. I\u2019ve had the letter for ages now, and I never drew the connection. I had no idea she was your Lady Emily.\u201d</p><p>Rage flared from him. \u201cSo you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know.\u201d</p><p>He took two confrontational steps in her direction. The candlelight sent fearsome shadows playing over his scarred face. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gossiping about me. Or maybe it was somewhere in my stack of correspondence. Have you been snooping through my letters on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she hastened to say. \u201cNothing like it. I learned about it from Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan. He told you.\u201d He cursed violently as he turned away. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then. There\u2019s not a soul remaining on this earth I can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Please don\u2019t take it that way.\u201d As she talked, she drifted closer, erasing the gap between them step by cautious step. \u201cDuncan worries over you so much. He didn\u2019t want to gossip, I promise. And he didn\u2019t, exactly. He told me about a Duke of Mothfairy and a Lady Shemily, and I had to extrapolate the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoth-what?\u201d</p><p>Izzy slapped a hand to her brow. \u201cNever mind. Please forget I said anything about that part.\u201d</p><p>Before she knew what was happening, he was upon her. He caught her by the waist and pressed her up against the nearest wall\u2014one lined with empty bookshelves.</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d he growled. \u201cI warned you not to push me. Now I\u2019m going push back.\u201d</p><p>He braced his hands on the shelves, caging her between his arms. One hard ridge caught her along the back of the thighs. Another scored the small of her back. The smell of wine was overpowering.</p><p>He had her trapped, and her body responded like any trapped creature\u2019s would. The hairs on the back of her neck lifted. Her diaphragm worked like a bellows, pushing air in and out of her lungs. Her pulse accelerated to a mad, frantic thunder in her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m s-sorry,\u201d she stammered. \u201cSo very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for what? Sorry you read me that letter? Sorry for my pain? Sorry that you had a hand in destroying my life?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. So he did blame her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cthat Lady Emily never understood the kind of man you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d One of his hands moved to her waist. His palm slid up and down over the liquid-smooth silk, idly tracing the curves of her breast and hip. \u201cAnd what kind of man is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good one. One who\u2019s gruff some of the time, and off-puttingly arrogant a great deal of the rest. But loyal and protective when it counts. You went after her, Ransom. You rushed after her, when you could have let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I rushed after her. And if you think that made me the hero in her little story, you have it all wrong. Everything she wrote was the truth. I didn\u2019t love her. I never would have loved her. To her, I was always the villain.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t love her.</p><p>The words should have made her relieved for his feelings. Instead, Izzy was selfishly relieved for her own.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d He leaned close. The heat of his breath rushed over her ear. \u201cYou have no idea how tempted I am to ruin you. Right here and now. The revenge would be so damned sweet. England\u2019s precious little innocent, spreading her thighs so wide for my cock.\u201d</p><p>At his carnal words, her knees went weak. She couldn\u2019t draw enough air. These wretchedly tight corset laces. With every shallow breath, her breasts pushed higher against the restrictive red silk. The exquisite friction chafed her nipples to hardened peaks.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019re not the sort of man to take advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be a man who takes advantage.\u201d He sent one hand to burrow under her skirts. \u201cJust one who takes an invitation.\u201d</p><p>He hooked a hand under her knee and lifted, drawing her leg to the side and propping her heel on the first shelf above the ground. Using the weight of his own knee, he pinned her in this lewd position.</p><p>Her heartbeat stalled as he pushed the folds of her petticoats and shift aside. She wasn\u2019t wearing anything but stockings beneath. But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to protest or shy away. His possessive touch excited her, and she found herself growing aroused even before his hand moved to cradle her sex.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to scurry back to the dining room and continue pretending. She wanted to be here with him, raw and craving. Her flushed, breathless response to his touch . . . This was honest. The need gathering between her legs . . . It was real.</p><p>His thumb slipped over her crease, parting her gently for his explorations. Pleasure shuddered through her, and she gripped the nearest shelf for strength.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He groaned. \u201cI knew it would be like this. I knew you\u2019d be so wet for me.\u201d</p><p>The crude words made her wild. He slid a finger inside her, and she bit her lip to keep from crying aloud.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>He knew just what she needed. He worked in and out, stroking a fraction deeper every time.</p><p>And still she craved more. She rocked her hips back and forth, trying to draw him deeper, deeper. She needed him. She needed him so deep inside.</p><p>\u201cNo one else has any idea, do they? What a naughty, wanton girl you are. No one else sees what I see. No other man makes you twist and pant and moan.\u201d</p><p>She arched off the shelves, gasping. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly me.\u201d His fingers thrust deep. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>With a soft groan of approval, he bent his head to lavish kisses on her breasts. Using his teeth, he tugged her bodice downward. Before she could protest that the gown was borrowed and already stretched to its seams, she felt the small rip of fabric.</p><p>Her breasts spilled forward, and a dizzying rush of air flooded her lungs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He eased her breast from her stays and circled her nipple with his tongue. \u201cI know what you need.\u201d</p><p>He slid both hands to her hips. In one swift motion, he lifted her six inches off the ground, setting her backside on the next shelf up. Nudging her skirts to her waist, he moved between her legs.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want this, tell me.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to scream. You don\u2019t have to push me away. You\u2019ve only to say it.\u201d</p> <p>Izzy didn\u2019t know what to say. Her body wanted his. That much was certain. But was this going to be her first\u2014and possibly only\u2014experience of lovemaking? A furtive, angry tupping against a dusty shelf? He wouldn\u2019t be making love to her. He\u2019d be striking back at the very idea of love.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She worked for breath. \u201cI\u2019m not saying no.\u201d</p><p>He moaned and lifted her, so that she straddled his hips.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m saying, not like this. I want emotion. I want tenderness. I think you want those things, too.\u201d</p><p>His fingers dug into the flesh of her backside, and he ran his tongue across her chest. \u201cCurse tenderness. To hell with emotion. I\u2019m not the man to fulfill your heart\u2019s desires, but I can give you everything\u2014everything\u2014your body\u2019s craving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust because . . .\u201d</p><p>He sucked her nipple into his mouth, and she lost her voice to another wave of bliss.</p><p>She wove her fingers in his hair and tried again. \u201cJust because she ran away, it doesn\u2019t mean a woman can\u2019t love you. Ransom, I . . . I know there\u2019s more to you than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal to me.\u201d He rocked his pelvis against hers, and the hard ridge of his erection stroked her core. \u201cYou could have it all. Just as long and hard and deep as you need it.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Oh, how she needed it.</p><p>He ground against her in a firm, delicious rhythm. The warmed, weathered buckskin teased over her thighs. Izzy whimpered and clung to the shelving, helpless to do anything but hang on for the ride.</p> <p>With every roll of his hips, he was pushing her higher. Closer to release.</p><p>And he knew it.</p><p>\u201cCome for me.\u201d He slid his hand between their bodies, and his fingers filled her deep again. As he worked them in and out, the heel of his hand rubbed against her pearl. \u201cI need to feel it. I need to hear it.\u201d</p><p>A thin whimper of pleasure caught in her throat.</p><p>\u201cMy name.\u201d He stroked deeper. \u201cSay my name. I want you to know it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansom.\u201d Her grip tightened on the shelf.</p><p>And then suddenly\u2014</p><p>Something gave way.</p> <p>With a creak and a whoosh, her whole world turned on its axis. Plunging them both into the dark.</p><p>\u201cWh-?\u201d She panted for breath. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Damned if Ransom could say. One moment, he was in paradise. Izzy gasping his name, all that tightness and heat surrounding his fingers . . . Victory, right in the palm of his hand.</p><p>A moment later, they were in hell. The entire section of wall, bookshelves included, had swung on its axis, depositing them here.</p><p>Wherever \u201chere\u201d was.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell. He just knew that everything in it was close. And dank. The air smelled of rot and the mustiness of centuries.</p><p>\u201cIs it some kind of secret passage?\u201d Izzy asked, still breathing hard.</p><p>He withdrew his hand from her quivering flesh and lowered her skirts as much as he dared. However, he held her pinned against the shelving with his hips, keeping her feet well off the floor. God only knew what muck or misadventures lay at his boots.</p><p>With his free hand, Ransom felt around the space. \u201cMore like a secret closet. If this was ever a corridor, it\u2019s been closed off now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been a priest hole. A hiding place. They built them in the sixteenth century when Catholicism was made illegal. There should be a way out of here. A lever, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>He scouted the shelves, pulling and pushing on each ledge. Nothing. He tried throwing his weight against one side of the panel in an attempt to make it rotate back the other direction. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cDuncan and Miss Pelham are certain to come looking for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we hear footsteps, we\u2019ll shout for help.\u201d</p><p>She caught his coat. Her breathing was a labored rasp. \u201cJust don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>He felt her head shake no. Her hands found his coat lapels and curled in fists. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . so dark, and I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not fond of the dark. I recall.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head, burrowing into his shoulder.</p><p>Gods above. She hadn\u2019t been exaggerating. This was not merely fear but terror. He could feel it in the tremors that raced beneath her skin. He could hear it in the quickness of her breath. The same woman who stood defiant in the face of bats, rats, ghosts, and dukes was utterly petrified . . .</p><p>Of the dark.</p><p>Ransom couldn\u2019t bring himself to tease or gloat. All his angry lust had dissipated into the murky gloom. Sliding his arms around her back, he pulled her against his chest and clutched tight. Because he understood that fear, as well as he knew his own heart. He\u2019d been that miserable soul, alone and terrified in the fresh hell of darkness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, but you\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Her quaking continued. \u201cIt\u2019s s-so embarrassing and childish. It\u2019s been this way since I was nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you were nine?\u201d</p><p>That seemed rather late in life to develop an aversion to darkness. Maybe talking about it would banish the fear. At the least, it would fill the silence.</p><p>\u201cI used to spend summers with my aunt in Essex. She had no daughters. Just a son, Martin. I might have mentioned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who tossed you in a pond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her chest rose and fell with her accelerated breaths. Her story came in short bursts of words. \u201cThat\u2019s the one. Miserable, horrid boy. He was jealous, hated me. He wanted me gone. Whenever he caught me alone, he would strike me and call me cruel names. When his casual tormenting didn\u2019t work, he tried throwing me in the pond. And since that didn\u2019t get rid of me either, he caught me in the garden one day, dragged me into the root cellar, and locked me there. It was some thirty paces from the house, and, naturally, underground. No one heard my screams. A full day and night passed before they found me. And Martin got his wish. I cried so hysterically, Aunt Lilith sent me home. I\u2019ve hated the dark ever since.\u201d</p><p>Things began to make sense to him. \u201cThat\u2019s why the bedtime stories began. Because you were afraid of the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re always downstairs when I wake in the morning. Because you\u2019re still afraid of the dark.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled slowly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>With a gruff curse, he ran his hands up and down her back. \u201cThat cousin of yours was a vile little bastard. I hope he got what he deserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. He\u2019s a full-grown bastard now, and he reaped every reward for his vile behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s only will was older than I am, drawn up when he reached his majority. I never even knew it existed, and he never revised it. But it left everything to his closest male heir, so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin inherited everything.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhen he came to claim the house and all our material possessions, I thought surely Martin would have matured over the years. Perhaps we might work out some arrangement. But no. He was still the same malicious, petty bully, and he only hated me more for my father\u2019s success. He took everything from me, down to the last pen nib. And he did it gleefully.\u201d</p><p>Ransom stayed completely still, not wanting to alarm her. Meanwhile, rage burned through him like a wildfire. He reconsidered the plan of waiting on Duncan and Miss Pelham to find them. He was angry enough to punch straight through the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone very quiet,\u201d she said.</p><p>He inhaled and exhaled, trying to moderate his emotions. \u201cI\u2019m engaged in a creative-thinking exercise. Would I rather throw your cousin to a pack of famished jackals? Or watch him be picked apart by a teeming school of piranha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to pose that question to Lord Peregrine.\u201d</p><p>All was quiet for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cHow do you bear it?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow do you bear this all the time? The darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy at first.\u201d A grave understatement. \u201cBut with time, I\u2019ve grown accustomed. The dark scares you because it seems boundless. But it isn\u2019t as vast as it seems. You can explore it, learn the shape of it, take its measure\u2014just as you can see a room with your eyes. You have your hands, nose, ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my mind,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst part. It\u2019s my mind that fills the darkness with horrid things. I have too much imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the door to it, then. No stories or wild tales. Concentrate only on the things you can sense. What\u2019s in front of you?\u201d</p><p>Her hands flattened on the linen of his shirt, light and chilled. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to either side of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s behind you?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled slowly. \u201cYour hands. Your hands are on my back.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hands up and down, warming her. \u201cThen that\u2019s all you need to know. I have you. If there are beasties in the dark, they have to get through me.\u201d</p><p>After a few more moments, her trembling began to ease. Some knot of tension unraveled in his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so big and strong,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cAnd you smell so comforting.\u201d Her forehead rested on his shoulder. \u201cLike whisky and leather. And dog.\u201d</p><p>The description startled a laugh from him. \u201cYou\u2019re learning the way of it. There\u2019s a great deal you can sense about people without seeing them at all. Scents, sounds, textures. It amazes me sometimes how little attention I paid such things before I was injured. If there\u2019s a boon in all this, it\u2019s that I notice things I would have overlooked.\u201d</p><p>The woman in his arms, for instance.</p><p>If he\u2019d crossed paths with Izzy Goodnight at Court a few years back, Ransom was certain of one thing. He would not have given her a second look. She was dark, slightly built, and modestly dressed. Innocent, uncertain of her attractions. In sum, not his sort. His eyes had typically wandered to vivacious, fair-haired types.</p><p>In this case, his eyes would have done him a disservice.</p><p>Because this woman . . . she was a revelation. Every time he took her in his arms, he was astonished anew by her warmth and softness. The fresh, green scent of her hair and the wild-honey sweetness of her voice. Her instinctive passion.</p><p>And her tenderness. Her hands skimmed downward, and she slid her arms around his waist to hug him close.</p><p>Then she pressed her face to his shirtfront.</p><p>Nuzzling.</p><p>Well, she was back to herself again.</p><p>\u201cSo if noticing things you might have overlooked is the best part of being blinded, what\u2019s the worst?\u201d she asked.</p><p>God. There were too many contenders for that honor. She could guess at many of them. Others, she could never fathom, and he would never share.</p><p>\u201cLearning to hate surprise,\u201d he said, surprising himself with the confession. \u201cI\u2019m a creature of routine now. I have a mental chart of every room in this place, every tabletop. I have to put everything back precisely where I found it, or I\u2019m lost. Makes me feel like an old curmudgeon, growling at anything unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was unexpected,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. You were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve been altering your routine. Moving things about on your mental chart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You have.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head from his chest. \u201cI understand why you didn\u2019t want me in the castle. I was a surprise. You must have hated me.\u201d</p> <p>He swept a touch to her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you didn\u2019t hate me at the first, you have reason now. Ransom, you must believe me. I\u2019m just so sorry. For the letter, for the castle, for Lady Emily. For everything. You have every right to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shushed her. \u201cGoodnight. We\u2019re trapped together in a small, dark space. For the moment, we\u2019re getting on as well as could possibly be expected. I don\u2019t think this is the time to remind me of my many valid reasons to resent your presence and despise everything you stand for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cOn second thought, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t wait to be rescued. There must be a release latch somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it has to be me.\u201d Izzy shifted her body. \u201cMaybe if we re-create our position just before the panel turned. You were between my legs, and I had my hand on the shelf just about . . . here.\u201d</p><p>Ransom moved dutifully into place, lifting her by the hips and feeling like a jackass about it. Had he really held her like this? Spread wide and wrapped around him, while he pawed at her and made lewd demands, just so he could prove something to his wounded pride?</p><p>Yes. Evidently he had.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did it go? Oh, yes. You had your fingers inside me, and you were pleading with me to say your name, and then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we dispense with the details?\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. She was a penniless and homeless virgin who was just as much a victim of her father\u2019s charlatanry as anyone. And Ransom had never felt more disgusting. She had every reason to despise him, too.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then\u201d\u2014her body arced as she stretched high\u2014\u201cI think I pulled just here . . .\u201d</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Izzy\u2019s world tilted once again.</p><p>The panel spun on its axis, spitting them back out into the library. But this time, the hidden door didn\u2019t make a complete rotation. It lurched and stopped halfway.</p><p>They both tumbled forward with the momentum.</p><p>\u201cOof.\u201d</p><p>Ransom twisted as they fell, catching her in his arms and taking the brunt of the fall.</p> <p>She landed in his embrace, sprawled atop him and gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He released her. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. I was merely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t.\u201d Smiling, she pressed her fingers to his lips, shushing him. \u201cDon\u2019t even bother.\u201d</p><p>Izzy refused to listen to yet another speech about his dastardly behavior and his life that was a scourge on decency and romance.</p><p>Everything was different now. He\u2019d eased her trembling in the darkness. They\u2019d shared their innermost thoughts and memories. He\u2019d threatened her vile cousin with two imaginary, delightfully gory deaths.</p><p>They understood one another. At least, a little bit.</p><p>Most of all, Izzy knew, beyond a whisper of doubt, that all his talk of being a heartless villain was nothing more than that: talk.</p><p>Just to prove it . . . just to get back at him for all his crude, sensual games earlier . . . she bent over and pressed a tender kiss to his forehead.</p><p>And she held it, for two heartbeats more.</p><p>Take that, sweet man.</p><p>Then she pushed to her feet and did her best to cover herself with her displaced corset and the torn bodice. He remained exactly where he was, flat on the threadbare carpet.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He let his arms fall to the sides. \u201cI\u2019m slain.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps thundered down the corridor. Abigail and Duncan reeled around the corner and into the library.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Duncan said. He went straight to Ransom, surveying the dust and grime on his coat.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. We\u2019ve been searching all over.\u201d Abigail ran to Izzy, taking in her ripped garments and disheveled hair. Then she glanced toward Ransom where he lay on the floor. \u201cMy goodness. What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were . . . We were stuck.\u201d Unable to find the words to explain it, Izzy motioned toward the priest hole and hoped the rest would be obvious.</p><p>Abigail screamed.</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cWe did get out. And I\u2019m so sorry about your gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Abigail said weakly. She turned Izzy toward the priest hole. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Izzy looked. \u201cIs that . . . ?\u201d She cocked her head to the side, moving closer until there could be no doubt. Then she clapped a hand to her mouth. \u201cOh my God. It is.\u201d</p><p>There, tucked in the shadowed, dusty back corner of the priest hole, were bones.</p><p>An entire person\u2019s worth of bones.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t been alone in the dark at all.</p><p>The discovery brought a swift end to the dinner party. Centuries-old corpses had a way of doing that.</p><p>Ransom sent for both the magistrate and the vicar, and the two spent a full hour debating what was to be done with the bones. Whether reports needed to be filed; whether the remains could be buried on holy ground, and so forth. Even though he was found in a priest hole, he could have just as easily been a vagrant or a smuggler or a thief. There was no telling whether the dead man was even a Protestant or Catholic, so the men gratefully took Izzy\u2019s suggestion that the bones be interred in the castle\u2019s chapel.</p><p>They swept up the remains with as much dignity as could be mustered and laid them under a stone in the chapel floor. The vicar said a prayer.</p><p>And once the vicar had gone home, taking Miss Pelham and Izzy with him, Ransom was alone. He decided to honor the dead man in a different time-honored way. With heavy drinking.</p><p>He was on his second tumbler of whisky when he heard light footsteps traversing the hall.</p><p>\u201cIs that a ghost?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in ghosts, remember?\u201d</p><p>Izzy.</p><p>She walked the length of the hall. \u201cAbigail decided she\u2019d rather sleep at the vicarage tonight. I can\u2019t say I blame her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I do, either.\u201d He\u2019d assumed Izzy would be spending the night at the vicarage, too.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t stayed at the vicarage. She\u2019d come back to him.</p><p>His chest swelled with some unnameable, unthinkable emotion. He blamed the whisky.</p><p>She stopped by the hearth. \u201cWhy is the fire dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the new servants left. No one wants to work in a haunted castle of horrors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She added wood to the hearth and gave it a stir with the poker. \u201cWhat about Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSent him down to the village pub,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cHe needed a drink, and he\u2019s not the sort to drink alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t be alone. He\u2019d be here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the sort to drink alone.\u201d He tossed back another swallow. The earthy tang of whisky smoldered all the way down. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stay at the vicarage with Miss Pelham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe invited me. But I declined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot three hours ago, we found a dead man in the wall. And spent several minutes with him, in close company. You\u2019re not frightened to stay here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m always frightened, every night. You should know that now. But this is my house. I\u2019ve waited too long for a proper home just to run away at the first\u2014well, third or fourth\u2014sign of unpleasantness.\u201d</p><p>She drew up a chair. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m honest, there\u2019s another reason I returned.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cI was worried. I didn\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. How was it that this woman saw the rest of the world through the gauzy filter of some fairy tale but had an eagle\u2019s keenness when it came to Ransom\u2019s shortcomings? No matter how small the weakness, now matter how he tried to hide it . . . she homed in on that vulnerability and latched onto it with talons.</p><p>She sat down next to him. \u201cFinding that poor man\u2019s remains . . .\u201d He sensed her shudder. \u201cWell, it shocked us all. But it seemed to truly unnerve you.\u201d</p><p>It had. It had unnerved him greatly. Because it could have been him.</p><p>He leaned forward, letting his head hang toward the floor. Two hundred years from now, that could have been him. A wasted, forgotten sack of bones in this castle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, Goodnight, you have been the ruination of all my plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d she said. \u201cReally? That sounds like an accomplishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so smug. There weren\u2019t many plans left to ruin. There was exactly one plan remaining, in point of fact, which was to stay here until I rotted to dust.\u201d He sat tall again and pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cThen you came along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve found the desire to live again, and it\u2019s all to do with me.\u201d Fabric whispered as she slid farther into her chair. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear it. Hell, I can feel it. It\u2019s all warm and sweet and . . .\u201d He scowled. \u201cBah.\u201d</p><p>She made a little crooning noise. \u201cOh, Ransom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even worse.\u201d He lifted his shoulders, as if they could shield his ears. \u201cSee, this is why you\u2019ve ruined everything. Just ask that fellow we found in the wall. For centuries now, a man couldn\u2019t find a better place than Gostley Castle to shrivel up and decay. Not anymore. Now there are draperies and dinner parties. It\u2019s insupportable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said gently, \u201cthis means you should return to London. Rejoin the world of the living.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Return for what? There was nothing for him there.</p><p>He had no true friends. He\u2019d never wanted them. He was the Duke of Rothbury, one of the highest-ranked and wealthiest men in England. He didn\u2019t need to go courting acceptance, and anyone who tried to court his favor was a candidate for suspicion. They could only want something from him.</p><p>As for enemies . . . In his youth, he\u2019d collected enemies like a boy collects shiny pebbles. If people hated him, at least he knew he came by that revulsion honestly. And it wasn\u2019t as though his enemies could hurt him. He was invulnerable.</p><p>Right up until the moment he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Damn his eyes. Of all the injuries to incur. If he\u2019d lost a hand, he could have done without. For that matter, he could have given a leg. Both of them. But unless he regained his sight, he could never manage his affairs unaided. Now he was a prisoner of his own youthful arrogance. Left alone, with no one he could trust.</p><p>Well, he revised grudgingly, that wasn\u2019t quite true tonight.</p><p>Right now, he was very much not alone. He couldn\u2019t remember ever being so aware of a woman in his life. The rawness of his senses was painful. Izzy was killing him in a hundred tiny ways.</p><p>The fire she\u2019d stoked was sending waves of heat in his direction, and they were all scented of her. Smoky and herbal. He felt drugged by her nearness.</p><p>He could hear her removing the pins from her hair. One by one, those slender bits of metal hit the side table. Each tap concussed his eardrums like a powder blast.</p><p>Then she sighed. Just the faintest, softest release of breath. The sound swept through his chest like a hurricane, with the force to topple trees.</p><p>The irony didn\u2019t escape him.</p><p>They were alone. He was a little drunk, and she was more than a little vulnerable. This would have been the perfect time to continue with his ravishment scheme. He could lay siege to her virginal clothing. Ruthlessly dismantle her inhibitions. Steal an hour or two of fleeting pleasure before proving beyond a shadow of doubt: Romance is an exercise in willful delusion and nothing\u2014nothing\u2014ends happily. At least, not in this castle, and not with a man like him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was only one wrinkle in that scheme.</p><p>He liked her too much to go through with it.</p><p>\u201cYou need to retire for the night,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cNow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She yawned. \u201cI suppose I should.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t leave straightaway. She rose from her chair and did some moving about. At first, he assumed she was gathering a candle to light her way upstairs. But that couldn\u2019t possibly take her so long.</p><p>He listened to a solid minute\u2019s worth of andirons rattling and fabric rustling and furniture inching over slate before the truth sank in.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d He pushed to his feet. \u201cStop at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d Her voice carried an unmistakable note of guilt.</p> <p>\u201cStop what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d He rose to his feet and moved in her direction. \u201cYou just pushed that chair toward the table. And before that, you hung my coat on the peg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, you caught me. Call the magistrate. Put me in the stocks for excessive tidiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not tidiness, Goodnight. You know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get away with this. He knew exactly what she was doing. She was putting the room to rights before she left for the evening. Making certain every chair and pillow and fireplace poker was in its place.</p> <p>For him.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t mere tidiness. It was understanding and thoughtfulness. And considering his emotional state, tonight that behavior was dangerous. Any way she cared to spell it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you to your turret.\u201d He offered his arm before she could accuse him of chivalry or gallantry or anything else equally absurd. His motives were entirely disgusting.</p><p>He wanted to be close to her, shoulder to shoulder as they climbed the stairs to the next floor. He wanted to guide her down the corridor, sliding his hand across her waist and letting it settle just at the small of her back. He wanted to feel her unbound curls brushing against his exposed wrist.</p><p>He wanted . . .</p><p>God, he wanted her. All of her.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d She stopped at the archway that led to her turret room. \u201cGood night, Ransom.\u201d</p><p>He lingered, counting her steps as she climbed the stairs. One, two, three, four . . .</p> <p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>She stopped. Then came back down a few steps. One, two . . .</p><p>\u201cWas that a dismissal or a summons?\u201d she asked. \u201c \u2018Goodnight, come here\u2019? or \u2018Good night to you, now go away\u2019? \u201d</p><p>Hell, Ransom didn\u2019t even know. The word had just ripped from him. He suspected the sentiment behind it was something like, Goodnight, take off all your clothing and wrap your limbs around me and never let go.</p><p>\u201cThe fifteenth step,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more narrow than the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want me to fall and be hurt. How sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet.\u201d He gritted his teeth. \u201cI already swept up one pile of bones today. I\u2019d rather not contend with another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the same.\u201d Her hand touched his face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingertips rested on his cheek, like a constellation of unexpected kindness. He encircled her wrist with his fingers, planning to wrench her touch away.</p><p>Instead, he brushed his thumb over the fluttering beat of her pulse. Her skin was so soft there. His mind\u2019s eye bloomed with petals. In every shade of pink. And since it seemed he\u2019d already crossed the border into sentimental madness, and he couldn\u2019t possibly make it much worse\u2014</p><p>He brought her wrist to his lips. And he kissed that tender, precious heartbeat, like a damn besotted fool.</p><p>Bless you.</p><p>He released her, squeezing his eyes shut. He was dangling by a thread already. If his eyesight miraculously returned to him at this moment, she would have no chance at all.</p><p>\u201cHave mercy on a broken man. Just go to bed.\u201d</p><p>He stood at the bottom of the stairs, listening to her light steps spiraling up to the turret. Everything in him ached to follow. He leaned against the archway and gripped the stone, wrestling his desire.</p><p>As her last steps faded, he turned to walk away. He\u2019d reached the end of the corridor and counted half the stairs back down to the great hall when he heard it.</p><p>\u201cRansom!\u201d</p><p>He froze, one hand on the stone. A chill shot down his spine.</p><p>\u201cRansom, come at once.\u201d</p><p>And then, in the space of a second, he understood it. He understood the reason he\u2019d walked this castle every night in the dark. Learning the length and breadth of every room, arch, corridor, and stair. It wasn\u2019t about regaining his strength, or mastering the space that was now his home and prison. He\u2019d done it all for one purpose:</p><p>So he could get to her.</p><p>Now. As fast as his legs would carry him.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Izzy stood in the center of the room, frozen in shock. Ransom\u2019s steps came booming up the stairs.</p><p>He emerged into the room, breathless and red-faced. A storm of fury had gathered on his brow, and his scar forked from it like lightning. \u201cIzzy, what is it? Speak to me. Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She felt horrible for alarming him. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this. You did this? You must have done this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe candles. They\u2019re everywhere.\u201d</p><p>She turned a slow circle. At some point since she\u2019d last been in this room, someone had placed a dozen sconces around the perimeter. Each one held a lit beeswax taper. In addition, there were two candelabras on her dressing table, and one on the table beside her bed. The sheer number was extravagant and ridiculous\u2014they filled the space with enough light to rival a star, and their collective heat raised the temperature of the room by several degrees.</p><p>Izzy was overwhelmed.</p><p>They could only be Ransom\u2019s doing. She hadn\u2019t told anyone else.</p><p>She sniffed back a tear. \u201cDownstairs, you berated me for pushing in a chair or hanging a coat. And then . . . this?\u201d She swiped at her eyes. \u201cRansom, this is just unfair. Why would you go and do something so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just candles.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He had to know these were not just candles. They were caring. He was caring about her, for her, and it was such an unfamiliar sensation, Izzy didn\u2019t know what to do with it.</p><p>In desperation, she fluttered her hands, as if she could shoo the emotion away. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake.\u201d He moved toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re making too much of this. They\u2019re meant to keep you up here. In your room. Away from me. Every night, you\u2019ve been stealing downstairs in the dark, waking me up before dawn. I couldn\u2019t understand what it was you were missing up here, but I tried everything. Blankets, brazier, writing desk.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a hand to her throat. \u201cThose were all your doing, too? I thought Abigail . . .\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. I know what you\u2019re thinking, and I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not that way. This isn\u2019t how it looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had better hope not.\u201d She swept another glance around the candlelit room. \u201cBecause this looks . . . sweet. It looks . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cOh, Ransom, it\u2019s so romantic.\u201d</p><p>He pushed both hands through his hair in a gesture of frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. This is romantic. You are being romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d His arms went around her. \u201cI just . . . I just needed to keep you up here.\u201d He walked her backward until her knees met the edge of her bed, and they both tumbled onto the mattress. \u201cIn this bed.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, fanning it out over the pillows, and framed her face in his hands. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t discern what it was you needed to feel safe. I tried everything. Finally, tonight, you gave me the answer. Light. So now you have as many candles as you please. But now it\u2019s gone all wrong. Because you\u2019re here in this bed. But I\u2019m here, too. And God help me, Izzy.\u201d His brow pressed to hers, and his weight settled over her, crushing and warm. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how.\u201d She pushed on his shoulders. \u201cI will make you.\u201d</p><p>He tensed. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. We can\u2019t do this. Every time we get close, something awful occurs. The weasel bites you, a rock falls on your head, we get trapped with a dead man in a darkened hole. If we do this . . . ? God knows what could happen. The whole turret might collapse.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly, as if giving it careful thought. \u201cIzzy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it happen.\u201d His lips lowered to hers. \u201cI don\u2019t damn well care.\u201d</p><p>Let it happen, Ransom thought, pushing her back against the bed. Let God and the devil do their worst.</p><p>The castle could crumble to the ground. The world could end. The entirety of the Moranglian Army could show up wearing jingling bells. All that mattered was this. Her, and him, and the light of two dozen candles. The both of them, tangled in this bed.</p><p>No darkness. No loneliness. No fear.</p><p>And he wanted to be sure she would have no regrets.</p><p>\u201cIzzy, I want you. I feel the need to say it. Not to be crude or shocking, but just in case there\u2019s any ambiguity in this situation: Me, atop you, in your bed. You must know I want to . . .\u201d</p><p>His mind skipped over all the possible words. Bed you, tup you, fuck you, tumble you, make you my mistress . . .</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you, Izzy. Very, very, very badly.\u201d</p><p>Ransom had never used those words before. She couldn\u2019t know that, but he did.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her fingers went to his hair. \u201cI want you, too. So much.\u201d</p><p>Her shyly voiced admission redoubled his heart rate.</p><p>It was after midnight, and he was tired. Normally, his vision would be shot at this hour. But with all these candles, and the extreme nature of their evening, he had enough sight remaining to him that he could make out the dark aura of her hair against the white linen. And most lovely of all, her wide, red smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He turned her onto her side and began tugging at the buttons down the back of her frock. She\u2019d changed out of the soiled, torn red silk and into one of her everyday frocks. Even though the buttons were larger and the fabric easier to manage, his fingers didn\u2019t work too cleverly. It took him ages just to undo the first three or four buttons.</p><p>\u201cUndressing you was easier when you were unconscious,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt was probably easier when you weren\u2019t drunk.\u201d</p><p>Right. He supposed he could have blamed his trembling on the whisky. But in reality, Ransom knew better.</p><p>He was dashed nervous. Because this would be his first time in a long time, and it would be her first time ever.</p><p>And because this was Izzy, and he wanted it to be good.</p><p>With a curse, he gave up on buttons for the moment.</p><p>\u201cIzzy.\u201d He cupped and kneaded her breasts through the linen of her frock. \u201cI can\u2019t be patient. Not right now. Let me pleasure you.\u201d</p><p>He found the slit in her drawers and widened it with a swift, decisive rip of fabric. He pulled her to the edge of the mattress and knelt on the floor at her feet. Then he pushed her skirts and petticoat up, bunching them around her waist, and hooked an arm beneath one of her legs, spreading her wide.</p><p>There. Now he could touch all of her. Taste all of her.</p><p>\u201cRansom?\u201d She struggled to sit up. \u201cWhat are you do\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He laid his tongue to her core.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She flopped back against the bed. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>God, she was sweet. Sweet and pink and musky and Izzy.</p><p>Izzy, Izzy. My own.</p><p>His cock throbbed vainly in his breeches. As he licked her, he freed it with one hand and began to stroke. Shameless, lewd. Bringing himself off right there on the floor while he pleasured her? But this was what she did to him. She reduced him to a panting, needing beast with no care for civility or etiquette. And she liked him crude and profane. She\u2019d told him so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the bed, she writhed and wriggled. \u201cRansom. Ransom, are you certain this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>He raised his head just long enough to say: \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He worked his way over and around all her most sensitive places, taking time to accommodate and make adjustments.</p><p>She gasped his name and clutched at his hair, holding him fast to her core. God, he loved it when she touched his hair.</p><p>He increased his efforts, licking all along her folds, then sweeping back to the swollen bud at the crest of her sex and suckling hard, flicking his tongue back and forth.</p><p>She shuddered and moaned, arching off the bed and spasming under his tongue.</p><p>Yes. Yes.</p><p>Come for me. Me, and no other.</p><p>As her climax broke, he slid his tongue inside her, needing to be in her, in some way. To possess her. Her intimate muscles convulsed, pulling at him. Begging for more.</p><p>He hurried to rejoin her on the bed, fitting himself in the cradle of her splayed thighs. His cock brushed against the soft, dewy heat of her sex. He could be inside her in seconds.</p><p>But once he was inside her, there would be no taking it back.</p><p>He pressed his head to her shoulder and released a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cRansom?\u201d She pushed up on one elbow. \u201cWhat is it? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s for you to decide.\u201d</p><p>Izzy stared at him, her vision hazy in the aftermath of that beautiful, beautiful pleasure. Surely he wasn\u2019t changing his mind now. The broad, smooth head of his erection lay against her thigh\u2014hard and hot and eager.</p><p>He said, \u201cI\u2019m just drunk enough to think this is my most brilliant idea in ages. But I\u2019m not too drunk to stop if you don\u2019t feel the same.\u201d</p><p>She was sober, and she knew very well that this might not be the most prudent idea. But something felt right about it, all the same. This wasn\u2019t impersonal lust. They understood each other. She was likely halfway in love with him, and he cared for her, too. He might never say it in those words, but this very room was ablaze with the proof.</p><p>Besides, a girl like Izzy didn\u2019t have the luxury of being choosy with her nights of wild passion.</p><p>This happened tonight, or never.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stop,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d He sounded relieved as he pulled at her buttons and laces. His fingers moved more easily now. \u201cFor a moment there, I thought the attempt at decency would come back and bite me. It usually does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecency?\u201d She slipped one arm free of its sleeve. \u201cI should be terribly disappointed if you were decent. I\u2019m expecting you to be wicked indeed.\u201d</p> <p>He freed her breast and bent to suckle it. \u201cI\u2019ll do my damnedest. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>However long it had been, he hadn\u2019t forgotten how to make a woman twist and writhe.</p><p>He pressed a finger inside her. Then he added another finger to the first, stretching her with an exquisite fullness.</p><p>\u201cRansom . . . hurry. Don\u2019t you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed the heel of his hand against her mound, rubbing her in just the right place as he stroked his fingers in and out. Deeper, and deeper still. Before long, she was arching off the bed to meet his thrusts.</p><p>He bent to suck her nipple, and she moaned at the decadent heat of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured, sounding triumphant. He swirled his tongue in ruthless circles, and the sweet tension began to build between her thighs again.</p><p>He withdrew his fingers and sat up on his knees. He pulled his shirt over his head and cast it aside, then worked to undo the remaining closures of his breeches. Izzy thought about asking if she could help, but he didn\u2019t seem to need assistance.</p><p>When he\u2019d wrestled free of all his garments, he rejoined her on the bed. He dropped reverent kisses along her neck, her chest, her belly. She felt worshipped.</p><p>Then he moved between her legs, and his hips pushed her thighs wide.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She stroked his shoulders and chest, exploring the firm, sculpted contours. \u201cI . . .\u201d She nearly lost her courage. \u201cI want to see you. Touch you.\u201d</p><p>He sat back on his haunches in wordless invitation.</p><p>Izzy looked. There it was, in all its magnificence. Dusky, proud, alarmingly large. Jutting out from a thatch of dark hair and straining toward her.</p><p>She was entirely unaware of the protocol when becoming acquainted with a man\u2019s rampant sex organ. Did she reach out and give it a handshake? Touch one finger to the tip? Bid it a polite howdoyoudo?</p><p>In the end, she decided to ask for guidance. She put her hand in Ransom\u2019s. \u201cShow me how to please you.\u201d</p><p>The words alone made him moan. He took her hand in his and curled her grip about the base of his erection. Then he guided her, teaching her to stroke him, up and down. She loved the feel of him in her hand. The soft skin sliding over rigid flesh beneath. Curious, she brushed her thumb over the tip and was delighted to find it silky and sensitive.</p><p>He squeezed her hand, preventing her from indulging in any further explorations.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong? Is there something else I should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong,\u201d he whispered, lacing his fingers with hers and pressing her hands back to the bed. \u201cNothing else. You\u2019re perfect. Just be there. Just be you. Lovely, lovely Izzy.\u201d</p><p>She felt the smooth, broad crown of his erection prodding at her entrance.</p><p>And then he was inside her.</p><p>She cried out. She couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He pushed forward, sinking an inch deeper. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to breathe. He was just so foreign and . . . and just impossibly large inside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take this slowly.\u201d He dropped little kisses on her lips. She could taste the whisky in them. \u201cUntil I can\u2019t anymore, and then I\u2019ll probably take it hard and fast. I\u2019ll apologize now. Words might be beyond me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t, really, but she assumed she\u2019d figure it out along the way. She was still struggling to adjust to the feeling of him inside her. The fullness, the stretching, the heat. He glided smoothly in and out, sinking a little deeper each time. Eventually, his body met hers, holding there a moment before retreating to do it all again.</p><p>Soon the pain of their joining receded, and she began to enjoy the friction of his hard, male body against hers. His legs, coarse with hair and dense with muscle, rubbing against her sensitive inner thighs. His chest pressing against her breasts.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t so bad anymore. It was rather nice.</p><p>He lifted up on his arms. His face twisted. \u201cIzzy. God. I . . .\u201d</p><p>Right. So this would be the \u201chard and fast\u201d part now. She was glad that he\u2019d warned her.</p><p>He shifted, and his hips spread her thighs to a new, wider angle, holding her open for his thrusts. He drilled deep, working in and out of her body at a furious pace. It hurt her. It excited her. It pushed her to the verge of . . . of something unknown.</p><p>She felt as though she were sprawled atop not a wool-batting mattress but a tense, brittle surface. A thin sheet of ice over black, fathomless longing. Each of his fierce thrusts put a crack in it. The unknown that lay beneath both thrilled and frightened her. She wanted to let go, to fall through it . . . but she was too afraid to let go.</p><p>He knew what she needed.</p><p>He reached between them and pressed his thumb to her pearl, working it in small, tight circles. The tension broke into a thousand facets of pleasure, and she clung to his neck as her world constricted to the thick, hard, stroking length of his cock. Her orgasm was weightless, helpless, endless. Like free-falling through clouds of bliss.</p><p>Above her, he cursed. Then groaned. Then cursed again.</p><p>Out of nowhere, she felt like laughing. He\u2019d been right. Words were beyond him now. It felt good to know she\u2019d sent him to some other place.</p><p>One last frantic barrage of thrusts, and he slumped atop her. Heavy, panting, sweating, shuddering.</p><p>At last, he released her hands. His arms went about her middle, clutching tight. He laid his head on her breast.</p><p>Tentative, Izzy placed one hand flat on the slick surface of his back. With her other hand, she touched his hair.</p><p>He tensed for a moment. She did, too. And then he exhaled so deeply, she could believe he was expelling air from his lungs that had been there for months. Perhaps years. Everything went out of him\u2014all the arrogance, pride, anger, fear, lust. Until he just existed in her arms.</p><p>She stroked his hair, teasing her fingers through the soft, heavy locks. Her heart swelled with an unbearable sweetness. It didn\u2019t matter what happened tomorrow. This tenderness was worth everything.</p><p>\u201cRansom,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve fallen just a little bit in love with you. You needn\u2019t be worried. I won\u2019t expect you to return the emotion, and I know that this can\u2019t last. But I\u2019ve been waiting so long for somebody to care for, and I . . . I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>She waited, heart pounding in her chest, for his reaction.</p><p>And when it finally came, it was this:</p><p>A faint, reverberating snore.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>The strangest things woke Ransom the next morning. Sunlight, streaming warm on his face. A gentle breeze, scented of blossoms. The chirp of songbirds.</p><p>The tickle of hair against his neck.</p><p>\u201cRansom. Ransom.\u201d</p><p>Someone was shaking the limp, dead weight of his arm.</p><p>Izzy.</p><p>He opened his eyes. He saw the halo of curls surrounding her pale face. Those dark eyebrows. Her red lips.</p><p>\u201cRansom, wake,\u201d she said, shaking him again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was a rasp. \u201cI\u2019m not dead.\u201d Emotion burned at the corners of his eyes, like acid. He said it again, slowly. Gratefully. \u201cI am not dead.\u201d</p><p>He was very much alive. Awakened, in a way he\u2019d never felt before. His heart was like a new organ, pumping a fizzy, champagne-like joy through his veins. He felt like dashing to the window and bursting into song.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been with a woman since . . .</p><p>Well, since.</p><p>For the first few months after his injury, he was simply in too much pain to contemplate it. And then . . . then, he\u2019d feared it would be like entering an unfamiliar room. He\u2019d be fumbling about, cursing. Making stupid mistakes as he learned the lay of the space. What if it was bad?</p><p>What if he was bad?</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t been bad. It had been good. So damned good for them both. Memories came back to him in bits and pieces. Her slick heat clenching around his fingers, making him wild to get inside her. The tight, willing welcome he\u2019d found once their bodies joined. The sweet way she\u2019d held him at the end.</p><p>Izzy, Izzy.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNow hurry and dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He blinked and sat up in bed.</p><p>She fluttered about the room, washing up and donning her clothing. Watching her was like watching a burlesque dancer. Water splashed and dripped as she dragged a sponge over her body. He watched, transfixed, as her white shift drifted down over her dark head, then the pale pink column of her nude body. She pulled her hair free, and it tumbled like a black cascade, transforming her silhouette once again. Light and dark tugging back and forth.</p><p>There was no doubt in his mind that she was the most alluring creature he\u2019d ever beheld. Utterly, elementally sensual.</p><p>He moved to the edge of the bed, catching her by the waist and drawing her close. He pressed his forehead to her belly. \u201cIzzy . . .\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from his grasp. \u201cWe can\u2019t. Not now. I don\u2019t know where Duncan\u2019s gone, but he\u2019s sure to turn up soon. We can\u2019t let him find us like this.\u201d</p><p>Ransom rubbed his face. \u201cBelieve me, Duncan has seen far, far worse. And he knows better than to ask for explanations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose this could be just another morning for the two of you. But it\u2019s a bit out of the usual for me.\u201d A wadded ball of fabric hit him in the chest. \u201cYour clothing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stymied, he sorted out the tangle of garments. This wasn\u2019t \u201cjust another morning\u201d for him, either.</p><p>He yanked the shirt over his head and punched his arms through the sleeves. Then he rose from the bed, pulling his breeches to his waist and fastening the closures.</p><p>He crossed to the dressing table, where she was hastily pinning up her hair. He dropped a kiss on her exposed neck. \u201cIzzy, last night was . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He caught a stray curl. \u201cI don\u2019t think you do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and turned to face him. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You needn\u2019t be worried, Ransom. I understand. Last night was lovely, but . . .\u201d</p><p>But?</p><p>Ransom couldn\u2019t believe he was hearing that word. Last night was so lovely, but?</p> <p>No \u201cbut\u201d belonged in that sentence. Only \u201cand.\u201d Last night was so lovely and passionate and tender and erotic and . . .</p><p>\u201cBut it was like a dream,\u201d she went on briskly. \u201cThis morning, I\u2019m clear-eyed and levelheaded. You needn\u2019t worry. I haven\u2019t formed any silly expectations of you.\u201d</p><p>Good God. He was shocked speechless.</p><p>These were words that any jaded rake would be thrilled to hear. Words that Ransom would have been thrilled to hear, from any other woman, on any prior occasion.</p><p>Coming from her, this morning? The words were gutting him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get back to our work this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI can be very professional. I promise, it will be like nothing happened at all.\u201d</p> <p>She slipped away from him, hastening down the stairs.</p><p>He let her go.</p><p>She had no expectations of him.</p><p>Truly, none?</p><p>Did she really think he would make love to her last night, and then want to go on today as if nothing had happened at all?</p><p>Well, of course she believed that. Why wouldn\u2019t she? She\u2019d spent the past few weeks reading through abundant evidence of just such behavior. By now, she was intimately acquainted with his history, his temperament, all his vices and faults. He\u2019d done nothing but underscore the impression with boorish behavior and the occasional groping. Add to everything the fact that he was a scarred, blinded wretch.</p><p>And then, last night, he\u2019d taken her virtue\u2014without so much as the mention of marriage, or even any promises beyond the one night\u2019s pleasure.</p><p>Naturally, she had no expectations.</p> <p>He supposed that meant one thing.</p><p>If he wanted any chance of keeping her, Ransom would have to come up with some surprises.</p><p>Izzy needed the comfort of familiar tasks this morning. Too many aspects of her world had altered since yesterday. She was no longer a virgin. She was a bit sore between her legs. Her heart was raw and tender.</p><p>In sum, she ached all over.</p><p>What did last night mean to him? What did it mean to her?</p><p>She was afraid to ask those questions. She would rather linger in this giddy ignorance a while longer.</p><p>All these stretched and vulnerable parts of her needed some time to recover, that was all. And then Izzy could take a deep breath and a good, hard look at herself.</p><p>\u201cYou started without me?\u201d</p><p>Then she looked up and saw him. The air vacated her lungs. Her grip tightened on her pen.</p><p>Snap, went the quill.</p><p>Thud, went her heart.</p><p>No man should be this handsome. It just wasn\u2019t fair. He entered the great hall, wearing a clean, open-necked shirt tucked into gray trousers. His hair was still damp at the temples, but the sunlight found the streaks of gold in his brown hair and teased her with them.</p><p>With effort, Izzy tore her gaze away and attempted to concentrate on the task at hand. It was rather like trying to work with a small, glowing sun in the room. Struggle as she might to avoid looking directly at him, she couldn\u2019t escape his intensity and heat. Much less her memories of last night. Perspiration beaded between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d she said, clearing her throat, \u201cwe must settle down to business. No more going through every paper and sorting them into piles. I\u2019ve read enough by now that I can tell Significant from Insignificant at a glance. We need to start making meaningful progress through this heap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the rush?\u201d He didn\u2019t settle in his usual place on the sofa. Instead, he came to stand at her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve been purposely delaying thus far. More days of work means more money for you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, but that was before. Before she\u2019d realized something was amiss in these papers and before she cared enough about him to want it sorted out.</p><p>Something was wrong here.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find all the envelopes from your solicitors.\u201d She handed him an envelope, moving his thumb over the lumpy wax holding it closed. \u201cThey always use the same seal. You can find them by touch.\u201d</p><p>He cast the envelope aside. \u201cI\u2019d rather be touching you.\u201d</p><p>He moved behind her, putting his hands on her shoulders and kneading her tensed muscles.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We truly do. I\u2019ve been growing quite concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be concerned.\u201d He kissed her just beneath the ear. \u201cIzzy, I don\u2019t want you to worry about anything.\u201d</p><p>Her knees went to jelly again. She braced one palm flat on the table, leaning her weight on it for strength.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a letter from the solicitors. I should sit down and read it.\u201d She reached for her usual seat.</p><p>He slid his arm around her waist and kicked the chair away. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible to read standing, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible to do a lot of things standing.\u201d He left a trail of kisses down the nape of her neck. His hands caressed her hips.</p><p>She laughed nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of you this morning. Where\u2019s the surly man who greets the dawn with a curse? What about \u2018Good grief, Goodnight\u2019? Where are those charming maritime endearments?\u201d</p><p>He pulled on a lock of her hair. \u201cOctopus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s all wrong. You said it so fondly.\u201d</p><p>She made her voice chastening, but secretly, she was elated. Apparently, whatever it was between them, he wanted it to last longer than the one night.</p><p>She broke the envelope\u2019s seal and began to read. \u201cIt\u2019s dated three months ago. It begins, \u2018May it please Your Grace\u2014\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he murmured. \u201cRepeat it for me. Just those last three words.\u201d</p><p>The last three words? Izzy consulted the paper. \u201cPlease Your Gra\u2014\u201d Oh, the shameless rogue. She gave in. \u201cPlease, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d He slipped one hand to cup her breast. The other delved under her skirts.</p><p>\u201cRansom,\u201d she chided. \u201cSomeone could come in at any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They could. That\u2019s what makes it so exciting.\u201d</p><p>Izzy couldn\u2019t deny it. It was exciting. Her nipples drew to tight points, and between her legs, she was already aching for him. \u201cBut you can\u2019t mean for us to . . .\u201d She swallowed. \u201cReally? Here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I mean to do this everywhere. I plan to have you in every room of this castle. And why stop there? On the ramparts, beneath the stars. In the park, on a blanket spread amid waving grasses.\u201d He pushed her skirts to her waist. \u201cBut we start right here, right now. I\u2019ve been dreaming of taking you on this table for weeks.\u201d</p><p>The lines started to blur together on the page. Her hand slipped forward, and papers spilled to the floor. There was nothing Significant anymore. Nothing except the wicked caress of his fingers, sweeping up her thigh.</p><p>\u201cHullo? Anyone about?\u201d</p><p>The unfamiliar voice called up from the courtyard.</p><p>Izzy startled, sending a sheaf of papers to the ground. \u201cOh, heavens,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHullo!\u201d The voice again. \u201cHo, there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who he is. He needs to disappear.\u201d Ransom turned and called out the window. \u201cFor the love of God, man. I have England\u2019s sweetheart bent over the desk and panting for me. Go away and come back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Horrified, Izzy shoved him away. \u201cRansom.\u201d</p><p>She hastened outside. Thankfully, the visitor wasn\u2019t anyone she knew. Just a messenger with an express post. Izzy gave him the postage and an extra coin for his troubles, apologizing for the duke\u2019s inappropriate sense of humor.</p><p>When she came back inside, she put off his attempts at returning to their interlude, putting a hand to his chest.</p><p>\u201cRansom, don\u2019t ever joke like that. I mean it. What if Duncan or Abigail had been about? Worse, what if that had been a Moranglian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if it had been?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy do you care what those people think? Why are you so afraid of their knowing that you\u2019re not an innocent little girl anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause being that innocent little girl is how I\u2019ve survived.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly understand this. He was a wealthy, privileged duke, and he always had been. He didn\u2019t know what it was to be hungry and shivering alone in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYou recall how little I had to my name when I came here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you succeed in taking this castle from me, I\u2019ll be left with nothing again. But my father\u2019s admirers support me, in their own . . . unique but well-meaning ways. I may not have money, but at least I have the goodwill of thousands.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a face. \u201cYou have a weasel. And sweetmeats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d She broke the seal on the letter. \u201cYes, I might have to subsist on sweetmeats some days. Yes, the roof over my head might be that of my third host in as many weeks. But I will always have food. I will always have a bed. Just so long as I\u2019m the girl they want me to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as you\u2019re little Izzy Goodnight. Not Izzy Goodnight, scandalous mistress. Or Mrs. Izzy Something-Else-Entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. So please, Ransom. Don\u2019t ruin it. Don\u2019t ruin me with your thoughtless joking. Not unless you mean to promise me that I\u2019ll never spend another night of my life feeling cold, hungry, alone, or unloved.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. \u201cLove isn\u2019t something I know how to offer. I don\u2019t have the goodwill of thousands. You\u2019ve read my letters. I don\u2019t have the goodwill of anyone. And not all of us spent our childhoods in starry bedchambers, tucked beneath coverlets with kisses and stories each night.\u201d</p><p>Her heart twisted in her chest. \u201cHow did you go to bed at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWealthy.\u201d</p><p>The silence was distressing, so she turned her gaze to the letter as a diversion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never made pretensions of being a romantic hero. And now I\u2019m scarred, blinded, scorned by the world. But it\u2019s not as though I couldn\u2019t provide for you. I am still a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She stared numbly at the paper in her hands, scanning its contents. \u201cAccording to this letter, you might not be much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis express that just arrived from your solicitors. It says they\u2019ve arranged a mental-competency hearing. They\u2019re challenging your sanity and your ability to continue acting as the Duke of Rothbury.\u201d She lowered the paper. \u201cThey\u2019re coming here. Next week.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>For the rest of the morning, any visitor who interrupted them would have discovered nothing more scandalous than a harried secretary and her irate employer, both buried chest deep in paperwork.</p><p>They\u2019d opened, read, and sorted through everything.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>Izzy\u2019s eyes were going crossed.</p><p>\u201cHere it is, at last.\u201d She read the paper aloud. \u201c \u2018May it please Your Grace, the business has been completed. Gostley Castle has been sold, at your request.\u2019 \u201d She lowered the letter. \u201cThis was dated three months ago. So they did sell the castle to Lynforth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I never made any such request.

They\u2019re trying to make me look unstable. I\u2019m being set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet up?\u201d Izzy echoed. \u201cBy the solicitors? Why would they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re working in concert with my heir, most likely. You\u2019re not the only one with a grasping cousin. Mine wouldn\u2019t dare throw me in a pond or lock me in a root cellar, but he\u2019d happily take the title and control of my fortune, given the chance.\u201d</p> <p>Izzy sifted through the pile of notices. \u201cThis is beyond my expertise. You need help. A new solicitor, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>He dismissed the idea. \u201cI can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and that\u2019s a problem. You need to start trusting people, Ransom. Start by letting them know you. Not just your strengths, but your weaknesses, too.\u201d</p><p>He paced back and forth on the stone floor. \u201cLet them know the real me. All my weaknesses. Yes, I\u2019ll make plans to do that. Right on the heels of your announcement that Izzy Goodnight isn\u2019t a girl anymore but a twenty-six-year-old woman who likes her nipples pinched.\u201d</p><p>Izzy supposed his point was valid. They were both hiding parts of themselves. But the consequences weren\u2019t quite the same.</p> <p>She tapped a stack of papers to tidy them. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that matters progressed to this stage because you were too ashamed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshamed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ashamed.\u201d Izzy was tired of dancing around it. He was the one who\u2019d insisted he didn\u2019t want coddling. \u201cYou\u2019re a duke, and your intended bride ran off with a lowly farmer. Then the farmer bested you in a duel, leaving you blinded. That had to have been humiliating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe farmer did not best me in anything, damn it.\u201d He stopped by the windows. \u201cDo you know the only thing more dangerous than fencing against a master swordsman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFencing against a love-drunk fool who hasn\u2019t a goddamn clue what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s like defending both sides at once. He\u2019d never even held a sword before. I had to try like hell not to run him through.\u201d</p> <p>What was he saying? That he\u2019d incurred his injury while trying not to win?</p><p>She rose from the table and moved toward him. \u201cRansom . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t kill him. What good would that have done anyone? I only chased after them because I feared she hadn\u2019t gone willingly. On that point, I was corrected.\u201d</p><p>Izzy ached for him. Now she regretted using the word ashamed. He shouldn\u2019t feel ashamed of his actions. He\u2019d risked everything to protect that girl. He should wear that scar like a badge of pride.</p><p>\u201cIt was good of you.\u201d She said it firmly. Not as a placating gesture, but as a fact she wouldn\u2019t let him contradict. \u201cYou must have cared for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to marry her,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I cared. As much as a man like me is able to care. No, we didn\u2019t share any grand passion or meeting of hearts and minds, but I thought she was . . . practical. Interested in becoming a duchess and spending my money, and patient enough to put up with my faults in exchange.\u201d He flexed one hand. \u201cIn the end, it seems I misjudged.\u201d</p><p>Izzy felt a powerful twinge of guilt, thinking of Lady Emily\u2019s letter. \u201cShe was so young. Probably just impressionable and frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I think it\u2019s the other way round. She was more perceptive than I gave her credit for.\u201d He turned back toward the pile of correspondence. \u201cWhen I lose all control of my fortune, she will be able to celebrate her narrow escape.\u201d</p> <p>If you lose all control of your fortune, what becomes of me?</p><p>Izzy chided herself for thinking it, but the fear was creeping in fast. It would seem the castle was legally hers, after all. But she\u2019d never be able to keep the place\u2014or find another home\u2014without the wages he\u2019d promised her.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness.\u201d Abigail and Duncan entered the room, surveying the drifts of paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened here?\u201d</p><p>Ransom rose to his feet. \u201cTreachery. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there another body in the walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Izzy lifted the letter that had come express. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting important visitors next week. Apparently, His Grace is to be the subject of a mental-competence hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lunacy hearing? But that\u2019s absurd. The duke\u2019s not mad.\u201d She turned and whispered to Izzy, \u201cHe isn\u2019t mad, is he?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Abigail. Izzy lifted her eyebrows and shook her head no.</p><p>The vicar\u2019s daughter continued in a not-quite-confidential murmur, \u201cI mean, he did behave rather strangely last night.\u201d</p><p>Ransom cleared his throat. \u201cMiss Pelham, I am standing right here. I am not deaf. And as it will be plain for the lawyers and doctors to discern, I am not mad.\u201d</p><p>But he was blind.</p><p>That was the true unspoken source of concern, and everyone was thinking it. Blind people were often put in asylums even if they were otherwise of sound mind. Considering the neglected state of his business affairs and his prolonged, dramatic absence from society, Ransom wasn\u2019t going to have an easy time of this. If his solicitors wanted him gone, the truth would be a heavy stroke against him.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d He pushed both hands through his hair. \u201cI could lose everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cWe won\u2019t let it happen. Because if you lose everything, so do I. For that matter, so do Duncan and Abigail.\u201d</p><p>If Ransom wasn\u2019t the duke any longer, Duncan wouldn\u2019t have a post. If Izzy had to abandon the castle for lack of funds, Abigail would lose the support for the local parish.</p><p>They were all in this together now.</p><p>\u201cForget everything I said about honesty. If these solicitors have been lying to you, you can lie right back to them. They never have to know the extent of your injuries. When I arrived at this castle, it took me hours to realize you were blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were unconscious for most of them,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cJust the same. You know what I mean. You know this castle in the dark, and you can focus well enough that your eyes don\u2019t wander. All you have to do is bluff your way through this one interview. Once they\u2019re gone, you can sack Blaylock and Riggett and hire new solicitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the castle, Miss Goodnight.\u201d Duncan looked around. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a ducal residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll make it one.\u201d She squared her shoulders. \u201cWe have a week. The castle\u2014the public parts of it, anyhow\u2014need to be immaculate. But we mustn\u2019t change the arrangement of the rooms by even one inch. The duke will need a wardrobe. For that matter, I could use a new gown or two.\u201d Izzy twisted her fingers. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need servants. A great many servants. To clean, garden, serve at table . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRefreshing the duke\u2019s wardrobe will be a distinct pleasure,\u201d Duncan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Izzy, you know I\u2019d love to help with yours. We\u2019re all ready for hard work. But that last bit\u2014the servants\u2014will be a challenge.\u201d Abigail looked regretful. \u201cIt was already difficult to convince the local people to come work at the castle . . . what with its bloody history, the ghostly rumors, and the duke\u2019s months of seclusion. But after the bones were found in the wall . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIn time, I\u2019m certain I could convince them to come back. But this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if we did manage to hire them,\u201d Duncan said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I could train village folk to an acceptable standard in that time. Then there\u2019s the matter of uniforms and livery. It all seems rather hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be hopeless,\u201d Izzy said.</p><p>Abigail smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Izzy. Would Cressida and Ulric just give up? Of course not. We\u2019ll pull through somehow. Doubt not.\u201d</p><p>And with that, all four of them fell silent.</p><p>Doubting.</p><p>But they couldn\u2019t waste much time with doubt. Not when there was so much to be done.</p><p>Over the next few days, everyone in Gostley Castle worked hard. And no one more so than Ransom.</p><p>A few days later, Izzy watched from the entryway as he scrawled a line of script across a blank page\u2014once, then again and again. After ten repetitions, he lifted the paper and held it to the light, as if trying to judge the straightness of the lines.</p><p>Apparently dissatisfied, he cursed and crumpled the paper into the grate.</p><p>She held her breath and waited for all the evidence to be destroyed. Only when he drew out a fresh sheet of paper did Izzy gather the courage to approach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy, Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>He knew her footsteps too well.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cLet it wait, then. Go sweep a cobweb from the rafters or polish a mirror. There must be some household task that needs attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a task that needs attention. It\u2019s this one.\u201d She set her tray on the tabletop next to him. \u201cYou need to eat.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her.</p><p>She sliced a pear into wedges, then offered him one. \u201cYour eyesight is better when you\u2019ve eaten. And you need your eyesight because I have something important to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He reached out, catching her by the wrist. Then, using his teeth, he took the slice of pear straight from her fingers and devoured it. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>She offered him another slice. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He ate more. Slice after slice until the pear was gone. He finished by licking her palm and sucking the juice from each finger in turn. That wicked tongue of his swirled around her knuckles and teased the sensitive webs between her fingers.</p><p>At last, her littlest finger slid from his mouth with an audible pop.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this important thing you have to show me?\u201d</p><p>Dashed if Izzy could remember after that sensual onslaught. She had to shake her head to clear it.</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>\u201cYour new bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tipped in that roguish half grin. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>As she led him up the stairs and down the corridor, Izzy felt rather like a chicken leading a fox straight to his own den.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cThe ducal bedchamber. We blocked out the bats with shutters, then cleaned the chimney. The bed hangings and tapestries are all new. The drapes, as well.\u201d</p><p>He strode to the center of the chamber, nodding thoughtfully. \u201cI like what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to contrive compliments. That wasn\u2019t my goal. I just wanted to give you a chance to map out the room, before the . . . Before the new servants arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a contrived compliment. I can hear the difference.\u201d He took another measured step. \u201cThe whole room is softer. The echoes are muted, the hard edges are gone. It\u2019s cozy.\u201d</p><p>Izzy smiled, and her nerves lost their edges, too. He didn\u2019t need to praise their hard work, but it meant a great deal that he did.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the bed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . still there. Exactly where it was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>She took the hand he offered and led him to the edge of the enormous four-poster bed. \u201cHere. There\u2019s a new mattress, of course. And we restrung the frame with new ropes.\u201d</p><p>He pushed up and down. \u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>Then he caught her in his arms and launched them both onto the bed. Izzy shrieked as they landed in a tangle in the center of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m testing something.\u201d He wrapped his legs over hers, then rolled them back and forth over the length of the bed. When he stopped in the center again, he said, \u201cI was right. Large enough for a duke and six women besides.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you want six women, none of them will be me.\u201d She struggled to disentangle herself and sit up.</p><p>He pulled her back down. \u201cWhat if I just want you? Six times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix times in one night? Impossible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat sounded like a challenge.\u201d His hand slid to cup her breast. \u201cI accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansom . . .\u201d Her words trailed off into a sigh as he licked along the lacy edge of her bodice. \u201cRansom, we can\u2019t. Not now. There\u2019s too much to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done so much already.\u201d He shushed her, nudging her legs apart so he could reach between them. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working so hard, Izzy. This room is proof of it. Just relax for a moment. Let me give you something in return.\u201d</p><p>It worried her that he couldn\u2019t seem to accept the smallest kindness\u2014not even a sliced pear\u2014without thinking he needed to repay her somehow. If not with wages, with pleasure.</p><p>Not that she minded the pleasure, of course. Izzy had scarcely slept in days. The soft, springy mattress cushioning their weight was so inviting, and his hard, wanting body atop hers felt so right. She\u2019d missed him so much.</p> <p>Still . . .</p><p>As he kissed her ear, she sighed and smiled. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be cooperative, ever?\u201d</p><p>He slid a hand under her skirt. \u201cWhere would the joy be in that?\u201d</p><p>Joy.</p><p>The word surprised her.</p><p>Of all the words he could have used in that sentence. Where would the sport be in that? he could have said. Or, Where would the fun be in that?</p> <p>But he hadn\u2019t spoken of \u201csport\u201d or \u201cfun.\u201d He\u2019d spoken of joy. Was that truly what he felt with her?</p><p>She hoped so. She couldn\u2019t deny it any longer. She wanted him to feel at home here. Here, in this castle\u2014and here, with her.</p><p>If they managed to pull through this . . . inspection, of sorts . . . he wouldn\u2019t need to hide and brood in Gostley Castle anymore.</p><p>But might he possibly want to stay?</p><p>She touched his face, running her fingers over his cheek and reaching to stroke his hair. This impossible, flawed, wounded man who\u2019d brought her in from the rain. Who\u2019d eased her trembling in the dark. Who\u2019d made her feel beautiful and cherished in his embrace.</p><p>He had so much more inside him if only she could find the way to reach it. Passion. Devotion. Love. Somewhere deep inside him was a true and constant heart, struggling to emerge from under all the scars and pride. Some part of her had known it from the first day, when he\u2019d carried her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cRansom,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhatever happens, I hope\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He shushed her, frowning. \u201cWhat the devil am I hearing?\u201d</p> <p>Ransom was listening to sounds he\u2019d hoped never to hear again. The clop of hooves, the clack of wheels\u2014and the ceaseless clanking of cut-rate armor.</p><p>Bloody hell. They\u2019re back.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re early,\u201d she said.</p><p>She\u2019d known about this? \u201cIzzy, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Please don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>As if he could be angry with her. He rose from bed and went to the window, unwillingly and inexorably at once\u2014as if drawn by the sight of a carriage wreck. That familiar silvery rainbow of people poured into the courtyard.</p><p>They\u2019d been invaded by the Moranglians again.</p><p>Izzy joined him at the window. \u201cI know. I know how you feel about them. But we\u2019re desperate for help. We can\u2019t be particular.\u201d She called down to the men filling the courtyard with their obnoxious clanking. \u201cWe are honored, Sir Wendell! How good you are to heed my summons in our hour of need.\u201d</p><p>From the courtyard, a voice floated up. \u201cDoubt not, Miss Goodnight. We have returned from thither to offer our service anon.\u201d</p><p>Ransom wrested her away from the windows. \u201cIzzy, no. No. I\u2019m supposed to be displaying my sanity and competence in all things ducal. Having the castle overrun by delusionals with play swords and an unnatural fondness for the words \u2018thither\u2019 and \u2018anon\u2019 is not going to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice. There\u2019s no time left to find, train, and outfit servants locally. These people want to help. They\u2019ve drilled to act in unison, and . . . well, they do have matching attire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are wearing breastplates from some blacksmith\u2019s scrap heap. It\u2019s hardly proper livery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s unusual, but we\u2019ll play it off as my eccentricity,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know how everyone sees me. I\u2019m a dreamy little girl, living in my father\u2019s storyland.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, he hated that she had to pretend that. He especially hated that she had to pretend one more moment of it for his sake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting one more problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is that all these people have me mistaken for their hero. They\u2019ll be calling me Ulric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s mistaken. Everyone understands that stories are just stories. These people never believed you were Ulric. They just think . . . Well, they think you\u2019re one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ransom, they\u2019d gladly be your friends if you\u2019d let them.\u201d</p><p>Friends.</p><p>Friendship with these people was not what he needed. But the hard truth of it was, he did need servants. He couldn\u2019t appear to be moldering in a decrepit castle alone with his valet. Even though that\u2019s exactly what he had been doing up until a few weeks past.</p><p>\u201cJust give them a chance,\u201d she whispered, kissing his cheek before she descended to greet her adoring throng. \u201cDo it for me?\u201d</p><p>Do it for me.</p><p>The woman had no idea the trials he would suffer for her. A great deal more than this foolishness.</p><p>He\u2019d imprisoned himself in this castle to rot. He\u2019d cut off all contact with the outside world. And just when he thought he\u2019d burned all his bridges, this woman\u2014this impossible, sweet, foolish woman\u2014arrived, determined to swim the moat. Breach his defenses. Make a home. Stay.</p><p>If not for her, this room would still be filled with rats and bats. If not for her, he\u2019d be sitting unshaven and drunk in the great hall, morosely counting his steps to nowhere. And if not for her, he would have no reason to fight this battle at all.</p><p>Perhaps he would have no title or fortune to offer her, but he was determined to see her safe.</p><p>Everything he did, from this point forward . . .</p><p>It was all for her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Gather round, everyone. This will be our final time through the paces.\u201d</p><p>Izzy called down from the window of the ducal chamber, addressing the assembled knights, handmaidens, servants, and friends below.</p><p>Tomorrow, the solicitors arrived. This would be their last chance to practice.</p><p>She cleared her throat, and called, \u201cTake your places, please.\u201d</p><p>The knights, cook, and servant-handmaidens disappeared inside, leaving only the Inquisitioners in the courtyard.</p><p>The \u201cInquisitioners\u201d were Abigail and a few of the handmaidens who\u2019d offered to pose as the visiting party. The girls had thrown themselves into the roles with enthusiasm, pulling their hair back into severe knots and donning dark, somber topcoats and beaver hats from the old vicar\u2019s wardrobe. They\u2019d even taken bits of kohl and drawn sideburns and moustaches on their faces.</p><p>Except for the occasional burst of giggling, they made a fair approximation of a stern-faced party of solicitors and doctors.</p><p>\u201cNow, when the visitors arrive, Duncan will welcome them to Gostley Castle.\u201d</p><p>Duncan opened the front door and bowed solemnly to the young ladies in costume. \u201cGood afternoon, sirs. Welcome to Gostley Castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. And then he\u2019ll show them into the\u2014\u201d Izzy turned to Ransom, who stood beside her in the upstairs room. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you prefer the great hall? We do have the salon now. It\u2019s a more manageable size.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt has to be the great hall. I know how the space works, how the echoes sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the great hall it is.\u201d She turned and called from the window again. \u201cDuncan will show them into the great hall.\u201d</p><p>Duncan faced the \u201cInquisitioners\u201d and tilted his head in invitation. \u201cIf the gentlemen would be so good as to follow me.\u201d</p><p>The tittering young women followed him inside.</p><p>Izzy stepped away from the window. \u201cThis is where we wait. Once Duncan has them settled in the great hall, he\u2019ll send one of the handmaidens up to knock.\u201d</p><p>They lapsed into silence, just waiting. Izzy studied her shoes. She had new ones for tomorrow, but for today her old nankeen half boots would have to do.</p><p>Ransom, of course, only looked more magnificent with each passing day. Duncan had dedicated many tireless hours to the task of brushing, laundering, pressing, and polishing every item of attire in the duke\u2019s wardrobe, and it showed.</p><p>His hair was still a touch overgrown, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to suggest a trim. He wore that fall of golden brown hair like a shield over his wounded brow. She worried he would feel vulnerable without it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious about anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve planned every moment, made alternatives for any eventuality. And if all else goes wrong, there\u2019s a last resort. Plan E.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan E? What\u2019s Plan E?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnowdrop. If there\u2019s an unforeseen problem, one of the handmaidens will release the ermine into the room. It will be a diversion, at least.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked to one side in that now-familiar manner.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t quite know how to read the expression, but she was coming to think of it as a smile.</p><p>A knock came at the door.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s our cue.\u201d</p><p>She threaded her arm in his, and together they walked into the corridor and began heading downstairs to the great hall.</p><p>\u201cI remember everything you told me,\u201d she said. \u201cBlaylock has ginger hair and spectacles. Riggett is the portly one, with narrow-set eyes. When we enter the hall, I\u2019ll find them, and I\u2019ll tap out their position on your arm. The first count will be Blaylock. The second, Riggett. As for the newcomers, we\u2019ll have to rely on introductions. Duncan, should you need him, will always be just to the left of the entrance. Once you introduce me, I can take ov\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped in his paces. \u201cIzzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes? Did I forget something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He bent his head and kissed her. Just a warm, lingering press of his lips against hers. \u201cYou seemed to need that.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled. \u201cI think I did. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>All her drifting, scattered thoughts coalesced. His kiss was her anchor in the storm. So long as they could come away from this trial together, that was all that mattered.</p><p>When they entered the great hall, Izzy used their agreed-on system to point out the handmaidens designated as Blaylock and Riggett. Ransom acknowledged them with the slightest of nods in their general direction.</p><p>This was where his social rank worked in his favor. Ransom needn\u2019t bow to anyone. He certainly didn\u2019t shake hands. He needn\u2019t offer to serve his guests drinks. Unless his vision was particularly gray, he could distinguish a person well enough to focus on him when speaking. For a duke, that was enough.</p><p>They walked to the grouping of freshly reupholstered furnishings near the hearth. Once again, Izzy used slight pressure against his arm to direct him toward an unoccupied chair.</p><p>Everyone was seated with a minimum of awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d she said, beginning to breathe easier. This really needn\u2019t be as difficult as it she\u2019d feared it could be. \u201cOnce we\u2019re all seated, it\u2019s just a matter of chatting, drinking. Answering their questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the one asking questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, too. If the mood is amiable, I\u2019ll offer them a tour of the castle. I\u2019ll lead, of course, and you can bring up the rear. Once we\u2019ve returned to the great hall, it will probably be time for dinner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In an instant, Ransom\u2019s demeanor changed entirely.</p><p>Izzy\u2019s heart sank. She\u2019d been hoping he would take this well. But it would seem she\u2019d hoped in vain.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean, dinner?\u201d</p> <p>Damn it to hell. Ransom hadn\u2019t counted on this.</p><p>\u201cWhy does there need to be a dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith any luck, there won\u2019t be a need,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we must be prepared for the possibility. The solicitors will have traveled all this way from London. They\u2019re going to be fatigued, hungry. We\u2019ll probably have to offer them lodging for the night, too.\u201d</p><p>He cursed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve planned everything, and we\u2019ll walk through it right now. Duncan will invite us in to dinner.\u201d</p> <p>She motioned in Duncan\u2019s direction, and the valet-cum-butler did as she asked, intoning, \u201cDinner is served.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you offer me your arm,\u201d Izzy said, taking the arm in question before he\u2019d offered it at all, \u201cand we\u2019ll lead the way to the dining room.\u201d</p><p>As they walked down the corridor to the dining room, Ransom felt as though he were walking toward the gallows. Every step he took was one step closer to doom.</p><p>Dinner. Of all the things. She couldn\u2019t have set him up for failure any better if she\u2019d arranged for a target-shooting demonstration.</p><p>They reached the dining room. They must have been planning this out. On either side of the endless dining table stood an armored row of knights, waiting at attention in their role as footmen. He heard a wince-inducing creak as one of them shifted his weight from one foot to the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll suggest seats for our visitors.\u201d She directed the costumed ladies in their oversized, dark coats to take various seats.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to sit at the head of the table, of course.\u201d She nudged Ransom toward the appropriate chair. \u201cAs hostess, I\u2019ll need to be at the opposite end.\u201d</p><p>In other words, miles away.</p><p>He caught her arm and pulled it, keeping her close. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t panic.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI promise. I\u2019ve arranged for all the courses to be served \u00e0 la russe. All the courses are plated in the kitchen and served individually. No carving, no serving. It\u2019s the newest style in France. We\u2019ll seem fashionable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve thought this through,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cHowever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first course is soup, of course. That\u2019s straightforward enough. For the meat course\u201d\u2014she motioned to one of the overgrown toy soldiers\u2014\u201cwe have beefsteak.\u201d</p> <p>A plate appeared on the table before him.</p><p>She pulled up a chair and sat next to him.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she whispered. \u201cRansom, you can\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed that you never eat in front of us. You\u2019ll take a bit of bread, maybe, or a sandwich. But never a proper meal. So I tried eating a meal blindfolded, managing a knife and fork by touch. I made a hash of things before getting three bites in my mouth. I do understand.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was sweet. But she spoke to him like a damned infant. And bloody hell, she did not understand.</p><p>She took his hand and guided it around the plate. \u201cI\u2019ve made arrangements with Cook. Everything on your plate will be in bite-size pieces, save for the bread. Buttered roll at twelve o\u2019clock, then beef from three to seven. Potatoes and broad beans from eight to twelve.\u201d She put a fork in his hand. \u201cGo on, try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIzzy . . .\u201d</p><p>She touched his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged. I know you can do this.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled and exhaled slowly, trying to remain calm. \u201cI will eat when and where and how I wish. I don\u2019t need things cut in pieces for me. I\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p><p>There it was, sitting on the table before him . . . All the frustrations of his life, dished up on one plate.</p><p>Here, Your Grace, have a serving of helplessness. With an accompaniment of bitter humiliation.</p><p>This\u2014this, right here\u2014was madness. He\u2019d been a fool to agree to this plan. Within five minutes at the dinner table, his solicitors would see him for what he was: a blinded wretch. At best, he would be branded an invalid. At worst, he\u2019d be institutionalized. He would lose his title, his fortune . . . possibly even his personal freedom.</p><p>And he would lose her. Any ability to protect her. Any chance to hold her tight and feel her sweet touch on his skin.</p><p>All because he couldn\u2019t cut beefsteak in the dark. The sheer stupidity of it gutted him.</p><p>Meanwhile, the handmaidens whispered and giggled. The knights clanked in their armor. The scrape of metal on metal felt like fingernails raking through his brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d He motioned toward the armored footman. \u201cTake this away.\u201d</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d he growled, \u201caway.\u201d</p><p>The armored idiot stepped forward and retrieved the plate. Ransom winced with each creak and clank. At the base of his skull, he felt a headache looming. It was like knowing a villain stood poised behind him with an ice pick, ready to stab at any moment.</p><p>That settled it. He was done with this. He rose from the table.</p><p>Izzy followed, stopping him before he even reached the corridor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d she said. \u201cI should have known better than to surprise you. I know you must be exhausted. We\u2019re all exhausted. We can try again later. Perhaps for now, you should go upstairs and rest.\u201d</p><p>Now he needed a nap?</p><p>That was the final indignity.</p><p>He said, \u201cWe\u2019re done with this. All of this. Thank your Morphinians for their time, and then send them all away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend them away?\u201d She grabbed his sleeve, holding him in place. \u201cWe can practice for as long as it takes. But we can\u2019t give up. There\u2019s too much at stake for us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me what\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p><p>Her entire future hung in the balance. Ransom scarcely cared for himself anymore, but he had to make certain she\u2019d be safe.</p><p>This plan of hers\u2014passing himself as sighted, while dozens of fancy-dress dreamers looked on\u2014simply wasn\u2019t going to work. He could stand here and argue the facts of it, but he knew Izzy. She wouldn\u2019t surrender that romantic optimism. Not with all her admirers standing about, hanging on her every word. She was too afraid of letting them down.</p><p>She was never going to choose Ransom over the goodwill and sweetmeats of a thousand strangers. Even if it was for the best.</p><p>So he would make the choice for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m changing the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on to Plan E!\u201d one of the knights called out. \u201cPlan E, everyone! Who has the ermine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that plan,\u201d Ransom said, gritting his teeth. To Izzy, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose. Go upstairs and get your wrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wrap? Why? Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Scotland,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be married tonight.\u201d</p><p>Married?</p><p>Izzy was speechless for a moment. Her brain was awhirl. There were children\u2019s tops that spun slower than her thoughts were doing.</p><p>When at last she spoke, she did so carefully. And quietly, though there was no doubt that the assembled knights and handmaidens could hear everything.</p><p>\u201cYou want to be married? To me? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t like the idea either, but it\u2019s the only option. Get your things. We can reach the Scottish border in a few hours, at most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe advantages should be plain.\u201d His voice was emotionless. \u201cIf we marry, that changes everything. At the very least, they\u2019d wait to see if you\u2019re pregnant with my heir. During that time, I can make certain you get the money you\u2019re owed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sounds very . . . transactional. I hope you\u2019ll pardon the honesty, but this isn\u2019t quite the romantic proposal a girl hopes and dreams to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-six years old,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many other proposals were you expecting?\u201d</p><p>His cold words froze the breath in her lungs.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps none,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I have to rejoice in one so unfeeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrow up, Izzy. What are you waiting for? Some dashing hero? It\u2019s time to stop living in this\u201d\u2014he waved his arms at the knights and handmaidens\u2014\u201cfairy tale.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, unable to believe the words coming from his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing this on purpose,\u201d she said, slowly understanding him. \u201cYou\u2019re pushing me away because you\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pushing you away. I believe I just offered to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the most insulting, unappealing way possible.\u201d</p><p>Wendell clanked a few steps forward and called out to them. \u201cCan I offer my lady some assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your lady,\u201d Ransom shot back. \u201cShe\u2019s Miss Goodnight. A grown woman. And it doesn\u2019t matter how many of your granny\u2019s tea trays you strap on your chest. They don\u2019t make you a knight.\u201d</p><p>Izzy crossed her arms. So, it wasn\u2019t enough for him to push her away. No, he wouldn\u2019t rest until he\u2019d pushed away everyone.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, I am a knight,\u201d Wendell said. \u201cI\u2019m a Knight of Moranglia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you a Knight of Moranglia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swore an oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you swore an oath. On what? A sword made of a vegetable marrow? You\u2019re not a knight. You\u2019re delusional. All of you.\u201d He lifted his voice. \u201cAdmit it. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here, styling yourselves as handmaidens and knights of honor. Because your own lives are too pitiful to face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve never known what it\u2019s like to be a part of something like this, and you\u2019re envious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnvious,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cOf these men? I\u2019ve ten pounds that says Sir Wendell here still lives with his mother.\u201d</p><p>Wendell\u2019s face flushed bright red. \u201cA great many bachelors live at home until they marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cAnd what marriage prospects are on your horizon? Do you have a sweetheart? An intended? At least tell me you\u2019ve groped a tit or two.\u201d</p><p>Izzy stomped on his boot and ground her heel into his toe. \u201cI said, that\u2019s enough. If your aim was to make a jackass of yourself and ruin everything we\u2019ve been working toward, believe me, you\u2019ve done more than enough.\u201d</p><p>But Ransom wouldn\u2019t let up. \u201cCome along, \u2018Sir\u2019 Wendell. Admit it. You\u2019ve never even kissed a girl, have you?\u201d</p><p>Poor Wendell. His cheeks blazed an alarming shade of crimson.</p><p>Izzy couldn\u2019t see anything but red.</p><p>And then Abigail Pelham crossed the dining hall in determined steps, took a shocked Wendell Butterfield by the shoulders, and kissed him full on the lips.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Abigail said. \u201cHe\u2019s kissed a girl now.\u201d</p><p>Inwardly, Izzy cheered. Good for Abigail.</p><p>With a desperate tug, she tried to draw Ransom aside. \u201cNow that\u2019s enough. You\u2019re going to apologize. We need these people. And even if you are determined to destroy your own chances, I need these people. They\u2019re always here for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not here for you. They are here for a wide-eyed, precious little girl with emerald green eyes and sleek, amber hair. They were never here for you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>The words came as such a blow to her, she actually fell back a step.</p><p>\u201cI am here for you,\u201d he said, taking her by the waist. \u201cIzzy, if we marry, it doesn\u2019t matter what they do to me. They can throw me in Bedlam and swallow the key. As long as my child is in your womb, you\u2019ll be protected.\u201d His hand slid to her belly. \u201cWe both know you could be carrying my heir already.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lowered her voice to a horrified whisper. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that. Aloud, in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even bring herself to look around for the handmaidens\u2019 reactions. Much less Abigail\u2019s. Unshed tears burned at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>All this effort. All this work. All this love in her heart. And it was nothing to him. He was throwing it away. She\u2019d been hoping they could make it through tomorrow together\u2014and they couldn\u2019t even make it through this afternoon.</p> <p>And to make it worse, he\u2019d just ruined her in front of the only friends she had left.</p><p>\u201cYou need to break free of this, Izzy.\u201d He tilted his head toward the shocked onlookers. \u201cFor that matter, so do they. You do them no favors by hiding the truth. Are you afraid they\u2019ll find out that fairy tales are a load of bollocks, all their \u2018oaths\u2019 and vows are worth precisely shite, and happy endings only exist in your father\u2019s storybooks? Good. I hope they do learn it. It might save some other man in my position a great deal of trouble.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. This isn\u2019t about The Goodnight Tales or your solicitors. And it\u2019s not about me. This is about your pride, and Lady Emily Riverdale.\u201d</p><p>Duncan coughed, loudly and frantically.</p><p>\u201cLady Shemily Liverpail,\u201d she corrected. \u201cSorry. Either way. This is revenge for you. Is that it, Ransom? It wasn\u2019t enough to ruin England\u2019s precious sweetheart. Now you want to marry me, just to even the score.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about scores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the deluded one.\u201d She jabbed a finger in his chest. Poking right at that empty place where he ought to have a heart. \u201cShe didn\u2019t leave you because of my father\u2019s stories. She left you because you were cold and unfeeling toward her. The reason you find yourself alone and blinded and helpless is the fault of exactly one person in this room. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIzzy . . .\u201d</p><p>She swiped a scalding tear from her cheek. \u201cAnd do you know what? She was right to run away. She deserved better. I deserve better, too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>The men and women filling the dining hall were utterly silent as the last of Izzy\u2019s footsteps faded. Ransom could feel their collective condemnation.</p> <p>The echoes of her words still rang in the ceiling vaults.</p><p>She deserved better. I deserve better, too.</p><p>Ransom tugged at his cravat, loosening the restrictive knot.</p><p>It came as a sick sort of relief to hear that sentiment voiced aloud, and to know everyone around him agreed. These past few days of amiable assistance and cheerful industry had made him feel like a stranger in his own house. Dozens of people organized to help him, for no wages or discernable reward? He scarcely recognized his life.</p><p>But this sense of empty, echoing isolation . . . ?</p><p>This was familiar. This was what he\u2019d always known. What he\u2019d been told, since before he could understand words. There could be no comfort for him. No kindness, no mercies. No one had ever loved him, and no one ever could.</p><p>You don\u2019t deserve that, boy.</p><p>Ransom wouldn\u2019t argue.</p> <p>As he left the room and made his way to his dressing room, only Duncan followed.</p><p>\u201cDuncan, draw me a bath, prepare my finest suit, and pack everything else. We\u2019re leaving tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Scotland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. For Town.\u201d</p><p>Ransom crossed the room and began tugging loose his cuffs.</p><p>They would leave for London at once. Once there, he would go straight for the bank and empty his accounts. In the event his traitorous solicitors had already frozen his accounts, he\u2019d go to the clubs\u2014wherever he was still a member\u2014and beg or borrow as much as he could.</p><p>Whatever funds he could manage to raise, it all went to Izzy. She didn\u2019t need to like him, much less love him\u2014but he needed to know she was safe.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Duncan began, \u201care you certain it\u2019s wise\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ransom cut him off. \u201cNo. Stop there. I don\u2019t want any sage advice. You\u2019re not my counselor, you\u2019re my valet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d been promoted to butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been demoted again. Draw a bath. Prepare my suit. Pack.\u201d</p><p>Ransom undressed while he listened to the sounds of kettles being put on to warm and the tub scraping across the floor toward the hearth.</p><p>When all sounded ready, he found the tub and lowered his body into it, anticipating the perfectly warmed bathwater to be poured over his shoulders.</p><p>What he got was a deluge of ice-cold, freezing shock. Dashed straight over his head.</p><p>He sputtered. \u201cWhat the . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can consider that my resignation, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly I can. My pension was settled and prepared years ago. I\u2019ve only stayed on in the position for the stupidest of reasons. A promise I made long ago. But today, in the dining hall, you enlightened me. You made it perfectly clear that those oaths and allegiances are . . . Was it shite or bollocks? I can\u2019t recall.\u201d</p><p>Ransom pushed the freezing droplets from his face. \u201cWhat are you going on about? You never swore an oath. There\u2019s no Valet\u2019s Promise, or Order of the Starched Cravat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to you. I swore an oath to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Miss Goodnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. To your mother. I promised your dying mother that I would look after you. Absurd, isn\u2019t it? Like something from a soppy story.\u201d</p><p>Ransom inhaled slowly.</p><p>So, it wasn\u2019t enough that he\u2019d been the instrument of his mother\u2019s death. He\u2019d ruined Duncan\u2019s life, too. That was lovely to know.</p><p>Well, he could put an end to that torture quickly. \u201cConsider yourself released from that promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, Your Grace. I do.\u201d</p><p>Another barrage of ice-cold water crashed down over his head.</p><p>\u201cYou fool,\u201d Duncan said, in a seething tone that Ransom had never heard his valet use before. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you drunk, debauched, engaged in all manner of devilry. But I\u2019ve never seen you behave so stupidly as you did today. If you let that girl get away, you are a true idiot.\u201d</p><p>Ransom shook himself. His teeth chattered. \u201cIt\u2019s b-better this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Another dipper of freezing water splashed over his shoulders. \u201cFor whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her.\u201d He pushed the water off his face. \u201cFor Izzy. You heard her. I d-don\u2019t deserve her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t deserve her. No man deserves a woman like that. He mortgages his very soul to win her and spends his life paying off the debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon I won\u2019t have a single asset to my name. I\u2019m not going to take you and her and everyone else down with me.\u201d</p><p>Duncan was silent for a long moment. \u201cShe loved you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Loved. Funny, how that one little \u201cd\u201d took a miraculous sentence and made it heart-shredding. \u201cYou and Miss Goodnight have a great many chats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not speaking of Miss Goodnight. I\u2019m speaking of the late duchess.\u201d</p><p>Ransom steeled himself against the sharp pain of the mention. \u201cYet another woman who would have been better off if I\u2019d never been born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just a young footman, hired on when you were in the womb. Everyone in the house walked on eggshells. There\u2019d been a stillborn child the prior year, they told me. Rumor in the serving quarters was, the doctors had warned that the duchess might not survive another birth.\u201d</p><p>A stillborn child, the previous year?</p><p>Ransom had never known this.</p><p>\u201cBut she wanted to take the risk,\u201d Duncan continued. \u201cShe wanted you so much. Once the birthing was over, I was sent in to remove the doctor\u2019s case from the room. She reached out, and her hand caught my arm.\u201d The old valet cleared emotion from his throat. \u201c \u2018Promise,\u2019 she said. \u2018Promise you\u2019ll show him love.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Ransom couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cShe was delirious,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cAlready slipping away. I knew she\u2019d mistaken me for the duke. But I couldn\u2019t tell her so, and there wasn\u2019t time to summon him. The duke wouldn\u2019t have told her what she yearned to hear, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Damn right he wouldn\u2019t have. His father had remained a cold, unforgiving bastard until the day he died.</p><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t let the young duchess die uneasy. So I told her, I promise. I promise to show him love. And for thirty years, I\u2019ve done my best to honor that.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Where was another ewer of freezing water when he needed one, to mask all these other droplets on his face?</p><p>Sinking down into the tub, Ransom drew his knees to his chest and scrubbed his face with both hands. His nursemaids and tutors had been forbidden to show him kindness. But who had been there for him? Cleaned him up after every night of debauchery, stitched his wounds, slipped him into immaculate tailcoats made tighter than a mother\u2019s hug?</p><p>Who had stayed by him these seven months, as he crawled and fumbled his way back from the brink of death?</p><p>Duncan.</p><p>Duncan, all this time.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he scraped out. \u201cYou\u2019re just telling me this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were ready to hear it before. And I was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . why? There\u2019s no pension in the world worth thirty years of serving me. It\u2019s not as though I gave you any reason for devotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. I kept that promise for thirty years because it gave my work meaning. It gave me honor. A small, domestic kind of honor, but honor nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cBut apparently, in your view, I\u2019ve wasted my whole life. Just another of those shite-filled vows and bollocks oaths. Now that you\u2019ve released me from it . . .\u201d The valet heaved a deep breath. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll retire to a little seaside cottage in Ireland. I\u2019m rather looking forward to that.\u201d</p><p>Ransom groped about for a towel or his clothing. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, Your Grace. That\u2019s not my job anymore. But if I might offer you one bit of parting advice . . . You\u2019re not in a position to be selective. If someone offers you love or friendship, take it. Even if it comes dressed in a tea tray. Also, stay away from stripes. Unflattering.\u201d</p><p>Ransom was left blind, naked, wet, and shivering. And completely alone, just as the day he was born.</p><p>There was nothing to do but start over.</p><p>And try to get everything back.</p><p>Izzy paced her bedchamber by the light of a single candle.</p><p>She checked the clock again. Half past two in the morning. Only nine minutes since the last time she\u2019d checked.</p><p>Where on earth could Ransom have gone? In the dark of night, on his own? At her insistence, Duncan had gone out searching for him. They should have returned hours ago. Now, Izzy was worried for them both.</p><p>She alternated between anger at his desertion and the fear that something horrid had happened. He was a grown man, she told herself. Magnus was a faithful guide. But none of that was a guarantee against accidents or injury. What if he\u2019d gotten lost? What if he\u2019d fallen in the stream?</p><p>What if he\u2019d gone to Scotland with one of the handmaidens instead? She didn\u2019t know that she would blame him, after some of the angry things she\u2019d said.</p><p>Lord. The uncertainty was killing her. Maybe she should venture out herself. She could take a lamp and rouse Snowdrop from her bed of wood shavings.</p><p>That was it. Izzy reached for her cloak and boots. She couldn\u2019t just sit here and do nothing.</p><p>Her fingers trembled as she worked at unknotting the laces of her boots. Why she never unlaced them when she took her boots off at the end of the day, Izzy didn\u2019t know. It was a lazy habit, and she\u2019d never regretted it more than she did this moment.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d made the decision to go out in search of him, her anxiety had intensified. And unlike her usual heart-pounding terror in the dark, this fear had a defined shape and edges she could grasp on to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because this wasn\u2019t imagined fear. Not anymore. This was genuine terror for the safety of someone she cared about. Someone she loved. She loved him, and it didn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d sabotaged all their hard work and future happiness today. If he was out there somewhere, hurting in the dark, she had to help.</p><p>And then\u2014just as she\u2019d finally worked loose the knot on her second boot\u2014she heard noises in the courtyard. She ran to the window.</p><p>Oh, thank heaven.</p> <p>He was home.</p><p>He was home, his arm slung over Duncan\u2019s shoulder, and he was . . . laughing.</p><p>Laughing?</p><p>Her fear was gone. In its place, she knew a rush of pure fury.</p><p>Izzy stormed down the staircase and into the great hall, just in time to greet the returning men.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms about herself to stop her trembling. \u201cRansom. I\u2019ve been worried sick. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>Duncan seemed to know his cue to clear out. \u201cI have some . . .\u201d He gestured vaguely toward the ceiling. Then turned his head to look over his shoulder. \u201cThe laundry. Need to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d Izzy pleaded.</p><p>He went, and gratefully.</p><p>\u201cMy thanks,\u201d Ransom called after him. \u201cFor all of it.\u201d</p><p>Duncan paused and bowed. \u201cIt was my honor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d She hugged herself tight. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been . . .\u201d He gestured expansively. \u201cMaking friends.\u201d</p><p>Making friends? She couldn\u2019t have been more astonished if he\u2019d answered, Chasing unicorns.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd with whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I started at the vicarage. Wendell Butterfield was there for dinner with the Pelham family. Then, after a few hours, I went to the village inn. When their public room closed for the night, I moved on to the seedy tavern. The Musky Boar, I think it\u2019s called. Charming, sticky little place, filled with interesting types. At least one or two of them could read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cYou see, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing. Moving from place to place all evening. I needed something read aloud to me, and I couldn\u2019t ask you. Something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what was that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Goodnight Tales.\u201d</p><p>She felt his answer like a blow to the knees. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. It became clear to me today, if I had any hope of ever understanding you, deserving you, much less winning you back\u2014I needed to know what was in those stories. And now, thanks to Abigail and Mr. Butterfield, and the kindly patrons of the local drinking spots, I\u2019ve been through the entire saga. Start to finish. Not that the tale is finished, of course. I\u2019ve some questions for you about that.\u201d</p><p>No. No.</p><p>Not him. Not Ransom. The one man who didn\u2019t treat her like some insipid little girl in a fairy tale but as a full-grown woman. A beautiful temptress of a woman, with interesting ideas and sensual wit.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d read all those stories, he\u2019d be just like Lord Archer and Abigail and everyone else.</p><p>Izzy reeled away from him before he could do something soul-destroying. Like pat her on the head. Or offer her a sweetmeat.</p><p>He sang out, \u201cPut out the light, my darling Izzy, and I\u2019ll tell you such a tale.\u201d</p><p>She choked back a sob. \u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow could you? That\u2019s what I want to know. I must say, I have some sympathy for those people who write you so many letters. No wonder they\u2019re deranged. Ulric\u2019s been left hanging for more than a year now, and Cressida\u2019s still stuck in that tower . . . You must tell me who the Shadow Knight is. I need that much, at least. I have my theories, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in her hands. \u201cThis is terrible. Not you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, me, too. I\u2019m a full-blooded Moranglian. A convert to the wondrous enchantment that is The Goodnight Tales.\u201d He stretched out on the sofa, folding his arms beneath his head and facing the ceiling. \u201cYou warned me the first few years were rubbish. I\u2019ll give you, you were right on that score. Juvenile and predictable, for the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPredictable?\u201d Against all logic, Izzy was a bit miffed.</p><p>He went on talking. \u201cBut then, somewhere into Cressida\u2019s second kidnapping, the story started to change. Like a good whisky aging in a barrel. There were deeper layers, more shadings of emotion. And the words painted such vivid pictures. I could see it all happening in my mind. So clearly, as if it were taking place before me, but the story kept taking me by surprise. By the time we reached the end\u2014or the Not The End\u2014I was riveted to my barstool. The tavern didn\u2019t even exist. I found myself wishing I were half the man Ulric is. I don\u2019t mind saying, I\u2019m rather taken with Cressida.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered with despair.</p><p>\u201cBut the biggest shock of all had nothing to do with the characters or the storyline.\u201d He sat up, facing her. His dark eyes seemed to focus on hers. \u201cIt had to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart quivered in her chest.</p><p>Oh, God. He knew.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, confirming her fears. \u201cI know the truth.\u201d</p><p>That was it, then. Her charade of thirteen years was up. He knew everything.</p><p>Which left Izzy with only one possible response.</p><p>Run.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>With a painful gasp, Izzy broke the icy veneer of her panic. She tore from the great hall and dashed up the spiraling staircase.</p><p>\u201cIzzy.\u201d</p><p>She rushed on.</p><p>He chased after her. \u201cIzzy, stop. Don\u2019t run from me, damn it. Don\u2019t ever run from me.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled to a halt in the corridor, putting one hand to the wall for strength.</p><p>He was right. Lady Emily Riverdale had run from him. She\u2019d done it because of Izzy\u2019s stories, and in doing so, the girl had ruined Ransom\u2019s life.</p><p>If Izzy could give him nothing else, she owed him this. The chance to confront her, face-to-face.</p><p>So she stopped running. And turned to face the truth.</p><p>\u201cRansom, I . . . I can\u2019t imagine how you must be feeling right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI think you can.\u201d</p><p>He caught her by the waist and steered her into the nearest room\u2014which happened to be the newly refurnished, never yet used ducal chamber.</p><p>He kicked the door shut behind them.</p><p>\u201cYou did dream up all those outlandish stories, after all. So it\u2019s clear that you can imagine quite a lot of things.\u201d As he spoke, he backed her toward the bed. \u201cSo perhaps you can put yourself in my place, as I sat there\u2014first in the vicarage, then the inn, then that sticky tavern\u2014slowly coming to the certain realization that the author of these tales was not Sir Henry Goodnight. It was, and always had been, you.\u201d</p><p>The edge of the mattress hit her in the back of the knees, and she fell backward onto the bed. He fell with her, caging her with his limbs and using his weight to pin her to the mattress.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me.\u201d His voice was as dark and hollow as a cave. \u201cCan you possibly imagine how I felt? Can you put a name to that intense emotion that filled my chest so completely, it pained my ribs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnger,\u201d she guessed, feeling faint.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRage? Betrayal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong, and wrong again.\u201d He touched her lips, tracing their shape with his thumb. \u201cIt was pride. Oh, my Izzy. I was so damned proud of you, I thought my heart would burst.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped beating altogether.</p><p>\u201cProud of . . .\u201d She cleared a lump from her throat. \u201cWhat do you mean? How could you be proud of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that nonsense. Don\u2019t pretend anymore, not with me.\u201d He swiped away her tear. \u201cI was proud because you wrote it. You wrote all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that means it\u2019s all my fault. My work is to blame for Lady Emily\u2019s elopement. Your injuries and blindness. The fact that you\u2019re now on the brink of losing everything. It\u2019s my fault, all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen all I can say is . . .\u201d He inhaled and exhaled slowly. \u201cBless you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. If you had not taught that silly, flighty Emily Riverdale to dream of love, I would have had no chance of believing in it, myself. I would not have come here. I would not have met you. Even if I had, I would have been too arrogant and hardheaded to ever let you close.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head, burying his face in her neck. \u201cIzzy, I owe you everything. You are my heart. My very life. If you leave me . . . \u201d</p><p>His voice broke. Her heart swelled.</p><p>She slid her arms around his neck and hugged him tight. \u201cIf you\u2019ll only let me hold you, I won\u2019t ever let you go.\u201d</p><p>They kissed deeply, sweetly. And slowly. As though now they had all the time in the world.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stupid things I said. I was a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ruined all your work. Worse, I destroyed all the plans I\u2019d been making.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled. \u201cWhat plans had you been making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to begin with . . .\u201d He rose up on his elbows. \u201cI\u2019d been planning to seduce you in this bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>Izzy swallowed. \u201cHas that plan altered?\u201d</p><p>Please say no. Please say no.</p><p>\u201cYes, it has.\u201d He rose up and straddled her waist. \u201cI don\u2019t think seduction is called for. I think you\u2019re overdue for a ravishing.\u201d</p><p>A thrill shot through her.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>This was just what part of her craved\u2014for him to take control. Just this once. She\u2019d been the responsible person in the Goodnight household since the age of ten. All those years of feverishly scribbling stories, working to keep bread on the table and oil in the lamps. Then the constant tension of keeping the truth to herself\u2014always counting her statements in any conversation, clenching her fists and holding her tongue. Making sure no one got close enough to guess. Because she needed to guard not only their family income but the dreams and hopes of thousands.</p><p>And all the while, she\u2019d been yearning for someone to take care of her. She\u2019d dreamed of this. A man strong enough to protect her, bold enough to see her for who she truly was. Willing to claim her for his own.</p><p>She was long overdue for a ravishing. A lifetime overdue.</p><p>But it couldn\u2019t happen tonight.</p><p>When he laced his hands with hers and pushed her back against the bed, she protested. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this. I can\u2019t let you ravish me.\u201d</p><p>She took advantage of his surprise, turning and flipping their positions on the bed so that she lay sprawled atop him.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d she vowed, \u201cI\u2019m going to ravish you.\u201d</p><p>Ravish him?</p><p>Ransom made a halfhearted attempt at demurring. He muttered a few incoherent words of protest. But his body betrayed him.</p><p>\u201cI know you want it,\u201d she whispered, hiking her skirts to straddle his hips.</p><p>And he did. He wanted this badly indeed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t know what it meant to him, to be pushed back against the bed, divested of all his clothing, and then . . . just touched. Caressed. And best of all, kissed. Kissed everywhere. With no reciprocation or compensation expected. Nothing up for barter or exchange. Just the outpouring of her sweetness, her passion. Her beautiful heart.</p><p>She kissed him everywhere. Everywhere.</p><p>He found it adorable, some of the places she chose to grace with her lips. The inside of his elbow. His knobby chin. His hairy, muscled calves. And all the while, her soft, sensual hair dragged over his skin, like a thousand caressing fingers.</p><p>She kissed his lips, of course, sliding her tongue deep to twine with his. She kissed his cheeks and temples\u2014both the unmarked and the scarred. She kissed the tender place just beneath his ear, and she ran her tongue down the center of his chest and . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And stopped at his navel.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to press her for it. But by this point, she\u2019d put her mouth on him just about everywhere else, and his cock was getting ideas of its own. Straining for her touch, aching for her kiss. Even leaping, like a tethered beast.</p> <p>\u201cIzzy.\u201d</p><p>At last, she took his erection in hand. She pressed her lips to the crown. Encouraged by his moan of helpless pleasure, she did it again. And again, this time sweeping gently with her tongue.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cShow me what to do.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist that invitation. He fisted his hand in her hair, guiding her to take him in her hot, wet, lovely mouth and stroke him up and down. She didn\u2019t need a great deal of instruction. Once she had the rhythm, he released his grip and let his head fall back against the pillow, reveling in the bliss.</p><p>She took him deep in her mouth one last time, and then released him, sliding her tongue along the sensitive underside. He groaned in a wordless plea for mercy.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready to be ravished?\u201d she asked, in a sultry, honeyed tone.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cVery much so.\u201d</p><p>She climbed his body, straddling his pelvis and rubbing her heat up and down his rigid length. Then she froze, poised above him. Holding the tip of his cock lodged just where it wanted so desperately to go.</p><p>Dear God. She would kill him.</p><p>\u201cIzzy.\u201d The unspent lust had his voice in a stranglehold. \u201cNow. Do it now. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the word I\u2019m waiting to hear.\u201d</p> <p>Did he know?</p><p>Ah. Yes, he supposed he did. The little minx.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He reached for her, tangling one hand in that long, wild, curling hair, and said it again. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><p>She sank down on him, slowly and smoothly, taking him all the way to the root.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>For as long as he could bear it, he allowed her to set the pace. She rode him in a slow, gentle, rolling rhythm that teased his patience to the brink.</p><p>And when he couldn\u2019t be patient anymore, he grasped her hips in his hands and guided her to move faster. Harder. He planted his feet on the bed and pushed upward with his hips, meeting her halfway with his thrusts.</p> <p>She fell forward, and the soft, bouncing heat of her breasts met his chest. He held her, wrapping her in his arms so tight, treasuring her every tiny gasp and sigh of pleasure. He held himself back as long as he could, driving into her again and again\u2014pushing her higher and higher, until she shuddered and came apart in his arms.</p><p>And when she came, he came, too. It was oneness, and it was glorious, and it was perfect, and it was her. All her.</p><p>God, he loved her.</p><p>Gathering her close, he rolled onto his side and tucked her head to his chest. She nuzzled sweetly, curling in his embrace.</p><p>He rested his chin on her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you a question, Izzy. I\u2019ve never asked this of a woman before. And it\u2019s taking me a great deal of courage to even broach the subject, so please\u2014I beg you, consider your answer carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIzzy, my heart . . .\u201d He tenderly stroked her hair where it fanned across the pillow. \u201cIn the morning, will you make me a pancake?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>As soon as the dawn came streaming through the windows, Izzy shook her sleeping lover awake. It pained her to do it. He was so beautiful there, his bronzed limbs tangled amid crisp white sheets and downy pillows.</p><p>He looked at peace.</p><p>But today was going to be an interesting day, to say the least. He couldn\u2019t sleep through any more of it.</p><p>\u201cRansom.\u201d She nudged his shoulder.</p><p>He startled. \u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake and dress. The solicitors are coming today. I don\u2019t know where Duncan is, but he\u2019s sure to turn up soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIzzy, for God\u2019s sake. Curse the solicitors. Duncan resigned. And I thought we\u2019d moved past this. I\u2019m not going to hide what we have any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding it.\u201d She plopped down beside him on the bed and ruffled his hair. \u201cI\u2019m just hurrying you along. If you want your pancake, it has to be now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, then.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, wearing rumpled clothes and a rare smile, Ransom followed her down the stairs and into the kitchen just off the great hall.</p><p>She stoked the fire and began pulling bowls and spoons from the cupboard. \u201cSo, how did you guess the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I know, do you mean? I\u2019ve had my suspicions for some time now. You describe sunsets as dying warriors, you read in voices, and you write me silly lines of dialogue. Once I finally heard the stories, it was obvious. I knew because I know you. Izzy, you shouldn\u2019t deny or pretend any longer.\u201d</p><p>Very well. She wouldn\u2019t pretend any longer. Not with him.</p><p>The rest of the world could never know the truth, but she couldn\u2019t deny how much it meant to know this one man had discerned it. He\u2019d looked beyond the expectations and the public perceptions, and he\u2019d seen her. The real Izzy.</p><p>\u201cYou truly liked them?\u201d she asked. It was the silliest question, and he chided her for it accordingly.</p><p>He tugged on her hair. \u201c \u2018Liked\u2019 isn\u2019t the word.\u201d</p><p>But what is the word? she wondered.</p><p>Admired? Adored? Cherished?</p><p>Loved?</p><p>She didn\u2019t need him to say that word, she told herself. But secretly, she couldn\u2019t help wishing he would.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he asked. \u201cFor that matter, why don\u2019t you tell the world? If I\u2019d written England\u2019s most popular book, I\u2019d never stop crowing about it.\u201d</p><p>Was he mad? \u201cOf course I could never tell anyone. Not without ruining everyone\u2019s enjoyment and making my father out to be a fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was a fraud. He was a cowardly, shameless fraud, taking all the glory for your hard work.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, reaching into the cupboard for eggs. \u201cAt the outset, he was the one protecting me. I was so young. The publishers wouldn\u2019t have even looked at the Tales if they thought I\u2019d written them. I didn\u2019t want the attention, the admirers. The public adoration made my father happy. It was the writing that gave me joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil he died, and you lost everything. Don\u2019t you miss it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I miss it. Terribly.\u201d Even now, more than a year later, she carried a sense of aching loss that never quite went away. \u201cBut how could I continue? If I tried to pass the work off as my father\u2019s, it would legally belong to Martin. If I sent it under my own name, the publisher would only send it back. Unread, most likely. \u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you know if you don\u2019t try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand this, Ransom. You can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>His head jerked in affront. \u201cI don\u2019t know what my blindness has to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>His blindness had everything to do with it.</p><p>No man had ever\u2014ever\u2014treated her the way he did. She was small and plain and insignificant. But on the page, her words could be so much more. They could be influential, admired. Even powerful.</p><p>But only if they weren\u2019t hers.</p><p>She\u2019d come to accept that this was how it would always be. She was at her best when she was invisible. That\u2019s why she\u2019d written herself with emerald green eyes and sleek amber hair. The real Izzy wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>Until now. The real Izzy was good enough for Ransom. He would never know how much that meant. But she would endeavor to show him.</p><p>She squeezed his arm. \u201cLet me make your pancake.\u201d</p><p>He looked on as she gathered eggs and began cracking them in a bowl.</p><p>\u201cWho taught you to make pancakes?\u201d he asked. \u201cYour family\u2019s cook?\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cWe had no cook. My father\u2019s only income came from a handful of pupils he tutored. Until the stories became successful, we never had the money for servants.\u201d She poured milk in the bowl, sifted in a measure of flour, and began to beat the mixture with a spoon. \u201cNo cook, no maid, no governess. It was always just me and Papa. I taught myself to make a fair number of things, but pancakes were a favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. You spent your childhood acting as your own cook, maid, and governess. Then you became the family provider at the age of thirteen.\u201d His hands framed her waist. \u201cI\u2019m tempted to take that spoon from your hands and send it sailing out the nearest window. You should never make another pancake again.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and kissed his cheek. \u201cThis is different. It\u2019s my pleasure to make one for you.\u201d</p><p>He slid his arms about her waist and hugged her as she added a sprinkle of salt and sugar to the bowl.</p><p>And she decided\u2014right here in this kitchen\u2014there was something else she\u2019d like to share with him, too.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to know how it continues? The true identity of the Shadow Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d His arm cinched tight about her waist. \u201cI would trade almost anything to know that. Anything but pancakes. Pancakes are not for up negotiation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Ulric was dangling from that parapet.\u201d She found the butter in its crock. \u201cAnd just beginning to pull himself up, when the Shadow Knight unsheathed his sword and severed one of his hands in a single blow.\u201d</p><p>Ransom winced. \u201cGood Lord. You do have a bloodthirsty imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow he\u2019s dangling by only one hand. With the rain falling, the wind whipping about the parapets. He has not only the weight of his body but the weight of his armor. It\u2019s too much. He\u2019s starting to lose his grip. It\u2019s over, and both Ulric and the Shadow Knight know it.\u201d</p><p>She set the bowl of pancake batter aside, offering him her sugary fingers to lick.</p><p>She went on with her tale. \u201c \u2018Tell me,\u2019 Ulric says, as he slips from three fingers to two. \u2018Before you send me to my death, tell me who you are.\u2019 At last, the Shadow Knight lifts the visor of his helmet, revealing an all-too-familiar face, and says\u201d\u2014she lowered her voice, giving it an ominous cast\u2014\u201c \u2018Ulric. I am your brother.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He let her fingertip slide from his mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s truly not that much of a twist. The motif runs through most chivalric literature. Knights-errant are always having to face down a nemesis who is revealed to be their father, brother, or a long-lost son.\u201d</p><p>She put a pat of butter in the heated pan and followed it with a generous spoonful of batter.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought Ulric\u2019s brother died in the Crusades,\u201d Ransom said.</p><p>\u201cUlric thought so, too. He thought Godric died on the battlefield, but he survived. It took him years to make his way back to England, and with every step, he dreamed of vengeance on the brother who had left him for dead.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNext you\u2019ll tell me Cressida\u2019s truly their sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCressida, their sister? Lord, no. What on earth would make you think of such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a good surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to admit.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of disgust as she flipped the pancake. \u201cThey can\u2019t be siblings. They\u2019ve kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still a kiss. They are not brother and sister.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWhat a suggestion.\u201d</p><p>She slid the finished pancake on a waiting plate. Just then, the door to the kitchen creaked open, and Izzy looked up just in time to see a familiar figure, capped with a shimmering knot of blond hair.</p><p>\u201cIzzy, there you are.\u201d</p><p>Abigail.</p><p>Izzy bit her lip, uncertain what the vicar\u2019s daughter would think of her now. Ransom\u2019s declarations yesterday had left little room for ambiguity, and here they were in rumpled half dress, making early-morning pancakes in the kitchen. The fact that they were lovers must be obvious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And just in case it wasn\u2019t apparent enough, Ransom slid his arm about her shoulders, drawing her close.</p><p>\u201cAbigail,\u201d she said. \u201cGood morning. I was just\u2014I mean, we were . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Izzy.\u201d Abigail moved into the room, drawing Izzy aside. \u201cI won\u2019t tell a soul. In fact, I\u2019m here to ask you for a favor. If anyone asks you, I stayed here at the castle last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d Understanding dawned. \u201cOh. Of course you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most definitely did not spend the night at the Moranglian Army encampment,\u201d Abigail went on in a low whisper, \u201callowing Mr. Butterfield some mildly unchivalrous liberties.\u201d A wash of pink touched her cheeks.</p><p>Izzy smiled. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. What are friends for?\u201d</p> <p>Abigail gave her a squeezing hug and heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cNow,\u201d she said brightly, \u201cwhat\u2019s to be done about these solicitors? How do we prove that the duke\u2019s not an incompetent lunatic? Surely we haven\u2019t given up.\u201d</p><p>Izzy looked to Ransom. \u201cWe haven\u2019t given up. Have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cLet them come. No more charades. No more pretense. I will answer their questions, honestly. If, at the end of it, they mean to challenge my fitness as duke, I will see them in the Lord Chancellor\u2019s court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that plan,\u201d she said. \u201cAbigail, can we still count on your help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan has resigned,\u201d Ransom said, scratching his unshaven jaw. \u201cBut I think I can convince him to stay. As a friend. We\u2019ll still need footmen.\u201d He looked to Abigail. \u201cYou said the Moranglian Army is still camped nearby? Perhaps I can persuade them to come back.\u201d</p> <p>Izzy wasn\u2019t sure that was a wise idea.</p><p>\u201cRansom, you were so hurtful to them yesterday. Lord knows what they\u2019re thinking of me. Whatever you say to them . . . I suggest you consider beginning with a sincere apology. And concluding with the word \u2018please.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He chewed a bite of his pancake and shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re reasonable men. I\u2019m certain with a bit of conversation, we can reach an understanding.\u201d</p><p>Evidently, an understanding wouldn\u2019t be so easily reached.</p><p>Not two hours later, Ransom found himself in the Moranglian encampment. Surrounded, hooded, and held at sword point, with both hands bound behind his back.</p><p>And now they were taking him into the woods.</p><p>He tried to make himself heard through the clanking of armor and the sacking thrown over his head. \u201cGood sirs, truly. I know yesterday I said hurtful things. But today, I\u2019ve come in peace. I wish to join your ranks.\u201d</p><p>A pointed object jabbed him in the kidneys. \u201cOne does not simply join the Knights of Moranglia. It\u2019s not that easy. There\u2019s a ceremony and an oath.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd a trial,\u201d another said.</p><p>\u201cVery well. I will submit to your trials. But really, is the hood necessary? I am already blind.\u201d</p><p>He took another jab to the kidneys. \u201cKneel.\u201d</p><p>He knelt. Someone removed his hood.</p><p>Ransom took a greedy gulp of fresh air. \u201cSo what do I do? What do I need to say?\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAnon I pledge mine fealty thither . . .\u201d</p><p>They put the hood back over his head.</p><p>\u201cPrithee,\u201d he protested, \u201cif thou wouldst waiteth a goddamned second\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother Wendell, he\u2019s not taking this seriously,\u201d one of the knights said. \u201cOur order is a sacred trust. We\u2019re here because we\u2019re united by a higher purpose.\u201d</p><p>Another chimed in. \u201cIf we admit him to our ranks, we must treat him as one of our own. As a brother. Do you think he\u2019s going to treat us the same way?\u201d</p><p>Ransom bowed his head and managed to shake his hood loose. Unburdened, he lifted his eyes and spoke to the faceless men surrounding him.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cI know. I\u2019m not your friend. I\u2019m the bastard who thrashed you and took your pocket money at school. But right now, I\u2019m on the ground. In the woods. Kneeling in something highly unfortunate, on the day after my valet quit his post. I am serious about this. I am seriously apologetic for what I said. And I seriously need your help.\u201d</p><p>That was the first time Ransom could recall ever saying those words: I need your help. And look, he hadn\u2019t even collapsed of humiliation.</p><p>The first knight spoke again. \u201cDon\u2019t allow it, brother. He\u2019s not a true Moranglian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am now,\u201d Ransom insisted. \u201cAnd Sir Wendell should know it. He was there at the vicarage for dinner when we read through the first part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove your worth,\u201d the second knight said. \u201cIn installment seventeen, what three ingredients did Ulric fetch for the Witch of Graymere\u2019s potion?\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. That was very specific. Ransom searched his memories of the previous night. He\u2019d been paying attention to the story\u2014he\u2019d been lost in it, truly\u2014but he hadn\u2019t taken sodding notes. \u201cToe of troll, hair of newt, and . . . and unicorn piss? Damn it, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see?\u201d the knight said. \u201cHe\u2019s not sincere. I bet he doesn\u2019t even know the Doubt Nots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Ransom said, perking up. \u201cThose, I know.\u201d</p><p>He remembered this part. It was a good part, with Ulric taking his leave of Cressida before departing on his quest to slay the Beast of Cumbernoth. He\u2019d made quite a speech.</p><p>\u201cDoubt not, my lady,\u201d he recited. \u201cDoubt not. I shall return. Doubt not my blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s steel,\u201d someone corrected, adding a corrective thump to the back. \u201cDoubt not my steel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d He concentrated on the muddy ground. \u201cDoubt not my steel. Doubt not my strength. And there\u2019s something more, and something else about the king, and then \u2018you remain queen of my heart\u2019 and it ends with, \u2018For my lady, and for Moranglia.\u2019 \u201d He lifted his head. \u201cThere, is that good enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He recognized Wendell Butterfield\u2019s voice. \u201cThat was pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just using us,\u201d the first knight said again. \u201cOnce he gets what he wants, he\u2019ll forget us. Cut us in the street. Make sport of our rituals at his fancy gentlemen\u2019s clubs. He doesn\u2019t understand how we are.\u201d</p><p>Ransom shook his head. \u201cNo, no. No one likes me at those clubs, either. Believe me, I know what it\u2019s like to be reviled. I was gravely injured seven months ago, and guess how many visitors and well-wishers I\u2019ve had? Exactly none. I\u2019m an outcast, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wealthy, highly ranked outcast with a half dozen estates,\u201d Wendell pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, yes. But if my solicitors and heir have their way, I could lose everything. Make no mistake, I\u2019m not asking your help for me. I need to protect Miss Goodnight. If this hearing doesn\u2019t go well, she will be forced to sell the home of her dreams. Allow me to join your ranks, and I swear to you: We will be united in a higher purpose. Her.\u201d</p><p>There was a prolonged silence.</p><p>Ransom didn\u2019t know what more he could say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as your solemn oath.\u201d Sir Wendell laid a blunted sword to his shoulder. \u201cI dub thee Sir Ransom, a brother in the Order of the Poppy and a true knight of Moranglia.\u201d</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cOrder of the Poppy,\u201d Ransom mused, as his hands were cut loose. He rubbed his chafed wrists. \u201cDoes this mean we get to smoke opium now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wendell said. But to his compatriot, he added, \u201cPass him the mead.\u201d</p><p>A flask of sweet, sticky wine was offered to him. Ransom drank from it. \u201cNot bad. You have my thanks, Sir Wendell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother Wendell,\u201d he corrected. \u201cYou\u2019re one of us now.\u201d</p><p>Really. He was one of them now.</p><p>How unexpected. There, kneeling in the forest, surrounded by men who represented the odd pegs and loose ends of English public schools, Ransom was seized by the strangest, most unfamiliar sensation.</p><p>Acceptance.</p><p>\u201cAnd when we\u2019re not on guard,\u201d Wendell went on, \u201cit\u2019s Mr. Wendell Butterfield, Esquire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEsquire?\u201d Ransom repeated. \u201cBut . . . you can\u2019t mean you\u2019re a barrister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know they allowed barristers to spend their free time tromping the forest in makeshift armor.\u201d</p><p>Wendell answered, \u201cWhy not? We spend our work days wearing long black robes and powdered wigs.\u201d</p><p>Ransom supposed that was true.</p><p>\u201cAnd I may be useless when it comes to performing a footman\u2019s table service, but I can get your legal matters sorted. If you\u2019ll accept the help, that is.\u201d</p><p>Wendell stuck something blurry and flesh-colored in Ransom\u2019s face.</p><p>His hand.</p><p>A last pang of bruised pride knocked about his chest, heaving in its death throes. He didn\u2019t need help rising to his feet, that pride insisted. He wasn\u2019t an invalid or a child.</p><p>But he was human. Hopelessly in love, for the first time in his life. And in danger of losing everything. As Duncan had said, he needed all the friendly help he could get.</p><p>He swallowed back his instinctive refusal and accepted the man\u2019s hand.</p><p>Once Ransom had gained his feet, Wendell called for the knights to circle close. Their hands clapped on his shoulders and back.</p><p>\u201cAll knights salute!\u201d</p><p>Fists thumped armor. \u201cFor my lady, and for Moranglia!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Izzy, you\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d Abigail pulled her toward the turret window.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Oh, please tell me it\u2019s not the solicitors. We\u2019re not ready at all. I\u2019m not dressed. Ransom isn\u2019t even here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the solicitors. Look.\u201d</p><p>Izzy poked her head out the narrow window. There in the distance, winding down the road to the castle\u2019s barbican, was the familiar, gaily colored sight of the West Yorkshire Riding Knights of Moranglia. Accompanied by their sister chapter of Cressida\u2019s Handmaidens. Their banners waved briskly in the breeze, and sunlight glinted off armor.</p><p>\u201cThe duke did it,\u201d Abigail said, clutching Izzy\u2019s arm. \u201cHe convinced them to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect you had something to do with it, too,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cSir Wendell obviously has his own reasons for returning. But it doesn\u2019t matter why they came. It just matters that they\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>A silly tear came to her eye. Even after everything yesterday, they hadn\u2019t abandoned her. They were still here, still her friends. They still believed.</p><p>Doubt not.</p><p>The next few hours were a flurry of activity. Cook and the handmaidens were busy in the kitchen. The knights had another course in table service. Duncan whisked Ransom off for a bath, shave, fitted coat, and gleaming boots. Abigail expended nearly three-quarters of an hour and a great deal of patience on a quest to tame Izzy\u2019s hair.</p><p>When the carriage wheels sounded in the drive, Izzy couldn\u2019t even bring herself to look. Abigail had to do it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s them. Now they\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo coaches. Three . . . No, four men in all.\u201d</p><p>Four of them? Oh, dear. Only two would be the solicitors. The others must be . . . doctors, witnesses, assistants to the Lord Chancellor, perhaps?</p><p>She paced back and forth, just hoping everything was going well downstairs. Duncan would be greeting them, seeing them into the hall, and then it would be time for . . .</p><p>A knock sounded at the door.</p><p>Ransom.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d He offered her his arm, and together they made their way down the corridor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything. Just stay close to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t they find it strange if I\u2019m plastered to your side the whole time?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tugged to one side. \u201cBelieve me. None of my solicitors will be surprised to find a beautiful woman plastered to my side. It will only bolster the impression that I\u2019m my old self.\u201d</p><p>His reputation wasn\u2019t the source of her concern. She strongly doubted his solicitors were used to seeing him with women like her.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d Izzy held him back.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Right. That would be lovely, but perhaps it can wait until after this crucial meeting we\u2019ve been preparing for all week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t wait,\u201d she said, pulling on his sleeve. \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to know. Urgently.\u201d</p> <p>Now that she had his attention, she almost lost her nerve. She forced herself to blurt it out. \u201cI\u2019m not beautiful. At all.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed, and lips pursed as if he would ask a question, but the question seemed to just . . . get stuck there.</p><p>\u201cI should have told you ages ago. You can\u2019t know how it\u2019s been weighing on me. It\u2019s just . . . No one\u2019s ever called me beautiful. No one\u2019s ever made me feel beautiful. And I couldn\u2019t resist enjoying it, even though it was all a misunderstanding. But you need to know it now. If we go into that room together, me draped on your arm . . . There will be no clearer evidence that you\u2019ve gone blind. They won\u2019t know what in the world you\u2019re doing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIzzy.\u201d His hand swept up her arm.</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cI\u2019m not fishing for compliments. Truly. It\u2019s important that you believe and understand this. I\u2019m not beautiful, Ransom. Not pretty. Not comely. Not even passably fair. I\u2019m exceedingly plain. I always have been. No man has ever paid me the slightest attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. So you\u2019re not beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all your layers and revelations . . .\u201d His hands settled on her shoulders. \u201cThis is the deepest secret you\u2019ve been keeping from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She tried to reach for him.</p><p>His grip firmed, forbidding her to move. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As he backed her up against the wall, words just kept spilling out of her. Useless, foolish words.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed harmless enough at the start. I never dreamed it would cause any trouble, and I told myself there wasn\u2019t any reason you needed to know the truth. Except now . . . now there are other people here. And you want to pass me off as your lover, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not passing you off,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are my lover.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hands to her face. Curse her ridiculous vanity. Now his whole future was at risk.</p> <p>He said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening. This . . . this . . . is your great, shameful confession. You tell me you\u2019re not beautiful.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s just absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s nothing. Do you want to hear a truly ugly secret, Izzy? Here\u2019s mine. I killed my mother.\u201d</p><p>Ransom could feel her recoil at his words, palpably shocked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t blame her. They were ugly words. Never, ever pleasant to hear. They\u2019d taken a toll on him, too.</p><p>\u201cMy mother labored for thirty-odd hours to bring me into the world, and died less than one hour afterward,\u201d he said. \u201cI killed her. That\u2019s precisely what my father told me, in those exact words, from the time I was old enough to understand them.\u201d</p><p>The memories were still so clear. Every time he\u2019d cried, every time he\u2019d shivered, every time he\u2019d stumbled and wanted a bit of cosseting. His father would haul him by the collar, heels dragging along the marble floors, and push him to the floor before the floor-length portrait of his mother.</p><p>Stop that sniveling, boy. She can\u2019t wipe your tears now, can she? You killed her.</p><p>God, she was beautiful in that portrait. Golden hair, blue eyes, pale blue gown. An angel. He used to pray to her. Little blasphemous petitions for miracles, forgiveness, playthings . . . any signs that she could hear.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t hear. She was gone.</p><p>He\u2019d never prayed to anything since.</p><p>\u201cAll the servants,\u201d he said, \u201cnursemaids, housekeeper, tutors . . . they were sternly instructed to show me no affection. No hugs, no kisses, no nurturing or comfort. Because those were things my mother would have given me, and I didn\u2019t deserve them. He blamed me for her death.\u201d</p><p>He felt the breath sigh out of her. \u201cRansom, that\u2019s just terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt was so wrong of him to treat you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. He was a cruel, disgusting bastard. Let\u2019s just say, there weren\u2019t many bedtime stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . It\u2019s meaningless to say it, but I\u2019m so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his brow to hers. \u201cIt\u2019s not meaningless at all. It means everything. And if later, you want to take me to bed and stroke my hair for days, I\u2019ll take it gladly.\u201d He pulled back, putting distance between them. \u201cBut that\u2019s later. Right now, we\u2019re discussing you. Not-beautiful you.</p><p>\u201cI know women, Izzy. I\u2019ve known far too many women.\u201d He\u2019d spent years searching for that physical comfort he\u2019d been denied, always shying away from any deeper connection. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve known, ever since that first afternoon, that you were unlike anyone who\u2019d come before. I\u2019m glad of it. And if men never paid you attention, I\u2019m glad of that, too, selfish cad that I am. Otherwise, you\u2019d be with some other man instead of here with me.</p><p>\u201cBut no matter how tightly I hold you, no matter how deeply I sink inside you\u2014I\u2019ve felt there\u2019s always some small part of you I can\u2019t reach. Something you\u2019ve been holding back. Your heart, I assumed. Oh, I wanted it. I want all of you. But I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ask for something I so clearly didn\u2019t deserve.\u201d</p><p>He felt her draw breath to object, but he cut her off before she could try.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s nothing to do with my birth or my childhood. I\u2019m old enough now to recognize my father\u2019s treatment for the senseless cruelty it was. But it\u2019s everything since. You think a few features scattered on your face make you plain? I am ugly to the core. All England knows it. And after reading through my papers, you must know it. You sifted through a mountain of my misdeeds. Of course you\u2019d build a wall around your heart. You\u2019re a clever girl. How could you love this? How could anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansom.\u201d Her voice wavered.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I learn that this . . . this . . . is what you\u2019ve been guarding. This is the reason for that reluctance. You don\u2019t feel pretty enough. For a blind man. Christ, Izzy. And I thought I was shallow.\u201d</p><p>The words came out more harshly than he intended. So he followed them with kisses. Tender, soothing kisses to her cheek, her neck, the pale, arousing curve of her shoulder . . .</p><p>Bless this woman and her silly, all-too-human vanity. He might never know how to be the man she deserved, but this?</p><p>This, he knew how to remedy.</p><p>\u201cIzzy,\u201d he moaned, pressing his body to hers, \u201cyou make me wild with wanting you. You can\u2019t imagine.\u201d He started pulling up her skirts.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what it seems like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t. The solicitors. They\u2019re just downstairs, waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTupping me in the corridor is more important than saving your title?\u201d</p><p>He held very still. Then he kissed her lips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He said the word simply, solemnly. Because he meant it, with everything he had left to him. Body and soul. The solicitors and dukedom could go hang. There was nothing worth defending in his life if he couldn\u2019t make her see this.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t judge how beauty looks anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know the sound of it. It sounds like a flowing river of wild, sweet honey. Beauty smells like rosemary, and it tastes of nectar. Beauty sneezes like a flea.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. That beautiful smile. How could she ever doubt her effect on him?</p><p>\u201cThis is how plain you are.\u201d He caressed her breast with one hand, while with the other he undid the closures of his breeches placket. \u201cThis is how unattractive I find you.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time for foreplay or finesse. Only joining.</p><p>He fought his way through the petticoats, found her to be every bit as ready as he was\u2014and put both hands on her backside, lifting her off the ground and against the wall. She clung tight to his neck, wrapping her legs about his waist.</p><p>And then he thrust.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Saying those words\u2014the words he\u2019d been denied so long, until he denied that they meant anything\u2014damn, it felt good. And saying the words while sliding deep inside her? It felt amazing.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Izzy.\u201d He thrust deep and true, sliding further home with every dig of his hips. \u201cI love you. You. Beautiful . . . tempting . . . clever . . . lovely . . . you.\u201d</p><p>He paused inside her, sheathed to the hilt. Holding her pinned to the wall, the both of them fighting for breath. Her thighs quivered against his. There wasn\u2019t any way to get closer. He\u2019d pushed into her just as far as he possibly could, thrust as deeply as he could ever reach.</p><p>But was it enough? Could he manage to touch her heart?</p><p>He had to know.</p><p>He closed his eyes and pressed his brow to her sweet, powdered skin. That old, insidious voice thundered in his blood. You don\u2019t deserve this. You don\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>But he had to ask anyway.</p><p>He spoke the words that were most difficult of all.</p><p>\u201cLove me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Love me.\u201d</p><p>The words were a hoarse, faint whisper. But Izzy knew how much they\u2019d cost him.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She hugged his neck tight, lest she be swept away by this flood of tender emotion. She kissed his brow, his cheek. \u201cOh, Ransom. I love you. I do.\u201d</p><p>On a shaky gasp, he pulled almost all the way out, then thrust home once more. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She could have said it a hundred times. She could have held him deep inside her for just as long as he could wish. But they didn\u2019t have that kind of time. He worked hard and fast, bringing them both to a stunning, silent crisis. She sank her teeth into her wrist to keep from crying out.</p><p>Then he withdrew from her body, setting her feet back down on the floor. He held her for a few moments longer. Just breathing.</p><p>\u201cI needed that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI think we both did.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her skirts and smoothed out the worst of the wrinkles while he refastened the buttons of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cIzzy, here is what I can say with confidence, as a man who would know.\u201d He straightened his waistcoat with a tug, then each sleeve in turn. \u201cYou\u2019re a wildly attractive, palpably sensual woman. Perhaps suitors kept their distance because of the Tales. Perhaps your father held them at bay because he feared losing you. I don\u2019t know why men never pursued you in the past. I can only tell you why they won\u2019t pursue you in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an isn\u2019t-it-obvious shrug. \u201cBecause I won\u2019t let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Izzy melted against the wall.</p><p>He spread his arms for her appraisal. \u201cAm I put back together? Will I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re devastating.\u201d Still reeling, she touched a hand to her coiffure. Or what remained of it. \u201cMy hair. You go ahead. I\u2019ll just run upstairs and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it.\u201d He took her arm and pulled it through his. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be worried about appearances. Stay close to me, every moment. There won\u2019t be any doubt in those solicitors\u2019 minds about what I\u2019m doing with you.\u201d He paused. \u201cUnless you\u2019re worried what your friends will think, in which case\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she told him, hugging his arm tight. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about that at all.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Ransom went to face the Inquisitioners.</p><p>When he entered the great hall, everyone stood. He saw a group of four gray figures, adrift in a sea of gray mist. Brilliant. He couldn\u2019t tell them one from the other. Had no idea who the others might be, once Blaylock and Riggett were accounted for.</p> <p>These four ominous shadows had come to pass judgment on his life.</p><p>But he had Izzy on his arm. The subtle creaking of the knights around him was an unexpected source of reassurance.</p><p>And he had a new lawyer. A good one. One he could trust.</p><p>He was among friends.</p><p>One of the visitors approached him. Ransom could feel the man taking in his appearance, scrutinizing his scars. \u201cYour Grace, it\u2019s a relief to see you in such good health.\u201d</p> <p>A relief? Ransom snorted. Somehow he doubted relief was what the man felt right now. Despicable, grasping swindler.</p><p>Izzy pressed her fingertips against his wrist, letting him know the solicitor\u2019s identity.</p><p>\u201cBlaylock,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Miss Isolde Goodnight. The new owner of Gostley Castle. Lynforth willed the place to her.\u201d</p><p>Izzy curtsied. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve brought along with us Mr. Havers,\u201d the man went on, \u201cfrom the office of the Lord Chancellor.\u201d</p><p>Havers came forward. \u201cA pleasure, Miss Goodnight. The Lord Chancellor sends his regards. His son is a great admirer of your father\u2019s stories.\u201d</p> <p>Blaylock completed the introductions. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember my colleague, Mr. Riggett. And this kind gentleman is Dr. Mills, from the Holyfield Sanitarium for the Mentally Dispossessed.\u201d</p><p>Ransom acknowledged their vague forms with a curt nod. \u201cIf your introductions are concluded, I\u2019ll proceed with mine. This is Mr. Wendell Butterfield, esquire. My new legal counsel. And before we proceed any further this afternoon, we will make one thing clear. I will answer any questions. About how I ended here seven months ago, and why. About what I\u2019ve been doing since. About my injuries, my blindness\u201d\u2014he waited for them to absorb this news\u2014\u201cand my mental state. I will submit to your examinations. But first . . .\u201d He snapped his fingers, and Wendell put the papers in his hand. \u201cYou will sign this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt creates an irrevocable trust for Miss Goodnight in the amount of twenty thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>His solicitor balked. \u201cWhat? Twenty thou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neglectful management meant she inherited this castle from her godfather and arrived to find it in a shameful state of disrepair. The least we can do is provide her the funds to restore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, we cannot authorize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my fortune. I am the duke. Until a court decides otherwise, I do the authorizing.\u201d He thrust the papers in the solicitor\u2019s hand. \u201cI will sign. You will witness. Then, and only then, will I be at your disposal. If you refuse . . . ? I swear to you this. I will fight you, every step of the way, and I will see you brought up on charges of fraud.\u201d</p> <p>The solicitors conferred.</p><p>Izzy\u2019s arm tightened on his. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ensuring your future here in this castle. Everything else is secondary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fate\u2019s not secondary,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>Ransom acknowledged her sweet words with a squeeze of his fingers. But he didn\u2019t withdraw his demand. Twenty thousand was a significant sum, but it was only a small portion of what they\u2019d control if they succeeded in wresting his fortune away. He was relying on their greed to carry the day.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he prodded. \u201cPerhaps I should rescind the offer and press straight for the charges of fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Blaylock said. \u201cIn the interests of Miss Goodnight, we will sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Once he\u2019d scrawled his name at the bottom of the papers, and the solicitors had done likewise, Ransom could breathe easier. Izzy was safe.</p><p>Now, to make her a duchess.</p><p>The doctor approached him. \u201cThese fraud remarks concern me. Do you often see conspiracies surrounding you, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>Here it came. The interrogation.</p><p>Ransom dropped onto the sofa and settled in. He answered query after query. What year it was, the current ruling monarch, the color of the sky. They asked questions about his injury, poked at his scar.</p><p>He mined every reserve of patience he possessed. He could tell they were waiting to pounce on the slightest error or irregularity. With this many witnesses, they couldn\u2019t fabricate a lunacy charge. If it came to a formal trial, Ransom knew he\u2019d prevail. But it would be so much easier to be done with this today.</p><p>After an hour or so of their questioning, he couldn\u2019t be patient any longer. A headache threatened at the base of his skull. \u201cSomeone get me a drink. Whisky.\u201d</p><p>The doctor made a note. \u201cDevoted . . . to . . . whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly a new development,\u201d Ransom said.</p><p>\u201cI must admit,\u201d Mr. Havers remarked, \u201cI find your house staff\u2019s attire to be . . . fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s my whimsy,\u201d Izzy said, adopting that girlish, treacly voice he despised. \u201cYou know how devoted I am to my father\u2019s wonderful stories. And now, with the backdrop of this magnificent castle, I just can\u2019t resist bringing a bit of The Goodnight Tales to life. I\u2019m so lucky to have the handmaidens and knights here with me. Do you have any sweetmeats?\u201d</p><p>The doctor leaned forward. \u201cHow do you feel about this atmosphere, Your Grace? Do you enjoy living in a fairy tale, too?\u201d</p><p>One of the knights\u2014Sir Alfred, Ransom thought he was called\u2014creaked and clanked forward. He placed a tumbler of whisky in Ransom\u2019s hand. The glass jostled in the exchange, and spirits splashed them both.</p><p>\u201cApologies, my brother,\u201d Alfred said.</p><p>\u201cBrother?\u201d</p><p>Damn it. Ransom knew that sound. That was the sound of a pounce.</p><p>Blaylock\u2019s voice sharpened. \u201cDid that footman just address you as brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you testing my hearing now?\u201d Ransom tried to sound bored. \u201cI believe he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t permit the footmen to address you in that familiar manner, Your Grace. Or have you forgotten yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, there.\u201d Riggett called to the young knight, who had clanked his way back to the side of the room. \u201cWhy did you just address his grace as \u2018brother\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-because we are both members of the same brotherhood,\u201d the youth answered. \u201cThe Order of the Poppy.\u201d</p><p>When Ransom heard the resulting laughter, there was no gray in his vision any longer.</p><p>Only red.</p><p>\u201cThe Order of the Poppy?\u201d Blaylock was like a greedy boy with a bowl of trifle and two spoons. \u201cDo tell us more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Moranglian order of knighthood, sir. We have banners, tournaments. Badges, and an oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the duke is a willing part of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d Alfred hesitated.</p><p>Of course he hesitated. Ransom recognized the youth\u2019s voice now. He was the one of the knights who\u2019d been arguing against Ransom\u2019s inclusion. And perhaps for good reason. Alfred had known this moment would come even if he hadn\u2019t guessed it would be so soon.</p><p>He\u2019d known Ransom would be put to the test.</p><p>So, here it was. He could have his fortune, title, and authority restored today\u2014but only if he denounced Izzy\u2019s hard work and everything her friends stood for.</p><p>Yesterday, he\u2019d had no difficulty doing just that. He\u2019d mocked and belittled every person standing on the fringes of this room.</p><p>And today, they\u2019d come back. For Izzy, and for him. Was he supposed to abuse them all over again?</p><p>\u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d Riggett was eager to seal the matter. \u201cHe\u2019s addled, clearly. His blow to the head has left him hopelessly confused. A lunacy trial is our only course.\u201d</p><p>The doctor leaned close. \u201cYour Grace. Do you know who you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ransom rose to his feet. \u201cI know precisely who I am. I\u2019m Ransom William Dacre Vane, the eleventh Duke of Rothbury. I\u2019m also the Marquess of Youngham, Earl of Priorwood, Lord Thackeray. And . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d the doctor prompted. \u201cAnd you believe you\u2019re someone else, as well?\u201d</p><p>He heard Izzy\u2019s small hiss of warning. But damn it, he\u2019d sworn an oath. On her name. He couldn\u2019t deny it now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Knight of Moranglia.\u201d</p><p>Izzy clapped a hand to her mouth.</p><p>Oh, no. He\u2019d done it now.</p><p>Ransom thumped his chest, and all the knights saluted in return.</p><p>Half of Izzy wanted to cheer, and half of her wanted to weep. It was a sweet, valiant gesture on his part\u2014but at what cost?</p><p>The solicitors moved into action at once.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Havers? We have no choice.\u201d Riggett pointed at the duke. \u201cHe needs to stand for a lunacy trial. He\u2019s delusional. Probably dangerous.\u201d</p><p>The doctor agreed. \u201cIn my professional opinion, he should be taken into custody, held for examination in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Izzy said. \u201cPlease wait a moment. Let\u2019s discuss this further. Surely an asylum isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>But her pleas were lost in the din. Other objections drowned them out.</p><p>All around the great hall, the knights and handmaidens were rousing themselves to Ransom\u2019s defense.</p><p>One of the knights drew his saber\u2014a saber that didn\u2019t look sharp enough to cut sponge cake\u2014and thrust it into the air. \u201cYou can\u2019t take him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a brotherhood,\u201d another cried out.</p><p>\u201cI knew all this training would be for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stand as one. We will fight to the death.\u201d</p><p>Even Magnus began to growl and bark.</p><p>A shout lifted over all: \u201cRelease the ermine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Izzy ran to the end of the hall, clambered up on the table, and cupped her hands around her mouth. \u201cStop!\u201d she cried, putting the force of her full body into it. \u201cStop, all of you! Stop!\u201d</p><p>They stopped. And turned to her.</p><p>When she had the room\u2019s attention, she took a deep breath. She made her hands flat in front of her, as if she could use them to physically smooth the tension in the room.</p><p>\u201cNo battles will be necessary. No examinations, either. This is all a misunderstanding. The duke is perfectly sane. Mr. Blaylock, Mr. Riggett, Mr. Havers, Dr. Mills. You must believe me. I have been sharing this castle with the Duke of Rothbury for weeks now, and I know him to be perfectly sound of mind. The knights, the handmaidens, the romantic stories . . . he doesn\u2019t believe in all this. He shouldn\u2019t believe in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see . . .\u201d Her eyes flitted over the knights and handmaidens. \u201cThe Goodnight Tales were . . . Well, they were a lie. I was never that innocent little girl with sleek amber hair. Sir Henry wasn\u2019t a doting father though he tried his best. I didn\u2019t want a weasel for a pet, and I didn\u2019t ask for this.\u201d She indicated the castle. \u201cCressida might be brave, but I\u2019m terrified of the dark. Ulric can say, \u2018Doubt not,\u2019 but I have doubts all the time. I\u2019ve doubted the truth of happy endings. I\u2019ve doubted the existence of lasting love. Most of all, I\u2019ve doubted myself.\u201d</p><p>To the solicitors, she said, \u201cThe duke is humoring me. But he knows this is just pretense. Shite and bollocks, I believe he called it yesterday.\u201d She looked around the room. \u201cDidn\u2019t he? You all were there.\u201d</p><p>A murmur of reluctant confirmation swept the room.</p><p>She turned to Ransom. \u201cSo tell them. It\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t need to pretend any longer, and you don\u2019t need to protect me. Just tell them everything you\u2019ve been saying to me for weeks. You\u2019re perfectly sane. Romance is the delusion.\u201d She pressed her hand to her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Truly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ransom considered. She watched his chest expand with a deep breath. He scratched his neck as he stared at the floor.</p><p>Blaylock moved forward. \u201cWell, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>Do it, she silently willed him, trying to send the message all the way across the hall to where he stood. Disclaim all of this. Save yourself.</p> <p>Just tell the truth.</p><p>\u201cI will say only this.\u201d When Ransom lifted his head, a sly smile played about his lips. \u201cDoubt not.\u201d</p><p>Her heart flipped over in her chest. \u201cNo. No, Ransom, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt not, my lady. I shall return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p> <p>He began to walk in her direction, continuing the recitation. \u201cDoubt not my steel. Chains, arrows, blades, stones. I shall never know their sting.\u201d</p><p>Not Ulric\u2019s speech. Anything but this.</p><p>\u201cDoubt not my strength.\u201d His voice was getting stronger, too. \u201cNo storm . . . No storm . . .\u201d</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Good. Izzy knew what came next, but she wasn\u2019t about to help him.</p><p>He looked to the knights for a cue.</p> <p>One of them whispered, \u201cNo storm-churned seas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d He took a step in retreat and began that bit again. \u201cDoubt not my strength. No storm-churned seas, no windblown sands. Nor mountain tall could bar me from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Blaylock prodded the doctor. \u201cHe\u2019s gone raving mad. He thinks he\u2019s a character in some fairy story.\u201d</p><p>Ransom paid them no attention. He didn\u2019t acknowledge anyone in the hall but Izzy. His progress toward her was slow, but unswerving.</p><p>On the edges of the great hall, the handmaidens looked ready to swoon.</p><p>\u201cDoubt not my heart.\u201d He was declaiming loudly now, and with feeling. His deep, resonant voice was made for this role. \u201cTime may pile into months and years. It cannot sway the eternal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansom, please,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey think you\u2019re mad. I\u2019m starting to wonder, too.\u201d</p><p>The solicitors and doctor moved toward him, as though he needed to be restrained.</p> <p>And they could try to hold him back. But Izzy knew he\u2019d just keep coming.</p><p>In fact, he kicked aside a chair and forged on with the next part:</p><p>\u201cDoubt not my love.\u201d</p><p>By this point, all the knights and handmaidens were joining in. Of course, they all knew the words, better than Izzy knew them herself.</p><p>But Ransom was the only one who knew the words were hers. That they\u2019d always been hers. And now he was giving them back to her. In a gesture of love and faith, and . . .</p><p>And sheer insanity.</p><p>She pressed a hand to her heart. Her hero.</p><p>A dozen handmaidens rushed to her side, lifting her down from the table and sweeping her forward to meet him in the center of the hall.</p><p>\u201cDoubt not my love,\u201d he repeated, with a chorus of knights to bolster him. \u201cIf men would seek to part us, death itself would be a veil too thin. For lo, though I wander the earth for my king, you remain\u2014now and ever\u2014queen of my heart.\u201d</p><p>He went down on one knee and kissed her hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry,\u201d he murmured, coming to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s your life\u2019s work, and they\u2019re our friends. I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not angry.\u201d She took his face in her hands. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how much I love you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say you\u2019ll marry me. I\u2019ll go to London, sort out this legal business. And then I\u2019ll come back with a ring. Diamonds or sapphires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a ring at all. I just want you.\u201d</p><p>There was time to steal a quick, heartfelt kiss.</p><p>And then they tried to take him into custody.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, remain calm.\u201d The solicitors flanked him. \u201cWe\u2019ll be taking you to London now. There are some very fine doctors we wish you to see.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged off their hands. \u201cI\u2019ll take myself to London. No custody required. But yes, you had better believe I\u2019ll be seeing you in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Mr. Havers interjected, \u201cI don\u2019t believe there will be any proceedings. Not a lunacy hearing, anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Blaylock said. He waved at the scene. \u201cBut you witnessed that . . . display just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. And I assure you, the Lord Chancellor will be wholly uninterested in hearing the matter.\u201d Havers turned to Izzy. \u201cAs I told Miss Goodnight, his son is a great admirer of these tales. The young man fell from a horse in his childhood, and he\u2019s been confined to his bed ever since. The stories have been a boon to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfined to his bed?\u201d A suspicion formed in Izzy\u2019s mind. \u201cBut you can\u2019t be speaking of Lord Peregrine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very one,\u201d Havers said. \u201cThe Lord Chancellor will have no desire to hear this matter. Lock away Izzy Goodnight\u2019s intended groom for lunacy? He\u2019d never hear the end of it at family dinners. For that matter, all England would be grumbling.\u201d</p><p>Riggett gestured wildly. \u201cBut the knights. The armor. The Order of the Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, man. They\u2019re just stories. The rest of us here understand that.\u201d Mr. Havers gestured at Ransom. \u201cLook at him. The man\u2019s not delusional. He\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>Ransom\u2019s lips quirked in that familiar half smile. \u201cWell, that\u2019s one charge I can\u2019t argue.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a typical wedding. Rather a quiet affair.</p><p>The ceremony took place early on a Tuesday morning. The bride wore red, so the groom could see her in a crowd. The narrow pews of the village chapel were crushed with knights in makeshift armor and handmaidens in medieval gowns.</p><p>And, after a wedding breakfast at the village inn, the happy couple eschewed the waiting carriage in favor of a long, leisurely stroll back to their castle, walking arm-in-arm.</p><p>As they approached the barbican, Izzy stared up at the ancient stone fortress. The new glass panes in the windows acted like facets of a diamond, sparkling in the morning sun. So much had changed since that first rainy, gloomy afternoon, when she\u2019d been deposited here with nothing more to her name than a weasel, a letter, and her last shred of hope.</p><p>Ransom stopped her in the courtyard. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him. And then she spent the next few moments collecting her scattered wits. The castle might have changed in her perception, but this man hadn\u2019t. That wild, untamed masculine beauty made her knees weak every time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid we leave something behind at the inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve just been wanting to do this again.\u201d</p><p>He bent at the waist, and in one swift move, he scooped her into his arms, tucking her close to his chest.</p><p>And this time, Izzy managed not to swoon.</p><p>Just barely.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Several months later</p><p>The candle was nearly guttered in its holder when Ransom reached the thirty-fourth stair. \u201cIzzy, it\u2019s late. You should come to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Izzy replaced her quill in the inkwell and propped her elbows on the desk. With a sigh of fatigue, she closed her eyes and rubbed her temples.</p><p>He came to stand behind her. His strong hands settled heavily on her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re working much too hard these last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d She picked up the quill and began to write again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s only that I\u2019m desperate to have a few months\u2019 worth of installments completed before the baby arrives. The work\u2019s going more slowly than I\u2019d like. Add to that, I\u2019m drowning in correspondence to answer.\u201d</p><p>His thumbs kneaded the muscles at the back of her neck, coaxing a deep sigh from her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat massage is a lovely start.\u201d She sorted through the pile of envelopes. \u201cMaybe you can help me answer this letter from Lord Peregrine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat conundrum has he posed this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to pose the conundrum, actually, and I\u2019m stumped for one.\u201d She tapped her quill on the blotter. \u201cAha. I have it.\u201d She dipped her pen and began to write. \u201c \u2018Would you rather find a weasel in your bed or an octopus?\u2019 \u201d She scribbled the letter\u2019s closing and set it aside.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfair. He gets to choose? I don\u2019t get to choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re stuck with both.\u201d Smiling, Izzy pulled a magazine from her pile of correspondence. \u201cNow here\u2019s something from the post you\u2019ll find amusing. There\u2019s a letter to the editor of the Gentleman\u2019s Review. And it\u2019s about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead it, then.\u201d</p><p>Izzy opened the magazine to a marked page and read aloud in a lofty, affected baritone. \u201c \u2018Like so many devoted readers of your publication, I was pleased to see that England\u2019s beloved daughter, little Izzy Goodnight, newly the Duchess of Rothbury, has taken up her pen and decided to continue writing in the marvelous world Sir Henry gave to her, and to us. I read the first installments with great anticipation and much interest, but I am sorry to say they did not impress.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Ransom scowled. \u201cImpertinent jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s entitled to his opinion. Let\u2019s see . . . Here we are.\u201d She lowered her voice again. \u201c \u2018Though she has swiftly ascended to a higher social rank than her late father enjoyed, these first chapters make it sadly clear that Her Grace will never be his literary equal. Her writing pales beside the richness of Sir Henry\u2019s prose though I am pained to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pain him to say it,\u201d Ransom grumbled.</p><p>\u201cOh, but it gets better,\u201d she told him, skimming ahead. \u201cHe goes on, \u2018The Shadow Knight\u2019s Journey isn\u2019t without its faint glimmers of promise, however. With maturity and time to hone her craft, perhaps the duchess can aspire to be half the writer her father was\u2014and that in itself would be a genuine accomplishment for any writer so young, and so female.\u2019 And it\u2019s signed, The Right Honorable Edmund Creeley, of Chatton, Kent.\u201d</p><p>She set aside the magazine, laughing helplessly.</p><p>Ransom didn\u2019t laugh. He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prodded. \u201cAren\u2019t you amused? Have you no response?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have a response. The Right Honorable Edmund Creeley can take his quill and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The profanity that followed had Izzy clapping her hands to her belly, as if she could cover her unborn child\u2019s tender ears. The babe, however, merrily kicked and cartwheeled in her womb.</p><p>Oh, goodness. It seemed this child would take after Ransom.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mind that one bit.</p><p>\u201cWe will have the last laugh,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cMr. Creeley will be forced to eat his words, if not . . . those other things you listed. He\u2019ll learn the truth in time. As will everyone.\u201d</p><p>Ransom had given her a fairy-tale ending, and Izzy had vowed not to squander it. She was going to claim her work, and continue the stories she\u2014and so many others\u2014loved. But she wanted to go about it cautiously, with respect for Cressida and Ulric, and for her father\u2019s memory and that purple counterpane\u2014and most especially, for the readers who\u2019d made The Goodnight Tales not quite \u201ctrue\u201d but truly meaningful.</p><p>So rather than pick up where the original tales left off, she\u2019d begun a new story: The Shadow Knight\u2019s Journey.</p><p>No doubt many readers, those more perceptive than Edmund Creeley, would begin to guess the truth. A few had already written her with their suspicions. But for now, Izzy was playing coy.</p><p>She meant to follow the Shadow Knight through his side of the adventures, right up until that climactic scene at the parapet. And then, once the two tales were intertwined, he would lift the visor, revealing his true identity\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Izzy\u2019s.</p><p>When the truth came out, there was bound to be a bit of scandal. Izzy worried more about how Ransom would cope than she worried for her own feelings. She hoped reading him Mr. Creeley\u2019s letter might work as an inoculation of sorts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better prepare yourself, Ransom. When that installment is published in a few years, no one will be patting me on the head. I\u2019m sure to receive more unpleasant letters.\u201d</p> <p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, good. Because I\u2019ve decided that the proper response to any unpleasant letter is kisses, and I like having excuses to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this particular unpleasant letter merits more than one kiss. Something like ten or twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop until you count one hundred,\u201d he said wickedly. \u201cLater.\u201d</p> <p>She pouted. \u201cLater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I want to show you something. It\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Izzy was undeniably intrigued as she followed him down the spiraling stairs. She went slowly, cautiously. Her center of balance was changing by the day.</p><p>\u201cWhat surprise could be better than a hundred kisses?\u201d she asked, following Ransom down the corridor.</p><p>\u201cThis one, I hope.\u201d</p><p>He stopped before a particular bedchamber. The one they\u2019d designated as a nursery. He pushed open the door.</p> <p>She clapped her hands together. \u201cIs it finished?\u201d</p><p>Izzy had been strictly forbidden from involvement in the major renovations\u2014too much dust and danger, Ransom said. She hadn\u2019t argued. She was happy to focus on the writing for now. And it warmed her heart to see his growing investment in the castle that had been his ancestral home.</p><p>The castle that was now their home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done, as of today. The laborers finished painting this afternoon.\u201d He waved her toward the open door. \u201cHave a look.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, Izzy rushed through the entryway.</p><p>And then she froze in place, awestruck.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed. \u201cOh, Ransom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t start complaining about girlish treatment. I know you\u2019re too old to be given a purple room with golden stars. But I also know it was a dream of yours, once. I thought you might want to give it to our children instead.\u201d</p> <p>Izzy pressed a hand to her chest, overwhelmed. The room was beautiful. A cradle with purple quilted bedding, draped with clouds of tulle. A plush carpet of twining vines and lush blooms. Rows and rows of bookshelves. And on the ceiling were painted silver moons and golden stars. Even a comet or two.</p><p>On closer look, a few of those celestial objects appeared a bit less precise than the others\u2014uneven and smudged in places. Hardly in line with the exacting standards Ransom imposed on all their workmen.</p><p>But in her heart, Izzy knew the explanation for those less-than-perfect stars.</p><p>Those must be the ones he\u2019d painted himself.</p><p>He shuffled his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not saying anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed. There are times when even a writer can run out of words.\u201d She sniffed back a tear and hugged him as tight as her swelling belly would allow. \u201cThank you. I love you. This is the best gift I can imagine.\u201d</p><p>In fact, it was the gift she\u2019d been imagining all her life. Now it was real. They would give their children this magical room, set in their very own castle. But more important than that, they would give their children love. And security.</p><p>And stories. Night after night of stories.</p><p>This was the true fairy-tale ending. He\u2019d given her the \u201chappily\u201d part the day they\u2019d agreed to marry. This room was the \u201cever after.\u201d</p><p>And the best part of all?</p><p>So many years stood between them and \u201cThe End.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
