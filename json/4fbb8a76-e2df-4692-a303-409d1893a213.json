Around her, firefighters moved through the smoldering ruins, checking every crevice and corner to be certain the fire was completely extinguished. Water dripped from the blackened walls and ceiling to puddle on the floor below, and the smell of smoke and burned sugar clung to her nostrils and skin, sinking into the very fiber of her uniform.</p><p>\u201cThird one in as many weeks,\u201d James Ralston muttered behind her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Darcy. I know you loved this place.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and faced her mentor, her chest gripped in a vise of pain. Like the two previous fires, this blaze had destroyed a location that was dear to her and had held precious memories. She\u2019d celebrated her twelfth birthday at the Sweet Spot candy shop, and she stopped by every Friday to stock up on the sour lemonade straws her sister had turned her on to.</p> <p>Focus on the details, Darcy. Don\u2019t lose it now.</p><p>\u201cWhoever the arsonist is,\u201d she said, \u201che\u2019s not going to quit. He\u2019s been doing this too long. It\u2019s in his blood.\u201d</p><p>The frequency of the acts and the terrible brilliance of the timed-delay incendiary devices being used spoke of someone who\u2019d had time to perfect his madness.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help feeling violated, despite knowing how irrational that response was. As much as she\u2019d wanted to leave Lion\u2019s Bay as a kid, she couldn\u2019t even contemplate abandoning the sleepy seaside town now. The same memories that had driven her parents to move away kept her bound to the area.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201d Jim\u2019s forest green eyes were warm with compassion and intent on her face. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any new residents and it\u2019s the off-season. Tourism is down. Anyone not from around here sticks out like a sore thumb.\u201d</p> <p>She turned in a slow circle, her trained gaze following the burn patterns he\u2019d taught her to read.</p><p>\u201cThis guy didn\u2019t just crawl out of the w-woodwork,\u201d she said, startled to hear her voice cracking. She cleared her dry throat. \u201cI think we need to bring the big guns in on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiller\u2019s doing a good job. He\u2019s meticulous and thorough.\u201d He touched her elbow lightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the one who steps on his toes.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded, acknowledging the sensitive nature of her relationship with the town\u2019s sheriff. \u201cI know, but I think he needs more resources, and I think he\u2019s too stubborn to ask for help.\u201d</p><p>The last time the Feds had come in, they\u2019d run roughshod over Chris Miller and his deputies, cutting him out of the loop while draining his limited resources. She remembered that tense time all too well, because the murder they\u2019d been investigating had been the tragedy that brought her home. \u201cAnd frankly, Chris\u2019s ego is the least of our problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s gather the evidence, then we\u2019ll discuss the next best steps.\u201d Setting his hand on her shoulder, Jim gave her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cMaybe you should stay with someone tonight?\u201d</p> <p>Reaching up, she set her hand over his. He knew her so well.</p><p>She wanted a particular kind of support, the kind where someone was nearby if she needed them but out of her way if she wanted time to just retreat with her thoughts.</p><p>Her gaze met Jim\u2019s and he read her mind. \u201cMy couch is always open to you, Darcy. You know that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>Turning away, Darcy looked for a place to set down her kit and begin.</p><p>ROLLING OVER WITH a sigh, Darcy looked at the clock over Jim\u2019s fireplace mantel and noted the time: quarter after five. It was still dark outside and she\u2019d been tossing and turning all night, too wired by her restless thoughts to catch the sleep she desperately needed. There was something about the fires that was niggling at her, but she just couldn\u2019t place it. Turning it over and over in her mind wasn\u2019t bringing the answer she was looking for to mind.</p><p>Sitting up, she rolled her shoulders back, knowing what had to be done. She wanted her treasured equanimity back, and the only way to make that happen was to find the psycho who was stealing it from her and see him in a cage. The sooner, the better. A possible pissing match between authorities wasn\u2019t going to be enough to hold her back. So far no one had been hurt, but their torch was barely catching his breath between fires. If he kept to his established pattern, they had only days before he struck again.</p> <p>A warm exhale over her toes brought her attention to the handsome German shepherd sprawled on the floor at the foot of the couch. When her brief relationship with Jim had fizzled out, she\u2019d felt the loss of his dog keenly.</p><p>\u201cThanks for watching out for me, Columbo.\u201d Reaching down, she scratched behind his ears.</p><p>The residents of Lion\u2019s Bay were paying her to provide the same service to the town\u2014to watch out for them and keep them safe.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let them down.</p><p>Chapter two</p><p>Deputy U.S. Marshal Jared Cameron waited until the Lion\u2019s Bay sheriff sucked in a deep breath mid-rant, then he glanced at his partner.</p><p>\u201cThis winner is all yours,\u201d he drawled, turning on his heel and leaving Deputy Trish Morales to it. She\u2019d been assigned to him for just that reason: she had the patience of a saint and he had no patience at all. Especially not for defensive, posturing small-town authorities who whipped their dicks out and started marking their territories the moment he rolled into town.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done. Where the fuck is he going?\u201d Sheriff Miller snapped, followed by a far more modulated reply from Trish.</p><p>Idiot. Nothing trumped the U.S. Marshals Service\u2019s silver star.</p><p>Jared closed the sheriff\u2019s glass inset door behind him just to shut out the man\u2019s voice. Pushing the irritation from his thoughts, he started through the bull pen toward the exit when an unexpected and unwanted complication walked into the station. He took scant note of her initially, but something drew his attention back.</p><p>Grudgingly he slowed, then came to a stop. Whoever she was, she was a bombshell. Not in the physical sense. In that regard, she was of average height, slim, and moderately proportioned. Her face was free of cosmetics and her brown hair was pulled back in a casual ponytail. If he\u2019d been looking at a photo of her, he wouldn\u2019t have looked twice. But in the flesh, watching her move, was what snared him.</p><p>She was hot monkey sex in a brown paper wrapper.</p><p>The secret of her was revealed in the sensual fluidity of her body and her heavy-lidded, bottle green eyes. The primitive male in him recognized the attraction instantly, completely disregarding his brain, which didn\u2019t have time for this sort of distraction. Unfortunately for him, the blue uniform slacks and embroidered white button-up shirt she wore told Jared he had no chance of avoiding her unless he wanted to switch with Trish and take point with Miller instead. He was stuck with deciding which part of his anatomy was going to be the least controllable: his fists or his dick.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d be lucky and she would be happily married with kids, therefore not the least bit interested in getting sweaty and dirty with him.</p><p>She was lost in conversation with the female deputy manning the front desk when he approached. The glance she shot him was cursory, just as his had first been with her. Then it snagged. Her focus zeroed in, sliding over his body from the top of his head down to his scuffed work boots and back up again. When her gaze collided with his, she sucked in a breath and licked her lower lip.</p><p>Fuck. He was screwed. His brain was screaming at him to turn his ass around and take his chances with the sheriff instead. Assaulting the local authorities for getting on his last nerve would garner him less trouble than playing with the sizzling awareness arcing between him and the sexpot fire inspector.</p><p>\u201cHere he is,\u201d the deputy said unnecessarily, pointing at him.</p><p>Jared thrust out his hand and introduced himself. The moment his palm touched the bombshell\u2019s, his blood rushed south and gave him a semi. He looked at her left hand almost desperately, cursing the lack of a wedding ring. A simple gold band would\u2019ve killed his interest right then and there.</p><p>\u201cDarcy Michaels,\u201d she replied, in a voice pitched high enough to be this close to girlish. \u201cI\u2019m a fire inspector with the Lion\u2019s Bay Fire Department.\u201d</p><p>The pretty blond deputy at the front desk smiled at him with the same invitation she\u2019d given him when he first walked in. \u201cDarcy\u2019s the one who asked me to put out the information about the arsonist.\u201d</p><p>The blonde was the type of woman he preferred to fuck\u2014attractive enough to stir the most superficial interest and easy enough to want nothing more than a good time. Darcy Michaels was rousing something far deeper, igniting a hunger that was full-bodied and complex. The kind that overrode a man\u2019s better sense.</p><p>Giving himself a mental kick in the ass, Jared caught the inspector\u2019s elbow and steered her toward the exit. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d barely stepped outside when she said, \u201cYou got here quick, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>He considered her voice. It was a cross between Marilyn Monroe and Jennifer Tilly. If anyone had asked him that morning what he thought of girly voiced women, he\u2019d have said they annoyed the shit out of him. It was just his damn luck that Darcy Michaels was the exception. Every time she opened her mouth, his mind went straight into the gutter.</p><p>Harder, Jared. Deeper...</p><p>Christ. His teeth grit.</p><p>\u201cWe have to move quickly,\u201d he bit out, trying to regain his focus. \u201cIf he keeps to his pattern, he\u2019ll burn something else before the week is out. What have you got so far?\u201d</p><p>She gestured down the street to a brick-faced fire station. \u201cMy office is over there. Do you have a suspect in mind? You came because you recognized the MO, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s similar to a known arsonist, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re three weeks in with him. Where was he four weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she persisted, \u201cSo there are intervals between bursts? How long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty years. Give or take.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stumbled to a halt. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p><p>He scowled for a variety of reasons, one of which was that her arm had slipped free of his grasp when she\u2019d stopped abruptly. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he a recent parolee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEscapee,\u201d he corrected. \u201cSeventeen years ago. He torched a bathroom in the courthouse during an appellate hearing and escaped in the ensuing clusterfuck. Haven\u2019t seen hide nor hair of him since. But the supervisory deputy marshal in the Seattle office helped to apprehend Merkerson the first time, and she recognized the pattern.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s frown cleared. \u201cMerkerson. That\u2019s it! I\u2019ve been trying to place the MO. He was way before my time, but we studied him briefly in school. What the hell has he been up to all these years? How has he stayed under the radar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have been incarcerated under a false name or out of the country. Or he might have trained a junior asshat to follow in his nutjob footsteps. It doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re going to nail the bastard.\u201d Grabbing her elbow again, Jared urged her toward the fire station.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it doesn\u2019t matter. In just three weeks, he\u2019s torn this town apart.\u201d</p><p>He heard the fury underlying her words and made note of it. Personal involvement clouded judgment. One of the many reasons why spending time with her was a really bad idea. He was already feeling the effects. While his brain was working the case, his body was straining toward hers, wired and revved and hot to screw her raw.</p> <p>They were about to cross the street to the fire station when he urged her into a corner diner instead.</p><p>\u201cI missed lunch,\u201d he explained, hoping low blood sugar, not his hormones, was responsible for handicapping his common sense. He could fix the former.</p><p>\u201cI just ate. But I\u2019ll grab a shake.\u201d</p><p>Another mark in her favor, he thought. A woman who might not be counting every damn calorie she put in her mouth.</p><p>He nearly groaned as visions of other things she could do with her mouth swept through his testosterone-muddled mind. If he\u2019d needed any proof that he was working too hard and not playing enough, he had it now. He should take the blond deputy up on her offer and ease himself down a notch.</p><p>Reaching the counter, Jared grabbed a menu from beside the register and ran a quick glance over the limited offerings. It was a burger-and-fries joint, with a couple salads thrown in for the calorie-conscious.</p> <p>A waitress in a \u201950s uniform with \u201cGinny\u201d embroidered over her heart approached with her notepad and a smile. \u201cHey, Darcy. You brought the Fed with you. Bet Miller\u2019s in a snit. I know how he gets when outsiders come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know everything?\u201d Darcy looked genuinely impressed. \u201cI just found out that the Marshals Service was here not more than five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Ginny shrugged. \u201cPrime location for news. Welcome to Lion\u2019s Bay, Marshal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy,\u201d he corrected, his attention returning to the menu. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Darcy asked Ginny with the easy familiarity of old friends.</p><p>\u201cBetter. Just had a new security system installed this morning. It\u2019s supposed to sense heat and alert the alarm company. And I had our existing fire alarms rechecked a couple days ago to make sure everything is working properly.\u201d Ginny jerked a thumb over her shoulder at the bulky-looking chef visible through the kitchen pass-through. \u201cTim joked about retiring on the insurance if the place burned. He slept on the couch last night for that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell. Ginny, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared stepped into the conversation before she could say anything further. \u201cProactive, thoughtful steps, Ginny. Good job. If your burgers are half as good as your planning, I\u2019ll order a double.\u201d</p> <p>Ginny grinned at the praise. \u201cBig strapping man like you, absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends. Hot or sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne chipotle bacon BBQ double-cheeseburger and fries coming up. Everything on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And two of whatever kind of shake Inspector Michaels wants. All to go.\u201d</p><p>Jared paid the bill, waving off the five-spot Darcy pulled out of her pocket.</p><p>Closing the register, Ginny stepped away to make the shakes, leaving Darcy standing there with a grim expression. He gestured her over to a red vinyl booth by the window.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he began when she sat. \u201cHow often has Lion\u2019s Bay had cause for the Feds to come in?\u201d</p><p>One of her brows arched and she sized him up. The caveman in him beat his chest at the challenge. Damn it, he hadn\u2019t been this interested in a woman in a long, long time.</p><p>It was a good thing she had some fire to her. When he got her beneath him, he wasn\u2019t going to be gentle...</p><p>Fuck that. What the hell was he thinking? He was not going there.</p><p>\u201cJust once,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated just a second, but he caught it. \u201cA local woman was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made that interesting?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed and her eyes took on a hardness that startled him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t glare at me, Darcy. It\u2019s a valid question. The Feds have bigger fish to fry than a small-town murder. What caught their interest about this one?\u201d</p><p>She exhaled in a rush. \u201cThe MO was a match to a serial killer they were looking for.\u201d</p><p>From the moment Darcy had spotted Jared Cameron in the police station, she\u2019d known he was going to tear through her orderly life like a whirlwind.</p><p>His looks had knocked her back first. It had taken everything she had to keep her mouth from falling open when he\u2019d walked up to her epitomizing the description of tall, dark, and dangerous. Then, he\u2019d swept her right out the door, his touch sending tingles racing up her arm and through her body. Now she was sitting across from him, faced head-on with how seriously freakin\u2019 delicious he was. Her mother would call him a \u201ccool drink of water,\u201d but Darcy wouldn\u2019t. Every time their eyes met, her mouth went dry. Despite his purely professional discourse, the way he looked at her with those electric blue eyes was with raw animal hunger.</p><p>And damned if she didn\u2019t want him right back. It was a primal response she couldn\u2019t suppress. Socially, he was gruff and abrupt, so she was inclined to imagine him screwing her senseless without talking. Sweaty, grasping, grinding fucking. That\u2019s what he radiated with his agitated energy and fierce gaze, and she was sold. It had taken his force-of-nature energy to make her realize she\u2019d been dead for a while. A no-holds-barred one-night stand was just what she needed to knock the dust off.</p><p>\u201cWhich serial killer?\u201d he asked in that clipped rough voice that brought to mind golden whisky in a crystal tumbler. He brushed back a lock of inky black hair with a careless hand, and she couldn\u2019t help but notice the veins coursing along his powerful forearms and biceps. He was perfectly built to her tastes\u2014lean, ripped, and not the slightest bit bulky.</p><p>\u201cSome guy from the Midwest who carved Mayan symbols in his victims\u2019 torsos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Prophet.\u201d Jared leaned back in the booth, the casual pose doing little to soften him. \u201cCounting down to doomsday. Sick fuck.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cIs that your professional opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my professional opinion, he was a whack job. And so is this guy torching your town.\u201d</p><p>She almost smiled. Jared Cameron was a blunt object, no doubt about it, but it made her feel better knowing he was here. She couldn\u2019t fathom anyone getting anything over on him.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d His fingertips drummed on the table. \u201cYou can\u2019t carry around guilt and blame for these fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. The waitress tells you she\u2019s taking steps to protect her property and you start apologizing like it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s hackles rose. \u201cThis is a small town, Deputy. People around here aren\u2019t exactly rolling in the dough. She spent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name\u2019s Jared. Use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just full of charm, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want charm, and we\u2019re talking shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell would you know what I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want the same thing.\u201d He leaned forward and lowered his voice, his blue eyes burning like flame. \u201cI want it so badly my dick\u2019s been half hard since the moment I saw you.\u201d</p><p>Arousal swept through her like a sudden fever, flushing her skin. No man had ever talked to her so crudely, so there\u2019d never been a chance for her to learn it turned her on. Now she knew, and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019d be vocal in bed. Just thinking about him growling raunchy and obscene statements while screwing her made her ache with desire. She struggled not to squirm, but she couldn\u2019t resist goading him for more. \u201cAnd what is it we both want, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move a muscle for a moment. Then his lips curled on one side in a wickedly carnal smile. His eyes glittered with fierce, hard lust. \u201cYou want a sheet-clawing, back-arching, mind-blowing fuck, and I want to pound my cock into you until I\u2019ve come my last drop.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sagged into the seat back, her hand lifting to her throat. \u201cWhew.\u201d</p><p>Her pussy throbbed greedily, the tender folds slickening with her growing hunger. She\u2019d known the man less than twenty minutes, but she was suddenly quite committed to knowing him even better. Well, his body, at least...\u201cYou\u2019re on. My workday ends at six.\u201d</p><p>The deputy\u2019s nostrils flared. Anticipation sharpened the blades of his cheekbones and made the precisely drawn lines of his beautiful mouth harsh. She could say, in all honesty, that he was the most gorgeous man she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna regret this,\u201d he muttered, scowling at her.</p><p>Oddly, his reluctance about wanting her only spurred her desire to have him. It betrayed how intense his attraction to her was, so much so that he couldn\u2019t fight it even though he wanted to. And she responded as any red-blooded woman would to the ferocious sexual need of a deliciously handsome, potently masculine creature: she provoked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaning forward, she whispered, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll be seeing stars when I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Grimacing with discomfort, he arched his hips up from the seat and adjusted the fit of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cBack to the shoptalk,\u201d she said, inwardly smiling with female triumph and heated expectation. \u201cGinny spent money she likely doesn\u2019t have on safety precautions that won\u2019t do her a damn bit of good. You know how Merkerson works. If he goes after this diner, he\u2019ll do it in the bright light of day right under her nose.\u201d</p> <p>And later, after the diner closed and the streets were quiet, the devious little time bomb would explode and engulf the structure in flames within moments.</p><p>\u201cYou heard what she said,\u201d Jared argued, rallying. \u201cShe feels better. And whether or not the modifications she made were necessary in this particular instance, they were still smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to help make her feel safe, and clearly she wasn\u2019t feeling that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d His gaze bore into her. \u201cAnd people should sleep with their doors open because we have law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite the same thing.\u201d The residents had been horrified at the first fire but trusted her and Jim to deal with it. The second fire had made things a little shakier, but they\u2019d still been sure an arrest was imminent. By the third fire, people stopped thinking the authorities were just a step away from catching the arsonist and they started thinking about fending for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cGet over yourself, Darcy. Unless you totally fucked up the evidence collection and analysis, you\u2019ve done your job and you\u2019re continuing to do your job by sending for help when you need it. Pat yourself on the back and give props to the people who are thinking forward instead of backward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I like you or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like me. Let\u2019s keep this simple.\u201d</p><p>She nodded without hesitation. After all, she was willing to indulge herself with him precisely because he was just passing through. Anything more than sex was beyond her at this point in her life. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>He was on his feet before Ginny reached their table with a takeout bag of food and a cardboard drink carrier. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Inspector. We have a lot of work to get through between now and six o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>JARED SET THE take-out bag down on the desk in Darcy\u2019s office and swept the narrow room with an examining glance. As he dug out his foam box, he considered the logistics of nailing her on the six-foot-long folding table set beneath the window that looked into the firehouse\u2019s heavy apparatus bay. Unfortunately, its flimsiness wouldn\u2019t hold up to the abuse, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be professional, although a quickie would do a lot to restore his concentration. He didn\u2019t trust her desk, either, with its ultramodern glass top artfully balanced on a network of thin chrome bars.</p> <p>\u201cMiller\u2019s bark is worse than his bite, by the way.\u201d She reached around him for her shake, and he breathed her in, smelling warm clean woman.</p><p>The sheriff was in his mid-thirties and an obvious devotee to free weights, but he was no threat. Jared had spent six years with Delta Force before he\u2019d joined the U.S. Marshals Service\u2019s elite Special Operations Group. There wasn\u2019t a human alive he couldn\u2019t severely maim or kill.</p><p>\u201cMy partner will deal with Miller. Even if she feels like killing him, she\u2019ll restrain herself.\u201d He took a bite out of his burger before occupying one of the two chairs in front of her desk. Pausing midchew, he mumbled an awed, \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved around her straw. \u201cDamn good burger, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cInsanely.\u201d</p><p>It was nearly as good as she looked when she smiled. You\u2019ll be seeing stars when I\u2019m done with you. Fuck of it was, he was inclined to believe her. She was doing a number on him already without even trying. What would she do to him if she put some effort into it...?</p><p>She rounded the desk and pulled open the top drawer of the filing cabinet. His gaze moved from her to the wall of cantilevered glass and chrome bookshelves behind her. Either the city invested a lot in the comfort of their civil servants or she\u2019d spent her own dime dressing the space up. He was inclined to think that the utilitarian gray metal folding table and chairs were provided courtesy of the city. The run-of-the-mill filing cabinet, too. But the bookshelf unit and matching desk were all her\u2014strong, eye-catching, and sexy. And the indulgence suggested that she spent a lot of time working...or felt the most at home in her office.</p><p>His gaze caught on a silver-framed picture on a shelf behind her. It was a snapshot of her when she was younger, wearing a cheerleader uniform and standing with her arm thrown across the shoulders of a mirror image of herself dressed in a band costume.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a twin.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the drawer shut and returned to the desk, setting three manila folders on the glass. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if her sister was anything like her. Maybe Darcy was the naughty twin. The thought made his overeager dick harden all over again. The word \u201cnaughty\u201d thought of in conjunction with \u201cDarcy\u201d seemed to have that now-predictable effect on him.</p><p>\u201cShall we start with the first fire?\u201d she asked, moving right along.</p><p>He resumed eating and nodded, but found himself slightly irritated by her lack of elaboration, which was a stupid response. Keeping things simple meant keeping them impersonal. He should be glad she was on the same page.</p><p>Pulling the bottom file free, Darcy opened it and began to carefully spread out photographs on her desk. Aside from a quirky blown-glass pen holder and red metal toolbox, there was nothing cluttering the pristine surface.</p><p>Jared chewed on a perfectly crispy French fry and studied the crime scene photos. She began to explain what he was looking at.</p><p>\u201cThe fire began at approximately ten o\u2019clock in the evening. The owner locked up at eight. It started here,\u201d she pointed to the third picture, \u201cin the hallway outside the restrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a brick-faced building?\u201d he queried, noting the rubble.</p><p>\u201cYes. Florinda\u2019s Dance Studio took over the old firehouse after the town moved all the civil services into this one area and called it a town square.\u201d Darcy pulled another photo out of the file, this one a close-up framed with an L-square ruler, and set it in front of him. \u201cSee these curled aluminum shavings? They tested positive for traces of white phosphorous. It\u2019s likely that the incendiary device was hidden in a soda can dropped into a waste bin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think is interesting?\u201d Setting her palms on the desktop, she leaned forward. \u201cAn arsonist who picks a brick building. There are buildings in Lion\u2019s Bay that have been around for over a century. Good, old-fashioned wood-sided and shingled structures that would light up like a match, in areas where other buildings nearby would light up just as quickly.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been thinking along those same lines. \u201cAny possibility this is insurance fraud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the extra fires being a deflection? The incendiary device is too sophisticated for a dabbler. Our subject is a pro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStructure number two was an old animal shelter, built mostly from cement block.\u201d Darcy slid the photos from the first fire into a neat pile and put them away before grabbing the second folder. She set the new photos out with care. \u201cThis location is very out of the way, but there\u2019s a lot of vegetation. It might\u2019ve gotten ugly if we hadn\u2019t just had days of rain that saturated the area.\u201d</p><p>Jared dragged one of the photos closer. \u201cYou received the anonymous tip about this fire, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>After he examined the images, she put them away and showed him the most recent property casualty.</p><p>\u201cWhat was this place?\u201d He eyed the unidentifiable twisted shapes that lined the floor along the walls.</p><p>\u201cA candy shop. Those weird-looking things used to be the plastic bins the candy was kept in. The store shares a wall with a costume jewelry shop. The sophisticated fire alarm system ensured we responded quickly. The jewelry store sustained only minor damage.\u201d</p><p>Shutting the lid of his empty food container, Jared stood and moved to the map pinned to the wall. Three red arrow stickers marked spots. \u201cAre these where the fires took place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He heard her put the files away while he studied the seemingly random locations. Different parts of town, different types of businesses. He sucked down the rest of the best shake he\u2019d ever had, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s head to the dance studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three weeks. There\u2019s nothing left to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not evidence we\u2019re looking for.\u201d He met her gaze as she straightened. \u201cThe subject saw something in these targets that we\u2019re not. If we\u2019re going to get inside his head and anticipate his next moves, we need to figure out what\u2019s catching his attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve pored over everything until my eyes bled. I can\u2019t see anything but random chaos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fresh perspective never hurts.\u201d She\u2019s reluctant to go back, he realized, wondering why and hoping that seeing her at the location would give him a clue.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Jared turned toward the open doorway and the man who leaned casually into the frame there. His uniform of short-sleeve white dress shirt and navy slacks was the same as Darcy\u2019s, except for a few extra patches on the sleeves and some gold braiding.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jim.\u201d Darcy quickly introduced them.</p><p>Chief Fire Inspector James Ralston straightened and shook Jared\u2019s hand, taking his measure with a sweeping glance. \u201cI just heard that Darcy called in the cavalry. Hope you can help us nail this bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take over?\u201d Darcy asked. \u201cDeputy Cameron wants to check out the studio. You\u2019ll be more help to him than I\u2019ll be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Ralston\u2019s eyes softened when he looked at Darcy. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t go anyway. The mayor has me reinspecting all the public buildings as part of a planned overhaul of the alarm systems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPanic\u2019s spreading,\u201d she muttered, pulling a set of keys out of her pocket. \u201cDon\u2019t let them keep you out all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, but I may be late. Let yourself in if I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cThank you.

See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The man left, but Jared\u2019s jaw didn\u2019t relax even then. \u201cHe\u2019s a little old for you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>Darcy paused in the act of rounding her desk. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s what? Forty? Forty-five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this.\u201d She walked right past him.</p><p>Damn it, when she got stern in that voice of hers, it made him hot. He\u2019d just reached the point of being too occupied by his work to pay attention to her sex appeal, then Jim Ralston had fucked it all to hell by showing up and starting a territory war.</p><p>Jared followed. \u201cHow long has it been over between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor you, maybe. Not for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way off base.\u201d She strode right out of the open bay door and into the parking lot, making a beeline for a city-owned pickup truck with emblems on the door and a light bar on the roof. \u201cHe was there for me during a rough time in my life. It was never serious and it\u2019s been over for nearly two years\u2014not that it\u2019s any of your damn business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it isn\u2019t,\u201d he shot back, rounding the front end and yanking open the passenger door. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to be a problem, I have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a problem. Drop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bit about you letting yourself into his place was like a dog lifting his leg.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze through the window. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any right to my personal history. You don\u2019t have any rights at all where I\u2019m concerned. You\u2019re a possible good time and that\u2019s it. And even that\u2019s debatable at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it, now?\u201d He glanced at his watch, then slid into the truck and slammed the door shut. It was four thirty. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter three</p> <p>Darcy got behind the wheel and slid the key in the ignition, her thoughts roiling. Backing down from Jared Cameron wasn\u2019t an option. At the tiniest show of weakness, he would steamroll right over her. And the alternative\u2014keeping him at a distance\u2014wasn\u2019t an option she considered for more than a second. She wanted him. Badly. Almost desperately, if she was being honest. So, as overbearing and aggravating as he was, she was inclined to put up with his social Asperger\u2019s if that\u2019s what it took to have him in her bed.</p><p>They drove to what was left of Florinda\u2019s Dance Studio in silence. Jared\u2019s gaze slid back and forth over the city, taking everything in. There was a story behind his precise focus, something that explained the edge to him that set him apart from other law enforcement officers she\u2019d met. He was hyperaware and highly perceptive. He moved like a predator, with an economy of movement and lightness of stride. And he never let his guard down.</p><p>A man hunter. That\u2019s what he was. Someone had spent a lot of money training him to be dangerous. The military, she guessed.</p><p>She parked on the street in front of the studio and got out. There were already bulldozers on the lot and giant Dumpsters to collect the rubble. Her stomach clenched tight with grief and sadness so thick it was hard for her to swallow past it.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she joined Jared at the curb. He turned slowly, examining the surrounding neighborhood.</p><p>Darcy steeled her resolve and moved forward into the roofless ruins, trying to picture the place as it had once been. She was sorry it had been so long since she\u2019d last visited. Her memories were cobwebbed from childhood. There were only faint echoes of bygone times when she and Danielle had playfully competed against one another and shared ballerina dreams.</p><p>\u201cAdults or children?\u201d Jared asked, breaking into her reverie.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She looked at him.</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cAre you okay? You don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out. You look\u201d\u2014he frowned\u2014\u201csad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth adults and children,\u201d she answered, skipping over the too-close-to-home comment. She was recovering her composure by the moment. Thanks to him, and the aura of strength and security that surrounded him. \u201cAnd all styles, from ballet to hip-hop to ballroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a student.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>She took a deep breath, knowing it would be useless to deflect him. Nothing slipped by him. \u201cA long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. His hands went to his hips as he looked over what was left. \u201cConsidering the size of the town, how large were the classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive to fifteen students. The owners used to be professional dancers. People came from all over the country to study with them.\u201d She pointed at the quaint motel across the street. \u201cThey had arrangements for out-of-towners with the Daniels family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to dig into those former students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff Miller has been working on that.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cMorales is on it, then.\u201d</p><p>At her questioning glance, he filled in, \u201cMy partner.\u201d</p><p>She watched him walk the perimeter of the crumbling brick walls, his cool cop\u2019s eyes taking in everything. Her chest tightened as her past combined with her present, but she put it aside and answered his questions.</p><p>Nearly an hour later, he glanced at his watch and pointed out, \u201cIt\u2019s quarter to six.\u201d</p><p>There was a wealth of promise in those words and the heat in his eyes.</p><p>Darcy nodded. He would dull the pain, at least for a little while. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>THEY MADE A quick stop at Darcy\u2019s office, where she grabbed the files Jared had perused earlier and swapped out her work truck for a convertible BMW that was incongruous in a town filled with pickups and modest compacts.</p><p>She glanced at him, showing no doubts or trepidation. \u201cYour place or mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner first?\u201d he asked, because he wasn\u2019t a completely one-track-minded Neanderthal. Okay...he was. But he didn\u2019t want this go-round with her to be his last. If he was going to ignore his better sense, he might as well do it all the way.</p><p>\u201cDinner later.\u201d</p><p>Fuck yeah. \u201cYour place, then. Mine is a motel with paper-thin walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She backed up with speedy precision, and the sleek sports car purred out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cDrugstore.\u201d He met her gaze when she glanced at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t come prepared for this.\u201d</p><p>She got to the store quick but declined to go in with him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all over town in a half hour anyway, but I\u2019d rather not encourage the spread if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>Once he got inside the store, he realized quickly that she hadn\u2019t been kidding. The woman at the register eyed his purchases with an avid gaze and smiled at him with a delight that rankled. If he\u2019d been any less impatient, he would have had Darcy drive him to the next town to buy condoms. As it was, he made it in and out of the store in less than ten minutes, dropping the bag on the floorboard between his feet when he slid back into the passenger seat. Darcy was turning back onto the street before he got his seat belt on.</p><p>Jared leaned his head back against the headrest and closed his eyes, relishing the slow simmer in his blood. He hadn\u2019t been this eager to get into a woman\u2019s pants in a very, very long time. He was also inordinately curious about Darcy\u2019s home and what it would reveal about her. \u201cHow long have you lived in Lion\u2019s Bay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy whole life, except for a brief stint around college.\u201d</p><p>There was something in her voice that made him open his eyes and look at her. She\u2019d released her ponytail from the elastic band, freeing the chocolate strands to whip around in the evening air. Her head was tilted in a way that could be described only as deeply sensual. She sought the feel of the wind rushing over her skin and through her hair as she would a lover\u2019s caresses.</p><p>He took a deep, slow breath. Darcy was clearly a tactile woman who wanted to be touched. And he was going to touch every inch of her, inside and out.</p><p>They pulled up to a small, dated, one-story ranch-style home. It was so diametrically opposed to what he would have pictured her gravitating to that he thought they\u2019d made another pit stop at first. Then she pulled into the carport on the side of the house.</p><p>He frowned. She was modern, sexy, and fierce. He\u2019d gotten that impression from the way she decorated her office and from the car she drove. But the house she lived in was retro and uninspired. There was a story there. He\u2019d dig it out.</p><p>He followed her to the back door with a deliberately moderated stride, stretching out the last moments of delicious anticipation. There was nothing in the world like the buildup to a mind-blowing orgasm, and there was no doubt that he was minutes away from having the first of many tonight.</p><p>Darcy preceded him up the utilitarian cement walkway to a matching set of three steps and a small porch. She was through the door before he reached the tiny staircase. He climbed slowly, his cock getting harder with every step he took.</p><p>When he reached the threshold of the open door, he paused. Took another deep breath. Let it out. He absorbed the fact that somewhere over the course of a few short hours, fucking the sexy fire inspector had become damn near necessary to his sanity.</p><p>On an intellectual level, he understood the pull between them. He\u2019d spent most of his life studying human behavior and pinpointing how best to hunt and kill men. He was well aware that they were all animals at their core, creatures of instinct and hormonal impetuses. He and Darcy had an explosive attraction at that base level, and neither of them was inclined to fight it. But that didn\u2019t mean he was taking it gracefully. He needed control and unadulterated reason, and Darcy was fucking with both of those. He was hanging on by a thread, and knowing that it was going to snap at any second had him edgy and frustrated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stepped into view, unabashedly undressing in the living room. Only the kitchen stood between him and her, the pathway delineated by the preparation/cooking area to his left and an older, sturdily built wood table to his right.</p><p>Her shirt was already off and her arms were reaching behind her, unclasping a sensible bra that was notable only for its color\u2014black\u2014and the saucy red bow that nestled between her small breasts. \u201cAre you going to stand out there all night, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>She was running in overdrive. Christ. Not that he minded, but...</p><p>Actually, he did mind. He was too wound up to just fuck her into a good time and get shown the door. He wanted his fill, needed it, so he could get his damn brain out of his pants and back in the game.</p><p>His T-shirt was already clearing his head when he crossed into the house and kicked the back door closed. He threw the dead bolt and turned back to her, tossing the condoms on the dining table before dealing with his holster, badge, and belt.</p><p>Darcy continued to strip while he did, her movements rushed and without artifice yet still sexy as hell. Those heavy-lidded eyes...the flushed cheeks...the glistening parted lips...</p><p>Everything about her screamed \u201csex\u201d to him. He almost tripped in the process of toeing out of his boots, and forced himself to stand still while he tore open the button fly of his jeans. The freeing of his engorged cock was such a relief he groaned, a sound he repeated with more vehemence when she kicked off her panties and set her hands on her hips. Waiting. Naked. Ready.</p><p>He grabbed one of the two boxes of condoms and ripped it open, snagging a string of foil-wrapped packages in grasping fingers. Prowling forward, Jared separated one square and caught the rest between his teeth, deftly suiting up as he closed the distance between them.</p><p>Wide-eyed, she backed away. Her chest heaved with panting breaths; her tongue darted out to wet dry lips. He pursued her to the couch, watching as the backs of her legs hit the edge of the cushions and she sprawled into them.</p><p>He shoved the coffee table aside with a push of his foot, his focus solely on her and the feminine hunger that poured off her in waves of near-tangible heat. She stared at his dick with an avarice that made his balls tighten. His jaw unclenched on a deep inhale, releasing the condoms to fall to the floor.</p><p>Crowding her into the corner, Jared caught the back of the sofa with his left hand and cupped her pussy with his right, looming over her.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she gasped in that little girl voice that drove him crazy.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he growled, his fingertips gliding through silky moisture. \u201cYou\u2019re wet and hot. Primed for fucking.\u201d</p><p>Her neck arched back as he parted the lips of her cunt and massaged her clit. \u201cYes. Do it.\u201d</p><p>Bending his head, he caught her upraised lips before he thought about it. Kissing wasn\u2019t an act he much cared for himself. Or so he\u2019d thought. But then his mind had shut off at some point between the unhooking of her bra and the removal of her panties. He was eating at her mouth as if he could sate his hunger that way, devouring her, delving into the silken recesses with a greed he couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>Her low moan only goaded his ferocious need. He sucked on her tongue as she licked into his mouth, sliding the circle of his lips up and down the slender protrusion, relishing the way she shivered and slickened the hand massaging her pussy.</p><p>With eyes half lidded with desire, Jared lifted his head and watched her as he pushed two fingers into her, watched the way her swollen lips parted on a gasp. He penetrated her slowly, deliberately, holding her gaze with his so that he owned her pleasure. He took her to the knuckles, then withdrew, biting his lower lip at how tight and plush she felt. How slick and hot.</p><p>\u201cUmm,\u201d he purred, his dick aching with the need to be where his fingers were. \u201cOpen your legs wide, Darcy. Let me get to you.\u201d</p><p>Her lithe thighs spread gracefully, her heels lifting to the couch and her knees falling open. Presented with a beautifully pink and depilated pussy, Jared felt his tenuous control slipping by the moment. He pumped his fingers deep and fast, over and over, fucking her pretty juicy cunt until she was grinding her hips into his hand and making sexy little noises. She cupped her tits in a kneading grip, her fingers tugging at the hard little nipples, her breath escaping her arched throat in mewling pants.</p><p>All the while he hovered over her mouth, teasing her with tantalizing flicks of his tongue, staying just far enough out of reach that she couldn\u2019t have the deep French kiss they both craved. It would be too much, he\u2019d lose his mind and his restraint, and he needed her to come first. Needed to ease the desperate tightness of her pussy. Because once he got into her, all bets were off.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gasped, her slim torso glistening with perspiration. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to come...Oh, God...\u201d</p><p>Darcy fell into climax with a violent full-body shudder, her cunt clutching at his working fingers with a strength that nearly set him off. He dropped to his knees, his mouth replacing his hand, his tongue spearing through her tender convulsing tissues. He consumed her like a man possessed, burying his face in her silky wet core, tonguing her cunt until she came again. And again. Her short nails clawing at the sofa as she cried out words he couldn\u2019t hear over the rushing of blood in his ears. He couldn\u2019t get enough. Needed more of her taste, her pleasure, her surrender.</p> <p>Her damp palm pressed to his sweat-slick forehead, pushing him away. \u201cJared...Jesus...I\u2019m going to pass out before you get inside me.\u201d</p><p>Fuck that. He\u2019d eat more of her pussy later, when she was too wiped out to argue and his dick wasn\u2019t throbbing like a son of a bitch. Damned if she\u2019d check out before he got his cock in her.</p><p>Wiping his mouth on her inner thigh, Jared rose and caught the back of her leg over his arm. He pulled it high and wide, opening her completely.</p><p>She grasped him in both hands, making him wince as the pleasure of her touch threatened to send him over the edge. Her gaze stayed with his as she positioned him at her opening, sliding the crown around in her wetness before notching him into her tiny slit.</p><p>\u201cGod, Darcy. This is gonna be so fucking good.\u201d</p><p>The weight of his body was the force behind his entry. As his cock sank into her cushioning pussy, his breath hissed out in agonized pleasure. He\u2019d never been so hard or his body so tense.</p><p>Whimpering, she writhed beneath him. \u201cJared.\u201d</p><p>The way she said his name, in that breathless girly voice, did him in. He dug his feet into the floor and he drove deep, spearing into her with a mindless thrust. Her back bowed, crushing her small breasts into his chest. The feel of her pressed against him was like a punch to the gut. His abdomen clenched, his blood raged, and his adrenaline spiked. Her cunt quivered around him, massaging his tormented dick, stealing any possibility that he might\u2019ve reined himself in.</p><p>He groaned, his hips churning against hers. \u201cYou feel amazing...so damn tight and plush...\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s teeth sank into his shoulder, her hands clutching at his waist. The bite of pain was perfect, enough to jolt him out of the haze of near-painful pleasure and goad him into moving.</p><p>Shoving his arms beneath her, Jared caught her to him, crushing her against him from shoulder to hip. With her pelvis tilted up to cradle him and her body completely restrained by the bands of his arms, he possessed her completely. He gave a tentative thrust, withdrawing partway, then shoving back inside her.</p><p>She released his shoulder, her head falling back to once again arch over the armrest. She moaned. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night,\u201d he promised darkly, taking her with another fierce stroke, watching the need flare higher in the depths of her jade green eyes. \u201cYou won\u2019t remember what it felt like to go without my cock inside you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s cunt clenched around him and he broke. Rearing back, he lunged hard and deep. His tempo increased, faster and faster, until he was riding her relentlessly. Pounding into her. Nailing her to the couch with powerful drives of his hips.</p><p>In a distant part of his mind, he knew he was taking her too roughly, working her snug pussy too hard, but she was taking everything he had to give her and demanding more.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she gasped, throwing her hips at him. \u201cDeeper. Ah...you\u2019re so big. It\u2019s so good...\u201d</p><p>It was beyond good. She was killing him with her enthusiasm\u2014the raking of her nails across his back, her heels in the backs of his thighs spurring him on, her silky tissues rippling up and down his aching cock. And her voice, which rivaled the rhythmic slap of his heavy balls against her damp flesh as the most erotic thing he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy,\u201d he growled, unable to stop fucking her, needing to get deeper inside her. He was bottoming out with every plunge, filling every inch of her, his eyes rolling back because she was deliciously tight and scorching hot. The softly feminine smell of her skin was going to his head, intoxicating him, making him dizzy. Just when he thought he might blow it and go off without her, she began to tense.</p><p>\u201cOooh.\u201d She shivered violently. \u201cI\u2019m going to come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d Jared bit down on her shoulder, relishing the way she jerked and tightened around him in response. He grunted as she pulsed in tiny spasms. \u201cJust like that...Milk my cock. Ah, hell...\u201d</p><p>She climaxed with a cry, the delicate tissues that hugged him tightening into a velvet fist before convulsing in the milking grip he\u2019d demanded of her. Pinning her shoulders, he held her immobile and jackhammered through her orgasm, his own spiraling like molten metal down his spine and pooling in his balls.</p><p>His head fell back on a serrated groan, his body bowing as her pleasure fueled his, enflaming him. Cum spurted from the tip of his cock with a ferocity that rocked him, stinging his eyes and tightening his throat. His straining muscles burned and quaked, his entire body rigid as he emptied himself into the condom.</p><p>He might have lost his sanity in that mind-blowing moment if not for Darcy. She was right there with him, meeting him stroke for stroke.</p><p>Chapter four</p><p>Despite the sweat that ran in rivulets down her overheated body, Darcy missed Jared\u2019s weight and the feeling of him inside her the moment he rolled away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He collapsed on the seat beside her, his chest heaving with deep, gulping breaths. His eyes were closed, his head pressed into the sofa.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI can\u2019t feel my legs.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, telling herself that rapid separation and focus on pleasure was the way to go. Keep it simple. They were just screwing. And since it was phenomenal, she couldn\u2019t complain.</p><p>His lips brushed over her shoulder. \u201cI was rough and you allowed it. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Soothed by the gesture and sentiment, she kept her eyes closed and smiled.</p><p>He shifted. His mouth sealed over hers without warning, stealing her breath. Frozen for a moment, it took a few soft licks of his tongue to kick-start her brain. When she opened to him, he kissed her with a gentleness very much at odds with the impatience with which he\u2019d taken her body. His hand cupped the back of her neck, his fingers pushing into the sweat-dampened roots and holding her just where he wanted her.</p><p>The stroke of his tongue along hers was soft and slow, the press of his lips firm but not hard. It was a lush, hot, wet melding that curled her toes.</p><p>When they parted, they were both breathing hard. Their gazes met. A long, somewhat awkward moment passed.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI need to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a bag of Epsom salts, in case you\u2019d like to soak.\u201d Jared pushed to his feet. \u201cBathroom?\u201d</p><p>Startled by his thoughtfulness, she managed to point down the hall. \u201cLeft side.\u201d</p><p>He set off, presenting her with a view of a really gorgeous ass. Her gaze was riveted to its rhythmic clenching as he walked away, her heartbeat elevated by the realization that she\u2019d pushed such a gloriously masculine creature to his limits.</p><p>Taking a moment to collect herself, Darcy stood and moved into the kitchen, realizing as she went that Jared had known the state of her body before she did\u2014she was slightly sore. Breaking a year-long abstinence with a hard, pounding fuck with a well-hung man would do that to a woman, she supposed.</p><p>She was just digging through the shopping bag for the salts when she heard the rush of bathtub water surging through the house\u2019s old pipes. He had purchased men\u2019s combo hair/body wash and razors, too, which gave her an odd flutter of delight\u2014he\u2019d planned on staying from the get-go. She wasn\u2019t going to read anything into it, but it was nice to know he hadn\u2019t planned on yanking his pants back up as quickly as he\u2019d dropped them.</p><p>When she joined him, Darcy found the bathroom door open and her new lover leaning over the triangular-shaped tub, testing the temperature of the water. He glanced at her as she filled the doorway.</p><p>\u201cNow, this room,\u201d he said, \u201cfits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the bathroom redesigned after my parents moved out.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hired a contractor to gut the closet in the adjacent den to expand the home\u2019s one bathroom into something she could live with. The room was still small, but it now accommodated a separate bath and shower, instead of the combo tub with showerhead that had been there before. The caf\u00e9 au lait walls and tile, paired with accents of eggplant, gave the room a warm modern elegance she found soothing.</p><p>Jared held his hand out for the Epsom salts.</p><p>An odd tenseness spread through her tummy. \u201cYou came prepared. I take it riding a woman hard is par for the course with you?\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his extended fingers curling into a fist. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d</p><p>She stepped closer and handed him the bag. She hoped his answer meant she got to him in a unique way, especially considering how he so easily devastated her.</p> <p>Looking almost...chagrined, Jared dumped a heaping handful of salt under the running water. \u201cI have a sister with no concept of TMI,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cYou might know what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe said salt baths worked wonders after overenthusiastic nights. It seemed like a good idea to grab some, considering where things were heading.\u201d He gestured her over. \u201cIs this too hot?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. With a grateful, slightly bemused smile, Darcy stepped into the small corner tub and sighed her delight. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Turning off the water, he stood. He grabbed his toiletries and moved over to the floating glass shower stall. She relaxed into the neck pillow she kept on the ledge and watched as he stepped beneath the oversized showerhead. He was tall, but the flexible arm adjusted for that, and soon enough he was putting on a show she would have paid top-dollar for.</p><p>Completely oblivious to her avid perusal, he soaped his hair and chest, his hands roaming over his gorgeously ripped body with brisk efficiency. The scent of his soap filled the air and she swallowed hard, her mouth watering. A flush swept over her skin that had more to do with her new lover than it did with the heat of the bathwater. Jared Cameron was her darkest sexual fantasies in the flesh, his thick biceps flexing as he moved, his abdomen and pectorals clenching as his arms lifted to scrub at his hair. Soapy water sluiced down his tanned skin, making her pussy clench in renewed hunger.</p><p>When he turned his attention to washing his genitals, stroking his long thick penis in one hand and rolling his scrotum with the other, Darcy couldn\u2019t ignore the pulsing between her legs any longer.</p><p>Laying one leg on the lip of the tub, she cupped her slick pussy and massaged the tender knot of her clitoris. The fingers of her other hand caught a nipple in their grip, rolling and tugging the aching point, sending shards of delight straight to her womb. She made a soft noise of need and his head lifted abruptly, catching her in the act of pleasuring herself.</p><p>She bit her lower lip in a deliberately provocative come-on, feeling sexy and naughty as his desire rose in response to hers. His cock thickened in his hand and she arched her back, remembering how the hard length felt moving inside her.</p><p>His resultant scowl wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected. Neither was the haste with which he finished rinsing off and vacated the shower. As he strode out of the bathroom with her towel wrapped around his lean hips, she wondered if she\u2019d crossed a line.</p><p>Deflated and embarrassed, her hands fell away from her body. She sank her head beneath the water, submerging herself as long as her lungs would allow.</p><p>When she came up for air, Jared was there. Standing by the tub with his arms crossed and a new condom rolled over his raging erection. She quickly swiped the water off her face with her hands, blinking up at him.</p><p>He uncoiled, stepping into the tub before she knew he intended to. Catching her beneath the arms, he hauled her up and set her ass atop her neck pillow on the wide ceramic edge.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to wait,\u201d he muttered, kneeling in the water and spreading her legs. \u201cAt least until after dinner.\u201d</p><p>He dove for her pussy, his mouth latching on to her tender core and tonguing her cleft. He pushed inside her and she gasped, her hips arching. His tongue slid in and out, licking quick and shallow, luring her slickness until she heard how wet she was. He groaned and tilted his head, thrusting deeper into her, drinking her in as if he couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>When she started to tremble, hovering on the edge of orgasm, he wiped his mouth on her inner thigh and stood. Darcy shivered at the look he shot her, the edgy hunger that seemed little appeased by their animal screwing on the couch.</p><p>He caught himself in hand and gently nudged her. A rough sound escaped him. \u201cFuck, I wanted to wait,\u201d he said again, with more vehemence. \u201cYou\u2019re swollen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it if you hit all my hot buttons.\u201d She gripped his hips to stabilize her perch. \u201cYou looked so damn hot in the shower. Turned me on watching you stroke yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were looking at my dick like you\u2019d die if I didn\u2019t give it to you. I almost blew my load in the shower.\u201d He began a slow slide into her, exerting minimal pressure to ease past tender tissues. \u201cAfter what you did to me on the couch, I shouldn\u2019t have anything left to blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have loved to watch,\u201d she said, breathless with lust. Every inch he pushed into her stole another piece of her sanity; every coarse word he spoke ratcheted up her need.</p><p>Cupping her cheek in one hand and her hip in the other, he shook his head, nudging deeper. His thumb pushed into her mouth. \u201cI want this mouth first.\u201d</p><p>She drew on the callused pad, rubbing her tongue over it, watching his eyes darken.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll suck my dick just like that,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019ll have you on your knees, deep-throating my cock. After this, it\u2019ll take me longer to come. I\u2019ll be fucking your mouth for a good, long while. I\u2019ll make it last because it\u2019s going to feel so damn good. Everything about you makes me feel good.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his thumb free and lowered his head to kiss her, his tongue thrusting into the warm recess in imitation of the act he spoke of. With his lips whispering over hers and his hand at her throat, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll swallow every drop of my cum, sucking it from the tip of my dick until I\u2019ve got nothing left to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d she breathed, wanting him in her mouth now. Wanting to see the pleasure sweep across his face as she took him to orgasm.</p><p>With a roll of his hips, he sank into her to the root. His groan hardened her nipples. \u201cYou\u2019re even tighter than before and your cunt was perfect then.\u201d</p><p>Tilting her head back, Darcy\u2019s lips and teeth followed the sharp line of his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re thicker than before and your cock was big then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause now I know how good it\u2019s going to feel when I go off.\u201d He leaned his head back to invite her attention to his throat. \u201cHow good it feels when you lose it and squeeze me like a fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me come so hard,\u201d she whispered by his ear, licking delicately into it and smiling when he shuddered. She deliberately tightened her pussy around him.</p><p>Jared cursed and withdrew, then slid balls deep in a measured glide. \u201cPlay all you want, sweetheart, but you\u2019re not rushing me.\u201d</p><p>Gripping his taut ass in her hands, she squeezed and held him close so she could grind into him. She nearly came from the fleeting pressure of his pelvis against her clitoris, her sex spasming greedily around his erection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d He groaned, reaching behind him to grab her hands and pull them away. He crowded her, forcing her to lean back. Then he pinned her hands to the tile with his own and gave her a breathlessly perfect stroke with a practiced swing of his hips. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to quit until I\u2019m an idiot over you. A pussy-whipped, salivating piece of shit who can\u2019t think about anything but nailing you everywhere and every way he can, no matter how often he has you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s head fell back with a mewl as he began to shaft her aching pussy with smooth measured thrusts. She couldn\u2019t speak for the pleasure, the fit of his thick, long cock so perfect it filled every centimeter of her. Eyes closed, she absorbed the rhythmic impact of his hips into hers and the arousing smack of his heavy balls against the wet curve of her buttocks. The push and pull of his erection was an erotic massage over her hypersensitive flesh, the wide crest rubbing over a spot that made her shake uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cI could do this all day,\u201d he growled. \u201cAll night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, Jared. Don\u2019t. Stop.\u201d</p><p>His tongue flickered over her nipple and she nearly climaxed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d His breath blew hot over her damp skin. \u201cWe\u2019re doing that later. I\u2019m going to slide my dick into you, then suck on your nipples until your hungry little cunt milks me dry.\u201d</p><p>His lips surrounded the tip of her breast. He suckled her with drawing pulls that were perfectly timed with his plunges between her legs. His tongue lashed at the hardened nipple, flickering over it in a way that sent pulses of heated delight racing across her nerve endings. She heard herself whimpering, her body moving separately from her mind, her hips rocking to meet his and hold the incredible fullness of him deep inside her.</p><p>Jared released her wrists, his hands moving to cradle her spine and mold her body to his. It was the singularly most carnal experience of her life. And the most intimate.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, suspended in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m coming...\u201d</p><p>The orgasm swept through her like a gentle wave, lapping at her senses, gaining strength until she quivered uncontrollably. All the while he continued the leisurely thrusting of his rigid penis, swelling with his own imminent release, spurring her to climax again.</p><p>Wrung out and on an emotional precipice she hadn\u2019t expected, Darcy gave herself over to him. Let him pleasure her until she was certain she couldn\u2019t take any more, until her legs hung limply in the cold water and her nipples throbbed.</p><p>Only then did he let go, holding her torso against his scorching-hot skin, his chest heaving as he jerked violently and came endlessly.</p><p>Chapter five</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve actually made some good headway with the student list from the dance studio.\u201d Trish\u2019s voice came clearly through Jared\u2019s cell phone speaker, accompanied by the rustle of papers in the background. \u201cThey\u2019ve already confirmed alibis for most of the repeat students going back one year. Miller is territorial, but he\u2019s got good instincts.\u201d</p> <p>Jared slid the phone aside to make room for a cutting board on the kitchen counter. \u201cMy concern is whether or not the town\u2019s residents are a blind spot in his investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working him around to thinking more along those lines. At least considering them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lets you get a word in edgewise? You\u2019re a miracle worker.\u201d He deseeded a bell pepper, then chopped it quickly into small squares.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Trish said. \u201cHis only experience with federal law enforcement wasn\u2019t a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that.\u201d He worked on an onion next. \u201cI\u2019d like the name and contact information of whoever was the primary on that case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to thank him or her for making our job so much easier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me ideas.\u201d Using the knife, he scraped half the vegetables into a heated skillet. \u201cIt might be worth it to see if anyone in Lion\u2019s Bay rubbed the Feds the wrong way. Aside from Sheriff Congeniality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time are you coming into the station tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot sure. I want to check out the other two locations in the morning. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want Miller to be out and miss you.\u201d</p><p>Gripping the handle of the skillet, he jerked the pan to flip the sizzling vegetables. \u201cI\u2019ve requested courier manifests going back six months. While it\u2019d be stupidly obvious to ship hazardous materials in and leave that trail\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the ones who overlook the obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m hanging up now. Call if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner. I\u2019m hungry. Good night.\u201d Jared tapped the disconnect button on his phone and turned his attention to cracking eggs to finish up the omelets.</p><p>As he moved, he mentally cataloged the state of his body. His damned legs were jellied and there was an odd knotting in his gut that he told himself was hunger. He was having trouble staying focused, his thoughts drifting to the woman presently soaking in a fresh Epsom bath.</p><p>The sexpot fire inspector had fried his brain. A wild lay was not supposed to make a man feel strange. It was supposed to relieve stress, provide a workout, and clear a man\u2019s head. Instead, he didn\u2019t even hear Darcy enter the room until she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re cooking,\u201d she said, \u201csmells delicious.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, cursing inwardly for being caught unawares. \u201cOmelets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d She maneuvered around him and opened a cupboard to pull out plates. Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, her composure irritated him. He\u2019d tugged his pants back on because they were about to eat, but he\u2019d left the fly partially open, exposing the waistband of his boxer briefs. He was shirtless and barefoot, comfortable and relaxed, while she looked like she was ready to leave the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, scrambling the yolk with enough vehemence to make it frothy.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got dressed.\u201d And her hair was damp and slicked back into a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was supposed to eat naked. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He unclenched his jaw. \u201cYou could have put on a robe.\u201d</p><p>Setting the plates on the dining table, Darcy returned to the kitchen. \u201cI didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d She exhaled harshly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m assuming anything or taking anything for granted. You made it very clear that things need to be simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo assumptions, but you assume I\u2019ll get antsy if you follow the evidence that says I prepared to spend the night.\u201d He poured the eggs into the pan with the veggies, then added the ham he\u2019d chopped before he called Trish. \u201cUnless what you\u2019re not saying is that you\u2019re ready for me to go.\u201d</p><p>She straightened and approached him. \u201cSex doesn\u2019t improve your humor, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because I\u2019m not done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d She pulled silverware out of a drawer. \u201cThat\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Jared heard her moving the plastic shopping bag off the table. From the sounds of it, she was looking inside, perhaps noticing the toothbrush, antiperspirant, and razor sitting next to the two boxes of condoms. As far as he was concerned that wasn\u2019t optimistic, that was practical. He flipped the omelet with a deft flick of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had a camera,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look sexy as hell doing that.\u201d</p><p>She looked sexy as hell when he was doing her, all soft and warm and flushed. The memory of her in the bathtub was going to haunt him for a while.</p><p>He jerked his chin toward the table. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Darcy exhaled in a rush. \u201cI wanted to put a robe on. Just so you know, I originally thought about ordering something in, answering any questions you might have about the case, and maybe watching TV if it wasn\u2019t too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve gone with your instincts.\u201d He tossed some shredded cheese into the omelet, then slid it onto her plate in a practiced fold. \u201cDig in. Don\u2019t wait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis looks as awesome as it smells. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Returning to the stove, he started cooking for himself.</p><p>She moaned, making his dick twitch with interest. \u201cJared. Wow. This is phenomenal. You\u2019re as good in the kitchen as you are in bed.\u201d</p><p>He watched her lift a second bite to her mouth, her eyes closing as she chewed and hummed her pleasure.</p><p>Swallowing, she went on. \u201cNot that we\u2019ve made it to the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou know, I should get some credit for being concerned about scaring you off. I\u2019m giving you credit for being offended at the possibility of a brush-off.\u201d</p><p>Jared stared into the skillet. Simple would be taking the out she\u2019d offered him and heading back to the motel to sleep in a solitary bed. Simple would be keeping his eye on the job he was here to do and his hands off the smoking-hot inspector who flooded his system with so much testosterone he couldn\u2019t think straight.</p><p>Rubbing the back of his neck, he said gruffly, \u201cKeeping things simple means not making things complicated. You\u2019re overthinking.\u201d</p><p>Of course, he was hardly thinking at all. He was running on pure animal instinct when it came to her.</p><p>Darcy laughed softly. \u201cYou can\u2019t put this on me. I know how men work when they start off with the warning to keep it simple. That means don\u2019t get clingy. Don\u2019t expect me to be there for you when we\u2019re not fucking. I get that, and it works for me. That said, I know all men have hot buttons, but I don\u2019t know what yours are.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. As far as he was concerned, everything about her was a hot button. And this conversation had veered into a direction certain to drive him crazier than she did.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d She set her fork down. \u201cThings that freak you into thinking the situation is becoming more involved than you want it to be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slid his own omelet onto his plate, returned the pan to the stove, and joined her at the table. Too late for the freak-out warning. It had been going off since he\u2019d drilled her into the sofa. He had no control with her. No cutoff switch or throttle.</p><p>Darcy leaned forward. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me that a woman assuming a sleepover when you\u2019re in a wham-bam frame of mind doesn\u2019t make things dicey.\u201d</p><p>Shoving a bite of his food into his mouth, he chewed through his frustration. He didn\u2019t want to analyze this...them. He\u2019d rather stick with orgasmic ignorance. \u201cI can tell you that as long as we\u2019re both in the same place at the same time wanting the same thing, I really don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy pushed back from the table. \u201cAll right. Excuse me a moment.\u201d</p><p>He scowled at the sight of her half-eaten omelet, then glared at her retreating back. He\u2019d give her five minutes to get her tight little ass back in her chair or he was going to drag her back in to finish eating...</p><p>She returned in a short white satin robe that revealed her bare legs and the lack of a bra. Jared forgot his aggravation.</p><p>As Darcy resumed eating with obvious relish, he leaned back in his chair, watching her.</p><p>\u201cIn a town of this size, with only one fire station, how does the city council justify paying for two fire inspectors?\u201d</p> <p>When she looked up at him, her eyes were lit with amusement. \u201cA combination of nepotism, being willing to work part time, and a good word from Jim.\u201d</p><p>Jim. He reined in his irritation with a long, slow exhale. \u201cWho\u2019s the family member?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle. He moved several years ago, but memories are ageless in Lion\u2019s Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest of your family is gone, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Although my parents didn\u2019t go far. They bought a place on Lake Horton.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t all that far from his place in Seattle. \u201cWhy do you stay? What\u2019s here for you?\u201d</p> <p>Darcy pushed back from the table and picked up her plate. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He studied her as she came toward him to collect his plate, too. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe town. This house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Standing, he followed her to the sink. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not as easy to read as you think.\u201d</p><p>Jared backed off, noting the tension in her shoulders and the way she avoided his gaze. Coming up behind her, he pushed her ponytail aside and brushed his lips over her nape. He\u2019d get the story out of her eventually. In the meantime, he wanted her soft and warm. He wanted to explore what it was about her that made him want to kiss her all over.</p><p>She turned to face him. \u201cWhy did you join the Marshals Service?\u201d</p><p>He gripped the counter on either side of her, trapping her in the cage of his arms. She smelled sweet and clean, and he was hyperaware of the fact that she was mostly naked beneath the thin wrap of white satin. \u201cBecause the military and I were done with each other and there\u2019s nothing else I\u2019m good at.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to his hips, her fingers twining in his belt loops. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously hot. You could be a calendar model. Or a Chippendales dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not flattering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re outrageously good in bed. Although monetizing that is illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it on this side of the law,\u201d he murmured, bending his head over her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m picky about who I go to bed with. I\u2019d starve to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s flattering.\u201d</p><p>Darcy was a confident woman; she knew the force of her sex appeal. Since it was highly doubtful she would\u2019ve picked up that level of sensual sophistication around a town of this size, where the dating pool had to be painfully small, he was even more curious about the time she\u2019d spent away from this place. And what had brought her back. Maybe she was licking her wounds after a bad breakup, swearing off men for a while and retreating to a place where she\u2019d be left alone.</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cWanna watch TV?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled with silent laughter. She knew damn well he wanted another go at her, but he was going to hold off. He needed to be more careful or risk her burning out on him. He also needed to get a grip on himself.</p><p>\u201cFind something you like,\u201d she urged. \u201cI\u2019ll join you after I load up the dishwasher.\u201d</p><p>He went along with the suggestion only because he wanted to get a closer look at her place without making her nervous about it. Moving into the living room, Jared took notice of all the details he\u2019d been too lust addled to appreciate earlier. His gaze went to the now infamous couch first. Its modern lines and extra deep cushions were very much in keeping with how he saw Darcy, as was the sixty-two-inch flat-screen TV hung over the fireplace. Both were out of place against dated wallpapered walls. The coffee and end tables were sturdy wood pieces as retro in style as the dining table, while the knickknacks around the room were contemporary pieces.</p><p>Pausing by the fireplace, he looked at the framed photos on the mantel. Some were of Darcy with her parents, some were of her sister. He could tell the two apart easily, a difference confirmed by pictures of the two sisters together. The set of Darcy\u2019s shoulders and the cant of her chin were unique to her, displaying a self-possession and boldness that wasn\u2019t as evident in her sister\u2019s shy smile.</p><p>He turned away from the fireplace as she entered the room, his gaze hungry as it swept over her slender frame. He should be wrung out by the two explosive orgasms she\u2019d already given him, and there was no denying she was sore. But that didn\u2019t stop her from looking at him like she wanted to ride him \u2019til morning or him from seriously weighing the pros and cons of letting her. He\u2019d experienced potent sexual attraction before, but this was inexorable. Feeling his cock stir, he shucked his jeans but left his boxer briefs on.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get excited,\u201d he warned, when she caught her breath, \u201cI\u2019m just getting comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Catching her lower lip between her teeth, she gave him a deliberately provocative look. She ran a finger down her throat to her cleavage.</p><p>\u201cKeep it up,\u201d he drawled, grabbing the remote before dropping into the corner of the couch where he\u2019d had her pinned just hours before. He spread his legs and patted the spot between them. \u201cNow be a good girl and lay here against me.\u201d</p><p>She came to him with a wry smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as the type of man who likes good girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d He wrapped an arm around her as she settled her back against his chest. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t expect you to behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well,\u201d she teased, raking her short nails across his thighs.</p><p>Not yet, but he would.</p><p>Chapter six</p><p>The sun had barely risen when Jared finished poring over Darcy\u2019s files. Finding his cell phone a poor substitute for the big screen of his laptop, he availed himself of Darcy\u2019s office. He powered on her desktop, praying she didn\u2019t have it password protected. Whether she always slept like the dead or he\u2019d just worn her out, he figured she needed the sleep, considering the demands he\u2019d be making of her over the length of his stay.</p><p>When the computer screen flickered to life, he found himself looking at an image of Darcy and her sister, which served as the desktop wallpaper. They were children in the photo, not quite teenagers. Their hair was arranged in matching pigtails and they wore identical pale pink leotards. A reflection of their backs in a wall of mirrors was behind them, with a ballet bar that traversed the full width.</p><p>He tucked the image away along with the other bits and pieces he was collecting in his mental file for her, then he got to work. He accessed the Merkerson case files, comparing the information with what he\u2019d just acquired from Darcy\u2019s. The similarities were irrefutable. In fact, they were nearly perfect.</p><p>The only anomaly he could pinpoint was the incendiary devices in relation to the rapidity of the timeline. Merkerson had started out with smaller devices, such as soda cans, but he\u2019d been more intermittent. Months passed between arsons, until later in his rampage, when he advanced to using paint can\u2013sized devices and striking every seven days. His illness had progressed to where he wanted the entire world to burn. Fire was his obsession and his mistress. This new combination of smaller devices and frequency melded his earlier work with his later freneticism, but whether that was evolution, devolution, or simply a poor fit to the pattern was debatable. And any of those options left the field wide open.</p><p>Jared drafted a quick report to his superior, giving a rundown of his thoughts and impressions. She\u2019d lived the case the first time around, which gave her insight worth tapping into. He also asked for an update on the anonymous 911 call that alerted the authorities to the second fire. Miller had ascertained that the call originated in Seattle and was placed via a burner phone. But the sheriff had stopped investigating at that point, leaving the thread dangling. Why?</p><p>With that question in mind, he powered down Darcy\u2019s computer and checked the time. Seven thirty.</p><p>Heading back into the bedroom, he stopped by the nightstand and checked her alarm. It was set for eight, which gave him just about enough time. He looked down at her, finding her just as luscious while resting as he did when hit with the seething sensuality of the way she moved. She lay on her back with one arm bent around the top of her head and the other at her side. The sheet was loosely draped over her, exposing the upper swell of her tits and the bent knee of one leg.</p><p>He pinched the sheet between his fingers and tugged it down, exposing her body in delicious increments. She slept on, innocently luring him to start the day with a bang...</p><p>DARCY AWOKE WITH a gasp, heat flaring across her skin in a molten wave. As her brain lurched into awareness, another heated lash across her clit had her moaning and instinctively closing her legs.</p><p>But they wouldn\u2019t close. Strong hands held them down and spread for the next leisurely lick. Her heart raced with surprise and fear. Her eyes wrenched open, her hand thrusting downward to protect her intimate flesh. Her fingers sank into luxurious strands of thick hair, sliding through the mass to stroke over the scalp beneath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A low masculine sound of approval slid across her skin like a caress.</p><p>The spearing of a tongue into her pussy woke her fully, arching her back and ripping a cry from her throat. Her mind was just catching on, but her body was already there, her nipples beaded hard and tight, and her sex clenching with demand for more attention.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sunshine,\u201d Jared rumbled, his breath gusting warmly over her damp skin.</p><p>\u201cJared...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d He lifted one of her boneless legs over a thick shoulder and pushed the other up and to the side, opening her completely. \u201cNow just lie there and come for me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to reply, but a slow, deliberate swipe over her clitoris stole her breath. Whimpering, she lifted her hips to him, seeking more.</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d he purred, nuzzling against her with his lips. \u201cYou have the softest, most succulent cunt.\u201d</p><p>Her head pressed hard into the pillow as he traced her folds with the stiffened tip of his tongue. Her pussy was creaming for him, her desire seeping from her body in silky skeins of moisture. He lapped at her, teasing the clenching opening of her sex with taunting flutters. Her womb tightened to the point of pain.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her hips churned. \u201cFuck me with your tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He gave a shallow thrust, then circled her clit. \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything to you. Fuck you everywhere, in every way.\u201d</p><p>He moved sinuously, shrugging out from under her and gaining his knees. Pushing her legs up and back, he exposed her even more fully. Her hips were lifted from the bed, her shoulders supporting her weight as he bent his head and licked the length of her upraised slit. The vulnerability of her position only heightened the fever raging through her. His hands cupped the backs of her thighs, his thumbs holding her open for the tantalizing forays of his devious tongue. The scrape of his morning whiskers was an added stimulation, the slight discomfort soothed by the soft brush of his hair against her sensitive inner thighs.</p><p>And she could watch it all\u2014the way his mouth sealed over her pussy as he pushed his tongue into her in a raw, erotic French kiss; the way his eyes darkened as she panted and fisted the bottom sheet; the way his lids lowered on a groan as she grew hotter and wetter.</p><p>His thumb slid through the building slickness, coaxing it lower, using it to massage the tender pucker of her ass. Lust shot through her like a strike of lightning while sweat bloomed over her skin in a mist of heat.</p><p>Jared\u2019s head lifted. \u201cYou want me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you everywhere.\u201d She felt as if she no longer fit in her skin, as if she were trying to crawl out of it. Her hunger for him was raging through her, boiling through her veins and stealing every remaining shred of her sanity.</p><p>His thumb exerted the tiniest bit of pressure and she pushed out for him, flowering open and accepting his touch inside her. A violent tremor shook her, pushing her to the edge of climax. It had been a long time since she\u2019d trusted a man to take her there. Too long. And even then, the relationship hadn\u2019t been so raw and sexual. Jared\u2019s unabashed carnality stripped her of her normal boundaries, violated her sensibilities, opened her to torment both physical and...otherwise.</p><p>Every time he touched her, she wanted more. More of him. More of who she was with him.</p><p>Squeezing her aching breasts, she tightened around his thumb. \u201cEat me \u2019til I come. Then fuck my ass until you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d His skin stretched tight over his cheekbones. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you do to me. How crazed you make me. I want to defile your body. Own it. Possess it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg me, Darcy. Beg me to do it all to you. Everything I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. All of it.\u201d</p> <p>He dove for the saturated flesh between her thighs, latching on with a greed that tore through her. His tongue fucked her spasming pussy hard and fast, his head angling to get deeper. His thumb thrust in and out of her rear, the dual shallow penetration making her mindless.</p><p>She begged as he\u2019d demanded her to, pleaded with him to finish her, to make her come before she broke from the strain...</p><p>The moment his lips surrounded her clit, the climax hit her hard, bowing her back and blackening her vision. She cried out as he sucked her, drawing on her with rapid measured pulls. The orgasm barreled through her senses, building and building until she thought she might lose consciousness. Then it ebbed, taking her breath and energy with it. She melted into the bed, barely aware of the gentleness with which he lowered her.</p><p>\u201cDarcy.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing rasped in the semidarkness of the bedroom. She struggled to open her eyes, finding Jared kneeling between them, pushing his boxer briefs down to free his raging cock. His balls were hard and full, drawn up close to the base of his heavily veined shaft. The wide crest was purpled by the need to expend the semen dribbling from the tip and he fisted it with a harsh curse.</p><p>As he had in the shower, he rolled his scrotum in one hand and jacked himself off with the other.</p><p>She watched with a dry mouth as he stroked his cock with a brutality that pounded through her blood. It was a primitive demonstration of how wild she made him, soothing her with the proof that he was as lust crazed as she was.</p><p>Pinching and tugging on her nipples, she urged him on. \u201cI\u2019m imagining you in me\u2014how deep you get, how thick you are just before you come. You fill me so full the pleasure is almost pain. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll bear it when you take my ass, but I know I\u2019ll love it. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Semen exploded from him in a scorching stream across her torso. His fist flew, pumping the creamy fluid up the shaft to spurt over her nipples, coating her skin with the evidence of his virility. He came long and hard, cursing as his powerful body was wracked by wrenching shudders.</p><p>But when he finished, he was still hard, and the gleam in his eye was as rapacious as she\u2019d come to expect.</p><p>The blaring of her alarm was jolting, kicking her racing heartbeat into overdrive. Reaching down, Jared caught her by the nape of her neck and lifted her to his mouth. He kissed her hard and swift, his free hand kneading his cum into her breasts.</p><p>\u201cSaved by the bell,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>Darcy spoke with her lips against his. \u201cLater. We\u2019ll finish this later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting the seconds.\u201d</p><p>DARCY SET COFFEE to brewing while Jared showered, then turned her attention to the files on the arsons that lay on the dining room table. At some point during the night, he must have gone out to her car to retrieve them. She wondered what conclusions he\u2019d drawn, if any, and if he had any theories or questions she might help him with.</p><p>The shower turned off, leaving a sudden void as the noisy pipes quieted. In the ensuing silence, she could almost hear her body humming. She felt strangely energized and exhausted, content and apprehensive. In less than a day, Jared had found a loose thread in her life and he was slowly pulling it, unraveling her at the seams. She didn\u2019t see how she would be able to continue the searingly intimate sexual exploration they were engaging in without becoming attached to it.</p><p>Already she craved him. Picturing an addiction to him wasn\u2019t that big of a leap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kill to have some of that coffee I smell,\u201d he said, entering the kitchen with damp hair and nothing but his jeans on.</p><p>She drank him in, resisting the urge to run her fingers through the light dusting of hair on his chest. Truth be told, she couldn\u2019t stop her mind from imagining her tongue tracing the line of his happy trail from his navel to his cock below. Her mouth watered with the desire to lick and suck him to orgasm, to fully own his pleasure when he came. And her proprietary feelings extended beyond that to encompass the whole of him.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cYou\u2019re making my dick hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop teasing me with your rockin\u2019 body,\u201d she shot back, stung and frightened by the sting, which hinted that she might be in too deep with him already. \u201cHow would you like it if I walked around topless all the time?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI\u2019d love it and you know it, but we have shit to do besides fuck each other\u2019s brains out. I need you to give me a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d she muttered under her breath, turning toward the coffeemaker. He was irascible, grumpy, and rude as a rule. But that was part of his charm. Even if his gruffness did rub her raw at times. \u201cHow do you take your coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack.\u201d</p><p>Darcy pulled a mug out of the cupboard. She felt him come up behind her, then closed her eyes as he nuzzled his way past her ponytail to her nape. His arms came around her and she tensed, fighting to keep the tremors she felt on the inside from being discernible on the outside.</p><p>His embrace tightened and he spoke roughly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for the carafe, she took a deep slow breath. \u201cNothing to be sorry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I can\u2019t take it out on you when it\u2019s my own damn self I can\u2019t seem to control. We\u2019re on fire for each other. Keeping that in check is going to take work and some concessions. I hate putting clothes on when my skin\u2019s damp, but I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His teeth bit lightly into the muscle between her shoulder and neck, a primal possessive gesture that sent an unwanted thrill of awareness through her. \u201cI love the way you look at me, Darcy. Like you want to eat me alive. It\u2019s not a bad thing, it\u2019s just inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>She slid the full mug to the side. \u201cI\u2019ll work on looking elsewhere. Here you go.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t move for a minute, then he released her with a muttered curse. He left the kitchen, and she took the breather to give herself a mental kick in the ass. She straightened when he returned, moving away and toward the living room as he passed her on his way toward the coffee she\u2019d poured him.</p><p>They needed some distance from each other. They hadn\u2019t had any since they\u2019d met and that was a mistake.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare walk out of this room,\u201d he said in a voice too even to be anything but dangerous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019ve worn out my welcome, you\u2019ll look me in the eye and say so.\u201d</p><p>Pausing by the dining table, Darcy faced him, feeling grateful that she wore her uniform, which gave her the look of having her shit together even if she didn\u2019t. Jared had put his shirt on. He was now leaning with his hip against the counter and his legs crossed at the ankle. The leisurely pose didn\u2019t fool her for a minute. He was coiled tight. Watchful. Ready.</p> <p>She hit him with something certain to give him pause. \u201cI\u2019m feeling fragile this morning.\u201d</p><p>One arm crossed his chest; the other lifted his mug to his lips. He swallowed and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m a bit raw myself.\u201d</p><p>His confession made her feel better and she managed a smile. \u201cI was thinking maybe it would be a good idea for you to work with Jim today. I\u2019ll see what I can do to help your partner and Miller. We can sleep off some of the hormones...pheromones...whatever, separately, and see how things look tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>There was a long stretch of silence, then, \u201cI\u2019ll agree to the break, but it would be best for everyone if I didn\u2019t see Ralston again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s damn good at his job. He trained me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe could be the best damn fire inspector in the country; that won\u2019t stop me from laying him out cold if he tries that territorial bullshit again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had no way of knowing we\u2019d made arrangements to hook up,\u201d she argued. \u201cHe was just trying to be a good friend, which is all he\u2019s been for the last couple of years.\u201d</p><p>Jared took another sip, his gaze locked with hers over the lip of the mug. \u201cI\u2019m a trained observer, Darcy. So is he. We both got the measure of each other from the first. He knew I was stepping in, and he pushed a little to try and put me in my place. He pushes again and I\u2019m pounding him back.\u201d</p><p>Her anger spiked. \u201cI don\u2019t need this right now. I don\u2019t have anything to give you. I\u2019m all tapped out. You were just supposed to be a vibrator that didn\u2019t need batteries.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were as hard and beautiful as sapphires. \u201cAnd you were just supposed to be a hot piece of ass. Instead, this is getting messy. Deal with it. I want you and I can\u2019t turn it off. And when I\u2019m touching you, I don\u2019t want to turn it off, and you don\u2019t want me to, either. If you\u2019re hoping to shut us down with some distance, I\u2019ll roll with it just to prove you wrong, but we\u2019ll be back at each other in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking your word for it. I\u2019ll see for myself.\u201d He finished his coffee and refilled his mug. \u201cI need to change into fresh clothes and grab some things from the motel. Then I want to head out to the other two scenes. I\u2019d prefer it if you\u2019d take me, but if you\u2019re opposed to that, I\u2019ll work something else out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpposed,\u201d she repeated, laughing without humor. \u201cIf only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the same boat. If it sinks, we go together.\u201d</p><p>She stood and mentally dusted herself off. \u201cDo you need to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I\u2019m ready to go when you are.\u201d</p><p>Chapter seven</p><p>Trish was just leaving the motel when Darcy pulled her BMW into a spot in front of Jared\u2019s ground-floor room. He climbed out and met his partner at the curb.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he greeted her, frowning at her obvious agitation. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiller is champing at the bit to hold a press conference. He thinks if we put the heat on the arsonist, he\u2019ll move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenius,\u201d Jared muttered. \u201cMake our torch someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reminded him\u2014firmly\u2014that this is our case and we\u2019ll decide how to proceed.\u201d Her pretty face was hard and her choice of attire betrayed her determination to establish her control of the situation. Usually a jeans and blouse sort of gal, she was wearing slacks and a blazer today.</p><p>\u201cHow well does he listen?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged with a wry smile. \u201cWell, he called me to give me a heads-up. That\u2019s something, at least. I\u2019m going to head into the station and keep an eye on him. You heading out to the other two sites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve got the inspector\u2019s files for you to run through while I\u2019m out. You\u2019ll find she\u2019s very thorough.\u201d He glanced at Darcy and gestured for her to join them. \u201cWe also need to follow up on the vacation homes. There\u2019s a steady stream of seasonal residents and rental transients running through the town. The full-time residents aren\u2019t the only ones who know the ins and outs of the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your jeans, by the way,\u201d Trish said, as Darcy unfolded from behind the wheel. \u201cThey looked good on you yesterday, too.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a withering glance, to which she laughed. When Darcy came up beside him, he introduced the two.</p><p>\u201cCan you pass the files on to Morales while I get what I need?\u201d He moved on without waiting for an answer.</p><p>Entering his room, Jared unzipped his as-yet unpacked suitcase and pulled out a change of clothes. When he was done, he grabbed his laptop case and the sunglasses he\u2019d left on the dresser the day before, then headed back out to the parking lot. He found Darcy and Trish standing with their heads bent over the front end of the Marshals Service\u2019s SUV he\u2019d driven to Lion\u2019s Bay, discussing a file they had spread open on the hood.</p><p>Darcy glanced up when his room door shut. The way she looked at him was like a physical caress, and his heartbeat quickened. Her feminine hunger was a drug he couldn\u2019t quit. Even knowing it was fucking him up, he couldn\u2019t stay away.</p><p>Trish straightened, frowning at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be interested in hearing your thoughts when you get through surveying all three scenes. On paper, I\u2019m missing the connection. I find it odd that the subject would be so meticulous in his timing and the creation of the incendiary devices, and yet so random in his location choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club.\u201d Jared pushed his shades onto his face. \u201cOnce we find the connection, we\u2019ll crack this case wide open.\u201d</p><p>Darcy said good-bye and moved back to her car. He was right behind her. They headed to the fire station to change vehicles. It was just Jared\u2019s luck that the guy he least wanted to see approached Darcy the moment they entered the building.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come in on your day off,\u201d Ralston said as she searched the rack on the wall for the keys to the department\u2019s truck. \u201cI can help Deputy Cameron with whatever he needs.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled grimly. The easiest card Darcy could have played to gain some distance was one she hadn\u2019t used\u2014she wasn\u2019t working today. He took it as a good sign, as far as signs went.</p><p>\u201cActually, Inspector,\u201d Jared replied, \u201cwe could use your help reining Sheriff Miller in. He\u2019s pushing for a press conference, which will either feed the ego of our subject, run him off, or both.\u201d</p><p>Ralston sighed. \u201cThe last thing we need is media scrutiny. We\u2019d never get anything done. We know that all too well. Don\u2019t we, Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll listen to you, Jim. You have a way with people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris will listen to you, too. He\u2019s still got a soft spot for you. Don\u2019t suppose you noticed that he keeps a picture from prom in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. I didn\u2019t want to know that. I\u2019m going to take Deputy Cameron up to the Animal Friends site, then back around to the Sweet Spot.\u201d</p><p>Stepping closer, Ralston lowered his voice and said, \u201cLet me take care of the one for you. You shouldn\u2019t have to go up there again.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled harshly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ve got to deal with Miller, and Deputies Cameron and Morales need to make as much progress as possible before we have another blaze. The sooner we get through the sites, the better. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying that, darlin\u2019, but sayin\u2019 it doesn\u2019t make it so.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a step forward, reminding the other man that he was there. He did nothing overt, didn\u2019t reach out to Darcy or make any proprietary moves. He didn\u2019t have to. The look he shot the inspector said it all and more\u2014evolution hadn\u2019t altered the silent communication between males.</p><p>Ralston sized him up again. There was no challenge in the once-over he gave Jared. Just quiet, calm curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d Darcy said, oblivious to the exchange taking place over her head. \u201cI probably need to.\u201d</p><p>Ralston glanced at her again. \u201cOkay. I just don\u2019t want you pushing yourself into something you might not be ready for.\u201d</p><p>She responded with more assurances, then asked, \u201cDo you know where the truck keys are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitch had it around back, giving it a wash.\u201d</p><p>They went to collect the truck, with Darcy explaining that aside from two trained EMTs on payroll, the other firemen were local volunteers. \u201cMitch Quinn is one of the most active,\u201d she said as they rounded the corner and found a trim blond man in dark blue uniform drying off the pickup. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll get a permanent position if the city ever approves a budget increase. He deserves it.\u201d</p><p>She made quick introductions, then hopped in the cab, raring to go. They cleared the town quickly, then turned off the coastal highway and began climbing into the wooded area that scaled one end of the U-shaped ridge of hills that hugged Lion\u2019s Bay to the ocean. Darcy\u2019s knuckles turned white on the steering wheel and her lips thinned. Mentally, she drifted away from him, became lost in some thought or memory that absorbed all of her vitality.</p><p>\u201cTell me about this place we\u2019re going to,\u201d he said, engaging her because he wanted her with him. Wanted to be there for her, with her, while she dealt with whatever she was struggling with.</p><p>She jolted as if the sound of his voice had startled her. Looking at him, she revealed green eyes that were stark and lost. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour impressions of the animal shelter. Any thoughts you might have about its selection. What you know of its history.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d She slowly came back to him, exhaling her tension in a rush. \u201cThe shelter was built with funds provided by the Darmody family, who\u2019ve owned the land up here for three generations. Lucy Darmody spearheaded the project in response to teasing from her family that she was turning her house into a zoo, due to her tendency to pick up stray, wounded, and unwanted animals. When she passed away, her children didn\u2019t want the hassle of it, so they donated the equipment and planned on razing the building and kennels. Since then, it\u2019s been tied up in litigation. They can\u2019t agree on the best way to monetize the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do you come up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot.\u201d</p> <p>He studied her covertly from behind his shades. \u201cBut you used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears ago. My dad is a vet and he used to donate one weekend a month to coming up here to spay and neuter. He conscripted me and Dani\u2014my sister\u2014into odd jobs whenever he could. That\u2019s how Dani found out she loved the practice of veterinary medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo tame for you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cYes. I love animals, but it just wasn\u2019t a vocation for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d Jared wanted to meet Danielle. He wanted to see Darcy with her sister, see the emotions and reactions she had to someone she loved and trusted.</p> <p>\u201cNear my parents.\u201d</p><p>Why was Darcy still here? he wondered again. Without family ties, what was rooting her?</p><p>They pulled into a gravel parking lot riddled with weeds. At the end of the lot, charred cement block walls outlined the building that had once stood there. The kennels were obvious, the chain link and cement having weathered the fire well.</p><p>Darcy entered the building, her shoulders high and tight, the beam of illumination from a Maglite leading the way. \u201cThis was the main office. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot left in here. Some built-in bookshelves and boxes of records for deceased pets. The boxes were moved into that corner there, with the incendiary device placed in the middle. We estimate the fire began sometime around ten in the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the unidentified witness called at quarter after. From Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the timed delay, he could have set the stage and made the drive with time to spare.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at her. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>She stepped into a slender ray of light entering from a hole in the ceiling and gave an approving nod. \u201cExactly. What pyromaniac doesn\u2019t stick around to watch the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne who isn\u2019t obsessed with fire,\u201d Jared answered, which he knew was impossible.</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s not a pyro, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m following. We\u2019ve already noted that the materials used to build the structures our subject selected were not the most flammable choices.\u201d Jared rested a hand on the butt of his gun. \u201cWhat are some of the other reasons to start a fire? We talked about insurance payouts. Maybe revenge? Damn it, the incendiary devices are tripping us up. Like you said, they\u2019re too sophisticated, too meticulously built.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Someone loves them, loves working on them, loves imagining the destruction they\u2019re going to cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re back to a pyro who doesn\u2019t get off on his own fires.\u201d He stared at her. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat maybe what you said about Merkerson passing the baton to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is spot-on. What if they\u2019re working together, with Merkerson teaching the ropes, deliberately starting off with a small town and structures that are manageable?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA training ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s mouth curved grimly. \u201cI\u2019m liking this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt pulls more of the threads together.\u201d</p><p>Impressed, he asked, \u201cHow long have you been thinking along these lines?\u201d</p><p>She stepped deeper into the building. \u201cSince the tip came in. How do you have a torch igniting a fire in one town and a tipster in another? Two people. Occam\u2019s razor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you waited until the third fire to shout out for help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my call.\u201d Darcy opened a door that led outside, flooding the interior with dappled sunlight. \u201cThen I made it my call.\u201d</p><p>He followed. \u201cI\u2019m hung up on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose sophisticated time bombs you talked about\u2014they\u2019re better than they were back in the day. If it is Merkerson, he\u2019s upped his game over the years. He\u2019s been honing his weapons of destruction, modernizing them, which means he\u2019s been somewhere he could acquire the tools and substances he needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot jail, then.\u201d She paused at the end of a walkway that emptied into a small patio surrounded by the kennels. Her eyes took on that faraway look again.</p><p>Drawing to a halt beside her, he asked quietly, \u201cWhat are you seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemories.\u201d She pointed to a kennel and her breath left her in a rush. \u201cDani locked me in there once\u2014for an hour\u2014because I ripped the knee on her favorite pair of jeans when I borrowed them...without her permission.\u201d</p><p>He set his hand at the small of her back, offering what support he could. \u201cI knew you were a troublemaker.\u201d</p><p>Darcy leaned into his touch. \u201cI always thought it was stupid that so many fugitives stick around familiar locations. If they value their freedom, I\u2019d think they\u2019d want to get out of the country. Maybe that\u2019s what Merkerson did. Canada, maybe? Or Mexico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can share his photo and see if anything shakes loose.\u201d Jared took another look around. \u201cBut this location is remote. He would\u2019ve had to hear about it from someone familiar with it, or he would\u2019ve had to come here himself and find it on his own. Wouldn\u2019t be something he\u2019d accomplish in a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might\u2019ve stayed here awhile? Is that what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d She turned toward him. \u201cA snake in the grass, how creepy.\u201d</p><p>Cupping her face, he took her mouth. The kiss was slow and simmering, a gentle stroking of tongues and brushing of lips. He continued until his breathing was fast and she was pressed against him. Pulling back, he studied her eyes and found them dazed and hot with desire, which was a damn sight better than seeing them filled with shadows. \u201cThat\u2019s better. Now we can go.\u201d</p><p>DARCY\u2019S LIPS WERE still tingling when they pulled up to the curb in front of the Sweet Spot. More profound\u2014and infinitely scarier\u2014was the warmth he\u2019d pushed through her with his kiss, thawing the knot of ice that had settled in her stomach.</p><p>Jared got to her. Far too deeply and easily, and she didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. It was outside the scope of her experience.</p><p>She loved men. She was fascinated by them and enjoyed the hell out of them, but they were accessories. There was too much going on in her life, too many things that took up her time. Dani called her a heartbreaker. Darcy hadn\u2019t ever set out to hurt anyone, but it had been known to happen.</p><p>Looking at Jared over the hood of her work truck, Darcy wondered why he had to be the one to get under her skin. What was it about him? He was testy and brusque when he was in a good mood, and an ass when he was in a bad one.</p><p>One of his brows arched over the top of his sunglasses, a gesture that said, What are you staring at?</p><p>You. You\u2019re affecting me. Stop it. Instead she said, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for ogling. You\u2019re the hottest man I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep thinking that way. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you need me. I don\u2019t have anything to add to my report.\u201d She couldn\u2019t face the ruins of another place she loved. The shelter had been bad enough. Visiting the site again had hit her harder than she would have expected. Because of Jared. He\u2019d opened her up, found a way inside her through the hairline fractures he had created, and left her vulnerable to the reality of her losses in a way she hadn\u2019t been before.</p><p>With a curt nod, he ducked under the crime scene tape and stepped through the frame of what used to be a large front display window. It had exploded outward during the fire, showering the sidewalk with glass.</p><p>The proprietress of the adjacent jewelry store waved at Darcy through her matching window, then stepped outside. She was a statuesque brunette with cornflower blue eyes and bone structure to make a plastic surgeon weep in awe. With her waist-length black hair swaying around her shoulders, Nadine Bender glided over and joined Darcy in leaning into the truck. \u201cIs that the Fed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy U.S. Marshal,\u201d Darcy qualified, her eyes riveted to Jared as he examined what was left of the shop. He got a particular look on his face when he was focused on work. It was laser bright, sharp as a blade, and sexy as hell.</p><p>Nadine whistled. \u201cHe\u2019s a looker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure can pick \u2019em. You\u2019ve got a thing for men in uniform. Chris, Jim, and now this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy Cameron,\u201d Darcy supplied as Nadine bumped shoulders with her.</p><p>They\u2019d gone to school together, from kindergarten through high school. Like Darcy, Nadine had fled Lion\u2019s Bay as soon as she graduated, then came back. They joked that the town was like a vortex, inexorably sucking natives back into it.</p><p>\u201cAll I did was call in the cavalry.\u201d Darcy shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t take any credit for his hotness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you snagged him straightaway. I can see it in the way he looks at you. If I thought you were purposely grabbing all the sexy men, I\u2019d hate you. You\u2019ve always been the biggest guy magnet. Makes me pea green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way prettier than I am, Nadine. Always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You have this vibe that drives men wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not always a good thing,\u201d she muttered as a patrol car parked behind her truck.</p><p>Miller grabbed his hat off the passenger seat and unfolded from behind the wheel. His gaze was on Darcy as he set the hat on his head and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chris,\u201d Nadine greeted with a wave. \u201cHow are you this fine early afternoon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d He glanced at Nadine long enough to manage a smile. \u201cHow\u2019s the store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little worse for wear, but open for business. The insurance adjuster will be out later to take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded and came to a stop before Darcy, his warm brown eyes shaded by the brim of his hat. \u201cEverything all right with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir, Sheriff. Deputy Cameron is just checking out the scene.\u201d</p><p>Nadine backed away. \u201cI\u2019m going to head back to work.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shot her a look that said, Don\u2019t you dare, but the other woman just grinned mischievously and backed away.</p><p>Chris leaned back against the truck next to her. Too close. When he crossed his arms, his biceps brushed hers.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Deputy Morales?\u201d Darcy asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe was making some phone calls and Jim was helping her out with some things. So I thought I\u2019d find you and see if you needed anything.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled softly, feeling that tiny twinge of discomfort that came with knowing someone\u2019s interest was deeper than could be reciprocated. She and Chris had dated in high school. He\u2019d been prom king to her prom queen. They\u2019d had fun together, been wild and reckless as kids usually were, and she\u2019d enjoyed being with him, but it had never been serious for her. He was a good guy in a lot of ways. Plus, he kept himself in prime shape and was great looking. But he didn\u2019t get to her, not the way she needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m set,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ve turned everything I have over to Deputy Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d heard that.\u201d The intimation in his tone put her back up.</p><p>Darcy straightened away from the truck and faced him from the sidewalk. \u201cWatch it, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to talk about this. Why are you always going for a dead end? First Jim, then this guy\u2014\u201d He gestured toward Jared with a flick of his wrist. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Darcy. We\u2019re good together. You know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously? We dated when we were kids for chrissakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have history,\u201d he argued. \u201cWho knows you better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Chris, you don\u2019t know me at all.\u201d She thought back to when she\u2019d woken up to Jared in her bed. The things she\u2019d said to him...the raw sexual things she\u2019d demanded of him...She could never say such things to Chris. It didn\u2019t matter how long she\u2019d known him. The connection she needed to be so open wasn\u2019t there. \u201cWhere is this coming from anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been patient, Darcy.\u201d Pushing off his hat, he ran a hand through his thick mahogany hair. His eyes were hot with frustration. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re back in Lion\u2019s Bay. I figured that was the big step. I knew you had some adjusting to do so I\u2019ve kind of hovered on the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Chris. Are we going to have this conversation now? Here? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re going through a rough time. You need someone solid, Darcy. Someone who can anchor you. Not Jim and not some fly-by-night outsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this,\u201d she said, low and quiet. \u201cYou\u2019re under a lot of pressure at the moment. We all are. So I\u2019m going to give you a pass today and forget you brought this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve asked you out before now. Is that what you\u2019re saying? I tried to do the right thing by giving you some space, but I gave you too much space.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cWho knows? Maybe if you\u2019d asked me out when I first got back, I might have said yes. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have. We\u2019ll never know. It\u2019s a moot point right now. I\u2019m working. So are you. And I\u2019m presently involved with someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvolved?\u201d he snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s passing through, Darcy. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t, but you seem to have or your boxers wouldn\u2019t be in a twist and we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. We\u2019re going to collar our torch, Chris, and everything is going to go back to the way it was, then you\u2019ll be embarrassed over this conversation. Let\u2019s put it behind us.\u201d</p><p>Jared walked out of the building. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cSheriff Miller just wanted to offer his assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get Deputy Morales the list of part-time residents, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>Chris straightened and shoved his hat back on his head. \u201cYour partner\u2019s got everything she asked for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jared bared his teeth in a semblance of a smile. \u201cMorales will let you know if we need anything further.\u201d</p><p>She waited until Chris had driven away to say, \u201cSee? You underestimated yourself. You worked with him just fine...without your fists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe managed not to talk too much.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cBut he was laying it on thick for you. You handled that well.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she moved to the truck. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t his style. This case is really getting to him, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the thought of you with another man is.\u201d He opened the passenger door and paused, looking at her. With one arm draped on the roof of the cab and the other resting on the window frame, he looked casual, relaxed, and extremely delicious. \u201cYou know, being so easygoing with your brush-offs make them harder to accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause women are supposed to be emotional. Pissed off, vengeful, sad...whatever. Something. Brushing a man off like a gnat makes us realize we never got to you at all. Or that we were much too easy to get over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sexist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. No one\u2019s ever accused me of being PC.\u201d He pushed his sunglasses up, revealing cool blue eyes that scorched her. \u201cI want to go to Seattle, take a look around the area where the tipster placed his phone call. And I want to take you to lunch. Since it\u2019s your day off, it\u2019s not a problem for you to get away, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And she wouldn\u2019t have to wear her uniform. She was looking forward to hitting him with something flirty. \u201cI just need to change my clothes and my ride.\u201d</p><p>His slow, sexy smile did a number on her. She stood there a moment, absorbing the sensation of being so highly attracted to a man. Not just physically, but in every way. He\u2019d called her easygoing and she thought that was true. She\u2019d long avoided drama with men and anyone who was high maintenance. But her irritable lover wasn\u2019t scaring her away. She wanted more of him, the good and the bad, the rough and the smooth.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said honestly, \u201cbut that\u2019s not stopping me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter eight</p><p>Jared wondered what the hell he\u2019d gotten himself into when Darcy came out of the house. She\u2019d changed into a strappy, fitted red dress that bared toned arms and lithe legs that ended in heeled sandals. Her dark hair drifted around her shoulders, and she\u2019d touched up her eyes and lips with a light application of cosmetics.</p><p>His breath caught. More than her physical attractiveness, it was her sultry confidence that riveted him, the indefinable essence of her that so perfectly aligned with something deep inside him.</p><p>\u201cAre you still there, Cameron?\u201d Supervisory Deputy Holt asked through his cell phone\u2019s speaker.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve pulled the photos and video from the surveillance cameras around the payphone. They\u2019re not very helpful. The subject wore a hooded sweatshirt and kept his head down, but they\u2019re being e-mailed to you. Maybe one of the locals will see something familiar in the body language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll run it through. Thanks.\u201d He straightened as Darcy reached him. \u201cI\u2019m going to visit the location myself. I want to time the trip and see if something in the vicinity jumps out at me. It\u2019s possible he picked the payphone at random, but just in case, I\u2019ll check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend me an updated report by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He killed the call, shoved the phone in his pocket, and caught Darcy by the hips to pull her close. \u201cYou look amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Deputy.\u201d She accepted the compliment with an easy self-assurance.</p><p>A heartbreaker, he thought grimly. The kind of woman a man was never sure he possessed completely. That aloofness stirred his most primal proprietary instincts, and he was slightly irritated that he was no more immune to her allure than any other member of the male species.</p><p>But then she\u2019d confessed today that they were \u201cinvolved,\u201d and she wasn\u2019t the type of woman to use one man as an excuse to extricate herself from another. For now, she was his. It was up to him to decide if he wanted to keep her, and if he did, take the steps necessary to make that happen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scowling at me,\u201d she pointed out wryly, her cool fingertips smoothing the line between his brows.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect, Darcy. Just the sort of uncomplicated and undemanding female a guy like me hopes to pass some time with. It\u2019s driving me fuckin\u2019 crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes absolutely no sense,\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>He forced himself to relax. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>Stepping closer, she brushed her mouth across his. The kiss was soft as a butterfly\u2019s wings, barely there. Her tongue darted out, licking the seam of his lips, dipping just a tiny bit inside. He groaned, fighting the urge to drag her close and take over. He wanted her to give to him whatever she chose, however much she chose.</p><p>Her hands went to his shoulders, then the one not holding her little clutch purse cupped his nape. Her head tilted and she sealed her mouth over his. She deepened the kiss, unraveling him stitch by stitch. He couldn\u2019t say why, couldn\u2019t figure it out. She was a pretty woman he\u2019d met twenty-four hours before. They\u2019d fucked like feral rabbits, which should\u2019ve worked her right out of his system. Physically, he\u2019d been thoroughly satisfied. Yet he couldn\u2019t catch his breath because of a chaste kiss. His lungs heaved and burned, his heart pounded violently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pressing her forehead to his, Darcy exchanged gasping breaths with him. \u201cI need you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>He heard the tremulous note in her voice and caught her close, banding one arm around her hips and rubbing his hand up and down her back. He wondered if she\u2019d ever really needed anything from any man. What twist of fate had aligned his ferocious need to take her with her unrealized need to be taken?</p><p>\u201cAre we a pair or what?\u201d he murmured with his lips to her crown.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jared rubbed his cheek against the top of her head. \u201cWe\u2019re something.\u201d</p><p>THROUGH THE LENS of his camera, Jared stood on the street corner and photographed every possible angle from the phone booth.</p><p>\u201cSeems so wide open,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cWhere do you take an investigation from here?\u201d</p><p>He lowered the camera. \u201cCross-check local businesses with Lion\u2019s Bay residents. Check cab fares from that day and time and this general vicinity. He probably drove, but maybe he was cautious enough to take a cab from a parking garage to somewhere nearby. Of course, if he\u2019s that careful, he probably paid cash, but we\u2019ll tie off that thread to be sure.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him grimly. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping yourself busy while we wait for him to strike again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuilding a case.\u201d He put the cap back on the lens and put the camera back in its bag. \u201cI\u2019m done. Hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great little caf\u00e9 around the corner, although we might have to wait a bit for a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He caught her hand and led her straight to the restaurant. It was crowded, with a line out front and a harried-looking hostess who instantly brightened when she saw him.</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d Tiffany smiled and grabbed a menu. \u201cJust in time for your reservation.\u201d</p><p>He felt Darcy\u2019s grip tighten on his and knew she caught the undercurrent of familiarity. He didn\u2019t have a reservation, but Tiffany always found a spot at the counter for him...and time after work when he was in the mood for more than food.</p> <p>\u201cFor two,\u201d he pointed out gently, pulling Darcy up to his side.</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s brows rose and her smile widened. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncomplicated and undemanding?\u201d Darcy asked softly, following his urging to precede him to their table.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And suddenly far less appealing. Not that he didn\u2019t note and appreciate Tiffany\u2019s beauty. It just didn\u2019t hold his attention. Instead, he found himself focused on the number of stares directed at Darcy. She looked like a million dollars and carried herself as if she was worth ten times that.</p><p>God, she was fucking hot as hell.</p><p>And he had it bad for her.</p><p>Jared pulled out her chair and took the one next to her rather than across the table. The smile she gave him was warm and it stayed warm as she accepted the menu from Tiffany.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m getting,\u201d she announced when they were alone.</p> <p>\u201cDo you come here often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a couple times, but Jim ordered this phenomenal pasta once. I\u2019ve been dying to get a plate of my own ever since.\u201d</p><p>Jared set his camera on the table and made sure that when he spoke his voice was smooth and unchallenging. \u201cI\u2019m still not getting the Jim thing.\u201d</p><p>She set her menu aside. \u201cBack in high school, Jim was the hot older guy all the girls crushed on, and he was a fireman, which made him even sexier. When I moved back to Lion\u2019s Bay, some of that adolescent infatuation was still there. Turned out he\u2019d thought I was pretty hot, too, but I\u2019d been jail bait before. We had unfinished business, so we wrapped it up. Like I said, it was never serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had any serious relationships?\u201d He knew something had to be the catalyst that drew her back to Lion\u2019s Bay.</p><p>Her lips pursed as she considered the question. \u201cI\u2019ve had long-term boyfriends, but I\u2019ve never been engaged. Have you?\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in his seat, he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m a busy guy, Darcy. I mostly work this region, but I\u2019m also a SOG deputy\u2014the Marshals Service\u2019s Special Operations Group\u2014which means I\u2019m on call to go anywhere at any time. I haven\u2019t had any serious relationships. My last long-term girlfriend was back in high school and that lasted less than a year. I don\u2019t have commitment issues, but I haven\u2019t met anyone who was worth the inconvenience of trying to get a relationship off the ground.\u201d He took a slow, deep breath. \u201cUntil now.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her gaze darting over his face. Their waiter approached and Darcy ordered, then turned her attention to laying her napkin across her lap as he did the same.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything when they were alone again, thinking he\u2019d lobbed the ball into her court and she could either keep it in play or drop it. Maybe the duration of the case was all he\u2019d get from her. He wondered if staying out of her bed would make it easier to walk away at the end or harder. It wasn\u2019t a situation he\u2019d faced before. So he asked her, because he suspected she knew. Not from her point of view, but from the perspective of the other guys in her life who\u2019d wanted the piece of her she kept to herself.</p><p>\u201cIf I stop fucking you,\u201d he asked in a low, even tone, \u201cwill it be easier to stop wanting you?\u201d</p><p>Twisting in her seat, she faced him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re proposing, Jared. More of this?\u201d She gestured at the interior of the restaurant with a sweep of her hand. \u201cMore dates? Or just an understanding that we\u2019ll have sex occasionally when the mood strikes and we\u2019re in the vicinity of each other? Actually, aren\u2019t they both the same thing when a relationship is too erratic to be steady? One just comes with food and/or entertainment, while the other allots that bonus time to fucking instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know what to ask for? I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d He drummed his fingertips into the tablecloth and tried to figure it out.</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d Her voice had the slow, conciliatory note of someone about to impart bad news. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can have a casual relationship. The attraction between us...it\u2019s too intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that out when the first sight of you hit me like a two-by-four between the eyes. Listen...I\u2019m not talking about fitting you into my life as it is. I\u2019m talking about changing things to fit around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking me a priority?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He held her gaze. \u201cWith the expectation that you\u2019ll make the same effort for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should wait a few more days before you decide I\u2019m not going to lose my appeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start playing games. It insults both of us.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled in a rush. \u201cSorry. You freak me out. And the really scary part is I don\u2019t care. As freaked out as I am, it\u2019s not enough to get me to blow you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The rush of relief he felt almost made him dizzy. \u201cSo we make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be work. A lot of it. We\u2019re too volatile. Too...greedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a thirst you can\u2019t quite quench,\u201d he agreed softly. \u201cThe flip side being that every time you take a drink, it\u2019s the best fucking thing you\u2019ve ever tasted. If that\u2019s not worth working for, what is?\u201d</p><p>Darcy set a hand over her tummy and offered a tremulous smile. \u201cYes. I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>The rest of lunch became a slow exploration of the basics of who they both were. Jared talked about SOG\u2014the Shadow Stalkers, as they were called\u2014and some of the experiences he\u2019d had that he could share. He told her about his sister, Casey, who fell in love every other day and was unable to keep a secret to save her life.</p><p>For his efforts, Darcy talked about growing up in Lion\u2019s Bay, with most of her anecdotes featuring her sister, Danielle. He learned quickly that he\u2019d pegged the sisters right. Darcy was the troublemaker; Danielle was the good girl.</p><p>Jared was sorry when the meal ended, wishing the day was already over so he could take her home to bed. The sharp bite of lust for her was always with him, but it was the sense that he was really inside her when they made love that he craved. She was cool and collected everywhere...except in bed with him. When he was inside her, he knew he had all of her. Every fascinating centimeter of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to freshen up before we go,\u201d she said when the check came.</p><p>\u201cMeet you outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just shouldered his way past the dwindling line at the front when his cell phone rang. Pulling it out, he didn\u2019t recognize the number. \u201cCameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy Cameron, Special Agent Michelle Kelley here. Your partner left a message that you had some questions for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Kelley, yes. Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I wanted to ask you about your impressions of Lion\u2019s Bay and its residents, particularly anyone who struck you oddly.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s a small town, Deputy. Everyone there is a bit odd in one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Small town. What are the odds that two sets of Feds would end up there, investigating crimes with known MOs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZilch,\u201d Kelley said bluntly. \u201cBut the MO of our Unsub was off. The basics were textbook perfect. It was the details that deviated to an unacceptable degree. I liked the mystery boyfriend, but we never got close to him. Never even dug up a name. In a town that small, where everyone knows everything, no one knew the victim had a man in her life. Not even the sister, who was\u2014by all accounts\u2014very close to her. But then, she hadn\u2019t known the victim was six weeks pregnant, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, got to me, too. I don\u2019t see how this is helpful to you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t.\u201d He adjusted his grip on his camera. \u201cThe arsonist is familiar with the area. He\u2019s got a local\u2019s knowledge, but no one is pointing any fingers. I thought maybe someone might\u2019ve rubbed you the wrong way, give me someone to look at.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Deputy. I wish I had something for you, but the residents of that town gave up nothing. That case still haunts me. What was done to the victim...She was so young and pretty. A vet, for God\u2019s sake. Lived in Lion\u2019s Bay her whole\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA veterinarian?\u201d The sounds of the traffic and conversations faded from Jared\u2019s perception, leaving a stunned silence. \u201cMichaels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Dr. Danielle Michaels.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter nine</p><p>Darcy slid behind the wheel of her car and tucked her legs in as Jared closed the door behind her. He rounded the trunk and reached through the open top to set his camera on the backseat, then climbed in beside her.</p><p>\u201cWanna stop by your sister\u2019s place?\u201d he asked, looking out the windshield. \u201cShe\u2019s in Seattle, right?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, then let it out. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Backing out of the parking garage spot, she hit the road. Her grip was too tight on the steering wheel, but she couldn\u2019t ease up. There was a block of ice in her gut and her throat was tight. It didn\u2019t matter how many times she saw Dani\u2019s headstone, it still had the power to break something inside her.</p> <p>When they drove through the open wrought iron gates of the cemetery, Jared reached over and set his hand on her thigh. The knot inside her loosened. She set her hand over his and squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019re not surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was when I found out.\u201d He glanced at her, pushing up his shades so she could see his eyes. \u201cNow I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re letting me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>His fingers linked with hers. \u201cIs it so bad? Letting someone in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m...grateful. It\u2019s just...I can\u2019t come here with my parents. They need me to be okay. And I try to be. For them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDani was half of me.\u201d</p><p>She followed the road for a couple miles, then pulled over to the side and parked. They got out and she led him across the lawn to the Michaels family plot. Jared didn\u2019t say anything as she stood over Dani\u2019s grave and felt her eyes burn. He just came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist, setting his chin on her shoulder. They were there a long time, long enough for her to find her voice and tell him about the early-morning call that had irrevocably changed her life.</p><p>\u201cThere was talk of a boyfriend,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know who he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know him,\u201d she said grimly. \u201cI just don\u2019t know his name. When Dani made it clear his identity was a secret, I knew he was someone familiar to me and she didn\u2019t want me razzing her about him. That\u2019s a big reason why I moved back to Lion\u2019s Bay after she died. I wanted to figure out who he was and what he might know. I thought he\u2019d come forward by now...that just looking at me every day would shake him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how fucking dangerous that is?\u201d His voice was rough with fury. He turned her around to face his glare. \u201cAfter what was done to her?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d identified her sister\u2019s body, although everyone in town had known who Dani was and one look at Darcy\u2019s identical face proved it. The coroner had draped Dani\u2019s body in a sheet from the neck down, but Darcy was aware of what the Prophet was known for...the sick mutilations he did to his victims\u2019 bodies. \u201cI can\u2019t let Dani go while her killer\u2019s still out there, Jared. And honestly, with her gone, I\u2019m half dead anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I\u2019ve been inside you. When I\u2019m touching you...fucking you...you\u2019re so alive you burn me up with it. I see you trying to get out of this shell you\u2019re just surviving in, living a life that doesn\u2019t suit you one damn bit.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m going to get him, Darcy. He\u2019s going to pay for putting that look in your eyes. I promise you that. Let me do my job. Let me keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing picked up. \u201cYou think he\u2019s in Lion\u2019s Bay, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s likely, yes. The candy shop\u2014your sister have any connection with that?\u201d</p><p>Darcy frowned. \u201cShe was a customer. Dani had a sweet tooth. She stopped by there almost every day to buy a dollar or two of candy to carry around in her lab coat. And we celebrated our twelfth birthdays there. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery place our torch has hit has been tied to your sister in some way. You being in Lion\u2019s Bay is shaking this guy up, sweetheart. He\u2019s systematically wiping your sister off the map. First by taking her out, then by taking out places associated with her.\u201d</p><p>She caught him by the wrists. \u201cIf he wants Dani gone, why not take out the woman who looks like her?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s gaze darkened. \u201cIf I\u2019m right, he\u2019s saving that pleasure for last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI KNOW HOW it sounds,\u201d Jared muttered into his cell phone as they entered Darcy\u2019s house.</p><p>She watched him cross through her kitchen into her living room, then begin to pace. Something inside her shifted as she watched him move, his stride powerful and predatory yet utterly silent. Armed and dangerous. A trained hunter. And he was now on the hunt for the man who\u2019d killed Dani. The morass of emotions churning in her tummy had no outlet and she had no way of dealing with them. She\u2019d never felt like this before.</p><p>Because he was also hunting her. Deliberately. Systematically. And he wasn\u2019t going to stop until he\u2019d captured her. She wasn\u2019t going to let him stop.</p><p>Whatever it was she felt for him, it was important. With a little time, a little compromise, and with no effort at all, she could fall in love with him. And part of her really, really wanted to. Wanted to experience the magic she\u2019d only ever felt faint echoes of. She could have it with him. He wanted it, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got on your plate now?\u201d he asked his partner, running a hand through his hair. \u201cOkay. Good. When you head back to the hotel, give me a buzz and I\u2019ll meet you there. We\u2019ll order pizza and tear into this.\u201d</p><p>He was hanging up when she walked past him toward the bedroom, their eyes meeting in a long meaningful glance. She gave him a cheery smile because she didn\u2019t want him to worry any more than he already was. He\u2019d been even edgier than usual since they\u2019d left the cemetery; he didn\u2019t need any more on his plate.</p><p>She was crying silently before she reached the bedroom. She closed the door far enough that there was no gap, but didn\u2019t push it all the way\u2014she didn\u2019t want him to mistake her desire for privacy as a desire to shut him out. Then she undressed and entered the bathroom through the door in the master bedroom. Forgoing the bath, despite how tempting it looked, she got in the shower and welcomed the brief shock of cold before the heat kicked in with a vengeance.</p><p>The tears flowed freely, mingling with the water. Darcy stood directly beneath the spray, letting it course down her face like a veil, hoping to prevent puffy eyes that would give her away. She hadn\u2019t cried since the flight that brought her home to Dani\u2019s dead body lying in the morgue. She knew she was due, but that didn\u2019t make the dam burst any easier to bear.</p><p>She felt him come in behind her and was grateful he couldn\u2019t know that she was falling apart. Setting her hands on the tile in front of her, she bent her head as if she was directing the strength of the spray on her neck.</p><p>Jared\u2019s arms embraced her and he curled around her curved back. He didn\u2019t say anything when an unexpected sob shuddered through her.</p><p>She tried to shake him off, feeling stupid. \u201cI need a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake all the time you need.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t let go, she found her mouth curving ruefully. She turned in his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re a menace.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was trained to press every advantage.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked, her grief lifting at the gleam in his eyes. His beautiful face was stern and his sinner\u2019s mouth unyielding. Such a hard man in so many ways, yet he could be tender. She\u2019d like to see him with the sister he spoke of with gruff fondness and the parents he clearly admired and loved deeply.</p><p>His hands cupped her face, his thumbs brushing at her cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine your pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still crying, she realized when the rough pads of his fingers stroked over her face again. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said hoarsely, \u201cI was trying to spare you a weepy woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. My job\u2019s going to put enough between us as it is. We need to be brutal with the rest in order to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a guy who doesn\u2019t do relationships, you seem to have a good handle on how they work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a good handle on what I need.\u201d His fierce blue gaze riveted her. \u201cI expect that you\u2019ll tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>Her hands slid down his damp back, caressing the hard slabs of muscle bracketing his spine. Steam billowed around them, but the warmth she felt came from inside her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I need. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo while I\u2019m out tonight, think about it. Just make sure I\u2019m in there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be wishing you were in me.\u201d She reached between them and fisted his erection. \u201cYou\u2019re a deadly weapon all by yourself. Did you know that, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>He snorted, his grip tightening on her hips.</p><p>\u201cI bet there isn\u2019t a woman alive who\u2019s said no to you in your life. I\u2019m just one of the many to fall under your irascible charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking. You\u2019re a man-eater.\u201d</p><p>With a two-handed grip, Darcy stroked him from root to tip. Her gaze lowered to the thick column of flesh in her hands, her heartbeat quickening at the impressive length and thick network of veins that coursed along it. It was a brutal-looking instrument of pleasure, as primal as Jared\u2019s sexuality. That dichotomy\u2014his powerfully elegant build and fallen-angel face paired with a curt temperament and raunchy sensuality\u2014fascinated her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat a lovely idea,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Backing up a step, she sat on the tiled bench seat. It put her eye level with the object of her desire, which caused a hot flutter in her belly. She licked her lips, surprised at how turned on she was.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cYou\u2019re not sucking my dick.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cThe hell I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He slapped her hands away when she tried to tug him closer. \u201cChrist, Darcy. You were just bawling your eyes out. The only reason I\u2019m naked is because I haven\u2019t got a change of clothes and the only way to get to you was to get wet.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched with the urge to grin. He looked so affronted. As sexual as their relationship was, it wasn\u2019t all he wanted from her. That was good to know. Wonderful actually. Because as much as she wanted his body, she wanted more from him, too.</p><p>She pointed at his cock. \u201cHe\u2019s ready to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s new? I\u2019ve had a perpetual hard-on since I met you. Since I first laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cause the problem; let me take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem and I don\u2019t want you to take care of it,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI want to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Darcy held his gaze, let him see the clarity of her eyes. The ache in her chest would never totally go away, she knew, but it was easier to bear than it had been just that morning. That she could feel differently was a miracle to her after living with it unchanged for so long, that her chronic pain could be alleviated at all. God...it had been so nice to lean on someone in the cemetery and have her grief accepted without reservation. \u201cYou wanted to make me feel better and I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that.\u201d He scowled. \u201cI\u2019m a selfish bastard. I wanted to make myself feel better. Seeing you hurting was killing me. Watching you suck me off would make me feel worse. Hell...I\u2019m not a douche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I give you the impression that I was the type who went down on a guy without really wanting to?\u201d</p><p>His scowl grew fiercer.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Her gaze lowered. Her mouth watered. \u201cYou have the most perfect cock, Jared. Did you know that? It\u2019s a thing of beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scrambled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m ridiculously pleased with myself. I managed to snag exclusive access rights to your delicious body, which I\u2019d like to exert now.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved to grip the object of her desire. His fingers curled around it and stroked from root to tip. \u201cI have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo stop lagging and let me have it.\u201d</p><p>Releasing himself, he stepped forward and cupped her face in his hands. He searched her features, his gaze softening. \u201cAre you okay, Darcy? Really okay? Or are you feeling shaky?\u201d</p><p>She caught him by the wrists. \u201cI think you\u2019re feeling shakier than I am. I\u2019ve had three years to deal with this. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s been blindsided by a cold case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a hot woman.\u201d His thumbs slid gently over her cheekbones. \u201cYou\u2019re an occupational hazard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStep a little closer and I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>One of his hands slid down, the pad of his thumb gliding across her parted lips. \u201cYou already have.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop her when she reached for him again. He set one hand on the tile above her head and turned down the temperature of the water with the other. The spray beat down on his right side, running in rivulets down his muscular torso and washboard abs. She started there first, tracing the ridges with her tongue, her hands caressing his cock with soft, gentle pulls.</p><p>Jared\u2019s palms pressed flat to the wall, his head hanging over her, his breath quickening. As his skin heated beneath her hands, his raw sexuality slipped its chain. She could almost see its smoky tendrils curl around her, intoxicating her. Primitive need burned in her blood, melting what few inhibitions she had. She was like a bitch in heat with him and she liked it, liked the wanton freedom his acceptance gave her.</p><p>Fisting him, she made him harder, made him shudder. She nuzzled his cock with one cheek and then the other, before moving lower to fondle his balls with her lips.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he gasped, his cock jerking her grip.</p><p>Darcy took one full, heavy testicle into her mouth, sucking gently, rolling it around with her tongue. He was such a primal male. Big and hard and virile everywhere. There was a part of her that reveled in that, celebrating her claim on such a potently desirable masculine creature.</p><p>His thighs began to shake, his lungs heaving. \u201cPayback\u2019s a bitch, Darcy. Stop torturing me and suck it, sweetheart. Suck my cock in that hot little mouth.\u201d</p><p>She purred and pumped him with a two-fisted grip. She wanted to eat him up, every mouthwatering inch of him.</p><p>One of his hands cupped the back of her head, his fingers flexing spastically in the soaked strands of her hair. \u201cWrap your lips around me, Darcy baby. Yes...just like that.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth flowed over the thick crest, her eyes closing at the feel and taste of him. Warm satin over stone. Her tongue rubbed the sensitive underside of his cock head, every sense focused on his responses. His low groans. The tension gripping him. The sound of his teeth grinding.</p><p>\u201cSo good,\u201d he bit out. \u201cYour mouth is so damn good...hot...fucking perfect. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>She sucked hard on the wide, sensitive crown, moaning as a hot wash of pre-cum spilled over her tongue and made her ravenous for more. She stroked him with her hands, milking him, as his other hand tangled in her hair. His hips began to move, his grip holding her still. He fucked her mouth at the depth and pace he needed, his hips lunging in a steady unfaltering tempo, his stomach clenching and releasing as his cock slid in and out.</p><p>Darcy looked up at him, their eyes meeting. Holding. As raw as the encounter was\u2014her mouth filled with his thrusting cock, his abdomen sheened with water and sweat, the muscles flexing powerfully\u2014it was intimate in deeper ways. His pleasure was hers, hot and sweet. Fierce.</p><p>He hissed when her cheeks hollowed. He swelled further, making her pussy ache to feel him tunneling deep into her. \u201cShit. Just like that, sweetheart. Suck it just like that...I\u2019m gonna come so hard for you.\u201d</p><p>Her pussy spasmed as his flavor sharpened. She moaned and squirmed, so turned on by an act that had never gotten her hot and bothered before. She liked it well enough, but it\u2019d never aroused her to a fever pitch, never burned her with the stark eroticism of the act.</p><p>His fingers tightened in her hair. His face twisted in a grimace of agonized pleasure. \u201cFuck yeah...you\u2019re making me come.\u201d</p><p>Greedy, she sucked him like a woman possessed. Her head bobbing. Working the pulsing length with both lips and hands. Urging the furious spurts of semen to flood her mouth. Jared shouted a curse, his entire body wracked with violent spasms as he released stream after stream of hot, thick cum over her stroking tongue, his hips pumping his spending cock to the back of her throat.</p><p>His hands were shaking when he finished, when he tried to pull her off. She continued gently sucking, wanting everything he had. Every drop of his pleasure. Moaning in triumph when she pulled one last pulse of semen from his still-rigid flesh.</p><p>She was startled when he hauled her up and pushed her against the chilly tile, his hand dipping between her legs to thrust two long fingers into her. He took her mouth, his tongue delving into the depths that tasted of him, his moan of pleasure vibrating against her lips.</p><p>Hooking her leg over his, he set his foot on the bench, stealing her balance and opening her completely. His fingers began to rub inside her, sliding through the silky skeins of her desire, expertly finding all the tender spots and capturing her gasps of pleasure in his mouth.</p><p>Darcy clung to his shoulders, her nails digging in as he pressed his taut frame against her and pushed every thought from her head but him. \u201cJared\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking sexy,\u201d he growled, his fingers sliding free of her pussy to rub the pucker of her ass. \u201cYou make me so hard. I\u2019ve never been this hot for a woman, never felt like I\u2019d die if I didn\u2019t touch her. Taste her. Make her come screaming my name.\u201d</p><p>She cried out as one finger slid into her rear, only to retreat and come back with two fingers. Ferocious pleasure pumped through her with the maddened beat of her heart.</p><p>Watching her with that fierce blue gaze, he pushed deep, then withdrew. \u201cOnly you, Darcy. You\u2019re the only one to make me want to crawl out of my skin and into yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cIn me.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were driving her mad, fucking her anally with a steady, wickedly knowledgeable tempo. Her hips circled without her volition, trying to get him deeper. Harder. As close as they were, it wasn\u2019t close enough.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be in you, sweetheart,\u201d he promised darkly, his breath gusting fast and hard over her ear. \u201cBare and deep. I\u2019m gonna pump you full of hot, thick cum while I\u2019m riding your ass as hard as you can take it. Pounding into you until I can\u2019t tell where I end and you begin. You turn me into an animal, Darcy. You make me want to invent new ways to fuck just so I can own every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s thumb slid into her pussy and she cried out, so close to orgasm it was painful. Even the cool water couldn\u2019t cool the fever for him in her blood, a need that grew with every hour she knew him.</p><p>He caught her breast in his free hand, squeezing with a tenderness so at odds with the ferocity of his passion. She gripped the back of his head with both hands and ate at his mouth, sucking his tongue and moaning as the orgasm hit her with the force of a hurricane. He choked out her name as she tightened around his thrusting fingers, her body trembling so violently she thought she might break apart into thousands of tiny pieces.</p><p>It was Jared who held her together as the pleasure raced across her nerve endings like an electrical charge. He sank onto the bench and pulled her into his lap, his arms banding around her as she shivered with sweet, fiery aftershocks.</p><p>Chapter ten </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared finished his list of unusual package deliveries to investigate and began gathering up the items he needed to take with him to the motel. When Darcy\u2019s doorbell rang, he straightened and moved toward it, waving her back when she headed for it, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been perfectly safe for three years now,\u201d she reminded dryly, but she backed off and let him get it.</p><p>Finding Jim Ralston on her doorstep with a six-pack of beer in his hands made Jared immediately irritable. He\u2019d never been the possessive type, certainly had never cared who his lovers had fucked before he\u2019d come along. But the animalistic drive to claim Darcy as exclusively and irrevocably his extended beyond the bedroom. He fought it back with effort.</p><p>\u201cInspector,\u201d he greeted the man.</p> <p>\u201cDeputy,\u201d Ralston returned, his eyes lit with amusement. He was dressed casually in black jeans and a button-up shirt that was rolled up at the sleeves and open at the throat. His civilian clothes made him look younger and gave Jared his first inkling of what might\u2019ve prompted Darcy to have a friends-with-benefits relationship with the man.</p><p>Darcy rounded Jared with a welcoming smile. \u201cCome in, Jim. Ah, and you come bearing gifts. Deputy Cameron\u2019s heading out for pizza with his partner, which has got me craving some. You up for that?\u201d</p><p>Ralston stepped into the house, the storm door gliding closed behind him. \u201cI\u2019ll have to take a rain check. I\u2019ve got a date with the insurance adjustor who\u2019s looking over Nadine\u2019s shop. She called after I\u2019d already left the house to say she was running late, so instead of driving all the way back and waiting around, I figured I\u2019d make a pit stop here until she calls again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes brightened. \u201cYeah, a hot date trumps pizza. Good for you.\u201d</p><p>Returning to the coffee table, Jared grabbed what he needed along with the keys to the BMW. \u201cI\u2019ll be no more than a few hours. I\u2019ll call if I\u2019ll be back later than that.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy came to him, looking just as hot in stretchy pants and a V-neck T-shirt as she had in the red dress she\u2019d worn to lunch. \u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk me out.\u201d He glanced at Ralston, feeling marginally better knowing the man was going out to get laid tonight. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you tomorrow, Inspector. Go over a few things with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Ralston gave a curt nod. \u201cBuzz me and we\u2019ll work out a time.\u201d</p><p>When they reached Darcy\u2019s car, Jared dropped his stuff in the back through the open roof, then turned toward her to catch her close. He brushed his lips across hers and murmured, \u201cWhen Ralston leaves, lock up the house.\u201d</p><p>She looked prepared to argue, then seemed to think better of it. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been my pleasure, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back quick as I can.\u201d He smacked her ass cheeks with both hands and squeezed playfully, lifting her to her toes against him. \u201cSet out some lube on the bedside table. Bottled water, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a machine.\u201d</p><p>Flushed and sporting kiss-swollen lips, she looked like a woman who\u2019d been fucked long and well. It suited her. If he had his way, she\u2019d be looking just like that every day from here on out.</p><p>She grinned as if she knew his thoughts. \u201cLucky for you, I can take it.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his temple to hers, needing her safe and happy and close. He needed the time and space to explore the connection between them, both physical and emotional.</p><p>Backing away, Jared admitted that his emotions were still raw from their interlude in the shower. She was deep under his skin already. \u201cYeah, lucky me.\u201d</p><p>WAVING, DARCY WATCHED Jared drive away in the car that was her last real piece of her former life. She clung to it for that reason and because she loved it. Thankfully, her parents owned the house outright and she didn\u2019t have to pay rent. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford to keep the car with what the town paid her.</p> <p>\u201cThings are moving pretty fast with you two,\u201d Jim said, coming out of the front door with an open beer in each hand.</p><p>She accepted the one he handed her and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d</p><p>Together they walked back up to her porch and sat on the swinging bench. With one leg tucked beneath her and the other on the ground, she rocked them gently.</p><p>\u201cHe likens it to being smacked upside the head,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to say, I did feel like I\u2019d been sucker-punched when I first saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing the women around town talking about him. I gathered he\u2019s considered very attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat helps. But it\u2019s not everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d He tipped his bottle back and took a long drink, the muscles of his tanned throat working with each swallow.</p><p>She looked away. The sky was deepening into shades of pink, purple, and navy blue. The breeze grew in strength, cooling slightly and carrying a tinge of salt from the nearby ocean. \u201cWe\u2019re due for another fire, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just sitting here. Makes me so goddamn mad that we know he\u2019s out there and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy Cameron thinks Dani\u2019s murder and the fires are connected.\u201d</p><p>Jim froze, his green eyes going wide. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can explain it better than I can, which is why he wants to hook up with you tomorrow, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m speechless. Not a conclusion I would\u2019ve jumped to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Darcy took a pull on her beer. \u201cFucking insane. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over, he set his hand on her bent knee. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This has got to be really tough for you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the spot where her car had been and thought about Jared. Knowing he was working on Dani\u2019s case was keeping her grounded and, for the first time in a long time, optimistic. Placing her hand over his, she squeezed. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Been a long time since I was able to say that and mean it.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded as the sheriff\u2019s vehicle pulled up in front of her house. She watched as Chris got out and put his hat on his head, his gaze holding hers as he shut the door of his cruiser and rounded the front end. \u201cHey, Darcy. Jim.\u201d</p><p>Jim returned the greeting, but she waited until Chris joined them on the porch, his boot-clad feet thudding heavily over the wooden planks and his leather holster creaking.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you out this way?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Chris cursed under his breath. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his partner. Working the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Did you know he thinks Dani\u2019s murder is related to your arsonist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in town two damn days and he\u2019s going to wrap up a cold case along with the arsons? That\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose at his vehemence, but she wasn\u2019t overly surprised. Chris didn\u2019t like others digging into his cases and she couldn\u2019t blame him. She knew how she\u2019d feel in his shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s an angle, but it\u2019s not his only angle. I watched him compiling information\u2014he\u2019s covering a lot of bases.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, Jim set his elbows on his knees, holding his beer in both hands. \u201cChris.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way Jim said his name had Chris stiffening. Darcy frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Chris snapped.</p><p>Jim stared at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Ralston. You don\u2019t know shit.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s gaze shot back and forth between the two men. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t he know, Chris?\u201d</p><p>Chris glared at Jim. \u201cNothing. Absolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>Putting both feet on the deck, she stood. \u201cThat\u2019s crap. Don\u2019t lie to me. Not about this.\u201d</p><p>Jim pushed off the swing, too. \u201cDani told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Chris ripped the hat off his head. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDani told you what?\u201d she demanded, her temper flaring.</p><p>Jim kept looking at Chris. \u201cIt\u2019s going to circle back around to person of interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Ralston,\u201d Chris shot back, turning to leave.</p><p>Darcy focused on Jim. \u201cJim?\u201d</p><p>As his mouth opened to reply, his cell phone rang. \u201cDamn it. Hang on, Darcy.\u201d He stepped to the other side of the porch to take the call.</p><p>She set her beer on the little glass table by the swing and watched as Chris stalked back to his cruiser. She followed. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Then it hit her. Person of interest. There had been only one person of interest in Dani\u2019s case...</p><p>\u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it, Chris? You were the one seeing Dani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Damn it.\u201d He spun around halfway down her front walkway, his face red and eyes fierce. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s heart raced. \u201cWhat was it like, then, Chris?\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her when she came to a stop in front of him, his handsome face taut with strain. \u201cShe changed after you left, Darcy. A lot. She started dressing different, acting different, styled her hair and makeup different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were attracted to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d He crossed his arms, looking ornery and defensive. \u201cYou\u2019re the one I want. No one\u2019s like you, Darcy. What we had...You can\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t think about it. We couldn\u2019t get enough of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Chris.\u201d She exhaled harshly. \u201cWe were kids. Teenagers for god\u2019s sake. We were hormonal, and frankly, there wasn\u2019t much else to do around this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still get hard thinking about the things we did. Your mouth and hands on me...the noises you make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that have to do with Dani?\u201d Her sister wasn\u2019t like her. She had been softer, sweeter. Sex had been highly personal for her. Darcy enjoyed sex for sex; Dani had equated sex with emotional commitment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe stopped by my house one night. Dressed like you, smelling like you. She came on to me like a freight train. I couldn\u2019t help but think of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God...\u201d Darcy turned away, feeling sick.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe me. You\u2019re thinking Dani wasn\u2019t like that. She was the quiet one, the good girl. But she wasn\u2019t that way after you left. It was as if she wanted to be you.\u201d</p> <p>She barked out a humorless laugh. \u201cPlease. Dani was perfectly happy being Dani.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her by the arm, squeezing hard enough to bruise her, yanking her back around. His face was so hard and furious she recoiled from it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jim yelled from the porch. \u201cWatch it, Miller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one banging her,\u201d Chris bit out, releasing her. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not the one who knocked her up.\u201d</p><p>She slapped him before she knew she was going to.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t want to do that again.\u201d His voice was low and deep, his gaze dark and hot. The imprint of her hand glowed red on his cheek, intensifying the look of fury on his face.</p><p>Her tummy quivered with fear.</p><p>\u201cThere was someone else,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI gave her what she wanted that night and once more afterward. That was enough for me. She wasn\u2019t you, couldn\u2019t even come close. It was done and over long before six weeks prior to her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole. A Grade A prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor taking what was thrown in my face? Repeatedly? Does it make you feel better to lie to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing can make this better.\u201d She backed away.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking look at me like that.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cYou know me. You know I couldn\u2019t do what was done to her.\u201d</p><p>The awful thing was, she couldn\u2019t imagine anyone she knew hurting Darcy the way she\u2019d been hurt. But what did she really know about anyone, if Chris could\u2019ve hidden this from her?</p><p>Jim came up beside her, his hand gently gripping her elbow. \u201cYou should go now, Sheriff,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cGo find Deputy Cameron and tell him what he needs to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy...\u201d Chris stared at her for a long minute, then cursed under his breath. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this. We need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back on him and walked to the house.</p><p>\u201cTHAT\u2019S THE WACKIEST theory I\u2019ve heard in a long time,\u201d Trish said bluntly. \u201cMaybe ever. You\u2019re trying to pin first-degree murder and arson on the same subject, with years in between crimes. It\u2019s highly unlikely.\u201d</p><p>Jared met her gaze and nodded grimly. \u201cI know. But there are connections. After looking over Kelley\u2019s notes, I found out Danielle\u2019s obstetrician\u2019s office is catty-corner to the phone booth where the tip came in for the shelter fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be coincidence.\u201d She sat back in her chair at the small table in her motel room and rubbed the back of her neck, her dark eyes capped with a frown. \u201cThink of the premeditation required to copy both the Prophet\u2019s and Merkerson\u2019s MOs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve requested a cross-check of library lendings of true crime stories on both. It\u2019s a long shot, but at least we\u2019ll tie off that thread.\u201d He looked at his laptop screen and the case files Kelley had sent his way. \u201cThere was DNA from the fetus, but not one man in this town\u2014regardless of age\u2014volunteered a sample to rule himself out. Not one? And no probable cause on anyone to justify a warrant, because no one pointed a finger anywhere. Everyone knows everyone\u2019s business in this town, but not who\u2019s intimate with the vet, a woman who\u2019s lived here her whole life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t believe he\u2019s one of them. Everyone\u2019s innocent, so there\u2019s no one to be guilty.\u201d She sighed and grabbed another slice of pizza out of the box they\u2019d tossed on the bed. \u201cSmall towns. When everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business, they can\u2019t believe there\u2019s something they don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you speak from experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up in a small town. Some things are universal.\u201d</p><p>He filed that information away for further pondering. \u201cOur subject has no imagination. He hasn\u2019t been thinking about killing and burning for years, as we\u2019d expect, or he\u2019d have his own pattern, his own style. Instead he has to borrow someone else\u2019s, right down to the tiniest details. And when he\u2019s done what he set out to do, he puts the urge away. Goes back to being himself. Forgets about it. Because he\u2019s crazy as a loon, but his crazy doesn\u2019t eat at him every day. Something has to set it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we need to figure out what set him off. Maybe it was the baby the first time around. Maybe the guy\u2019s married. That\u2019s why they kept the relationship under wraps. I\u2019ll look up the men in this town who were married at the time and see what shakes loose.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her. \u201cWe also need to find out what happened in the last year or so that set off the fires, with a cushion for the learning curve required to build those incendiary devices. Then we can try and tie that back to the murder. I\u2019ve already started searching through the local paper\u2019s archived articles on the web, but they didn\u2019t have a website three years ago, so I\u2019ll have to hit the microfiche at the library if we need to go back further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wide net we\u2019re casting.\u201d Trish wiped her mouth with a napkin.</p><p>\u201cInspector Michaels is working on drafting a list of locales in town that had some special tie or significance to her sister. All three locations so far met that criterion.\u201d He closed his laptop. \u201cWe\u2019ll need Miller to cover surveillance on the best options.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cThat may be asking a little too much from our friendly sheriff. He didn\u2019t take it well when I mentioned your theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d Jared pushed back from the table and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll meet up with him tomorrow and get him on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going back to the inspector\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Grinning, she held up her hands. \u201cJust surprised is all. You\u2019re different with her, in a good way. I hope it works out.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d do whatever was necessary to make sure it worked out.</p><p>He was shoving his laptop into the padded sleeve in his workbag when a faint hiss caught his awareness. He stiffened as the hairs on his nape prickled with warning. His nose twitched; his gaze darted to the door, then to the vent in the wall near the ceiling. Sleek tendrils of smoke reached into the room like skeletal fingers, curling sinuously. He yanked the bedspread off the mattress, sending what was left of the pizza flying, and tossed the floral material over Trish\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Cameron?\u201d she gasped as the fire sprinklers in the ceiling sputtered to life. She lifted the comforter over both their heads, shielding the table as he swept everything into his open bag.</p><p>He\u2019d barely yanked the door open when the room exploded.</p><p>Chapter eleven</p><p>Darcy forced herself to loosen her white-knuckled grip on her phone. \u201cHow could no one know about Chris and Dani, Nadine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. I can\u2019t believe it. How could I not know? I didn\u2019t even suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Chris is the sheriff. If anyone would know how to cover their ass, I guess it\u2019d be him. Not because he killed her. I could never believe that. If anything, he hid it because he knew he\u2019d blow any shot at getting back together with you if you found out he\u2019d tagged Dani.\u201d</p><p>Inhaling a deep shaky breath, Darcy swiped at the tears coursing down her cheeks. It was impossibly painful hearing that Dani had changed so much. She still couldn\u2019t quite believe it, couldn\u2019t in any way picture it. \u201cWhat the hell was she thinking? Did she love him? She had to have...How long had she loved him? And if he\u2019s telling the truth about ending it long before she got pregnant, who else was in her life?\u201d</p><p>Nadine sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe she missed you. Or maybe she\u2019d been jealous of you for a while. Jealousy can make a woman lose her mind. Or maybe she was just stretching her wings and she took your example to the extreme. I\u2019m not a shrink, doll. Or a psychic. I don\u2019t have the answers for you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to come over? Or is your hunky deputy with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you, Nadine. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d She hung up, gasping for air and drowning in grief as if she\u2019d lost Dani all over again. She\u2019d sent Jim off on his date, then she\u2019d locked herself in the house, feeling too exposed to associate with anyone but Jared, who\u2019d already seen her bared to the soul.</p><p>Clinging to the receiver, she paced, fighting the urge to call him. He had more important things to do than listen to her breakdown. Besides, their relationship was so new and had already been weighted by heavy issues. The least she could do was give him a little time to get away from her and do his job in peace.</p><p>She jumped when the phone rang in her hand. Glancing at the caller ID, she saw it was dispatch and her stomach clenched.</p><p>Another fire goddamnit.</p><p>\u201cMichaels,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>Her heart missed one beat, then stuttered back into a panicked rhythm. \u201cMy God...\u201d</p><p>DARCY SAW THE smoke and flashing emergency lights long before she reached the scene. She parked her work truck on the street and hopped out, her heart racing as it had been since she\u2019d received the call from dispatch twenty minutes prior. Not having a car had held her back, forcing her to beg the use of one from a neighbor to get to the fire station.</p><p>Jared.</p><p>She climbed out of the department\u2019s truck and grabbed her field kit, forcing herself not to run or appear as panicked as she felt. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to lose him now. It was too soon. She\u2019d had only a taste of what he could bring to her life. Not nearly enough...</p><p>Her attempt at decorum was forgotten the moment she saw him sitting on the back of an ambulance with an EMT examining him. Her pace picked up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although he couldn\u2019t possibly have heard her coming with all the chaos around them, his head lifted and his gaze met hers. He pushed to his feet, saying something to the female paramedic without taking his bloodshot eyes off Darcy. He was soot-stained but alive, making him the most beautiful thing she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Shoving her kit at a passing firefighter with a hasty thanks, she broke into a run. Jared met her halfway, catching her up and squeezing the air out of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou scared me half to death.\u201d She held on to him with every bit of her strength. \u201cI c-can\u2019t let you out of my sight for a minute.\u201d</p><p>He cupped the back of her head and pressed her close. They clung that way for a long moment, their hearts pounding in a synchronized beat. The cold knot in her stomach eased at the feel of him against her, warm and strong.</p><p>She pulled back to examine him. \u201cHow\u2019s your partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough to be in the front office typing up a prelim report. This riled her up.\u201d He brushed his fingertips over her brows. \u201cWalk me through the scene with you. The sooner we get through it, the sooner we can get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Darcy drew herself together with a deep breath, then stepped back and went in search of her kit. Her hands were shaking as she reached for the box.</p> <p>Chris intercepted her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn his date. He knows what\u2019s going on. I told him I\u2019d handle it, and if I had any trouble, I\u2019d give him a call.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then yanked off his hat to shove a hand through his hair. \u201cHell, Darcy. Five of the rooms were occupied. A half dozen people could\u2019ve been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anyone seriously injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTear gas in the air duct system pushed everyone out before the fire started.\u201d</p><p>Jared stepped into Chris\u2019s line of sight. \u201cYou keep tear gas in inventory, Sheriff?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlready looking into it, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the two-story building, noting the area with the most damage. \u201cThe fire started in Morales\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>Jared set a grimy hand on her shoulder and squeezed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She reached up and set her hand over his, needing to deepen the connection.</p><p>Chris\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cSomeone wants you dead, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first somebody.\u201d The raspiness of Jared\u2019s voice made her wince in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cLet me do my job,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see if we can find something that gets us closer to figuring out who our torch is.\u201d</p><p>She moved toward the obvious point of origin with a brisk stride.</p> <p>Jared drew abreast of her. \u201cYou\u2019re aggravated with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things have come up since I saw you last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me about it when we get home.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS JUST after midnight when they got back to Darcy\u2019s house. Jared could see how exhausted she was but knew more than the length of the day was weighting her slender shoulders. He decided not to press her to talk, to let her decide when she was ready to share. She was a solitary woman in many ways. Joining her inner circle was going to take time and patience. The latter wasn\u2019t one of his strong suits, but he\u2019d make the effort for her. Not that he had a choice; he wanted her too much.</p><p>In the meantime, he showered, then made them both some cold sandwiches while she typed her preliminary report for Ralston. When they crawled into bed just after two in the morning, she turned into him, wrapping herself around him. With her legs tangled with his, her palms pressed to his back, and her face in his neck, he dropped into a deep sleep.</p><p>He woke up alone. Glancing at the clock, he noted it was barely six. He left the bed, then the bedroom, looking for Darcy. He found her in the living room, curled up on the couch beneath a chenille throw. She was watching a muted television, her eyes marred by dark circles. An open box sat on the floor by the coffee table, holding a variety of loose items, including framed photos of Darcy and Danielle.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLet me join you.\u201d</p><p>She sat up at his urging and he settled behind her, taking her weight against his chest. He ran his fingers through her hair, brushing it back from her forehead. The feel of her bare skin against his soothed him. As the explosion had thrown him out into the parking lot, his thoughts had been with Darcy and how he\u2019d be damned if some sick asshole blew him to hell before he figured out what he had with her.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Turning her head, she pressed her cheek to his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you want.\u201d He kissed the crown of her head, hating the misery that radiated from her and his helplessness to alleviate it. \u201cI can pull it all together later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much crap can I dump on you, Jared, before you run screaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never scream and I damn sure never run away.\u201d He gripped her shoulders, resisting the urge to give her a little shake. \u201cSpit it out.\u201d</p><p>In a low halting voice, she told him about Miller\u2019s visit and her subsequent talk with Nadine. \u201cI knew she had to be with someone familiar to me, but Chris...? I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t say anything. I wouldn\u2019t have been upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people have secret lives. Their loved ones are shocked when they come to light. It\u2019s no reflection on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help thinking that I fucked up somewhere and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t trust me with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like it was a couple random encounters. Maybe she was embarrassed. Heat-of-the-moment type thing that she regretted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven more reason to tell me, so we could\u2019ve laughed it off and put it away.\u201d She exhaled harshly. \u201cAnd Chris...Wow. He had a responsibility to disclose his affair with her to the Feds. Why didn\u2019t he, if he had nothing to hide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a problem. But at least we\u2019ve got enough to get a DNA sample from him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known him forever. He was my high school sweetheart. I thought I knew him.\u201d Her exhale shuddered out of her. \u201cI wanted to vomit when he said he slept with Darcy as a substitute for me. It\u2019s so sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far would he go to keep you from finding out about it? Especially if he\u2019s the one who got her pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She twisted to look into his eyes. Her gaze was so haunted it gored him like a dull knife.</p><p>\u201cI hate that I was thinking the same thing,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe was important to me at one time. How could I be so wrong about two people I thought I was close to? The Dani I know couldn\u2019t stomach casual sex. She always became emotionally attached when things got physical. And Chris...he\u2019s a sheriff, for chrissakes.\u201d</p><p>Jared brushed his fingertips over her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s killing me that you\u2019re hurting and I can\u2019t do a damn thing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here. That\u2019s what I need more than anything.\u201d Leaning into his palm, she sighed. \u201cThe answers will come later. We\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have a bad breakup shortly before her involvement with Miller?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze softened. \u201cYou really do pay attention when your sister talks, don\u2019t you? Yes, she met a fellow vet at a conference, and it was hot and heavy for a while. Then she found out he was married and that she was just a piece of ass on the side. She took it hard. I thought she\u2019d sworn off men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr became determined to prove she didn\u2019t give a shit about them.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sat up, the throw falling to pool in her lap. \u201cAnd I\u2019m her example for that? What the fuck does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she had issues,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cand she didn\u2019t know you all that well. You like men just fine. You just hadn\u2019t met one you liked enough to get serious about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled deeply at the admission, knowing how important it was to her. And to him.</p><p>She stood, gloriously naked, agitation pouring off her in waves.</p><p>Straightening, he tossed the throw aside and held her gaze. \u201cNone of this is your fault, Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She paced, her lithe muscles flexing through her thighs and buttocks. \u201cYou know, you say \u2018commitment\u2019 and I get butterflies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had commitments before. This one scares you because it\u2019s the last one you\u2019ll have.\u201d He set his elbows on his knees and linked his fingers together. Between his spread legs, his cock was hard and thick, thrusting upward hungrily in appreciation of the sight of his woman. \u201cEven I find that scary.\u201d</p><p>She paused midstride, staring at him. He saw her chest expand on a slow breath and her eyes darken with both grief and longing. Her turmoil was tangible, and unable to bear it, he pushed to his feet. She plowed into him, nearly knocking him back into the couch. Catching him by the nape, she yanked his mouth down to hers. His teeth cut his inner lip and the sharp metallic flavor of blood stirred him violently.</p><p>Lightning in a bottle. It had struck the moment they\u2019d laid eyes on each other. Sexual creatures that they were, they\u2019d both mistaken it as lust at first, and certainly that was a major part of what they knew about each other so far. But lust could be appeased. Sated. What they had ran much deeper, was more voracious than mere desire.</p><p>Gripping her by the elbows, Jared lifted her to her tiptoes and took over the kiss. His lips sealed over hers, his head tilting to find the perfect fit. The stroking of her tongue along his was as arousing as if she\u2019d licked his cock.</p><p>She reached down and grabbed his ass, grinding against him, massaging his dick with the soft firmness of her lower belly. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy.\u201d There\u2019s nothing he wanted to do more, but the rapid-fire switch in her mood gave him pause. He couldn\u2019t afford to screw things up with her. As fragile as she was at the moment, the intensity of their lovemaking could be too much. \u201cEasy, sweetheart. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need you inside me, Jared.\u201d</p><p>He caught her face in his hands. \u201cLet me set the pace. I know how to give you what you need, when you need it.\u201d</p><p>Her nails dug into his flesh. \u201cI need it now.\u201d</p><p>She dropped to her knees and took him in her mouth. The drenching heat, followed by powerful sucking, nearly sucked the cum right out of him. Her tongue fluttered. Her cheeks hollowed with deep, drawing pulls. Maddened by her greed for his body, his balls drew up tight, the urge to blow his load almost too great to resist.</p><p>Catching her beneath the arms, Jared yanked her up. If he didn\u2019t get a handle on her, she\u2019d have him so spiked he\u2019d bang her on the couch again, rutting on the woman he was falling in love with like an animal in heat. On any other day there\u2019d be no problem with that, but not today. Today they both needed more than a quick, furious orgasm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this in a bed this go-round,\u201d he muttered, lifting her feet from the floor and carrying her to the bedroom. She wrapped her legs around his hips, wiggling, trying to align their bodies. When the satiny soft lips of her cunt slid across the crown of his dick, his step faltered, his chest vibrating with a groan.</p><p>Darcy caught his mouth, latching on to his tongue and sucking. His knees buckled and he cursed, leaning heavily into the wall to keep them both upright. \u201cBehave, damn it. Before I nail you on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...Do it.\u201d</p><p>Cursing, he stumbled into the bedroom and dropped her on the bed. As she dove for his cock again, he snatched his handcuffs from the nightstand and intercepted her. He had her hands restrained at the small of her back before she knew what hit her.</p><p>She froze prone on the bed, her breathing quick and shallow. \u201cWhat are you doing, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacing us, Inspector.\u201d He was going to give her the love and tenderness she needed, by any means necessary.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He ran the pad of his index finger down the length of her spine, finding the sight of handcuffs against her bare back the most erotic view of his life.</p><p>\u201cI want you now.\u201d Her voice was even breathier than usual and it did crazy things to him, taking him to the very edge of his control.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get me now, sweetheart. All you can take and more.\u201d</p><p>Chapter twelve</p><p>Darcy absorbed the feeling of heavy metal around her wrists, then she processed how she felt about it.</p><p>Jared arranged her carefully with effortless strength, until she found her feet on the floor and her torso draped across the mattress. With her hands bound, it was a vulnerable pose. A shiver of anticipation coursed across her skin in a wave of goose bumps.</p><p>His lips whispered along her arm from shoulder to fingertip. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking hot in handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the lust in his voice spurred her into a feverish desire. Her breasts were tender, the nipples furled tightly against her rumpled sheets. Her pussy was damp and swollen, aching for the feel of his big cock pounding into her.</p><p>\u201cJared...I need you.\u201d She felt cold inside. Distant. As if a part of her had shied away and retreated, like it had when Dani died. Jared had lured her out when he\u2019d entered her life, made her start thinking beyond the moment, enabling her to envision a day when she might be able to put Dani\u2019s death behind her and get her life back. She needed him to do it again, make her feel again.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hands slid under her and cupped her breasts. He nuzzled his lips just below her ear. \u201cI need you, too.\u201d</p> <p>He caught her nipples between thumb and forefinger, tugging gently. His cock brushed against her hands and she clasped him, her eyes closing when he groaned and thrust into her touch.</p><p>He was hard as a rock and hot. She squeezed her thighs together, fighting off the building throb. She\u2019d wanted to make him come in her mouth, wanted to hear his pleasure. Taste it. Drink it down.</p><p>\u201cLet me suck you off,\u201d she said in what might have passed for a plea.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Darcy heard him move behind her, felt his hands cupping the backs of her thighs in the crease just below the curves of her buttocks. His breath gusted gently over the slick lips of her sex. She tensed in expectation.</p><p>\u201cSuch a pretty pussy,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m going to eat this cunt every chance I get for the rest of your life, Darcy. I\u2019m going to shove my tongue in your hot little hole and tongue-fuck you so often you\u2019ll feel strange when my mouth\u2019s not buried between your legs.\u201d</p><p>The rawness of his passion for her continued to astonish her. It mirrored her own in a way that felt like...kismet, a concept her rational mind scoffed at. But there was no denying that being with Jared felt like being half of a whole, two individuals drawn to one another by a fiery magnetic pull that was irresistible.</p><p>She bit her lip and quivered violently as he licked leisurely through her cleft, tracing her folds slowly and so gently that the touch of his tongue was like the kiss of a butterfly\u2019s wings. Her hips circled into the teasing strokes, but he wouldn\u2019t be rushed. When he finally pushed into her as he\u2019d promised, she moaned into the bedding, so close to coming she could taste it.</p><p>Pushing her legs apart, Jared opened her farther, thrust his tongue faster, showing her with his greedy voracity how much he loved going down on her, how much pleasure he took in the carnal intimacy. His groans made her hotter. Wild and desperate. His morning stubble scraped along her tender skin; the rough silk of his hair brushed over her in a whisper of a caress. She gasped and writhed, her skin misting with sweat as his tongue fucked relentlessly into her, making her cream for him until her inner thighs were wet with it.</p><p>\u201cMy clit,\u201d she begged, her muscles trembling with the strain. \u201cLick my clit.\u201d</p><p>Instead, he moved in the opposite direction, rimming the pucker of her ass with the pointed tip of his tongue. Darcy cried out, the tight ring of muscle flexing in delight. With a groan, he took her there with a lush dark kiss, pushing into her and thrusting shallowly.</p><p>Aroused beyond bearing, her body shook so hard the mattress vibrated with her, her hands fisting and releasing in mindless spasms. Pushing to her tiptoes on the floor, she lifted into his mouth, urging him on. Her entire body was a live wire, arcing with crackling sensual electricity.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cOh...it\u2019s so good. I\u2019m going to come...\u201d</p><p>Spreading her cheeks with his thumbs, he held her open and pushed her into climax with rapid-fire licks. She ground her sweat-slick face into the sheets, muffling her scream as the release tore through her with brutal power, singeing her nerve endings and flushing her skin like a fever.</p><p>Then his fingers were there, slick with lube, expertly preparing her with deep leisurely thrusts into her rear. She pushed back into his hand, riding those two wicked digits with a barely tempered hunger. They stroked along her smooth inner walls, twisting and pumping until she thought she might go mad with the need to feel him filling her with his big, beautiful cock.</p><p>He stood. His lips touched her shoulder as his fingers left her. \u201cHow are you doing? Your arms okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Not until you beg me to.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of foil crinkling, then the soft snap of latex. When he pushed into her pussy, Darcy jolted in surprise.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he murmured, steadying her with a hand on her hip. He paused a moment at the midway point, his breathing deep and even. Then he drove into her with one smooth, forceful thrust.</p><p>She came in a startled rush, crying out his name as the sensitive tissues rippled greedily along his thick length. He felt like heated stone inside her, stretching her to her limits and yet so\u2014</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she breathed, closing her eyes, feeling his warmth spreading through her. Soothing her, just as she\u2019d needed.</p><p>The terrible anxiety that had been ripping her apart since Chris\u2019s visit the day before eased, dissipated by her bone-deep surety that she\u2019d found the one man she could share herself with absolutely. Jared had come upon her during a terrible time and accepted it, accepted her as she struggled through it. Offering support and comfort in just the way she needed it. His quiet strength and determination gave her hope that Dani would have justice after all and that she might have a life without Dani in it, one that would fulfill her and give her a reason to strive forward every day.</p><p>But most importantly, Jared was the man she wanted to offer all those things to in return, with everything she had to give and more. She\u2019d learn to be more for him. She wanted to be everything to him, everything he needed and wanted.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he agreed, nuzzling against her temple. \u201cIt\u2019s so good, Darcy. Do you feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel it. Feel you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared groaned, his grip tightening on her hips. \u201cFeel me.\u201d</p><p>He began to fuck her with slow, deep thrusts, his rhythm perfectly controlled and fluid. He wielded his long, wide shaft with breathtaking expertise. Knowing just how to please a woman with it, but more, knowing just how to please her. Noting the nuances of her helpless response and focusing on what drove her to the edge. Stroking the thick crest over and over the sensitive spot inside her that made her insensate with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cFeels so good...\u201d she slurred, floating into a melting simmering orgasm with a breathless cry. He ground his hips against her, rubbing the deepest point of her, prolonging her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never get enough of you coming around my cock.\u201d Flexing his fingers on her hips, he began shafting her pussy again. \u201cOnce more, sweetheart. Let me feel you.\u201d</p><p>But once more wasn\u2019t enough for him. He drove her to orgasm twice before pulling free and unshackling her wrists. He rolled her gently to her back, his mouth surrounding an aching nipple and sucking softly, his tongue flickering over the hardened point.</p><p>Darcy whimpered, so boneless she scarcely had the strength to run her fingers through his sweat-soaked hair. He was drenched all over, betraying the effort he\u2019d exerted to make love to her with such selfless tenderness. He hadn\u2019t come, forfeiting his own needs to give his attention to hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake what you need,\u201d she urged. \u201cTake it how you need it.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing her bent knee against his flank, she urged him on. With his gaze on hers, he rolled the condom off and wrapped it in a tissue from the bedside table, tossing it in the trash can beside it. Moving quicker now, he caught her leg and lifted it into the air to prop against his shoulder, then he did the same with the other.</p><p>He stared down at her, his features harsh with lust, his blue eyes dark and soft with emotion. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about you, Inspector.\u201d</p> <p>He positioned his cock\u2019s head against the lubricated pucker of her ass, groaning as the eager orifice flexed in invitation. She flowered open for him, catching her breath as the thick crown pushed past the tight ring.</p><p>With her heels in the air and her ass cupped in his hands, he pushed into the slick passage, his gorgeous face twisting in a grimace of tortured ecstasy as she clenched around him like a fist.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, sweetheart, you\u2019re so tight.\u201d Sweat coursed down his temple and glistened on his flexing abdomen. \u201cSo damn hot. You\u2019re scorching my dick.\u201d</p><p>Her neck arched, her head pressing into the pillow as surrender radiated outward from the place where he pressed inexorably into her.</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d She moaned as pain mingled with her pleasure. The surfeit of sensation pulsed through her, tightening her chest and quickening her breathing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m right here with you,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cAh, God, I\u2019m gonna come before I get all the way inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d She wanted that. Wanted to feel it. Wanted to know that there were no barriers between them physically, just as there were none between them emotionally.</p><p>Adjusting his grip on her hips, he pumped deeper, sliding over highly sensitive nerve endings. Her hands fisted in the disheveled sheets; her head tossed from side to side. It felt as if something feral were trying to claw its way out of her skin. She surrendered to it, surrendered to him, the uninhibited lover who took the sexuality she\u2019d always embraced and enhanced in a way that made it new. Made it his.</p><p>Pushing onto her elbows, Darcy looked at where he entered her, her mouth drying at the sight of the thick veins pulsing along his rigid erection. He was at the limits of his control, yet still he held back for her. \u201cJared.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was hot as it met hers. She tightened down on him and he jerked violently, sliding deeper. With a growl, he thrust in to the root and started coming, spurting hot and thick in the depths of her rear.</p><p>She writhed as her pussy clenched on the verge of climax, then screamed as he placed the pad of his thumb over her clit and rubbed, hurtling her into orgasm with him. They arched together, straining against the vicious ecstasy, Jared thrusting mindlessly as he pumped his semen into her willing body.</p> <p>As the tension eased and her body sank limply into the mattress, Darcy came to the awareness of the unabated erection sliding in and out of her ass. Blinking heavy-lidded eyes up at Jared, she moaned as his gentle fucking stimulated overworked and hypersensitive nerves.</p><p>\u201cYou just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d His voice was gravel-rough and sexy as hell. \u201cAnd I have more to give you. Everything I am, Darcy. Everything I have. It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>She set her hands over his where they gripped her hips. \u201cGive it to me. All of you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter thirteen</p><p>Jared ran his fingertips up and down the arm Darcy had draped over his abdomen and ran the gathered data through his mind for the hundredth time, searching for what he might\u2019ve missed.</p><p>When Darcy bolted upright without warning, his arm shot out, his hand grasping for his weapon.</p><p>Breathing heavily, she stared at the gun he had aimed at the door, then met his gaze. \u201cDani never said a word to me about Chris, but she told Jim. I didn\u2019t know they were close, her and Jim. Close enough that she\u2019d share a secret lover with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said carefully, returning his gun to its holster. \u201cYou\u2019re following the same train of thought I had. I e-mailed Ralston\u2019s name to Agent Kelley. She might have some questions for him.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her hair back from her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make trouble for him. He doesn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>He propped some pillows behind his back. \u201cYou deserve answers and I\u2019m gonna see that you get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he has anything to do with this, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t one of the subjects the Feds interviewed, so technically he didn\u2019t lie to them, but it\u2019s never a good thing to withhold information. It smacks of having something to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr someone to protect.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for her hand, he linked fingers with hers. \u201cHow close is he to Miller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very. But I do think he said what he did yesterday to protect Chris. If you tie the arsons and the murder together\u2014which is what Chris came looking for you to talk about\u2014outing Chris\u2019s relationship with Dani absolves him of both. He has an airtight alibi for the first arson, he was out of town for three days prior to it\u2014his sister just had a baby. And the night of the shelter fire he was in the station when the call came in, working on evaluations. Unless you find out differently, that makes it impossible for him to have been the one to set the fire or make the call from Seattle.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her close, urging her to snuggle up with him again. \u201cCan you get Ralston to talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She laid her cheek against his chest. \u201cWhen I talked to Nadine yesterday, she said jealousy can make a person crazy. If Chris isn\u2019t the father of Darcy\u2019s baby, there was someone else in her life. Maybe he found out about Chris and lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure out the why when we figure out the who. We\u2019ll get there, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m ready to put this behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was home for you before you came back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbuquerque. I wanted something arid after growing up with so much rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do arid.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze softened. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I can transfer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I left New Mexico, I thought it might be a while before I figured out what was next. I quit my job, sold my condo...\u201d She ran her hand over the light dusting of hair on his chest. \u201cI can start over anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what the plan is, as long as it includes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter losing Dani and then last night...I could\u2019ve lost you, too. A few minutes here or there and you wouldn\u2019t be here now. I don\u2019t want to waste any chances, Jared.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tightly. \u201cWe won\u2019t. We won\u2019t waste a thing.\u201d</p><p>DARCY PULLED INTO the parking lot of the fire station and waved at Trish, who waited for them with Ralston by the open apparatus bay doors.</p><p>Jared stopped her from exiting with a hand on her arm. \u201cI don\u2019t want you leaving town. Even the animal shelter is too far. And I don\u2019t want you in the car with someone else if you\u2019re not behind the wheel. Don\u2019t go anywhere private with anyone. And text me as you move around so I know where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m just going to pick over the motel scene with Jim, then come back here to the station to expand on my prelim report. If that changes, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Dressed in her uniform, with her lush hair restrained in a ponytail, there was little evidence of the insatiable wanton who\u2019d shredded him just hours before. Except in her eyes. The way she looked at him made his chest ache.</p><p>\u201cYou be careful, too,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>They split up and he watched her pull out of the lot a few minutes later, driving the pickup with Ralston in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Trish asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d He faced her. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFired up. I want this shithead\u2019s ass in a sling.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cWe\u2019re starting here because of a volunteer named Mitch Quinn. There have been a few suspect shipments to the station, all under Quinn\u2019s name. Inspector Michaels says he should be here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s talk to him.\u201d</p><p>They found Quinn in the kitchen, putting away groceries. He looked up as they came in, his frown melting into a wide smile. With his shaggy blond hair and pale blue eyes, he had the look of a surfer about him, an impression strengthened by the seashell and hemp necklace visible through the opening in his uniform collar.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he greeted them. \u201cAre you looking for Inspector Michaels?\u201d</p><p>Trish returned his smile, but her game face was on, her eyes flat and watchful. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for you, Mitch.\u201d</p><p>He paused, then shut the refrigerator door. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d</p><p>Jared stepped up to the island. \u201cWe need to talk about some of the deliveries coming through this station\u2014\u201d</p><p>Quinn shoved the groceries across the tile at Jared and fled.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit,\u201d Trish muttered.</p><p>Jared leaped over the oranges and apples spilling off the island onto the floor, and gave chase.</p><p>DARCY PICKED THROUGH the charred remains of the motel while Jim jotted notes in his folder.</p><p>\u201cYour prelim was well done, Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He closed the folder with a decisive snap. \u201cWhen are you going to ask me why I didn\u2019t say anything about Miller and your sister earlier?\u201d</p><p>She faced him. \u201cI was waiting until we got through the scene first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019re finished for now. Since I was out all night, Columbo missed his morning walk. How about we pick him up and we\u2019ll talk about it away from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d They headed back to the truck. She closed up the evidence collection boxes in the bed of the pickup and said, \u201cI take it from your overnighter that the date went well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...not bad. I appreciate you handling things last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed the break and I knew we\u2019d need daylight to get the full scope.\u201d She slid behind the wheel and headed to his house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know Chris isn\u2019t responsible for what happened to Danielle, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Darcy glanced at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019d do it. I can\u2019t believe anyone I know could do that to another human being.\u201d</p><p>Setting his elbow on the window ledge, Jim rested his head in his hand and sighed. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t wrong when he said she\u2019d changed. There\u2019s no easy way to say this...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo just say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was...seeing a few men at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s grip tightened on the wheel. It was painful realizing there\u2019d been a widening gap between her and Dani, and she hadn\u2019t realized it. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the guys was Mitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d But the moment she asked the question, she knew it wasn\u2019t so surprising after all. Mitch was the sort of hardworking, good-humored type Dani had been drawn to. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen he caught on to her having other interests...it hit him hard. She was special to him and he hadn\u2019t realized that feeling wasn\u2019t mutual. So I went to see her, talk to her, try to get her to let him off the hook easy. Turned out she was upset because he\u2019d been following her. Angling to catch her in the act, I suppose. She told me she\u2019d been trying to cut him off for weeks and if I was really worried about him, I\u2019d tell him to knock it off or she\u2019d have Miller arrest him.\u201d</p><p>She felt him look at her, his gaze heavy on the side of her face. \u201cDarcy...I bluffed when I said she told me about her and Miller. There was just something in her voice. I wondered. When he showed up at your place so upset about tying the arsons in with the murder\u2014I took a shot in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Pulling up in front of his house, she parked and twisted to face him. She thought of Jared asking her about Mitch that morning and wondered what had drawn his attention in that direction. \u201cDo you think Mitch killed my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Hell, no.\u201d He shook his head violently. \u201cIf I even suspected that, I would\u2019ve driven him to the sheriff\u2019s office myself. Danielle was driving into Seattle a lot. I figure that\u2019s where she met the guy, whoever he is.\u201d</p><p>She shoved the door open and got out, needing to stand and suck in air to get past her sudden nausea. \u201cI really need that walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHAT WAS A real dumb move, Mitch.\u201d Trish circled his seat at a metal interrogation table in the sheriff\u2019s department. \u201cRunning from a marathon man like Deputy Cameron.\u201d</p> <p>Through the two-way mirror, Jared watched Mitch Quinn sprawl insolently in his chair and shake his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t running from the deputy. I left some ice cream in the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, ice cream. What flavor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanilla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, too bad. I like chocolate myself.\u201d She settled in the seat across from him. \u201cSo, let\u2019s talk about some of the packages that have been shipped to the station to your attention.\u201d</p><p>Quinn met her gaze directly. \u201cAll packages coming into the station are addressed to me. Stuff was getting lost before. I keep things organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meticulous, aren\u2019t you, Mitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, yes.\u201d</p><p>Trish nodded. \u201cI bet building a precision incendiary device would be child\u2019s play for a dedicated, meticulous, organized fireman such as yourself.\u201d</p> <p>He bolted upright. \u201cNow, wait a minute! You\u2019re not pinning the arsons on me. I fight fires, I don\u2019t start them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in a town of this size, there\u2019s no budget to take on more permanent firefighters, is there? Unless there was suddenly a rash of fires in the area. An arsonist setting up shop here would be almost a blessing for a long-suffering volunteer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. The supply room here in the sheriff\u2019s office is missing a can of tear gas. Did you know tear gas was used in the motel fire last night? Our arsonist didn\u2019t mind charbroiling me and Deputy Cameron, but he wanted to get the other guests out. You were in the supply room yesterday, Mitch. What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there was a note on the dry erase board in the station telling me to grab a box labeled LBFD\u2014Lion\u2019s Bay Fire Department, if you couldn\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho left the note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t recognize the handwriting? A meticulous guy like you?\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s gaze was icy. \u201cI didn\u2019t look at it that closely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She pulled out her cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ll text Deputy Cameron to snap a picture of it and bring it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI erased it after I finished the job,\u201d he bit out. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do, so we don\u2019t have guys trying to do jobs that have already been done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. Or maybe I should call it convenient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a witch hunt. You\u2019re looking for a scapegoat to keep your record looking good and I\u2019m the lucky guy. No way. I\u2019m done talking. I want a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Miller muttered from his place beside Jared in the observation room. \u201cThis is why I should\u2019ve interviewed him. He\u2019d trust me enough to hold off on lawyering up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo risky,\u201d Jared said, although he\u2019d already said it before. More than once. \u201cIf the arsons in any way tie back to Danielle Michaels\u2019s murder, you and I both have a conflict of interest. This way we\u2019re keeping it semi-clean.\u201d</p><p>His cell vibrated and he pulled it out of his pocket, reading the text from Darcy that said she\u2019d gone to Ralston\u2019s house and that he\u2019d pegged Mitch Quinn as one of Danielle\u2019s lovers.</p><p>Trish pushed back from the table. She\u2019d gone casual today with jeans and blouse paired with a Marshals Service Windbreaker, but there was nothing soft about her approach to the job. \u201cMaybe your lawyer can explain why you checked out three different books on Reginald Merkerson from the Seattle public library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a goddamned lie!\u201d Quinn lunged to his feet, knocking over his chair and putting Jared on alert for his partner\u2019s safety. Quinn\u2019s eyes were wild and hot, his face pale. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to the Seattle library in my life.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a copy of the library check-out list from the folder in her hand and set it on the table. \u201cThis says different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being set up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell it to your lawyer.\u201d She reached for the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would I drive to Seattle for books on Merkerson when Jim Ralston has copies of the actual case files in his office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck the dates on the paper there, Mitch. Those books were checked out before the fires started. Months before. Plenty of time to figure out how to make nasty little toys like Merkerson was known for.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cSomeone\u2019s setting me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would do that to a nice guy like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What I do know is that I didn\u2019t start those fires. A dedicated, meticulous, organized guy like me wouldn\u2019t leave such an obvious trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver date Dr. Danielle Michaels?\u201d</p><p>Mitch was clearly knocked back by the unexpected change in topic. \u201cWe hooked up a time or two. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk?\u201d</p><p>He sat back down and crossed his arms. \u201cI want a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Chapter fourteen</p><p>\u201cHey, boy.\u201d Darcy dropped to her haunches and wrapped Columbo in a big hug. \u201cYou\u2019re looking handsome. Miss me?\u201d</p><p>The energetic German shepherd greeted her with a bark and a tongue swipe across her cheek. She rubbed him down with both hands.</p><p>Jim set his notepad down on the dining table and pulled the leash off the rack by the door. \u201cHe does, of course. I told him after things settle down around here, he\u2019ll see you more often.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cI need to talk to you about the settling down part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He hooked the leash onto Columbo\u2019s collar. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m pretty superfluous around the station...\u201d</p><p>He arched a chastising brow at her. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m copping out,\u201d she admitted, shoving her hands in her pockets and rocking back on her heels. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if I was indispensible. The thing is, if you really need someone to do what I\u2019ve been doing, you should start putting out feelers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to pick up the life I left behind.\u201d</p><p>Holding the leash loosely in one hand, he leaned casually into the wall and crossed his legs at the ankles. \u201cIs this because of Deputy Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the spark, maybe, but the fire is my own.\u201d She pulled out one of the dining table chairs and sank into it. \u201cTime has been flying by and I didn\u2019t realize it. I\u2019ve been in a daze, I think, since Dani\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a couple nights of hot sex snapped you out of it?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, then smiled sheepishly. \u201cIt is really hot, but I\u2019ve had great sex before. There\u2019s something there, you know? Something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d He pulled the chair out beside her. \u201cSo what are you thinking? You\u2019re just going to drop everything and run off with a guy you\u2019ve known a few days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dropped everything to come back here. Getting on with my life eventually had always been my plan, although I lost track of that for a while\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re losing track of what you\u2019ve got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been really happy here in Lion\u2019s Bay, Jim,\u201d she reminded softly. \u201cIt\u2019s why I left in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Deputy Cameron doesn\u2019t have anything to do with your decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already answered that question.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of Columbo\u2019s ears. \u201cWhen are you going to grow up, stop being flighty, and commit to something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne guy to the next, one town to the next. Without any concern for the people who care about you and went out of their way for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Chris.\u201d Darcy slid her chair back and pushed to her feet, unnerved by his unexpected and provoking remarks. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, once we\u2019re both thinking straight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit the fuck down.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, finding the harshness of his words very much at odds with his calm voice and demeanor. A chill ran down her spine. \u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot for you.\u201d He gave her a mocking smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I have the right to get pissed when you throw me over for a gung-ho deputy who\u2019ll be in and out of your cunt as fast as he\u2019s in and out of this town?\u201d</p> <p>Darcy turned away, heading around the opposite side of the dining table to get to the front door.</p><p>Columbo started barking violently. She\u2019d scarcely registered the addition of a third voice in the conversation when the leash whipped around her neck and yanked her back.</p><p>Her head slammed into the edge of the table and her vision blackened...</p><p>JARED WAS SEALING up the contents of Mitch Quinn\u2019s locker at the fire station when the hairs on his nape prickled with warning. He paused, knowing he was wasting time closing off an avenue that was a dead end to begin with. In the meantime, something was wrong. It hit him in the gut, and he knew better than to ignore it.</p><p>He pulled out his phone and called Darcy. When he reached her voice mail twice in a row, he went to the contact list hung on the station\u2019s wall and called Ralston. When he got no answer there, either, he returned to the sheriff\u2019s department and entered the interview room to confront Quinn.</p><p>Setting his palms on the table, he asked, \u201cWhy did you run?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I don\u2019t give a shit, Quinn. The recorder isn\u2019t on. It\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>Mitch shot him a look. \u201cDo I look like a moron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a guy who\u2019s being set up. You have no one to corroborate your alibis for the nights of the fires, you have electrical wiring in your locker similar to the type Merkerson was known to use...With everything else we\u2019ve got, it\u2019s not looking good.\u201d Jared saw cold defiance shift across Quinn\u2019s face and changed tactics. \u201cYou consider Darcy Michaels a friend, don\u2019t you? I know she\u2019s real hopeful that you\u2019ll be promoted to full-time soon. I bet she puts in a good word for you every chance she gets. Does that mean anything to you? Or do you just care about yourself?\u201d</p><p>Jaw ticcing, Mitch said, \u201cI like Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible the person responsible for the fires is responsible for Dr. Danielle Michaels\u2019s death, too. I think it\u2019s possible they\u2019re going to go after Darcy Michaels at some point. And I think it\u2019s really fucking unlikely that you had anything to do with any of it, but someone wants to deflect attention from himself by drawing it to you. Someone who knows something about you that would make you antsy, make you run, make you lawyer up right off the bat so you look guilty and waste my time. Who would know you\u2019re into something shady, Mitch? Who would know your schedule? Gimme a name. Help Darcy after all she\u2019s done to help you.\u201d</p><p>Mitch scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d He bent closer and lowered his voice. \u201cMiller? Ralston?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way. Both of them are gonzo over her.\u201d He gripped his head in his hands. \u201cThe chief makes the schedule. He knows my hours and days.\u201d</p><p>Jared straightened, remembering his brief introduction to the Lion\u2019s Bay fire chief. \u201cChief Sendak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay, dude. He wouldn\u2019t have been messing around with Dr. Michaels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he has access to your locker, your schedule, and the mailing room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d Mitch leaned closer and lowered his voice. \u201cOccasionally\u2014rarely\u2014some of the guys have things shipped to them at the station that they don\u2019t want their wives finding out about. You know? Aside from that, there\u2019s nothing hinky going on. The guys are all straight up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Leaving the room, Jared pulled out his phone and called Darcy again. As it rang, he went by Miller\u2019s office and found it empty, then crossed through the bull pen to the desk and the blond deputy who manned it. He hung up when he got Darcy\u2019s voice mail.</p><p>\u201cHi, Deputy,\u201d the blonde greeted him.</p><p>He managed a brief, distracted smile. \u201cWhere\u2019s Miller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left while you were at the fire station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and smiled prettily. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He took personal time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet him on the radio. Please.\u201d He watched her make the attempt a few times with no answer before he turned around and looked for Trish. She was pouring a cup of coffee but sensed his gaze. She looked at him with a frown, then set the carafe down. She was walking toward him before he gestured to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something\u2019s bugging me. I need to find Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t question her assertion, knowing her instincts were as keen as his own. He looked at the deputy at the desk. \u201cI need Chief Inspector Ralston\u2019s home address. And Sheriff Miller\u2019s, too.\u201d</p><p>TRISH DROVE WHILE Jared continued to try to reach Darcy. When his other line beeped, he looked at the screen and saw Kelley\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cCameron,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cCameron, it\u2019s Kelley. I got your e-mail about Sheriff Miller. Thanks for keeping me in the loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your case, Kelley. I hope you can close it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to the airport now. I\u2019ll be back there to talk with Miller myself tonight, but in the meantime, in the spirit of sharing, I thought you\u2019d be interested to know that I poked around his background a little this morning and discovered his second cousin was aide to the lead detective on the Prophet case in Memphis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d He glanced at Trish and mouthed, \u201cMiller.\u201d</p><p>Trish adjusted the GPS and changed direction.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said to Kelley. \u201cHave a safe flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry not to get blown up before I get there. It\u2019d be nice to meet you in one piece.\u201d</p><p>DARCY WOKE WITH a groan, her head throbbing. Blinking, she tried to move and found her wrists bound. Awareness shot through her like a bullet, setting her heart racing. Her jaw ached from the ball gag that stuffed her mouth. She turned her head from side to side, trying to figure out where she was. Something wet touched her cheek, followed by the soft stroke of a tongue.</p><p>Columbo. The German shepherd lay beside her on the floor in an unknown bedroom. The room was shrouded by drawn curtains and cloaked in eerie quiet.</p><p>She rolled to the side and managed to prop herself up with an elbow. The room spun and her stomach roiled. She fought off a wave of nausea, knowing she\u2019d choke with the gag in her mouth. Leaning against the side of the bed, she sucked in air through her nose like a swimmer too long underwater. Her gaze fell on a badge lying on the floor near an antique dresser.</p><p>Chris\u2019s sheriff badge.</p><p>A chill moved through her as she remembered his angry voice intruding on her conversation with Jim just before she\u2019d lost consciousness.</p><p>Darcy managed to sit up, her gaze falling to the standard-issue handcuffs on her wrists. Chris\u2019s cuffs. Fear settled like a rock in her gut.</p><p>She jerked as she heard a door open somewhere in the house, then close, followed by heavy boot steps crossing hardwood floors, increasing in volume as they drew closer. The doorbell rang and they paused.</p><p>Struggling to her knees and then her feet, she was frantic to get to the door and get help.</p><p>The bell rang again and the screen door creaked open. Knocking ensued.</p><p>\u201cMiller? It\u2019s Deputy Cameron.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Jared\u2019s voice brought tears to her eyes. She was fumbling with the knob to the door when it opened. Stumbling backward, she fell onto the bed. Relief poured through her when Jim stepped into the room.</p><p>Then she saw the gun in his hand.</p><p>\u201cMake a sound,\u201d he said softly, \u201cand I\u2019ll shoot Cameron as he comes in. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Outside, Jared knocked and called out again. Tears coursed down her face, her brain trying to process the feverish brightness of Jim\u2019s eyes. She\u2019d never seen him look that way, never had him eye her coldly as he was doing now...</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t come in here without a warrant,\u201d Jim said calmly, as if he weren\u2019t brandishing a deadly weapon. \u201cIf you\u2019re quiet, he\u2019ll leave and live another day.\u201d</p><p>It seemed like an eternity before Jared gave up.</p><p>Darcy\u2019s lungs heaved for breath, spots swimming before her eyes.</p><p>Jim raised the gun to point at her chest. \u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve done for you...Damn it. It breaks my heart to have to kill you again.\u201d</p><p>JARED STARED AT the police cruiser parked at the curb in front of Miller\u2019s house and shoved a hand through his hair. He called the station and asked what kind of personal vehicle the sheriff drove.</p><p>Trish stood on the sidewalk with her hands on her hips. \u201cMiller is hugely territorial, but we get a suspect in custody and he bails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows something we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like him for this? The fires or the vet? Or both?\u201d</p><p>He went to the cruiser and set his hand on the hood, feeling the heat that told him the car had very recently been driven. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked at the house. \u201cI\u2019m not keen on Quinn, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s run by Ralston\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>As they pulled away from the curb, the unsettled feeling in his gut grew. He dialed Darcy\u2019s phone again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>DARCY LIFTED HER gaze from the barrel of the gun and looked into Jim\u2019s eyes. Fear slithered through her veins like ice water, chilling her to the bone. She flinched when he stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cScream and I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d He released the ball gag with one hand.</p><p>Flexing her aching jaw, she asked, \u201cWhat are you doing, Jim? Where\u2019s Chris?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThinking about taking up with him again? After he blew you off like a whore?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Chris hadn\u2019t broken it off with her; she\u2019d ended their relationship, as gently as possible. That was common knowledge. \u201cWe\u2019re in his house, right? I figured he\u2019d be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s around.\u201d</p><p>Her chest expanded on a sharp inhalation. \u201cCan you take the handcuffs off, too? Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sweet now. You fucked everything up by sending for the Marshals Service. If you\u2019d left things alone, none of this would have happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone of what? The fires?\u201d Her lower lip quivered violently. \u201cDani?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fires were bringing us closer together again. You were staying the night at my place...We were working the case during the day...\u201d</p><p>A choked noise escaped her as her chest tightened painfully. \u201cYou targeted places that meant something to me. You wanted me vulnerable, so I\u2019d turn to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron had no right to come in and push me out of the picture.\u201d Jim leaned into the dresser, looking totally relaxed. His easy demeanor was scarier than if he\u2019d been a raving lunatic.</p><p>\u201cThe people who owned those businesses you torched are our friends. They trusted you to keep them safe. You\u2019ve ruined their lives, stolen their livelihoods\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I know exactly what kind of hazard insurance covered each of those properties. They can rebuild better than before.\u201d</p> <p>She gaped at the man with whom she\u2019d shared her body but didn\u2019t know at all. \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>His jaw hardened. \u201cIf I am, you\u2019ve made me that way. I gave you everything, I was committed to you, and you got pregnant with someone else\u2019s baby. Who the fuck do you think you are, playing with people like that? After the way Miller treated you, you of all people should know how it feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been pregnant in my life,\u201d she shot back, anger slowly chasing away the terror. \u201cI\u2019m not Danielle. Did you kill my sister, Jim? Did you cut her up and do those horrible things to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d he snapped, his free hand waving with agitation. \u201cAnd Dani killed herself. She was screwing everyone, most especially anyone who had a tie of some kind to you. When I found out she was banging Mitch, I confronted her. We had a relationship. I expected you to be faithful, damn you. I was.\u201d</p><p>Darcy pushed slowly to her feet, alarmed by his shifting perceptions of who she was.</p><p>He straightened, tension stiffening his frame. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t tried to leave, I wouldn\u2019t have reached for you. You shouldn\u2019t have pulled away. If you\u2019d stayed where you were, you\u2019d never have fallen. You\u2019d never have hit your head.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of what to do, whether it would be wiser to play into his delusions or keep reminding him of reality, she asked, \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled harshly. \u201cI hate that you\u2019re making me do this. We were happy together. I don\u2019t understand why that couldn\u2019t be enough for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this place.\u201d She tried to swallow, but her mouth was too dry. \u201cIt\u2019s Lion\u2019s Bay. I can\u2019t take it here, Jim. That\u2019s the reason I spent time with Deputy Cameron\u2014he\u2019s going to leave and take me with him. But maybe you\u2019d take me instead? We can be happy anywhere, and with the fires...it\u2019s better if we leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. Don\u2019t try to play me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being practical, for once. I know you can make me happy. I don\u2019t know Cameron at all.\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s mouth thinned grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. I don\u2019t trust you anymore. You\u2019ve whored around one too many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re digging yourself a hole you won\u2019t be able to crawl out of,\u201d she warned, hoping he had some sense of self-preservation left.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s looking at me, Dani.\u201d His finger twitched on the trigger. \u201cAnd when they find your body with Miller\u2019s and pin the fires on Quinn, this will all go away and I can get on with my life.\u201d</p><p>Thinking her time was just about up, Darcy took a risk and launched herself into him.</p><p>\u201cSTOP THE CAR,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Trish braked to a halt. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He hopped out. \u201cWe don\u2019t both need to check out Ralston\u2019s. I\u2019m heading back to Miller\u2019s. If you catch Darcy, tell her to fucking call me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she called out, then she drove off.</p><p>Jared headed the two miles back at a brisk pace, spurred by a sense of urgency he couldn\u2019t qualify. He was still two blocks away when he heard a gunshot. He broke into a run. The house came into sight and he drew his weapon, racing past curious neighbors who straggled onto the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cGet back in your homes,\u201d he shouted. \u201cCall nine-one-one.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just reached the lawn when the door to Miller\u2019s house burst open and Darcy stumbled out, her wrists handcuffed in front of her. Relief burst through him, followed immediately by blood-chilling fear.</p><p>He darted forward, catching her and pulling her to the side of the house, out of the line of fire. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-No...no, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Miller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her lower lip quivered. \u201cIt\u2019s Jim. He did it all. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Peering around the corner, he eyed the porch. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tackled him into the closet in a bedroom on the right side of the hallway.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, his heart finally slowing from its frantic pounding. \u201cA fucking crazy thing to do.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a rasping, shaky breath. \u201cGod, I\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>Another shot rent the quiet.</p><p>\u201cOh, no...\u201d she breathed. \u201cColumbo.\u201d</p><p>He stood in a rush. \u201cSomeone else is in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. It\u2019s Jim\u2019s dog. I tripped on a runner in the hall and Jim was behind me with the gun...Columbo took him down. The gun went off and shot into the wall, but Columbo had his arm and he was snarling\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cupping her nape, he gave her a quick hard kiss. \u201cStay down.\u201d</p><p>Jared moved quickly and silently down the side of the house, looking in each window. The silence was brutal. When he saw blood and gray matter spattered on a paned window, he knew what the crime scene unit would find inside.</p><p>The dog was fine. It was his owner they\u2019d have to scrape off the walls.</p><p>DARCY WATCHED THE frenzy in the police station with an odd detachment. Jared was bent over a desk, talking with the federal agents who\u2019d arrived just a few minutes before. Outside, night had fallen and she was cold, but she suspected that came more from the inside than out.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Deputy Morales sank into the seat beside her and held out a paper cup filled halfway with steaming java.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked with the hospital. Sheriff Miller\u2019s fine. He has a nasty concussion, so they\u2019re going to keep him overnight, but he\u2019ll be good as new after a little time off.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling in a rush, Darcy\u2019s eyes stung with grateful tears. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron\u2019s going to drive you home in a bit.\u201d Morales studied her. \u201cAre you all right? I mean, as much as you can be under the circumstances?\u201d</p><p>It took Darcy a moment to gather her thoughts into something coherent. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about what Jim did...today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty much inevitable that he\u2019d self-destruct. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s any comfort or not. There\u2019s nothing you could have done differently. You\u2019re alive, that\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>Darcy rolled the warm cup between her bloodless hands. \u201cI expected to feel a sense of justice when I found Dani\u2019s killer. Instead I still can\u2019t believe it was Jim. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever understand it. And Columbo...That dog loved Jim, but he turned on him like he was a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDogs are smarter than we are. They sense things we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDani used to say that she couldn\u2019t trust people who didn\u2019t like animals, but more than that, she couldn\u2019t trust people that animals didn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>Morales patted her knee, then excused herself, getting back to work.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jared walked over. He crouched beside her chair and caught her free hand, his thumb stroking over the minor cuts and bruising left by Chris\u2019s handcuffs. \u201cLet me take you home.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze met his and her heart warmed. \u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to come back, but you need a hot bath and your bed. I\u2019ll hurry and get back to you as quick as I can.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved. \u201cDon\u2019t rush for me. I understand the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, just like I\u2019ll understand yours when it takes you away from me. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we fit so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what it is?\u201d Her widening smile betrayed the sexual undercurrent of her thoughts.</p><p>He blew out his breath, looking relieved. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>She realized then how worried he\u2019d been that she wouldn\u2019t be. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Standing, she said, \u201cTake me home so I can get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>Jared linked his fingers with hers and started toward the door. \u201cWon\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll still be under my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s right where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>The closing of the rolling metal door on the back of the moving truck was loud in the otherwise quiet afternoon. Darcy leaned into Jared as he draped his arm around her shoulders and they watched the truck drive away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>He nuzzled his lips against her temple. \u201cAnything left inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple boxes.\u201d She glanced at her childhood home, now sporting a Realtor\u2019s sign in the lawn. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be going, but I have fond memories of this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he murmured, his mouth curving against her cheek.</p> <p>She laughed softly, then jumped a little when he gathered her close and squeezed her tight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear you laugh, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting there.\u201d He pushed his fingers into her hair and cupped her scalp. His blue eyes were clear and warm, filled with a tender heat that never failed to touch her deeply. \u201cAnd we better get moving. We\u2019re supposed to be at your parents\u2019 house in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Placing her hand in his, Darcy whistled for Columbo. Together, they went into the house to gather the last of her things.</p>   </body></html>"]
