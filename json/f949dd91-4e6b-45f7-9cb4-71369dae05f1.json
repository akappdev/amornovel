No one\u2014human or vampire\u2014would dare trespass on angelic territory, but even had they felt the need to give in to the suicidal urge, it would have proved impossible. The keep had been built by angels, wings a prerequisite for access.</p><p>Technology could\u2019ve negated that advantage, but immortals didn\u2019t survive eons by being left behind. The air above and around the keep was strictly controlled, both by a complex intrusion detection system and by units of highly trained angels. Today\u2019s security had turned the sky into a cascade of wings\u2014it wasn\u2019t often that the ten most powerful beings in the world met in one place.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Uram?\u201d Raphael asked, glancing at the incomplete semicircle of chairs.</p> <p>Michaela was the one who answered. \u201cHe had a situation in his territory that required immediate attention.\u201d Her lips curved as she spoke, and she was beautiful, perhaps the most beautiful woman who had ever lived . . . if you didn\u2019t look beneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cShe makes Uram her puppet.\u201d It was a murmur so low that Raphael knew it had been meant for him alone.</p><p>Glancing at Lijuan, he shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s too powerful. She might control his cock, but nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan smiled, and it was a smile that held nothing of humanity. The oldest of the archangels had long passed the age where she could even pretend at being mortal. Now, when Raphael looked at her, he saw only a strange darkness, a whisper of worlds beyond either mortal or immortal ken.</p><p>\u201cAnd are we not important?\u201d A pointed question from Neha, the archangel who ruled India and its surrounds.</p> <p>\u201cLeave it, Neha,\u201d Elijah said in that calm way of his. \u201cWe all know of Uram\u2019s arrogance. If he chooses not to be here, then he forfeits the right to question our decisions.\u201d</p><p>That soothed the Queen of Poisons. Astaad and Titus seemed not to care either way, but Charisemnon wasn\u2019t so easily appeased. \u201cHe spits on the Cadre,\u201d the archangel said, his aristocratic face drawn in sharply angry lines. \u201cHe may as well renounce his membership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Chari,\u201d Michaela said, and the way she did it, the tone, made it clear she\u2019d once had him in her bed. \u201cAn archangel doesn\u2019t get invited to join the Cadre. We become Cadre when we become archangels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d Favashi spoke for the first time. The quietest of the archangels, she held sway over Persia, and was so good at remaining unnoticed that her enemies forgot about her. Which was why she ruled as they lay in their graves.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cWe\u2019re here for a reason. Let\u2019s get to it so we can return to our respective territories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the mortal?\u201d Neha asked.</p> <p>\u201cWaiting outside. Illium flew him up from the lowlands.\u201d Raphael didn\u2019t ask Illium to bring their visitor inside. \u201cWe\u2019re here because Simon, the mortal, is growing old. The American chapter of the Guild will need a new director within the next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let them choose one.\u201d Astaad shrugged. \u201cWhat does it matter to us as long as they do their job?\u201d</p><p>That job happened to be a critical one. Angels might Make vampires, but it was the Guild Hunters who ensured those vampires obeyed their hundred-year Contract. Humans signed the Contract easily enough, hungry for immortality. However, fulfilling the terms was another matter\u2014a great many of the newly Made had changes of heart after a few paltry years of service.</p><p>And the angels, despite the myths created around their immortal beauty, were not agents of some heavenly entity. They were rulers and businessmen, practical and merciless. They did not like losing their investments. Hence, the Guild and its hunters.</p><p>\u201cIt matters,\u201d Michaela said in a biting tone, \u201cbecause the American and European branches of the Guild are the most powerful. If the next director can\u2019t do his job, we face a rebellion.\u201d</p><p>Raphael found her choice of words interesting. It betrayed something about the vampires under her tender care that they\u2019d seize any chance of escape.</p><p>\u201cI grow tired of this.\u201d Titus stirred his muscular bulk, his skin gleaming blue-black. \u201cBring in the human and let us hear him.\u201d</p><p>Agreeing, Raphael touched Illium\u2019s mind. Send Simon in.</p> <p>The doors opened on the heels of his command and a tall man with the sinewy muscles of a street fighter or foot soldier walked in. His hair was white, his skin wrinkled, but his eyes, they sparkled bright blue. Illium pulled the doors shut the instant Simon cleared them, cloaking the room in lush privacy once more.</p><p>The retiring Guild Director met Raphael\u2019s eyes and nodded once. \u201cI am honored to be in the presence of the Cadre. It\u2019s not a thing I ever thought to experience.\u201d</p><p>Unsaid was the fact that most humans who came into contact with the Cadre ended up dead.</p><p>\u201cBe seated.\u201d Favashi waved to a chair placed at the open end of the semicircle.</p><p>The old warrior settled himself without any fuss, but Raphael had seen Simon in his prime. He knew the Guild Director was feeling the kiss of age. And yet, he was no old man, never would be. He was a man to be respected. Once, Raphael might\u2019ve called such a man a friend, but that time had passed a thousand years ago. He\u2019d learned too well that mortal lives blinked out with firefly quickness.</p><p>\u201cYou wish to retire your position?\u201d Neha asked with regal elegance. She was one of the few who continued to keep a court\u2014the Queen of Poisons might kill you, but you\u2019d admire her refined grace even as you took your last agonizing breath.</p><p>Simon remained coolly composed under her regard. Being Guild Director for forty years had given him a confidence he hadn\u2019t had as the young man Raphael had first seen take the reins. \u201cI must,\u201d he now said. \u201cMy hunters are happy for me to stay on, but a good director needs always consider the health of the Guild as a whole. That health flows from the top\u2014the leader must be eminently capable of undertaking an active hunt if necessary.\u201d A rueful smile. \u201cI\u2019m strong and I\u2019m skilled, but I\u2019m no longer as fast, or as willing to dance with death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest words.\u201d Titus nodded approvingly. He was most at ease among warriors and their kin\u2014for though he might rule with brutal strength, he was as blunt as the hard line of his jaw. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong general who can give up the reins of power.\u201d</p><p>Simon acknowledged the compliment with a slight nod. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a hunter, and as is custom, I\u2019ll remain available to the new director till my death. However, I have every faith in her ability to lead the Guild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d Charisemnon snorted. \u201cA female?\u201d</p><p>Michaela raised an eyebrow. \u201cMy respect for the Guild has suddenly increased a hundredfold.\u201d</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t allow himself to get drawn into the dialogue. \u201cSara Haziz is the best possible person to take my place for a number of reasons.\u201d</p><p>Astaad settled his wings. \u201cTell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith respect,\u201d Simon said quietly, \u201cthat is no concern of the Cadre\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>It was Titus who reacted first. \u201cYou think to defy us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Guild has always been neutral for a reason.\u201d Simon\u2019s spine remained unbending. \u201cOur job is to retrieve vampires who break their Contracts. But through the ages, we\u2019ve often found ourselves in the middle of wars between angels. We survive only because we are seen as neutral. If the Cadre takes too much of an interest, we lose that protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty words,\u201d Neha said.</p><p>Simon met her gaze. \u201cThat makes them no less true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she capable?\u201d Elijah asked. \u201cThis, we must know. If the American Guild falls, the ripple effect could be catastrophic.\u201d</p><p>Vampires would go utterly free, Raphael thought. Some would slip softly into an ordinary life. But others, others would murder and kill. Because at heart, they were predators. Not so different from angels when all was said and done.</p><p>\u201cSara is more than capable,\u201d Simon said. \u201cShe also has the loyalty of her fellow hunters\u2014I\u2019ve had a significant number of them come up to me this past year and suggest her name as a possible successor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Sara is your best hunter?\u201d Astaad asked.</p><p>Simon shook his head. \u201cBut the best will never make a good director. She is hunter-born.\u201d</p><p>Raphael made a note to find out her name. Unlike normal members of the Guild, the hunter-born came out of the womb with the ability to scent vampires. They were the best trackers in the world, the most relentless\u2014bloodhounds tuned to one particular scent. \u201cAnd Sara?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill she accept?\u201d</p><p>Simon took a moment to think. \u201cI have not a single doubt that Sara will make the right decision.\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Sara wasn\u2019t used to feeling sorry for vampires. Her job, after all, was to bag, tag, and transport them back to their masters, the angels. She was no fan of indentured servitude but it wasn\u2019t as if the angels hid the price of immortality. Anyone who wanted to get Made had to serve the angels for a hundred years. Non-negotiable.</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to bow and scrape for a century, you didn\u2019t sign the Contract. Simple. Running out on the Contract after the angels delivered their part of the bargain? That just made you a welsher. And nobody liked a welsher.</p><p>However, this guy had worse problems than being returned home to a pissed-off angel. \u201cCan you talk?\u201d</p><p>The vampire clamped a hand over his almost-decapitated neck and looked at her as if she were insane.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d She wondered how the hell he was still alive. Vampires weren\u2019t true immortals\u2014they could be killed by both humans and others of their kind. Cutting off the head was the most foolproof method, but the majority of people didn\u2019t go that way\u2014it wasn\u2019t as if the vamps were going to stand still for it. Shooting out the heart worked, so long as you then cut off the head while they were down. Or fire. That did the job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Sara was a tracker. Her job was to retrieve, not kill. \u201cYou need blood?\u201d</p><p>The vampire looked hopeful.</p><p>\u201cSuck it in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not dead. Means you\u2019re a strong one. You\u2019ll last till I can get you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDhooooo.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring the gurgled rejection, she crouched down to slide an arm around his back so she could drag him to his feet. She was only five feet three, and he was considerably taller. But she wasn\u2019t bleeding out from her neck, and she worked out seven days a week. Grunting as she got him up, she began to walk him to the car. He resisted.</p><p>\u201cNeed a hand?\u201d A deep, quiet voice, aged whiskey and smoldering embers.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know that voice. Neither did she know the body that moved out of the shadows. Six feet plus of solid, muscled male. Heavy across the shoulders, thick in the thighs, but with the liquid grace of a trained fighter. One she wouldn\u2019t want to be up against in a fight. And she\u2019d taken down vampires twice her size. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cJust help me get him to the car. It\u2019s parked at the curb.\u201d</p><p>The stranger all but picked up the vampire\u2014who was starting to make vaguely understandable sounds\u2014and dumped him in the backseat. \u201cControl chip?\u201d</p><p>She pulled her crossbow off her back and aimed it at the vamp. The poor guy scrambled back, pulling his feet completely into the vehicle. Rolling her eyes, she returned the crossbow to its previous position and withdrew a necklet from its spot hooked into the waistband of her black jeans, under her T-shirt. Reaching in, she paused. \u201cDon\u2019t try anything funny or I\u2019ll shoot you for real.\u201d</p> <p>Slumping, the vampire let her clamp the circle of metal around his rapidly healing neck. The science behind the device\u2019s effect on vampiric biology was complex, but the results clear\u2014the vampire was now constrained from acting without a direct order from Sara. Helpful didn\u2019t begin to describe the control chip because even this injured, the vamp could probably rip off her head in two seconds flat.</p><p>Sara liked her head, thank you very much.</p><p>Crawling back out, she shut the door and looked up at the other hunter\u2014and there was no doubt in her mind as to his vocation. \u201cSara.\u201d She thrust out a hand.</p><p>He took it, but didn\u2019t speak for a long time. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to protest\u2014something in those dark, dark green eyes held her in place. Power, she thought, there was an incredible sense of power in him. Then he spoke, and the decadent whiskey of his voice almost blinded her to his actual words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Deacon. You\u2019re much smaller than your reputation suggests.\u201d</p><p>She wrenched back her hand. \u201cThanks. And don\u2019t offer to help next time.\u201d</p> <p>Most men would\u2019ve walked off, egos dented. Deacon simply stood there, watching her with those intense eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a criticism.\u201d</p><p>Why the hell was she still here? \u201cI have to deliver Rodney to his master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a rep.\u201d He stepped closer, his eyes drifting to the strap that bisected her body. \u201cYou and your crossbow.\u201d</p><p>Was that amusement she saw in that oh-so-serious face? \u201cDon\u2019t knock it until you\u2019ve tried it. My bolts are made to carry the same properties as the necklets\u2014it keeps me out of harm\u2019s way until the target\u2019s safely chipped, and given their ability to heal, it hardly hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you had a necklet.\u201d</p><p>She took off the crossbow. \u201cMove.\u201d This close, all she could see was Deacon, his chest a mile wide. Maybe she was a little affected, but hey, she had a pulse. He was sexy as hell. That changed nothing. She was a hunter. And he might be Guild, but he was also an unknown. \u201cMy best friend loves them.\u201d She didn\u2019t get why, but then Ellie didn\u2019t get the crossbow, so they were even. However, Sara had promised to try the things, since Ellie had tried the crossbow on her last hunt. \u201cI asked you to move.\u201d</p><p>He finally shifted back a few inches. Enough that she could pull open the passenger door and drop the crossbow inside it. Rodney was almost completely healed, but he\u2019d gotten blood all over the interior of the rental car. Damn. The Guild would cover the expenses, but she didn\u2019t particularly want to ride around in that mess. \u201cI have to deliver the package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk to him first.\u201d</p> <p>She closed the passenger door. \u201cAnd why would we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about who cut him?\u201d He had ridiculously long lashes, she thought. Dark and silky and completely unfair on a man.</p><p>\u201cProbably some vampire hate group.\u201d She frowned. \u201cMorons. Never occurs to them that they\u2019re attacking someone\u2019s husband, father, or brother.\u201d</p><p>He kept staring at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d She rubbed at her face, glad her dark skin tone hid her stupidly hot reaction to this stranger. But no harm in looking, right?</p><p>\u201cThey told me you had brown skin, brown eyes, black hair.\u201d</p><p>That sounded about right. \u201cWho\u2019s \u2018they\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you after we talk to the vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrot and stick?\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not a rabbit.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved up a little at the corners. \u201cFor the sake of camaraderie.\u201d Reaching into his battered leather jacket, he pulled out his Guild ID.</p><p>Curious enough not to cut off her nose to spite her face, she jerked her head toward the car. \u201cI\u2019ll go into the front seat, take off the necklet.\u201d Unfortunately\u2014or fortunately, depending on your point of view\u2014vampires couldn\u2019t speak while chipped. \u201cYou get into the back and make sure he doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fit in the car.\u201d</p><p>She took him in. It was all she could do not to ask him to strip naked so she could lick him from head to toe. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, stuffing her suddenly energetic hormones back into storage. \u201cNew plan. I\u2019ll get him to lower the window, and you put your arm around his neck while we talk.\u201d</p><p>And that was what they did. Rodney was more than happy to chat once Sara introduced herself.</p><p>\u201cYou like to shoot people.\u201d He made it sound as if she were a maniac. \u201cWith a bow and arrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re behind the times\u2014I switched to a crossbow last year.\u201d It was faster, but she kinda missed her specially designed bow. Maybe she\u2019d go back to it. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t even hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just turned three.\u201d Vampires counted their age from the time of their Making.</p><p>Sara shook her head. \u201cAnd you tried to run? Why the fuck would you do something so stupid?\u201d His sire, Mr. Lacarre, was way past mad.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSounded like a good idea at the time.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, they weren\u2019t dealing with the sharpest knife in the drawer. \u201cOooookay.\u201d Her eyes met Deacon\u2019s. Not a ripple in their night-shadow green depths, but she could\u2019ve sworn he was holding back laughter. Biting off her own smile, she returned her attention to Rodney. \u201cSimple question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d The vampire grinned, showing both fangs, something the old ones never ever did. \u201cI don\u2019t like hard things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cut you, Rod?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed and blinked rapidly. \u201cNobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you tried to decapitate yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, which meant Deacon was holding on very lightly. Not that it mattered. Sara had her crossbow as insurance.</p><p>\u201cRodney.\u201d She put all the menace she was capable of in that single word. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>He blinked again and\u2014oh my God\u2014he was going to cry. Now she felt like a bully. \u201cCome on, Rod. Why are you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . .\u201d She thought about what would scare a vampire that bad. \u201cWas it an angel?\u201d If it had been his sire, she couldn\u2019t do anything about it except report the bastard to the Vampire Protection Authority. However, it was also possible the attack had been orchestrated by one of Lacarre\u2019s enemies, in which case the angel would take care of it himself.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rodney sounded shocked enough to be telling the truth. \u201cOf course not. The angels Make us. They don\u2019t kill us.\u201d</p><p>And the boy was living in la-la land. \u201cSo who else scares you that bad?\u201d She caught Deacon\u2019s eyes again at that moment and found her answer in their no longer amused depths. \u201cA hunter.\u201d Or someone Rodney had mistaken for a hunter. Because real hunters didn\u2019t kill vampires.</p><p>Rodney started sniffling. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me. I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Sara reached out and, ignoring his flinch, patted him on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m interested in collecting my retrieval fee. I only get half if you\u2019re dead, so it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Rodney looked at her with hope a shiny gem in his eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d Lowering his voice, he pointed at the arm around his neck.</p><p>Deacon spoke for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m her boyfriend. I do what she says.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, but Rodney apparently found the claim highly reassuring. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re the boss,\u201d he said to Sara. \u201cI can tell. My Mindy, she likes to be the boss, too. She told me I should run away and you know, we could go on like a cruise.\u201d</p><p>Sara pressed a her finger over his lips. \u201cFocus, Rodney. Tell me about the hunter who cut you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said all you hunters hate vampires.\u201d Rodney\u2019s voice got very small. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. I know it\u2019s your job to track us, but I didn\u2019t think you hated us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d Sara wanted to pat him on the head. Jesus. \u201cHe was just being mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so. What else did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat vampires were the scum of the earth, and that the angels were being polluted by our presence.\u201d He made a face. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that could be true since the angels Make us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sara was so surprised by the sudden burst of sense that it took her a second to process it. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.

He was wearing a black mask, and black everything. But he was tall. And strong.\u201d</p><p>That included half the hunters in the Guild. Sara tried to get more out of Rodney, but it was a bust. Neckleting him again, she drove to Lacarre\u2019s, very aware of Deacon following on a big monster of a bike. He remained outside the gates while she went in to deliver Rodney.</p><p>Rodney\u2019s master was waiting for him in the sitting area of his palatial home. \u201cGo,\u201d he ordered.</p> <p>Sara removed the necklet and put it on the table for Lacarre to return to the Guild as Rodney shuffled off like a penitent schoolboy. Snapping his cream-colored wings shut in anger, the angel picked up an envelope from the table. \u201cA receipt confirming payment. I sent it through as soon as you called to say you had Rodney.\u201d</p><p>Checking it quickly, she slid it into a pocket. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Haziz,\u201d he said, scowling, \u201cI\u2019ll be frank with you. I never expected Rodney to attempt an escape. I\u2019m not sure how to punish him.\u201d</p><p>Sara wasn\u2019t used to talking to angels for longer than it took to get the assignment. In most cases, she didn\u2019t even see them then\u2014they were way too important to consort with mere mortals. That\u2019s what vampires were for. \u201cYou know a Mindy?\u201d</p><p>Lacarre stilled. \u201cYes. She\u2019s one of my most senior vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous type?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm, I see.\u201d A nod. \u201cI\u2019ve been spending extra time with Rodney\u2014he\u2019s a child and I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll get eaten up if I don\u2019t teach him some skills.\u201d</p><p>Sara wasn\u2019t even going to ask how Rodney had gotten through the Candidate selection process. So many people wanted to be Made that it was anything but a slam dunk. \u201cHe\u2019s no mastermind,\u201d she said. \u201cI think if you punish him too harshly, he\u2019ll break.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lacarre nodded. \u201cVery well, Guild Hunter. Thank you.\u201d It was a dismissal.</p><p>Leaving Rodney with a master who was still irritated, albeit no longer furious, felt vaguely wrong. But the vampire had made his choice when he asked to be Made. Now he\u2019d be somebody\u2019s slave for the next ninety-seven years. As she walked out, her path crossed with that of a slender redhead. The woman was dressed in a daring scarlet suit that molded to her body like second skin. It made a statement.</p><p>She would\u2019ve kept going but the redhead stopped her. \u201cYou brought Rodney back.\u201d</p><p>Mindy. \u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>The older vampire\u2014much older from the sheer ease with which she faked humanity\u2014all but gritted her teeth. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to survive this long\u2014he can barely tie his shoe-laces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he get Made?\u201d Sara asked, unable to swallow her curiosity any longer.</p> <p>Mindy waved a hand. \u201cHe was fine bef\u2014\u201d She belatedly seemed to realize who she was talking to. \u201cGood-bye, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d Interesting, Sara thought. Everyone knew\u2014even if the knowledge had never actually been confirmed\u2014that a tiny percentage of Candidates went insane after the transformation. This was the first time she\u2019d seen an example of someone who\u2019d been diminished instead.</p><p>Deacon wasn\u2019t around when she got back into the rental car, but he\u2019d found her again by the time she reached her hotel. She parked in the underground garage and got out to see him bringing that monster motorcycle to a stop beside her. \u201cHow did you get past security?\u201d</p><p>He took off his helmet, unzipped his jacket, and swung off the bike. Gorgeous male muscle. Oh, so touchable. Something very tight in her stomach wound even tighter. Dear God, but the man was sex on legs.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Taking a deep breath to wash away the rush of raw hunger, she headed for the elevators, weapons bag in hand. Experience told her management would get a little testy if she walked in wearing her crossbow. \u201cSo? Security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sucks.\u201d</p><p>That was her estimation, too. \u201cIt was the most convenient location for this hunt.\u201d</p><p>Being stuck in an elevator with the man was an exercise in frustration. His smell; soap and skin, heated up from within to create something uniquely Deacon\u2014pure male with an edge of steel\u2014wrapped around her like an aphrodisiac. Since she couldn\u2019t not breathe, she was overdosing on it by the time the elevator kicked them out on the third floor. \u201cStay here.\u201d She held up a hand. \u201cI need to check your credentials.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his back up against the wall opposite her door. \u201cSay hi to Simon from me.\u201d</p><p>Keeping an eye on him, she swiped her keycard and entered the room. It was fairly basic\u2014a double bed beside a small chest of drawers, a table with just enough room for the hotel phone and maybe a laptop, a couple of chairs. Really, everything she needed while on a hunt. The call to Simon\u2019s cell phone from her own went through without problems.</p><p>\u201cDeacon,\u201d she said the instant he picked up. \u201cWho is he and why is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a description.\u201d</p><p>She did. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s Deacon. He\u2019s on a job and it\u2019s something I want you on as well\u2014I assume you\u2019ve completed the retrieval for Lacarre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Intrigued by what he wasn\u2019t saying, she put a hand on her hip. \u201cWhat\u2019s the job, and does it have anything to do with vampires getting their heads lopped off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeacon will explain. We need to sort this out fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d She paused. \u201cSimon. The other thing . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Sara. The decision doesn\u2019t have to be made today. Or even tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>But Sara knew it did have to be made. \u201cAfter this job. I\u2019ll give you an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for it.\u201d A pause. \u201cSara, Deacon\u2019s extremely dangerous. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty dangerous, too.\u201d Hanging up after a few more words, she went to the door and pulled it open. The man in question was standing on the doorstep. Her eyes drifted down to the duffel that had materialized at his feet. \u201cWhoa. You\u2019re not staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot to tell you. I\u2019ll crash on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Her streak of curiosity was a pain in the ass sometimes. \u201cYeah, you will.\u201d Waving him in, she locked the door. \u201cSo, let me guess\u2014we have to find and neutralize this psychopath pretending to be a hunter.\u201d There\u2019d been five murders in the past week and a half that she knew about. All vamps. All killed by decapitation.</p><p>Deacon dropped his bag on the floor beside hers and shrugged off his jacket to reveal a rough navy shirt that threw his eyes into even brighter relief. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure he\u2019s pretending. I\u2019ve been on his trail since the day after the second murder, and all signs point to a hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d she said, remaining by the door, arms crossed.</p><p>Putting his jacket over the back of a chair, he pulled it out and grabbed a seat before bending down to unlace his boots. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunters don\u2019t go around killing innocent people.\u201d It wasn\u2019t what they were, what they did. There was honor in being a hunter. \u201cWe make sure vampires don\u2019t get killed more often than they already do.\u201d Legend had it that before the formation of the Guild, vampires who dared try an escape were simply executed upon discovery.</p><p>Having removed both boots and socks, Deacon stretched out his legs and tipped his chair back against the table, eyes intent. \u201cBill James.\u201d</p><p>It was a punch to the gut, a fucking knife to the heart. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d Nobody but the three hunters who\u2019d gone after him\u2014and Simon, of course\u2014knew about Bill. To the others, he\u2019d died a hero, been given a full Guild funeral.</p><p>Deacon continued to watch her with absolute, unwavering focus, a calm that made her wonder if the man ever let go. \u201cMy name is Deacon, but most people know me as the Slayer.\u201d</p><p>She stared. He wasn\u2019t joking. Fuck.</p><p>Pushing off the door, she walked very quietly to the bed and sat down on the edge. \u201cI thought they made you up. Like the bogeyman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Guild recruits and trains some of the deadliest men and women in the world. We need a bogeyman.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cEllie\u2019s never going to believe I met the Slayer.\u201d It was a joke, the name. Taken off a television show. \u201cThe Guild really has a hunter whose job it is to hunt our own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when necessary.\u201d He didn\u2019t speak again until she raised her head. \u201cAnd you know it sometimes is necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill was an aberration,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething snapped in him.\u201d The other hunter had taken to killing children, savaging them with an inhumanity that made her gorge rise even now.</p><p>\u201cHunting our own is a rare thing,\u201d Deacon acknowledged. \u201cBut it happens. That\u2019s why there\u2019s always a Slayer in the Guild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you track Bill?\u201d Because it was Elena who\u2019d had to kill the older hunter. Sara had been determined to do the gut-wrenching task\u2014Bill was her friend, but he\u2019d been Ellie\u2019s mentor. But Bill had attacked her with a tire iron in an ambush none of them had seen coming. She\u2019d been unconscious before she hit the ground. And her best friend had had to knife her mentor to death.</p><p>He looked at me as if I\u2019d betrayed him, Ellie had said afterward, her face splattered with Bill\u2019s lifeblood. I know he had to die, but I can\u2019t stop thinking that he was right. His blood was so hot.</p><p>\u201cSheer bad luck,\u201d Deacon said, dragging her back to the present. \u201cThe situation went critical so fast that I couldn\u2019t get back in time\u2014I was on the other side of the world.\u201d He didn\u2019t move, a predator at rest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness,\u201d he said to her surprise. \u201cThe Slayer\u2019s rarely called for. I\u2019m a weapons maker by vocation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeacon? Wait a minute.\u201d Pulling her bag across, she unzipped it and grabbed her crossbow. The familiar, stylized D stared up at her from the bottom of the stock. \u201cThis is your work?\u201d</p> <p>A small nod. \u201cI make tools for hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best there is.\u201d This crossbow had cost her a mint. As had the bow she adored. \u201cAnd you slay in your spare time? Nice.\u201d Shaking her head, she put the crossbow back into the bag. \u201cHow come I\u2019ve never heard of you personally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to be friends with the people you might one day have to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lonely life.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to be so blunt, but she couldn\u2019t imagine that kind of an existence. She was no social butterfly\u2014not yet, anyway\u2014but she had a core group of friends who kept her sane and balanced.</p><p>\u201cSlayers are chosen from the loners.\u201d Raising his hands, he undid the first few buttons of his shirt. \u201cDo you want the shower first?\u201d</p> <p>She wanted to lick her lips, that\u2019s what she wanted to do. The man\u2019s skin stretched golden and strong over that muscular physique, and she could see dark curls of hair in the open triangle of his shirt. Her body tightened . . . expectant, ready.</p><p>Cold shower time.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, getting up. \u201cI\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d</p><p>Deacon just nodded as she grabbed her gear and hauled ass. The Slayer was delicious, no question about it, but she wasn\u2019t in the market for a lover. Not when she was about to make the biggest decision of her life. A decision that might make her existence even lonelier than Deacon\u2019s.</p><p>Male hunters were macho idiots\u2014and she meant that in the best way\u2014as a rule. Playing second fiddle didn\u2019t come easily. And it didn\u2019t get much more second fiddle than being the Guild Director\u2019s man.</p><p>Deacon finally unclenched the hand he\u2019d fisted the instant he sat down in the chair. Sara Haziz was not the woman he\u2019d been led to expect. Simon had some explaining to do.</p> <p>\u201cBrown skin, brown eyes, black hair, my ass,\u201d he muttered under his breath. The woman was an erotic fantasy come to life. Small, curvy, perfect. Gleaming coffee-and-cream skin, hair that probably fell to her waist when released from that tight braid, and brown eyes so big they saw right through him.</p><p>This was not the woman Simon had described as his \u201csensible successor.\u201d That made her sound about as interesting as shoe leather. It didn\u2019t even hint at the power beneath the surface, the strength in that backbone. He\u2019d met her only a couple of hours ago, and already he knew she could bust balls with the best of them.</p><p>The woman would make a perfect Guild Director.</p><p>Which meant he should keep his hands, and his thoughts, to himself. No sucking on sexy Sara\u2019s neck. Or other parts of her body. The office of Guild Director was a necessarily public one. Deacon didn\u2019t do public.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s not director yet.\u201d He tapped a finger on one jean-covered thigh, his eye on the bed.</p><p>He wanted Sara. And he didn\u2019t want lightly. But seducing her wasn\u2019t on the agenda.</p><p>\u201cKeep her safe. She won\u2019t accept a bodyguard, but you can accomplish the same thing by keeping her with you on the hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work alone.\u201d</p> <p>Simon\u2019s face was granite. \u201cTough. She\u2019s one of my best hunters\u2014she won\u2019t slow you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s one of the best, why does she need babysitting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Cadre knows she\u2019s my chosen successor. I wouldn\u2019t put it past certain archangels to \u2018test\u2019 her.\u201d</p><p>Deacon raised an eyebrow. \u201cWere you tested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey almost killed me.\u201d Blunt words. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to win against five old vamps on your own. I survived only because I happened to be with my wife at the time. Two pissed-off hunters against five vamps is much better odds.\u201d</p><p>So here he sat, listening to water cascade in the bathroom as he fantasized about kissing a slow path down Sara\u2019s body. It wasn\u2019t doing anything to lessen his arousal. And if she walked out to find him hard as fucking stone, he knew damn well he\u2019d be spending the night in the corridor outside.</p><p>That, he couldn\u2019t chance\u2014he had to keep her in sight. Simon had been very clear about that. If the archangels planned to test her, they\u2019d do it when they thought her vulnerable. So he\u2019d make sure she never was. Shoving a hand through his hair, he got up and checked the room. It was fairly secure. No outside windows\u2014claustrophobic but safe, no entrances or exits aside from the door\u2014which he jammed shut with a special tool of his own making, and no vents large enough for anything to get through.</p><p>By the time Sara exited the shower wrapped in a fluffy hotel robe, rubbing at her hair with a matching towel, he was confident enough of her safety to go have his own shower. A freezing one. \u201cChrist.\u201d He gritted his teeth and bore the onslaught. Pleasing his cock wasn\u2019t as important as ensuring that the Guild went on.</p><p>He\u2019d asked Simon about that. Why would the archangels potentially sabotage an organization that made their lives a hell of a lot easier?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game,\u201d Simon had said. \u201cThey need us, but they\u2019ll never allow us to forget that they\u2019re the more powerful. Attacking me, attacking Sara, isn\u2019t about stopping the Guild\u2014it\u2019s about reminding us the Cadre is watching.\u201d</p><p>Sara heard the water come on and quickly finished drying her hair before picking up her cell. She had no idea what time zone Ellie was in, but her best friend answered after a single ring.</p><p>\u201cSara,\u201d she said, \u201cdo you know what a skill it is to wrap three-feet-tall porcelain vases so they don\u2019t break in transit? And I did it! These gorgeous babies don\u2019t have a scratch on them. Genius, thy name is Elena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I even ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were a gift.\u201d Ellie sounded delighted. \u201cThey\u2019ll look perfect in my living room. Or maybe one in the bedroom, one in the living room.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s preoccupation with her d\u00e9cor struck a familiar chord in Sara. Hunters made nests. It was a response to the fact that they spent so much time on the road, and in the gutter. Sara was worse than most\u2014she loved her parents but they were feckless hippies at best. She\u2019d gone to ten different schools by the time she was seven. A solid, stable home was as necessary to her as breathing. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met the Slayer.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cNo shit.\u201d The whistle was a long one. \u201cScary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Built like a tank.\u201d If Deacon ever came after her, she\u2019d have to make sure he never got within punching distance. A single hit with one of those big fists and her neck would snap. \u201cEllie, there\u2019s a hunter going around killing vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Elena\u2019s voice changed, became darker. \u201cYou\u2019re hunting him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in New York, landed a few hours ago. I can be on the next flight.\u201d</p><p>Sara was already shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go after him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Deacon\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Slayer?\u201d Her relief was open. \u201cGood. Look, Sara, I\u2019m hearing things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us know you\u2019ve got Simon\u2019s position anytime you want. But I had a conversation with a high-level vamp on the plane home and he knew your name.\u201d</p><p>Simon had warned her of this. \u201cThe Cadre takes an interest in the next Guild Director.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s silence was long. \u201cI know you can\u2019t run and hide from this, so I\u2019ll just say\u2014be damn careful. The archangels aren\u2019t anything close to human. I wouldn\u2019t want to be within ten feet of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of them will bother to personally check me out\u2014probably send some of their vampires to have a look.\u201d And she knew how to handle vampires.</p><p>\u201cLucky you have the Slayer with you. Serious manpower when you need it.\u201d A faint pinging sound came over the line. \u201cGotta go. I think the takeout\u2019s arrived.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, Sara stared at the phone. Yes, it was lucky, wasn\u2019t it, that Deacon had shown himself to her when he spent most of his time in the shadows. And how very convenient that she\u2019d been posted on a hunt to the very city where the serial killings were taking place. Eyes narrowed, she waited.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Deacon walked out a couple of minutes later, dressed in nothing but a pair of jeans. Her hormones danced. Damn near did the foxtrot. She refused to join in. \u201cSimon sent you.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, he didn\u2019t bother to deny it. \u201cTwo birds. One stone.\u201d Grabbing a fresh T-shirt from his duffel, he pulled it over his head. \u201cYou know it\u2019s the right decision.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he sounded so coolly logical made her want to shoot him with the crossbow just to make a point. \u201cThe Guild Director can\u2019t be seen as weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also can\u2019t be seen as stupid.\u201d Intractable will in those midnight-forest eyes.</p><p>Putting down the cell she\u2019d been squeezing half to death, she dug out a brush and began to pull it through her hair. \u201cTell me about the killer. Is there any chance it could be an impostor?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for several seconds, as if not trusting her sudden capitulation. \u201cYes. But as of right now, I have three possibles\u2014all hunters. We\u2019ll visit them one by one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>A small nod. \u201cI figure we give it four hours, enough time for the killer to relax his guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you follow him after he hit Rodney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no visible trail.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cAnd your job is to babysit me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBabysitting you isn\u2019t what I want to do.\u201d Quiet, intense words, stroking over her skin like living velvet. \u201cBut since taking you to bed is out of bounds, I\u2019m stuck with babysitting.\u201d</p><p>Heat exploded across her skin, a raw, dark fire. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d let you within a foot of me?\u201d Her voice held the rough edge of desire, but it could as easily have been anger.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d ask nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry anything and I\u2019ll cheerfully gut you with your own knife.\u201d</p> <p>Deacon smiled. And it turned him from sexy to devastating. \u201cThis\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>But four hours of fitful sleep later, she was in no mood to play. Pulling on her gear before joining Deacon in the corridor, she adjusted her crossbow and set her jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that we\u2019re hunting one of our own.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She glanced at him as they walked down to the garage, and saw nothing. No expression. No emotion. No mercy. In that moment, he was the Slayer. \u201cHow many have you had to kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p> <p>She blew out a breath at the single precise word, and opened the door to the stairs. No point in making hotel security crazy by being caught on the elevator cameras armed to the teeth. \u201cWhy you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be someone.\u201d</p><p>She understood all about that. \u201cI never wanted to be Guild Director.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you were chosen\u2014you\u2019ll do what the director is meant to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to?\u201d</p><p>He exited first, and she knew it was a gesture of protection. Annoying, but on the scale of annoyances, minor.</p> <p>\u201cYou know about Paris. They had that director a few years ago who politicked himself into the position. Almost got all his hunters killed, he was so busy grandstanding.\u201d</p><p>Sara nodded and headed to the bike, their chosen method of transport tonight. \u201cI always wondered how that could\u2019ve happened.\u201d Hunters were a tough, forthright lot as a whole. Slick made them suspicious.</p><p>\u201cSome people say he struck a deal with a powerful cabal of vampires, that they influenced the vote.\u201d</p><p>Very old vampires were rumored to have mind-control abilities, and one of Sara\u2019s more important qualifications for the position of Guild Director was that she had a natural immunity to all vampiric abilities. Like Ellie and the other hunter-born, she\u2019d always been meant for the Guild. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure\u2014he hasn\u2019t been seen since he was deposed.\u201d Handing her a spare helmet, he watched as she put it on, then settled his own. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, realizing the helmets were miked. \u201cWhere\u2019re we going first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimothy Lee. He\u2019s shorter than Rodney described, but Rod was traumatized. We can\u2019t trust his recollection.\u201d</p><p>She was about to reply when she suddenly knew they were no longer alone in the garage. Already straddling the bike behind Deacon, she looked across to the door they\u2019d used to exit the stairs and saw a vampire. She had no need to ask if Deacon had made him, too\u2014the Slayer had gone motionless the same instant she had.</p> <p>Meeting the vampire\u2019s gaze, she felt the hairs on the back of her neck rise. He was an old one, his power so potent it thickened the air until she could barely breathe. When he didn\u2019t say anything, she decided to remain silent, too. Deacon started the bike and backed out of the space. \u201cWatch him,\u201d he said into the mike.</p><p>As he turned the motorcycle, she twisted her head to keep the vamp in sight.</p><p>The tall, dark-haired male didn\u2019t so much as blink as they drove out of the garage.</p><p>\u201cGames,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThey\u2019re letting me know I\u2019m being watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTesting your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I can see their point\u2014can you imagine what would happen to the world if any of the major chapters had a weak director?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d Deacon said again.</p><p>She nodded, though he couldn\u2019t see her. \u201cWhat was his name\u2014Jarvis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJervois.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jervois\u2019s weakness had led to a disorganized European Guild. Vampires had taken immediate advantage. Most had simply escaped, planning to lose themselves into the world. But a few . . . \u201cSeveral vamps gave in to bloodlust. The news reports said the streets ran with blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t far wrong. Paris lost ten percent of its population within a month.\u201d</p><p>Put in such finite terms, the horror of it was chilling. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the angels step in?\u201d In her native New York, Raphael ran the show, and as far as Sara knew, no bloodlust-ridden vampire had ever set foot in the city. Since that was statistically impossible, obviously Raphael had taken care of any problems with such flawless efficiency no one had heard so much as a murmur.</p><p>\u201cWord is\u201d\u2014Deacon\u2019s voice turned cold\u2014\u201cMichaela decided the humans needed a lesson in humility.\u201d</p><p>Michaela was one of the more visible archangels, a stunning beauty who enjoyed attention enough to pose for the human media on occasion. \u201cI think that one,\u201d Sara said, \u201cwould be happy to push us all back to a time where she\u2019d be looked upon as a goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people even now who see the angels as God\u2019s messengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother species,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re what we\u2019ll become sometime in the next million years.\u201d</p><p>It was an interesting hypothesis. Sara didn\u2019t know what she thought. Angels had been around since the earliest cave paintings. There were as many explanations for their existence as there were stars in the sky. And if the angels knew the truth, they weren\u2019t telling. \u201cSo, why Timothy Lee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been in the city during every one of the murders, he\u2019s capable of doing the job\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all capable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So that wouldn\u2019t matter as much, but Timothy\u2019s a very dedicated hunter. He sees it not as a job, but as a calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he hunter-born?\u201d Having been best friends with Ellie for so many years, she knew that for those born with the ability to scent-track vampires, entering the Guild was less a choice than a compulsion.</p><p>\u201cNo. But he worships the hunter-born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot healthy, but not psychopathic either.\u201d</p><p>Deacon nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s one of three. The other two have their own little idiosyncrasies but all hunters are strange to some degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Ashwini, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She heard him choke. \u201cMet isn\u2019t quite the right word. She shot me the first time we came into contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds about right.\u201d She grinned, but it didn\u2019t last long. \u201cIf it is one of these three, you\u2019ll execute him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m authorized to do this. The law will never become involved.\u201d A pause. \u201cThey\u2019re glad we police ourselves. Hunters who turn bad have a way of upping the body count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike vampires.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, but she felt his agreement in the tense stillness of his body. Eerily quiet, the night seemed to discourage further conversation, and they rode in silence until Deacon pulled over to the side of a still, dark street. \u201cWe\u2019ll go on foot from here.\u201d</p><p>Stowing her helmet alongside his, she followed him as he led her down the street and to a chain-link fence. She frowned. \u201cThis looks like a junkyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was truly odd. Hunters almost never lived in crappy places. They were paid very well for sticking their necks out chasing vampires who might just tear those necks off. \u201cTo each his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a hellhound.\u201d</p><p>She thought she\u2019d heard wrong. \u201cDid you say hellhound?\u201d Visions of red eyes pulsing in a miasma of sulfur danced through her head. Then the pitchforks started circling.</p><p>\u201cBig, black thing, probably bite your hand off if you look at it wrong. Timothy calls it Lucifer\u2019s Girl.\u201d He took something from his pocket. \u201cTranquilizer dart.\u201d Then he was gone, and if she hadn\u2019t seen it, she\u2019d never have guessed he could move that fast.</p><p>She stayed with him, both of them scrambling over the chain link to land with hunter silence on the other side. There was no bark, nothing to alert them they\u2019d become prey\u2014Lucifer\u2019s Girl came out of the darkness like a raging whirlwind. Sara ducked instinctively, and the dog\u2019s body jumped over hers . . . to meet the clearly rapid-acting tranquilizer in Deacon\u2019s hand. Instead of allowing the dog to fall, Deacon caught its muscled weight and lowered it gently to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou like her,\u201d Sara said, incredulous.</p><p>Deacon stroked the dog\u2019s heaving sides. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like? She\u2019s loyal, and she\u2019s strong. If I have to execute Timothy, she\u2019ll miss her master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d adopt her, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThere go your chances of ever again getting a girl.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, looking at her in that intent way of his. \u201cNot a fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got nine-inch fangs.\u201d Only a slight exaggeration. \u201cA woman would have to love you an incredible amount to put up with that kind of competition.\u201d She jerked her head toward the building on the other side of the mountain of scrap metal and God knew what else. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Tranq will keep Lucy out for a while.\u201d</p><p>Lucy?</p><p>They took their time finding a path through the junk, checking for booby traps in the process. When they finally reached the tumbledown shack that Timothy called home, it was to discover the place empty. A little breaking and entering later, they were inside, but saw nothing even close to a smoking gun. The fact that Tim wasn\u2019t home meant nothing\u2014hunters kept irregular hours as a rule.</p><p>She watched as Deacon took something from his pocket and placed it on the bottoms of all the shoes he could locate. \u201cTransmitters,\u201d he told her. \u201cBattery life of about two days. So if there\u2019s a kill in that period, and he wears a pair I\u2019ve tagged, I\u2019ll be able to trace his movements.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s next on the list?\u201d</p><p>He told her after they scaled the chain link\u2014petting Lucy along the way, and waiting long enough to ensure that she was coming out of the tranq okay. \u201cNext is Shah Mayur. Loner, does the job but doesn\u2019t seem to have any contact with other hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike someone else I know.\u201d</p> <p>Deacon ignored the comment as they straddled his bike and took off.</p><p>Grinning, she pressed herself to the heat of his back. \u201cWhat put Shah on your radar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had five complaints filed against him by the VPA.\u201d</p><p>The Vampire Protection Authority had been set up to stop cruelty and prejudice against vamps. They never won court cases\u2014it was extremely hard to make a vampire look the victim when you had pictures of their blood-soaked kills\u2014but they could kick up a serious stink. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcessive violence against a vampire during retrieval.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She thought about that. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sound more excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause all five complaints came from the same vamp.\u201d</p><p>Her own burgeoning excitement deflated. \u201cProbably someone with an ax to grind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we have to check him out.\u201d</p><p>Shah Mayur lived in a much more ordinary home\u2014in terms of its attractiveness to hunters. His apartment occupied the entire third floor of a freestanding town house.</p><p>Sara frowned. \u201cGetting in\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d Deacon had already told her there was no internal access, so they couldn\u2019t break in downstairs\u2014and the ladder that Shah used to get up and down was currently pulled up. That didn\u2019t mean he was home. According to Deacon\u2019s intel, it could be raised or lowered by remote. Shah wasn\u2019t a trusting sort. But he was also supposed to be on a flight to Washington as of an hour ago. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d</p> <p>Deacon was staring up at the back wall when she turned to him. \u201cCan you climb that?\u201d</p><p>She followed his gaze to what looked like some kind of a water pipe, a reasonably substantial one. \u201cYeah.\u201d The request surprised her. \u201cI thought you were babysitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re probably under surveillance,\u201d he told her, voice matter-of-fact. \u201cI can\u2019t defang you completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat implies you could.\u201d She shot him a sweet smile laced with bite. \u201cWe have to consider something else\u2014if we are being watched, then the angels and high-level vamps have to know what we\u2019re up to. I\u2019m not going to deliver a hunter into their hands.\u201d Angelic vengeance could be soul-destroyingly brutal.</p><p>Deacon looked into her face, unblinking. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to get to him first. We\u2019ll deliver death with mercy.\u201d</p><p>Giving a nod, she accepted the transmitters he held out and ran to the pipe. She was light enough\u2014and more importantly, had enough muscle\u2014that it was fairly simple to pull herself up. When she reached the window ledge, she found it an easy, wide perch. So close, it was tempting to push up the window and go in, but she took her time checking everything out.</p><p>Just as well, as it turned out.</p><p>Shah had rigged a garrote across the opening, at the exact height to cut anyone coming in. From the faint glitter, she guessed it was covered with crushed glass. Gruesome, but home security wasn\u2019t a crime. Double-checking for any electrical wires that might be connected to an alarm, she glanced down at Deacon and signaled her intention to enter.</p> <p>He nodded once and signaled back. Two minutes.</p><p>Pushing up the window, she stepped in with care, avoiding the lethal stroke of the garrote by bending low. She found herself in what looked like the living room. It was dark. But not dark enough to hide the man sitting silently in the armchair.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cI expected Deacon,\u201d he said in a silky soft tone.</p><p>\u201cShah Mayur, I presume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara Haziz.\u201d A lilt of surprise. \u201cSince when are you a Slayer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it a sideline.\u201d She noted the gun in his lap. \u201cYou\u2019re prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want my head lopped off before I had a chance to explain that I\u2019m not a homicidal killer.\u201d This time, the tone was wry.</p><p>She liked him. Didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t a murderer. \u201cSo if I leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot you. Tell Deacon I\u2019ll meet you both outside.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd Sara, it\u2019s not good form for the future Guild Director to be breaking and entering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone act like it\u2019s a done deal?\u201d she muttered and backed out, keeping an eye on his hands the whole time. If necessary, she could jump\u2014it would break a few bones, but it wouldn\u2019t kill her. Not like a bullet would.</p><p>Whether Shah replied, she didn\u2019t hear. It was far easier to go down the pipe than it had been to come up. \u201cHe\u2019s heading down to talk.\u201d</p><p>Deacon\u2019s face went very quiet. Dangerous. \u201cHe\u2019s not supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew you were coming. And he knows your name.\u201d</p><p>That made him go even more still. Sara found herself fascinated. Did Deacon ever let himself go? Or was he this contained even in the most intimate of situations? It was tempting to kiss him and find out, but with the way he drew her, she knew she wouldn\u2019t stop at a kiss.</p><p>The whisper of Shah\u2019s ladder sliding to the ground was a welcome distraction. She waited as the other hunter descended, his gun nowhere in sight. Of course, that simply meant he was good at hiding his weaponry. Elena would approve, Sara thought. Her best friend usually had spikes secreted in her hair, and knives strapped to her thighs. That was just for starters.</p><p>\u201cHello, Deacon.\u201d Shah turned out to be tall, dark, and very handsome, with shining black hair that swept his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d Deacon subtly angled himself so he protected Sara.</p><p>She stopped herself from rolling her eyes and used the chance to retrieve her own gun from the small of her back. Then she moved out of Deacon\u2019s night-shadow so she\u2019d have a clear line of sight.</p><p>\u201cSpying\u2019s my thing. I work intel for the Guild.\u201d</p><p>The Guild had an intel division? Sara wondered how many more secrets she\u2019d learn as Guild Director. It was temptation indeed for a woman as curious as her. But was she willing to give up everything she was, give up the possibility of a family, children? Yes, there were men who\u2019d be more than happy to sleep with the Guild Director, but they weren\u2019t the kind of men she\u2019d touch with a barge pole.</p><p>No, Deacon was her type. Cool, controlled, strong. And about as likely to sleep with the woman who\u2019d effectively be his boss\u2014if she accepted the directorship\u2014as he was to start spouting jokes. Reining in her wandering thoughts, she met Shah\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just supposed to believe you?\u201d</p><p>Shah shrugged, giving her a secretive smile. \u201cOr I could tell you all about the time you and Elena decided to try out the stripper pole at Maxie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>How the fuck had he learned about that? She scowled. \u201cIf you work intel, why didn\u2019t Simon clear you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeacon runs his ops independently.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI could\u2019ve played hard to get, but I figure you two are a good bet when it comes to keeping secrets. The future director and the Slayer. Who\u2019re you going to tell?\u201d</p><p>Deacon suddenly had his hand around Shah\u2019s neck, a knife to his abdomen. \u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Shah blinked, hiding his surprise behind charm. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you swung that way.\u201d</p><p>Deacon pushed the knife a little.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Unbuttoning the shirt with rapid fingers, Shah shrugged it off.</p><p>\u201cSara, check his body for marks of a struggle. One of the vamps put up a hell of a fight.\u201d</p><p>Sara did a close inspection, but all she saw was smooth, unblemished skin. \u201cHe\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>Shah rubbed at his throat as Deacon let him go. \u201cYou could\u2019ve asked nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you could\u2019ve stabbed him in the heart.\u201d Sara snorted. \u201cDrop the act. You\u2019re about as helpless as a piranha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame a boy for trying.\u201d He smiled, revealing dimples he no doubt used as a tool. \u201cIf you want my take, I\u2019d put my money on Tim. Have you seen that dog of his? Probably made a deal with the devil and got that as insurance. Now the thing\u2019s possessed him.\u201d</p><p>Sara shook her head, noting the gleam of amusement in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should throw stones\u2014I saw the teddy bear on your couch.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. A suave, sophisticated spy could go bright red under cinnamon-dusted skin. \u201cIt\u2019s my nephew\u2019s. And if you don\u2019t need to manhandle me anymore, I\u2019d like to go to sleep.\u201d With that, he turned and left.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hit on you.\u201d It was a quiet statement.</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cAnd you felt the need to point that out, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShah doesn\u2019t have any close hunter friends, but he\u2019s popular with the ladies. He hits on anything with breasts, but petite dark-haired women are especially his type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for crushing my self-esteem under your boot.\u201d Restraining the urge to kick him, she grabbed her helmet and thrust it on.</p><p>Deacon took his seat, putting on his own helmet before starting the engine. They were ten minutes from Shah\u2019s home and cutting through a deserted parking lot when Deacon came to a halt. \u201cFight or run?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen the vampires in the shadows. How many? Five, no, seven. Seven against two. \u201cRun.\u201d Stupidity wasn\u2019t what had kept her alive this long.</p><p>It was only as Deacon was peeling out of the lot that she realized he\u2019d left the choice up to her. It was . . . unexpected.</p><p>Their third stop of the night was a gay bar. Sara stared up at the bar\u2019s name. \u201cInferno.\u201d She turned to the silent man by her side. \u201cIs it me or are we seeing a trend here?\u201d</p><p>A quirk of his lips. It was sexier than a full-fledged smile from any other man. \u201cI\u2019m leading you into sin.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. She laughed. \u201cObviously, suspect number three is gay. Right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarco Giardes.\u201d He nodded up. \u201cLives above the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwns the place. Bought it with an inheritance.\u201d</p> <p>Sara shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t bother me. Bother you?\u201d</p><p>A bit of red stained his cheeks. Her mouth fell open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He doesn\u2019t know about me\u2014unless he\u2019s another spy. We\u2019re just two hunters who heard about his place and decided to drop in.\u201d</p> <p>Since hunters were known to do things like that to support each other, it was a perfectly believable cover. And despite the fact that it was close to four a.m., the bar was jumping. \u201cWeapons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem for hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They flashed their Guild IDs and got waved in by the heavily muscled bouncer . . . who gave Deacon a thorough going-over. Sara bit the insides of her cheeks when the big, tough Slayer shifted a little behind her.</p><p>The instant they entered the main floor, conversation stopped, then started in a huge rush. She was welcomed with smiles\u2014there were several other women in the crowd\u2014but the attention was most definitely on Deacon. So when he put his hand on her hip and pulled her up against him, she didn\u2019t protest. \u201cPoor baby,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThey really like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d She\u2019d never heard a blush before.</p> <p>A beautiful male with the slinky body of a catwalk model strolled over. \u201cWhat a shame,\u201d he murmured, noting their body language. \u201cI hope you\u2019re taking good care of him.\u201d</p><p>Sara patted Deacon\u2019s hand where it curved over her hip. \u201cThe best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let him dance with us?\u201d</p><p>Sara could feel Deacon\u2019s horror in the absolute frozen lines of his body. It was tempting to tease, but . . . \u201cHe\u2019s not much of a dancer.\u201d</p><p>Giving another mournful sigh, the blond walked away. Unable to keep it in any longer, Sara turned and buried her face in Deacon\u2019s chest as her body shook with laughter. His arms came around her, his lips at her ear. \u201cWe\u2019re going to a girl bar on our next date.\u201d</p><p>That simply made her laugh harder. Tears leaked out of her eyes. By the time she got it out of her system, the scent of Deacon was well and truly in her lungs. The man smelled delicious. A little bit of heat, a little bit of sweat, a whole lot of dangerous. Perfect.</p><p>Hands flat on that gorgeous chest of his, she looked up. \u201cI guess they know a manly man when they see one.\u201d</p><p>His lashes, long and beautiful, shaded his eyes, but she saw the glint in them. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p> <p>Her answer was interrupted by a discreet cough. She turned to find a man who could only be another hunter. His stance was easy in the way of someone who knew how to move in a fight, his eyes watchful . . . and at the moment, amused. \u201cWelcome. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara.\u201d She stuck out her hand. \u201cThis is Deacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara Haziz?\u201d The hunter\u2019s smile turned dazzling. \u201cI\u2019m so delighted to meet you. I\u2019ve heard of you, of course. Please, come in.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cPierre, prep a table.\u201d Returning his attention to them, he gave a short nod. \u201cI\u2019m Marco. With the Guild but not for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He smiled again, displaying a row of gleaming white teeth. \u201cI decided this bar is my true love after all.\u201d</p><p>Not many hunters retired. But it wasn\u2019t completely unheard of. \u201cYou won\u2019t miss the thrill of the hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a young man\u2019s game. I\u2019m in my late thirties now, but don\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>Deacon finally broke his silence. \u201cYour bar\u2019s doing well\u2014we heard about it on the hunter grapevine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of my best customers are hunters,\u201d Marco said, genuine pleasure in his voice. \u201cThey bring their girlfriends, mates, don\u2019t blink an eye. I\u2019m very glad to have been a part of that fraternity. Please, come. The drinks are on me.\u201d With that, he turned and led them to a table on the edge of the dance floor.</p><p>They all took a seat and drinks were ordered. Sara noticed that Deacon barely touched his\u2014whiskey, of course\u2014and neither did Marco. She took a sip of her cocktail and made a true sound of pleasure. \u201cThis is sinfully good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the bar\u2019s becoming quite well-known for its cocktails.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and they chitchated for several minutes. \u201cDoes this place have a ladies\u2019 room?\u201d</p><p>Marco grinned. \u201cOf course. I can show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just point me in the right direction.\u201d She leaned in close and whispered, \u201cI need you to stay here and protect Deacon.\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cThe big ones want to pit themselves against him, and the pretty ones want to take him home and give him a whip.\u201d</p><p>Deacon\u2019s face remained expressionless, but his green eyes held a distinct warning. Laughing, she got into the act and stroked his cheek as she left. His stubble made her fingertips want to go exploring, but she strolled to the bathroom instead, getting several approving looks from the crowd.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her fault she got distracted by a conversation with another hunter and ended up at a door that didn\u2019t lead to the toilets. Unfortunately, it was locked solid and coded with a touchpad. Hiding her disappointment, she made a point of asking for bathroom directions again and went in to use the facilities before returning to the table.</p><p>\u201cGet lost?\u201d Deacon asked before Marco could.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She laughed. \u201cSomeone dragged me off to ask if you really were as hard as you looked.\u201d</p><p>Deacon flushed. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>She knew it was another warning. But the byplay had the effect of disarming any suspicions Marco might\u2019ve had. He laughed and said a few more words before getting up to go mingle.</p><p>Deacon didn\u2019t look particularly happy, but waited to speak until they were on the bike heading back to the hotel. \u201cYou didn\u2019t make it to his apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHe crosses his leg like guys do.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She took pity on him. \u201cYou know, one ankle over the knee, encroaching on other people\u2019s space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a transmitter on his shoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I asked to go to the bathroom.\u201d She felt exceedingly smug about that. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even the best part\u2014he was wearing solid hunter boots.\u201d Increasing the odds that he\u2019d use the same footwear if he decided to go out killing.</p><p>\u201cMy guess\u2014the killer\u2019s not going to move tonight. Not after Rodney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t he be frustrated by the fact that he failed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible, but this guy\u2019s not stupid. He does his homework, strikes only when he knows his prey will be vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had more people, you could put watches on both Tim and Marco, and if necessary, Shah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver tried following a hunter who doesn\u2019t want to be followed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>She thought of the three they\u2019d visited. \u201cDid you ask Simon to run background checks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight already have come through.\u201d</p><p>He was right. He pulled out and turned on a PDA that looked as tough as he was as soon as they got back to the hotel\u2014all three reports were waiting in his e-mail.</p><p>\u201cPretty standard stuff,\u201d Sara said, as she lay flat on her back on the bed with the PDA in her hands. \u201cTimothy had a hunt go bad, hasn\u2019t been seen in public since, but we know he\u2019s alive. Shah really is a spy. Doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGut instinct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat if Shah was going to kill, he\u2019d do it in a way no one would ever trace back to him.\u201d She looked at the last page. \u201cMarco is a solid hunter with a stable personal life\u2014he\u2019s playing happy families with a vampire, so he clearly likes them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever been tempted?\u201d The bed dipped as Deacon braced a knee on the bottom edge and looked down at her.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Her mouth went dry.\u201cTempted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo take up with a vamp?\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cSure, they\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d But not real, not like Deacon. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole bloodsucking thing\u2019s kind of a turnoff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that trips me up, too. I don\u2019t want my partner thinking of me as a midnight snack.\u201d She switched off the PDA and laid it carefully on the small chest of drawers beside the bed. \u201cHave you ever had a vamp feed on you?\u201d</p><p>A shake of the head, his eyes lingering on her lips. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmergency feed,\u201d she said, suddenly hot in the T-shirt and jeans that had been fine moments before. \u201cThe guy was so badly off, I had to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt?\u201d Those night-shadow green eyes were drifting over the rise of her breasts, the dip of her stomach.</p><p>She breathed deep, saw him suck in his own breath at the movement of her chest. \u201cNot as much as you\u2019d expect. They have something in their saliva that takes the edge off.\u201d Stretching out her legs, she raised her arms above her head. \u201cAnd you know they can make it feel good if they want.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, his attention very much on her body as she relaxed from the stretch. Then he moved onto the bed, bracing himself above her using his forearms. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>A simple question\u2014one that made her pause and think. Hunters weren\u2019t prudes, but Sara had never had a one-night stand. It simply wasn\u2019t in her. Yet she\u2019d wanted Deacon from the instant she\u2019d seen him. And from the arousal he was making no effort to hide, she knew full well he wanted her, too.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t just two hunters who\u2019d met on the road. \u201cAre you going to get all weird after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine weird.\u201d He settled himself more firmly against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bit back a moan. The man was hot, hard, and more than ready. \u201cI need you to follow orders if I become director.\u201d Her former lovers wouldn\u2019t hesitate, because she hadn\u2019t been a candidate for the critically important position then. But now she was very much a candidate. \u201cAre you going to expect special treatment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in bed with the future director. I\u2019m in bed with Sara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p> <p>It was tempting to rush, but she stroked her hands into his hair and tugged. The kiss was a punch to the system. Making a sound of sheer pleasure, she wrapped her arms around his neck, her legs around his waist. The man was big, solid all over. A wall of flesh and bone and muscle contained by granite will. She wanted to rub against him until she purred.</p><p>He bit her lower lip. She gasped in a breath and then it was happening again, the wild rush of sensation, the near-unbearable pleasure, the need to taste him deep. When the kiss broke this time, she nuzzled at his throat, kissing her way along the taut tendons of his neck. He smelled so damn good.</p><p>He tugged her back for another kiss, and somewhere in between, she realized his hand was on her bare back, under her T-shirt. She wanted more. Breaking the kiss, she let go of him and tugged at her T-shirt. Deacon rose off her enough that she could pull it over her head and off.</p><p>\u201cGreen?\u201d He traced the scalloped lace of her bra with a single, teasing finger.</p><p>She began to unbutton his shirt even as he unhooked her bra. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite color.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucky for me.\u201d The last word was a groan as she flattened her hands on his chest. \u201cDamn lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Grunting, he rose to a kneeling position and slid off her bra before getting rid of the shirt. But he didn\u2019t come back down straight away. Instead, he reached out to close one big hand over her breast. She cried out at the unexpectedly bold touch, her eyes clashing with his. Deep green, but no longer calm or unaffected.</p><p>It made the last of her inhibitions fall away, and when he bent his head to her breast, she thrust her hands into his hair and held on for the ride. The Slayer knew what he was doing. There were no hesitant caresses, no requests for more permission. He\u2019d asked once, and she\u2019d acquiesced. Now he took every advantage. Truth to tell, it was beyond erotic being with a man so sure of himself in bed. So sure . . . and so utterly involved. Now she knew the answer to her question\u2014when Deacon lost control, he lost control.</p><p>God, could he get any sexier?</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his waist and kissed him wet and deep and open. \u201cI think you should take off your pants.\u201d</p> <p>Nuzzling his way down her neck to her pulse point, he reached down to hers instead. But rather than opening the jeans, he slid his hand under the waistband to cup her with bold familiarity. She arched into him, wanting more. \u201cNo teasing.\u201d</p><p>A nip at the soft flesh of her breast. Shuddering, she thrust her hands into his hair and tugged. \u201cDon\u2019t you talk in bed?\u201d</p><p>His response was to kiss his way down her breastbone, before sitting back up. Withdrawing his hand with obvious reluctance, he undid her jeans and pulled them off, along with her panties. A still, darkly sensual moment as he simply looked at her. Her body arched in silent invitation. Taking it, he bent down until his lips touched her ear . . . and whispered such wicked promises, such decadent requests, she thought she\u2019d melt from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cOkay, stop talking.\u201d It was too much sensory input, too much pleasure. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and sat up, his gaze never leaving her face. The intimacy was blinding. Then one big hand spread on her thigh, thumb stroking the insanely sensitive inner surface. She cried out in the back of her throat . . . and twisted out of his hold to sit up on her knees.</p><p>A flicker of surprise, followed by a smile, slow and sure. \u201cFast and sleek, and pretty.\u201d He bent to run his lips along her neck as she pulled out his belt and threw it to the floor, then started on the buttons on his fly. \u201cMmm.\u201d A sound of pure male appreciation.</p><p>Pushing his pants down just enough, she closed her hands around him. His big frame shook. \u201cSara.\u201d And then he was pressing her onto her back, tugging off her hands and sliding into her in one solid push.</p><p>Her entire body arched up off the bed. Wow, she thought, seconds before her sanity fractured, Deacon was built exactly in proportion.</p> <p>Body tingling from the aftereffects of the best orgasm of her life, Sara stared at the hotel ceiling. \u201cI knew we had chemistry, but that was unnatural.\u201d</p><p>The arm across her waist squeezed a little. \u201cI live to please.\u201d</p><p>Sexy, uninhibited as hell when you got past the control, and he had a sense of humor. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re in the market for a long-term relationship?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d expected shocked silence, but he answered straight away. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make a very good lover for the director.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like the spotlight, do you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, because she knew the answer. And part of her wished she didn\u2019t. Because she liked Deacon, more than liked him. Each time he revealed some new facet of his personality, she found it complemented hers on the deepest level. There was promise here. And it wasn\u2019t just about sex. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever get lonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing alone\u2019s never been a problem for me.\u201d His fingers played over the curve of her hip. \u201cYou\u2019re going to accept, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d always known it would come to this. \u201cThe Guild is important. It needs to have someone at the reins who cares enough to make sure it remains strong, that hunters are protected from vampires and angels both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the hunting?\u201d</p><p>She stroked her hand along his forearm. \u201cI\u2019ll miss it. But . . . not as much as some. My best friend, Ellie, she\u2019d go stir-crazy within a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElena Deveraux? Hunter-born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met her?\u201d She turned to him. Face relaxed with pleasure, hair all mussed, and green eyes lazy, he looked like a big cat sprawled beside her. A big, dangerous cat.</p><p>\u201cHeard about her,\u201d he said. \u201cThey call her the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d Sara was damn proud of Ellie, considered her more sister than friend. \u201cI worry about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry about all hunters.\u201d</p><p>And it was true. She did. \u201cI guess I was meant to be director.\u201d Her sense of responsibility was part of who she was. She could no more walk away and leave the Guild in weaker hands than she could force Deacon to change his lifestyle to accommodate hers. \u201cHow did you end up the Slayer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Guild keeps an eye on possibles. I was approached by the last Slayer and offered the position.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d accepted, Sara knew, for the same reason she would. \u201cSomeone has to do the job.\u201d But it was also a calling of sorts\u2014she knew she\u2019d love being director, that it would challenge and excite her in ways normal hunting couldn\u2019t hope to match.</p><p>\u201cAnd that someone might as well be the best.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shifted to face him fully, his hand on her hip, her own under her head. \u201cHave you ever met an archangel?\u201d The tiny hairs on her arms rose at the very idea.</p><p>\u201cNo. But you probably will.\u201d</p><p>She gave in to the shivers. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not for a long, long time.\u201d Angels she could deal with, but archangels were a whole different story. They simply didn\u2019t think like human beings in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>Deacon\u2019s lips curved. \u201cI think you\u2019ll handle it when the time comes.\u201d Reaching out, he brushed her hair off her face.</p><p>The tenderness of the gesture did her in. Again, she felt that promise. That tug that this could be so much more. \u201cRight now I just want to handle you.\u201d And she did.</p><p>An hour later, and despite her lack of sleep, she couldn\u2019t turn off, too revved up by pleasure. Deacon could do amazing things with his tongue, she thought, happily buzzed. Maybe the en dorphins lit up the right areas of her brain because she sat bolt upright and leaned over to pick up the PDA.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Deacon asked, one arm heavy around her waist.</p><p>She turned it on and checked. \u201cArgh, it\u2019s not here.\u201d Returning the PDA to its previous position, she slumped back onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA picture of Marco\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d She made a sound of frustration. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve been looking at this like it\u2019s some hate-crime thing, but what if it\u2019s a normal crazy who\u2019s using that to throw us off the scent?\u201d</p><p>Deacon pushed his hair off his face and raised an eyebrow. \u201cExplain \u2018normal crazy.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the boyfriend dumped Marco. Maybe Marco went batshit. And now maybe he\u2019s out cutting up vampires who look like his beloved.\u201d</p><p>Deacon frowned. \u201cThe victims don\u2019t fit a type\u2014they\u2019ve been blond, dark-haired, black, white.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath. \u201cIt seemed like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might still be a good idea.\u201d His hand went quiet on her skin. \u201cNo physical similarities, but they were all known to fraternize with humans more than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tracks,\u201d she said, feeling herself on the edge of understanding. \u201cI found Rodney through his human friends. He can\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of the victims had human lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a biggie,\u201d she said. \u201cHuman-vampire pairings are fairly common, especially with the younger vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s a distinct pattern when you put it together with the other stuff.\u201d Pushing off the sheet, he got out of bed.</p><p>Lord have mercy.</p><p>She stared unashamedly as he went to his jacket and grabbed a small black device. \u201cThis thing tracks the transmitters via GPS. I set it to beep if any of them moved, but just in case . . . No, they\u2019re all where we put them. The transmitters anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Tim,\u201d she murmured, wondering whether Deacon would mind if she used her teeth on that firm, muscled flesh of his. \u201cNo one\u2019s seen him for days. If he\u2019s not the killer . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.

Get dressed.\u201d</p><p>The chuckle was rich, unexpected, and so damn gorgeous, she almost jumped him again.</p> <p>\u201cNow. That\u2019s an order from the future Guild Director.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose naked toes I want to bite.\u201d</p><p>She curled said toes and continued to grin. \u201cHurry up.\u201d</p><p>Still chuckling, he seemed to be obeying. \u201cHow about a quick shower? We\u2019re sweaty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shower is tiny.\u201d But she lowered the sheet.</p> <p>His expression dared her.</p><p>She was such a sucker, she thought, getting up and sauntering off. But she got the last word . . . by driving him certifiably crazy while he was trapped in that steamy glass enclosure.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>It was seven a.m. when they set out again\u2014sleepless, but amped up on happy hormones as Sara liked to think of them, and armed to the teeth. It was obvious the vampires shadowing her were building up to something\u2014no reason to give them an easy target.</p><p>The streets were still winter-dark when they rode out, the fog curling over the houses like a whispered caress. Even the junkyard looked dreamy and somehow softer in the muted light.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take the front route today,\u201d she suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll say I\u2019m here to check up on him on orders from Simon.\u201d</p> <p>Deacon nodded and pulled the bike to a stop in front of the padlocked gate. \u201cLucy should be here any moment.\u201d</p><p>But though they waited, Deacon\u2019s favorite hellhound didn\u2019t appear. A bad feeling bloomed in the pit of Sara\u2019s stomach. \u201cWait.\u201d Getting off, she picked the lock and waved Deacon through. It was tempting to leave the gate open for an easy exit, but she didn\u2019t want Lucy escaping and terrorizing the neighborhood\u2014and maybe getting terrorized herself if she couldn\u2019t find her way back home.</p><p>Gate locked, she got back on the bike and they roared their way to Tim\u2019s house/shack\u2014or as close as they could get considering the random piles of junk. There was a light on inside. \u201cHe\u2019s home.\u201d Taking off her helmet, she hooked it on one handlebar, while Deacon did the same with his on the other.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d The Slayer\u2019s words were calm, his eyes intent as they made their way through a gap in the junk to emerge into a relatively open space near Tim\u2019s home. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Her instincts agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s do a circle of the house, make sure things are\u2014\u201d She saw them then. The vampires. Crouched on wrecked cars, lounging between towers of metal, leaning against the side of Tim\u2019s shack.</p><p>She knew there\u2019d be no running this time. \u201cWe need to get inside the house.\u201d It was the only defensible position. Her crossbow was already in her hands.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be ready for that.\u201d Deacon\u2019s back met hers as they stood facing in opposite directions.</p><p>\u201cUnless Tim\u2019s barricaded himself inside.\u201d</p> <p>Deacon said nothing, but she knew what he was doing. Listening. If Tim was alive and inside the house, he\u2019d let them know. But it was Lucy they heard, a sudden set of sharp barks and then nothing. The vampire closest to Sara swore loud enough that the sound carried. \u201cDamn devil dog ate half my leg.\u201d</p><p>It was such an ordinary thing to say, but she knew he was in no way ordinary. Not only did he carry centuries of experience in his eyes, he moved like a man who knew how to use every shift to his advantage. But there were no weapons in his hands. The archangels were nothing if not fair. Of course, their concept of fair meant two hunters\u2014possibly three\u2014against what looked like fifteen vamps.</p><p>\u201cSomebody upped the stakes,\u201d she murmured under her breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recognize any of them, even the old one. Means they belong to someone other than Raphael.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been thinking the same. \u201cGood to know my own archangel isn\u2019t trying to kill me.\u201d She aimed the crossbow at the leader of the group. \u201cGuess it\u2019s time for target practice.\u201d</p><p>The vampire smiled, polished and smooth. \u201cI want but a sip, milady.\u201d A voice that held echoes of gallantry and cruelty. \u201cThey say the Guild Director tastes sweet indeed.\u201d</p><p>Since she doubted very much that Simon would\u2019ve allowed anyone to munch on him, she took that with a grain of salt. \u201cYou so hard up for blood then?\u201d She moved a little toward the house. Deacon moved with her.</p><p>The vampires kept their distance . . . for now.</p><p>\u201cYou wound me, petite guerri\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>Little warrior? Sara almost shot him on principle. \u201cYou want to be chipped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies, sweet lies.\u201d He waved a finger. \u201cYou\u2019re only allowed chip-embedded weapons on a hunt. If you use illegal copies on me, you can\u2019t be Guild Director.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She hadn\u2019t expected the bluff to work, but his response meant he was smart. Smart plus old was not a good combination in a vampiric opponent. \u201cI really will shoot you if you get any closer\u2014and if I put a bolt through your heart, it\u2019ll leave you helpless.\u201d</p><p>The vampire spread his hands. \u201cAlas, I have my orders. My master does not see how a human female could run a guild of warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are female archangels.\u201d She felt Deacon\u2019s body tense, ready itself for battle.</p><p>\u201cAh, but you\u2019re not an archangel.\u201d And then he moved.</p><p>So did Sara and Deacon. It was as if they\u2019d been doing this for years. Shooting the crossbow as she ran sideways, she skew ered the lead vamp in the shoulder\u2014she\u2019d been aiming for his head, damn it\u2014and reloaded superfast using Deacon\u2019s patented technology. Hunters loved his weapons for a reason. She\u2019d shot five more bolts by the time they were blocked in again. But now they were within a three-second run of the house.</p><p>Deacon had stayed back to back with her the entire time, accommodating her smaller stride with an ease that told her exactly how good he was at combat. From the sounds she\u2019d heard, he was using some kind of a gun but not anything that shot bullets. The vamps were too close for her to risk a check, but she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d been injured anywhere.</p><p>\u201cEnough playing?\u201d she asked the vampire who seemed to be the mouthpiece of the entire group.</p><p>The handsome man had already removed the bolt and now tossed it at her feet. \u201cThat was rather unladylike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t exactly gentlemanly in attacking me.\u201d She could feel the edge of sunrise in the distance. Too bad the vamps wouldn\u2019t crumble to dust at the first touch of the sun\u2019s rays. Only in the movies were things so convenient. Some vampires did suffer from light sensitivity, but she bet every single one in this bunch was capable of walking around under noon-light itself.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d the vampire said. \u201cThat is so. But you have a knight to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a knight,\u201d she said, knowing full well this was about more than physical strength alone. \u201cI\u2019m not a queen to hide behind my troops. I\u2019m a general.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s expression grew strangely quiet. \u201cThen I will stop being a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>This time, she couldn\u2019t reload fast enough. Dropping the crossbow, she started to fight with knives, nicking him in the throat, catching a second vampire with a kick to the gut. Behind her, Deacon was taking out vamps left, right, and center. But they were severely outnumbered. This was in no way a fair fight.</p><p>Whoever had orchestrated this wanted Sara to die. Why? She slashed a line across one vampire\u2019s neck, and the blood that hit her was hot and fresh and nauseating. The vampire staggered back, hand clamped over his throat. She kept fighting, kicking and breaking knees. Something burned into her shoulder, and she stabbed a knife through the ear of the vamp who\u2019d decided to turn her into a breakfast buffet.</p><p>Howling, the attacker fell away. Deacon growled then, and she\u2019d never heard a more chilling sound. He took out three more coming at her, holding off two others on his own side as she grabbed the gun she\u2019d tucked into her lower back. \u201cReady!\u201d she yelled, and started firing to cover his reloading.</p><p>They were closer to the house. But not close enough. If Tim was in there, he was either injured, dead, or didn\u2019t give a shit. Else he\u2019d have been shooting as well. Which meant it was time for drastic measures. Simon had been very clear in his instructions.</p><p>\u201cWe walk a precarious line. The angels need us. But if we prove too powerful, they\u2019ll cheerfully wipe us from existence. Hurt the vampires they send after you, but try not to kill. Because if you do, you become a threat, not an asset.\u201d</p><p>Problem was, the vampires were healing from the nonfatal wounds only to continue their relentless\u2014and openly deadly\u2014assault. \u201cDeacon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Agreement.</p><p>Even as her hand moved to retrieve the miniature flame-thrower strapped to her thigh, a knife hit the vampire in front of her, severing his carotid artery. As he choked on his own blood and fell away from the attack, another knife lodged in the eye of the vampire she\u2019d hit with her first bolt.</p><p>Neither knife was Sara\u2019s.</p><p>Then the shooting started.</p><p>Knives from the left. Gunshots from the right.</p><p>And a clear pathway to the house. It had been the best choice at the start, a place from where they could make a stand. But now the odds had changed. \u201cYou thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFight.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she palmed a second gun from a shoulder holster and began firing two-handed.</p><p>Five minutes later, they had their backs to the house and the vampires were bloody and broken; caught between their guns and whoever was throwing knives\u2014and other things\u2014from the vicinity of the fence.</p><p>The head vamp raised his hands, palms out. \u201cI yield.\u201d</p><p>There was a collective groan from the other vampires\u2014all still alive\u2014as they collapsed onto the ground. Sara couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cYou think I\u2019m just going to let that go?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The vamp smiled. \u201cPolitics is a most unkind mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I expect any other visits from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The test has been passed.\u201d He blinked, his injured eye healing at a phenomenal rate. \u201cAnd the archangels have little interest in the inner workings of the Guild.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the whole trying-to-kill-me thing? What was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be done.\u201d Shrugging, he turned to his troops. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>Another five minutes and there wasn\u2019t a single vampire to be seen in the cool dawn light of a winter morning. Sara finally lowered her weapons and glanced at Deacon. He was bloody, his jacket torn in several places, but it was the look in his eyes that rocked her to the core. He was pissed. \u201cGoddamn it, Sara. I don\u2019t like you being hurt.\u201d And then he kissed her.</p><p>It was hot and wild and amazing . . . until Lucy began howling. And someone coughed.</p><p>Sara tore away from the kiss, gun raised\u2014to see a tall woman with long white blonde hair pulled into a ponytail, her eyes frankly curious and her body plastered with knives. \u201cSo,\u201d Ellie said, with a huge smile, \u201cyou and the Slayer, huh? I like.\u201d She looked Deacon up and down, and whistled. \u201cBest Friend Seal of Approval bestowed. With gold foil edging, even.\u201d</p> <p>Grinning, Sara went to hug her. Elena shook her head. \u201cI love you, Sara, but you\u2019re all bloody with vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Sara looked down at her soaked clothing. \u201cI thought I told you to stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have done that?\u201d Ellie raised an eyebrow. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Giving up, Sara threw up her hands. \u201cWe need to check on Tim\u2014the hunter inside.\u201d She turned to Deacon. \u201cThink we should send Ellie in? We wouldn\u2019t want to get blood all over Tim\u2019s floor.\u201d</p><p>Deacon\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>Elena glanced from one to the other. \u201cDo I have \u2018sucker\u2019 written on my forehead? I don\u2019t think so. I know all about Timothy\u2019s demon fiend of a sidekick.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his words, Deacon was already at the door. \u201cTim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d came the groaning answer as Lucy went into a barking frenzy. \u201cLuce, girl, down.\u201d A few growls but the dog quieted.</p><p>\u201cCover me,\u201d Deacon said and opened the door.</p><p>Sara was ready to shoot Lucy\u2014to disable, not kill\u2014but \u201cthe damn devil-eyed dog\u201d was sitting attentively by the sprawled form of her master, grinning as if she wasn\u2019t just waiting for a chance to bite off their faces. Tim had a gun in hand, a nasty bruise on the side of his face . . . and smelled like a distillery.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Tim,\u201d Ellie muttered, waving a hand in front of her hunter-sensitive nose. \u201cWhat, you took a beer bath?\u201d</p><p>Tim winced. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been on a bender?\u201d Sara blew out an angry breath. \u201cWe thought you were dead.\u201d Or a serial killer.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI got conscious long enough to shoot them, didn\u2019t I? And I\u2019m allowed to go on a bender after I find a vampire torn to pieces by a hate group\u2014they even cut off his fingers one by one. How fucking noble.\u201d</p> <p>Sara had had one of those cases, too. She\u2019d baked nonstop for five days after. Her neighbors loved her. \u201cWho\u2019s been feeding Lucy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, of course.\u201d He gave her an indignant look. \u201cAs if I\u2019d leave my baby without food.\u201d He kissed that mangy black head. \u201cShe knows where her stash is. And I leave fresh water all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTim,\u201d Sara pushed, \u201cthis is important. Can you prove where you\u2019ve been the past few days?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an oddly clear look. \u201cHiding in a corner of Sal\u2019s All-Night-All-the-Time bar. Matchbook\u2019s on the table.\u201d</p><p>Deacon called the number and confirmed Tim\u2019s story. Happy at the news, but cognizant of the implications, Sara rubbed her face. \u201cEllie, can you make sure Tim detoxes and gets that bruise taken care of? Deacon and I have something to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Tim murmured and tried to stand. Only to fall flat on his butt. \u201cOr maybe not.\u201d</p><p>Elena nodded. \u201cNo sweat. You need a hand?\u201d</p><p>It was Deacon who answered. \u201cStay close. If we need backup, we\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d Pulling \u201cyummy\u201d faces behind Deacon\u2019s back as he walked out to make another call, Ellie gave Sara the thumbs-up.</p><p>It was impossible not to smile, but that smile was gone by the time she reached the bike and Deacon. \u201cIt has to be Marco. And if not, we\u2019re in deep shit.\u201d Because that meant they had an unknown crazy out there.</p><p>\u201cI just checked with Simon. Shah left the city two hours ago, so if there\u2019s another killing . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for that. It\u2019s time to play hardball with Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can break him?\u201d</p><p>Deacon\u2019s face was a grim mask. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>It should\u2019ve scared her. It didn\u2019t. Because she knew how to play hardball, too. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d Getting on the bike, she took the helmet he held out. \u201cAfter this is over, I want a shower in a really big bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get us the penthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019ll be sharing it with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in hope.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she definitely wanted to keep him, she thought, as they closed the gate behind themselves and headed out. Maybe there was a way to make it work? But she knew there wasn\u2019t. She could hardly see Deacon in a tux at some \u201cdo.\u201d And the Guild Director had to play politics. Nobody liked a powerful presence like the Guild in the city, but that wariness could be turned into respect and even welcome by a little subtle maneuvering.</p><p>A long time ago, the Guild had chosen the veil of secrecy. The end result had been a spate of Guild-burnings that had razed many a chapter building to the ground, killing a devastating number of hunters in the process. No one wanted a repeat of that.</p><p>Suddenly conscious that Deacon had dramatically reduced his speed, she twisted to peer around one muscular arm. \u201cOh, no fucking way.\u201d Pulling off her helmet, she stood on the back of the bike, using Deacon\u2019s shoulder for balance. \u201cYou yielded,\u201d she told the vampire standing in the middle of the road. \u201cThis time, we\u2019ll be aiming to kill.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cMilady, you misunderstand me.\u201d A serious expression. \u201cI have need of the Guild\u2019s services.\u201d</p><p>Sara really didn\u2019t feel like helping someone who\u2019d tried to separate her head from her body not that long ago, but hunters existed for a reason. \u201cSomeone run out on a Contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. One of your hunters has taken one of us captive. If you would please organize a rescue, we\u2019d be most grateful.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed Deacon\u2019s shoulder. No way was this a coincidence. As she sat back down, Deacon maneuvered the bike to the side of the road. \u201cTalk,\u201d they both ordered at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSilas,\u201d the vampire said, shifting to stand on the sidewalk beside them, \u201chad a relationship with the hunter. Unbeknownst to anyone, they went their separate ways two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Around the time the killings started.</p><p>\u201cThe hunter\u2019s name is Marco Giardes.\u201d The vampire spread his hands. \u201cI have no idea of what happened between the two of them. But I received a message from Silas a few minutes ago stating that Marco was holding him captive in the basement of his home.\u201d</p><p>Sara wondered if Marco had guessed at her and Deacon\u2019s true motives after all. Something had to have triggered this. \u201cDid he say how long he\u2019d been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas walked into the hunter\u2019s bar an hour ago with his new inamorato.\u201d He snorted. \u201cHe is young, thinks being a vampire makes him invincible.\u201d A meaningful rub at the shoulder she\u2019d wounded.</p><p>\u201cDamn vampire wanted to rub Marco\u2019s face in his new affair.\u201d Sara almost felt sorry for Marco. Almost. Because if everything this vampire was saying was right, then Marco had gone out and killed five other men, none of whom had done anything to him. Not to mention how he\u2019d terrified Rodney. \u201cDo you have any other information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas\u2019s new lover is no more.\u201d A shrug. \u201cSilas got the message out before Marco realized he had a second cell phone. I\u2019ve received no messages since, so the hunter has likely remedied that.\u201d</p><p>Deacon stared at the vamp. \u201cIf you know where he is, why aren\u2019t you mounting a rescue? You have a big enough group.\u201d</p><p>A long pause. The vampire looked up, then down, lowered his voice. \u201cRaphael was not pleased when he found out about the attack on Sara. We are not his people. He has forbidden us from doing anything in his territory except that which relates to our departure\u2014even feeding.\u201d A long, shuddering sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re to leave on the first plane out of the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas is a tourist?\u201d Sara asked, rapidly thinking through her options.</p><p>\u201cMarco met him during a hunt. Silas came to be with him.\u201d Another glance upward. \u201cWe would appeal to our archangel for help, but he doesn\u2019t particularly care for Silas.\u201d</p><p>Sara didn\u2019t trust the vampire an inch, but she had a feeling he was telling the truth about Marco and Silas. There was a layer of concern in his voice that betrayed an obvious affection for the younger vampire. That wasn\u2019t as weird as it sounded. Vampires had once been human, after all\u2014it took a long time for the echoes to fade entirely.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She put her helmet back on. \u201cI guess it\u2019s time for the Guild to ride to the rescue.\u201d</p><p>Deacon started the engine in silence and they headed off, leaving the vampire standing at the curb. \u201cI think he was straight with us,\u201d she said. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fits with what we know.\u201d His voice was an intimate darkness in her ear. \u201cLooks as if Raphael likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him. Or even talked to him on the phone.\u201d She drew in a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She knew exactly where humans ranked in the scheme of things as far as archangels were concerned. Somewhere below ants. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that some other archangel tried to horn in on his territory. He\u2019s pissed.\u201d And when an archangel got pissed, things got brutal. \u201cDid you hear what he did to that vampire in Times Square?\u201d</p><p>A slow nod from Deacon. \u201cBroke every bone in his body and left him there. As a warning. He was alive throughout, the poor bastard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you see why I don\u2019t ever want Raphael to take an interest in my welfare.\u201d</p><p>Deacon didn\u2019t say anything, but they both knew that as Guild Director, she\u2019d have a much higher chance of attracting Raphael\u2019s attention than an ordinary hunter. But still, how many times did an archangel contact any human directly? Sara had never heard of it. They ran everything from their towers.</p><p>Manhattan\u2019s Archangel Tower dwarfed everything in the entire state. Sara had often sat in Ellie\u2019s way-too-expensive apartment and watched the angels flying in and out. Their feet, she thought, likely never touched the earth. \u201cYou know, I think Ellie\u2019s got a higher chance of meeting an archangel than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a feeling.\u201d A prickling across the back of her neck, a kiss of the \u201ceye\u201d her great-grandmother claimed to possess. \u201cThink we should call her for backup?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf Marco\u2019s in there alone, we can take him. Let\u2019s check things out first\u2014I don\u2019t want to panic him.\u201d A pause. \u201cThough it sounds like Silas is no prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But Marco hurt Rodney, who\u2019s about as dangerous as your average rabbit.\u201d She hoped his master hadn\u2019t been too hard on him. And that Mindy the Bitch had gotten her head torn off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d He pulled over and parked. \u201cThe bar should be closed.\u201d</p><p>Stowing the helmets, they headed to the bar . . . only to come to an abrupt halt when a little old lady on her way down from farther along the street stared at them and backed away very fast. Sara looked at Deacon, really looked. Big, sexy, loaded up with weapons . . . and stained rust red. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, slow and with a glint that said he was thinking about getting naked. With her. \u201cWe better wrap this up before the police arrive and all hell breaks loose.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she shoved aside the thought of soaping up his delicious body and picked up the pace. \u201cHow\u2019re we getting into the basement?\u201d</p> <p>Deacon raised an eyebrow. \u201cWe ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014Oh, that\u2019ll work. Two hunters, needing sanctuary and somewhere to clean up. I\u2019m good with that.\u201d</p><p>The door to the bar was locked shut, all the neon turned off. Deacon went to knock, but Sara grabbed his hand and pointed to the intercom hidden discreetly to the side. Pushing the button, she waited.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Marco\u2019s voice. Sounding tired, but not the least bit aggressive.</p><p>\u201cMarco, it\u2019s Sara and Deacon. We need a place to clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d The door clicked open. \u201cCome on through.\u201d</p><p>They went in. Sara waited until the door had closed behind them to whisper, \u201cIs it just me or does he sound way too normal?\u201d</p><p>Deacon was frowning as well. \u201cEither he\u2019s one hell of a good actor or something else is up.\u201d</p> <p>Marco stuck his head out the door that led up to his apartment. He whistled when he saw them. \u201cMust\u2019ve been some fight. The bathroom\u2019s big enough for two.\u201d A sharp grin that tried to hide exhaustion and failed.</p><p>Again, nothing weird about that if he hadn\u2019t yet had a chance to go to bed.</p><p>Then she saw the mess that was the bar itself. Bottles shattered, blood on the floor, what looked like bullet holes in the walls. A second later, Marco stepped out from behind the door, and it became apparent he was sporting the beginnings of a serious black eye. \u201cDo I dare ask?\u201d She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Marco thrust a hand through his hair. \u201cCome on up and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow would be better,\u201d Deacon said, unmoving.</p><p>The bar owner looked from one to the other and said, \u201cShit.\u201d Sounding like his heart had just broken into a million pieces, he sat down on the last step, head in his hands. \u201cHe set me up. The bastard set me up.\u201d</p><p>Sara was starting to get a headache. She\u2019d come in here expecting to rescue a hurt vampire from an unhinged hunter, and found a shattered lover. \u201cHow about we take this from the top?\u201d she suggested, staying out of attack range in case Marco actually was that good an actor. \u201cWhere\u2019s Silas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocked in the basement.\u201d Marco\u2019s eyes were bleak when he glanced at them. \u201cI needed time to get my shit together before I called the Guild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the man who was with him?\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded at the bar. \u201cSilas came up behind him and . . .\u201d He stared at his hands. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. But the blood, God, so much blood.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Deacon to keep an eye on him, she pulled herself up onto the gleaming wooden surface and looked down. A vampire\u2019s bright blue eyes stared up at her. She sucked in a breath. If she hadn\u2019t been able to see that his head was no longer attached to his body, she\u2019d have thought him alive. \u201cDead,\u201d she confirmed to Deacon. \u201cThe question is, how did he get that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas,\u201d Marco repeated dully. \u201cHe came in here, strutting like a damn peacock. I should\u2019ve left him outside but I\u2014\u201d He swallowed, hand fisted, pain apparent in every taut tendon. \u201cI thought maybe he\u2019d come to apologize. I didn\u2019t see the kid till after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize?\u201d Sara had the sinking feeling they\u2019d all been drawn into one seriously bad lover\u2019s tiff.</p><p>\u201cFor cheating on me.\u201d Marco finally looked her full in the face. \u201cHere I was, being a putz. I gave my notice at the Guild, set up this place, all because he said he hated knowing I was putting my life on the line with every hunt. I even asked Simon to talk to some of the senior angels, see if we could maybe get the rest of Silas\u2019s Contract transferred to an angel in the States so we wouldn\u2019t have to keep going back and forth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Sara grabbed a dented but still whole bottle of water and threw it at him. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He chugged the entire bottle, then threw it aside. \u201cHe was just using me. Wanted out of his Contract\u2014his angel doesn\u2019t like him. I could\u2019ve swallowed that. Hell on the ego, but I\u2019d have swallowed it. I loved him. But the whole time we were together, he was with . . . who the fuck knows. More than one guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Sara folded her arms. \u201cWhy would he set you up if he was the one cheating?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I dumped him.\u201d And in that moment, Sara saw the hunter Marco was. Hard, lethal, certainly very good at his job. \u201cI told him to get out and stay out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich meant he lost any chance of getting his Contract transferred.\u201d Deacon didn\u2019t move from his position by the door. \u201cIt sounds good. But all the evidence points to a hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took my stuff. My weapons, clothes, one of the ceremonial swords I collect.\u201d Marco ground his teeth together. \u201cI feel so fucking stupid. I knew he didn\u2019t handle rejection well, but I never thought he\u2019d go around killing people just to get back at me.\u201d</p><p>Sara glanced at Deacon. He shook his head in a slight negative. She agreed. Marco was very, very believable. But it was his word against this Silas\u2019s. If they backed him, the vampires would take it badly\u2014unless they had proof. In which case, Silas would disappear to face angelic justice. Hunters could kill, but only in exigent circumstances, or when they had an execution warrant. It made more sense for angels to deliver any necessary punishment\u2014they were faster, stronger, and far more cruel than the vampires they Made.</p><p>\u201cSecurity cameras,\u201d she asked Marco. \u201cDid you record the fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Self-disgust marred the handsome lines of his face. \u201cI turned them off when I realized it was him\u2014didn\u2019t want anyone seeing how much of a fool I\u2019d been. At least I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to leave my gun behind. Shot grazed his head, knocked him out.\u201d</p><p>That explained how Marco had gotten the vamp into the basement. \u201cWe need to talk to Silas.\u201d Sara stepped forward, expecting an argument.</p><p>Marco got up. \u201cI\u2019ll take you\u2014let\u2019s see what the bastard has to say.\u201d</p><p>Letting him go on ahead, they followed with weapons drawn. Silas was pounding on the door by the time they got there.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d More pounding. \u201cHelp! I can hear you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d Deacon\u2019s voice cut through the pounding like a knife.</p><p>Sara took the lead. \u201cHow\u2019d you end up locked in the basement?\u201d</p><p>They got pretty much the same story as from Marco . . . but with the roles reversed. By the time it was over, Sara\u2019s headache had turned into a thumping monster. How in hell were they going to fix this? The wrong move and a lot more blood would spill.</p><p>She looked to Deacon. \u201cGot handcuffs?\u201d</p><p>He handed her a thin plastic pair. \u201cThey\u2019ll hold.\u201d Marco lifted up his hands without question when she turned. Clicking the cuffs shut, she led him back upstairs, stashing him on the stairway that led up to his apartment . . . after blindfolding him and tying his feet together, then redoing the cuffs to lock him to the railing. Hunters were extremely resourceful when it came to survival.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t run,\u201d Marco told her, a broken kind of pain in his voice that hurt her.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d she said, \u201cI believe you.\u201d If she was going to be Guild Director, she had to learn to judge her people. \u201cBut we need proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s smart. Part of his charm.\u201d</p><p>Silas hadn\u2019t sounded particularly charming to Sara, but then, she wasn\u2019t in love with him. Patting Marco on the shoulder, she walked out, pulling the door shut behind her. \u201cRodney,\u201d she said to Deacon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even if he can tell their voices apart, how seriously is anyone going to take him?\u201d She pulled out her cell phone. Hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d</p> <p>As she waited for the phone to be answered, she found her eyes locked with Deacon\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to deal with messes like this all the time as director.\u201d</p><p>A nod. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll care enough to find out the truth.\u201d Bridging the distance between them, he touched her cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>The phone was picked up on the other end. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Sara dropped her head against Deacon\u2019s chest at the sound of that voice. \u201cMindy, I need to speak to your master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got punished because you tattled.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Sara didn\u2019t have time to engage in a pissing contest. \u201cYou should\u2019ve been more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Mindy said. \u201cI\u2019m four hundred years old and I can\u2019t get rid of the twerp. Not your fault. Hold on.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, and glad something was going right, she took a deep breath as Lacarre\u2019s cultured voice came on the line. \u201cHunter.\u201d A demand for why she was calling, and permission to speak, all in one word.</p><p>She explained. \u201cIf we could borrow Rodney for a few minutes, it might help clear things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the victims included two of my own, I\u2019d be very interested in learning the identity of the perpetrator. We\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d</p> <p>Closing the phone, she hugged Deacon. \u201cThink anyone would notice if I chucked it all in and ran screaming for the hills?\u201d</p><p>Warm, strong hands rubbing over her back. \u201cThey might send the Slayer after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo flirting. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, then.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop the back rub. \u201cI think this officially equals the oddest case of my career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m always surprised when vampires act as weird as ordinary humans. It\u2019s not like they gain the wisdom of the ages with the transformation.\u201d His heart beat strong and steady under her cheek. Solid. Calming. A woman could get used to that kind of an anchor.</p><p>They stood in silence for a long time, until Sara\u2019s heart beat in rhythm with his. \u201cDid you ever consider another career?\u201d she asked in a low, private whisper, realizing she knew nothing of his past. It didn\u2019t matter. It was the man he was today who fascinated her. \u201cAside from the Guild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A single word that held a wealth of history.</p><p>She didn\u2019t push. \u201cMe, either. I met my first hunter while I was living on a commune\u2014don\u2019t even ask\u2014when I was ten. She was so smart and tough and practical. It was love at first sight.\u201d</p> <p>His chuckle sounded a little raw. \u201cI saw mine after a bloodlust-crazed vampire destroyed our entire neighborhood. The hunter found me standing over the vampire, chopping his head off with a meat cleaver.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed him tight. \u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re not a psycho vampire-killer yourself.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, it was the right thing to say. He laughed softly and all but folded himself around her, kissing her temple with a tenderness that shattered her remaining defenses like so much glass. \u201cI decided I\u2019d rather be one of the good guys. I don\u2019t like tracking and executing my fellow hunters\u2014every kill hurts like a bitch.\u201d</p><p>And that, Sara suddenly knew, was why the last Slayer had chosen Deacon as his successor. The Slayer had to love the Guild with all his heart and soul. Every decision had to be made with the wrenching power of that love\u2014Deacon would never execute a hunter without absolute, undeniable evidence. Otherwise, Marco would\u2019ve been dead days ago.</p><p>Lifting up her head, she kissed his throat. \u201cHow do you feel about carrying on a secret affair with the Guild Director?\u201d She couldn\u2019t let him go. Not without a fight.</p><p>\u201cI prefer the world know full well I consider a woman mine.\u201d An uncompromising answer. \u201cSecrets just come back to bite you in the ass.\u201d</p><p>There went that possibility. Before she could come up with another, the front door vibrated under the force of an imperious knock. Lacarre had arrived. \u201cShowtime.\u201d Pulling away from Deacon, she walked over and let in both Lacarre and his entourage\u2014Mindy, Rodney, and unexpectedly, the vampire who\u2019d originally asked for their help. \u201cPlease come in.\u201d She raised an eyebrow at the one who didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>\u201cWe found him loitering,\u201d Mindy said, waving a hand with insouciance that told them she couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cLacarre decided he might be of help.\u201d</p><p>The foreign vampire didn\u2019t look especially pleased to have been dragged inside, but nobody said no to an angel.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the two men?\u201d Lacarre asked, keeping his wings several inches off the floor so they wouldn\u2019t drag on the sticky mess of glass, blood, and alcohol that coated the varnished surface.</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s behind there.\u201d She nodded at the closed door that led up to Marco\u2019s apartment. \u201cAnd the other\u2019s in the basement.\u201d</p><p>Mindy stroked a hand down Deacon\u2019s arm. \u201cDo they look like this one?\u201d It was a sultry invitation.</p><p>Deacon said nothing, just watched her with eyes gone so cold, even Sara felt the chill. Deacon did scary really, really well. Mindy dropped her hand as if it had been singed and returned to Lacarre\u2019s side quick-fast. Rodney was already cowering behind the angel\u2019s wings.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a good vampire,\u201d the angel said to Deacon. \u201cI might actually trust the city wouldn\u2019t fall apart if I left you in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer hunting.\u201d</p><p>The angel nodded. \u201cPity. Rodney, you know what you have to do?\u201d</p><p>Rodney bobbed his head so fast, it was as if it were on springs. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d He looked childishly eager to please.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Keeping her voice gentle, Sara held out her hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you last time, did I?\u201d</p><p>Rodney took a moment to think about that before coming over to close his fingers around her own. \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to get me, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She patted his arm with her free hand. \u201cAll I want you to do is listen to their voices and tell me which one sounds like the man who hurt you.\u201d</p><p>They went to Marco first, Lacarre and Mindy following. It made the hairs on the back of her neck rise to have a powerful angel and his bloodthirsty vampire floozy behind her\u2014she was able to bear it only because Deacon was bringing up the rear, with Silas\u2019s friend in front of him. \u201cMarco.\u201d She banged on the door. \u201cI want you to threaten to cut off Rodney\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>Rodney shot her a wide-eyed look. She whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s just pretend.\u201d</p><p>Marco began yelling a second later. Eyes wide, Rodney skittered away from the door and Sara felt her stomach fall. \u201cIs it him?\u201d she asked, after Marco went quiet.</p><p>Rodney was shivering. \u201cNo, but he\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>Lacarre wasn\u2019t fond of the basement idea, but he came down with them. And when Silas refused to do as ordered, the angel whispered, \u201cOr would you rather I come in for a private . . . talk?\u201d Silky sweet, dark as chocolate, and sharp as a stiletto sliding between your ribs.</p><p>If Sara had ever had any delusions about trying to become a vampire, they would\u2019ve died a quick death then and there. She never wanted to be under the control of anyone who could put that much cruelty, that much pain, into a single sentence.</p><p>Chastened, Silas made a wooden threat. About as scary as a teddy bear. Sara was about to order him to do it with more feeling when Rodney turned around and tried to run back up the stairs. Deacon caught him. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>To Sara\u2019s surprise, the vampire clung to him as a child would to its father. \u201cIt was him. He\u2019s the bad man.\u201d</p><p>Lacarre stared at the back of Rodney\u2019s head, then at Sara. \u201cBring this Silas upstairs. I will hear from the hunter as to what happened.\u201d</p><p>Sara had her crossbow at the ready, but it proved unnecessary. Tall, dark, and striking Silas, his clothes torn and bloody, followed them meek as a lamb. Leaving him in front of Lacarre and Mindy\u2014with the foreign vamp skulking in the background\u2014she released Marco and walked with him to the others.</p><p>Silas glared at his ex-lover. \u201cYou kill and put the blame on me.\u201d</p><p>Marco ignored him, staring straight ahead as he recited what Sara believed to be the truth. Around the time that he got to his rejection of Silas, the out-of-town vampire gasped and said, \u201cI believed you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet!\u201d Silas screamed.</p><p>Lacarre raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo. Continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has done this before,\u201d the foreign vampire said. \u201cThree decades ago, when a human he\u2019d been romancing left him for another vampire, he killed four of our own kind.\u201d</p><p>Sara met his eye. \u201cWere they men with strong ties to humanity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A trembling answer. \u201cHe told me the bloodlust had gotten hold of him. He was young . . . I protected him.\u201d The clearly shaken vampire took a deep breath and turned his back on his former friend. \u201cI no longer do.\u201d</p><p>Silas screamed and jumped up as if to attack, but Deacon brought him down with a single chop to the throat. The vamp went down like a tree. Marco flinched but didn\u2019t turn even then.</p><p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d Lacarre murmured,\u201cit\u2019s a great pity you don\u2019t wish to be Made. If you ever change your mind, let me know.\u201d</p><p>Deacon\u2019s smile was faint. \u201cNo offense, but I like being my own master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tempt you with beauties like Mindy, but it seems you\u2019ve made your choice.\u201d He walked over to Silas\u2019s unconscious body. \u201cThe Guild has the right to demand restitution and proffer punishment. What is your will?\u201d A question aimed solely at Sara. As if she were already director.</p><p>Sara glanced at Marco, saw the struggle on his face and knew there could be only one answer. \u201cMercy,\u201d she said. \u201cExecute him with mercy.\u201d For they all knew that Silas wouldn\u2019t be allowed to live. \u201cNo torture, no pain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lacarre shook his head. \u201cSo human.\u201d</p><p>She knew it wasn\u2019t a compliment. \u201cIt\u2019s a flaw I can live with.\u201d She never wanted to become anything close to what Lacarre was\u2014so cold, even when he looked at her with such apparent interest.</p><p>\u201cSo be it.\u201d Walking over to Silas, he bent and gathered the vampire in his arms with effortless strength. \u201cIt will be done as you asked.\u201d</p> <p>As he walked away, Mindy and the others trailing behind the wide sweep of his cream-colored wings, Sara saw Deacon put a hand on Marco\u2019s shoulder. A single squeeze. Words whispered so low that she couldn\u2019t hear what was said. But when Deacon moved back to her side, Marco no longer looked like he was dying a slow, painful death. Oh, he was hurting plenty, but there was also a glimmer of stubborn will, the kind that made humans into hunters.</p><p>He turned to Sara. \u201cI\u2019m withdrawing my resignation from the Guild. I thought . . . I hoped, but I can\u2019t stay here anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure Simon knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary, is it, Sara?\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSo long as you do.\u201d</p><p>Sara said good-bye to Deacon outside the hotel six hours later. He had his gear and she had hers. Ellie was waiting for her in a clean rental car, ready to start the drive to New York. One last road trip before she became bogged down in the myriad responsibilities that came along with running one of the most powerful and influential chapters of the Guild.</p> <p>\u201cThe next year\u2019s going to be brutal,\u201d she said to Deacon as he sat sideways on his bike, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his arms folded. \u201cJust as well you said no\u2014I probably couldn\u2019t carry on a secret affair even if I tried.\u201d She should\u2019ve laughed then, but she couldn\u2019t find any laughter inside her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t do anything sappy. He was Deacon. He stood, put his hand behind her neck, and kissed the breath out of her. Then he kissed her again. \u201cI have some things to do. And you have a directorship waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, the whiskey and midnight taste of him in her mouth. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better go. Ellie\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing him tight once more, she turned and walked away. He was right to do it this way. Whatever they had, the sweet, shining promise she could still see hovering on the horizon, it deserved to be left whole, instead of being crushed under the weight of unmet expectations.</p><p>\u201cDrive,\u201d she said to Ellie the instant the door closed behind her.</p> <p>Ellie took one look at her and didn\u2019t say a word. In fact, neither of them spoke until they\u2019d crossed the state line. Then Ellie glanced over and said, \u201cI liked him.\u201d</p><p>The unadorned remark splintered every one of Sara\u2019s defenses.</p><p>Dropping her head into her hands, she cried. Ellie pulled over to the side of the wide-open road and held her while she sobbed. Her best friend didn\u2019t insult either of them by spouting bullshit platitudes. Instead, she said, \u201cYou know, Deacon didn\u2019t strike me as the kind of man who lets go of things that matter.\u201d</p><p>Sara smiled, knowing her face was a blotchy mess. \u201cCan you see him in a tux?\u201d Her stomach tightened at the idea.</p><p>\u201cLet me get the visual. Okay, I have it.\u201d Elena sighed. \u201cOh, baby, I could lick him up in a tux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Mine.\u201d It was a growl.</p><p>Ellie grinned. \u201cI have a pulse. He\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d One who\u2019d made her smile, if only for an instant. \u201cI can just picture him shaking hands and playing Guild politics. Not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ellie shrugged. \u201cThe Guild Director has to do all that stuff. Who says her lover has to be anything but a big, scary, silent son of a bitch?\u201d</p><p>It was tempting to agree, to hold on to hope, but Sara shook her head. \u201cI have to be realistic. The man\u2019s a complete loner. It\u2019s why he\u2019s the Slayer.\u201d Dragging in a shaky breath, she sat back up and said, \u201cTake us to New York. I have a job to do.\u201d</p><p>Strong words, but her fingers found their way into a pocket, skating over the tiny serrated sawblade hidden within. It was Deacon\u2019s. The man had some really interesting weapons\u2014like a gun that fired these spinning circular babies instead of bullets. It was what he\u2019d been using out in Tim\u2019s junkyard. That made her wonder how Lucy was doing.</p><p>A tiny smile tugged at her lips\u2014who knew her favorite memory of Deacon would be of him cuddling a vicious hellhound of a dog?</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Two months later, Sara stared at her reflection\u2014the woman who looked back at her appeared both poised and quintessen tially elegant in a strapless black sheath. Her hair had been styled in a sophisticated bun at the back of her head, her new bangs swept to the side with an elegance she\u2019d never have been able to achieve in the field, and her face made up with skill that highlighted her cheekbones, brought out her eyes. \u201cI feel like a fraud.\u201d</p><p>Simon chuckled and walked to stand behind her. \u201cBut you look precisely what you are\u2014a powerful, beautiful woman.\u201d His eyes dropped to her necklace. \u201cGood choice.\u201d</p><p>It was that shiny serrated blade. Deacon\u2019s blade. She\u2019d had it strung on a silver chain. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the people you meet tonight will try to sneer at you. There are a few who see hunters as nothing more than jumped-up hired help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like Mrs. Abernathy?\u201d she said, tone dry as she named the society matron whose party she was about to attend. \u201cShe asked me if I\u2019d like some help with \u2018appropriate clothing, dear.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Simon squeezed her shoulders. \u201cHere\u2019s some advice\u2014anytime one of those \u2018blue bloods\u2019 tries to bring you down, remember that you deal with angels every day. Most of them would pee their pants at the thought.\u201d</p><p>She choked. \u201cSimon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd someday, you might even deal with a member of the Cadre. No matter how important they think they are, most humans will never come within touching distance of an archangel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d probably pee my pants then, too,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d Unexpectedly serious words. \u201cAs for the upper-crust vampires, remember, we hunt them. Not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Sara nodded and blew out a breath. \u201cI wish we didn\u2019t have to do this crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels might scare us, but hunters scare most other people\u2014including a lot of vampires. Reassure them. Convince them we\u2019re civilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a con.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>Simon grinned back, but it wasn\u2019t his face she wanted to see beside hers in the mirror. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready.\u201d This was her first solo outing as Guild-Director-in-training. The transition would be complete by year\u2019s end.</p><p>\u201cGo get \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>The party didn\u2019t bore her silly. It was the last sign\u2014had she needed one\u2014that she was the right person for the job. Ellie would\u2019ve shot at least five people by now. Sara smiled and parried another nosy question while soaking up the relentless flow of gossip. It was all intelligence. Hunters needed to know a lot of things\u2014like who a vampire might run to, or which individuals might sympathize with the angels to the extent of going vigilante.</p><p>Of course, to all outward appearances, she was simply mingling\u2014just another well-dressed female among dozens of others. Mrs. Abernathy had beamed at her when she arrived. \u201cProbably surprised I didn\u2019t turn up in blood-soaked leathers,\u201d she muttered into her champagne flute during a moment\u2019s respite on the balcony.</p><p>\u201cWould\u2019ve worked for me.\u201d</p><p>The smile that cracked her face was surely idiotic, but she didn\u2019t turn. \u201cIs it the leathers you like or the body in them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me.\u201d Warm breath against her nape, hands on her hips. \u201cBut I could get used to this dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, eyes up.\u201d She put the champagne flute on the waist-high wall that surrounded the balcony. \u201cNo scoping the cleavage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it.\u201d He turned her with a stroking caress.</p><p>And the air rushed out of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, man.\u201d She leaned back and twirled a finger.</p><p>Of course Deacon didn\u2019t give her a fashion show. He flicked at her sideswept bangs instead. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansom said it makes me look like I have raccoon eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansom has hair like a girl.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d Throwing her arms around his neck, she kissed him with wild abandon, and it felt way beyond good. So she did it again. \u201cThe debutantes are going to wet their panties over you.\u201d</p><p>He looked horrified.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d She pressed a kiss to his jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll scare them away.\u201d</p><p>Deacon caused such a stir she thought they might have a Chanel No. 5-scented stampede in the ballroom. She also thought it\u2019d make him turn and run. That he\u2019d come . . . well, hell, it had stolen her heart right out of her chest. But she didn\u2019t expect him to stand at her side with quiet focus, as if the attention didn\u2019t even register.</p><p>A few of the men tried to use his presence to ignore her\u2014male chauvinist pigs\u2014but Deacon deflected the ball back at her so smoothly, the others never knew what hit them. Sexy, dangerous, smart, and he knew how to deal with dunderheads without making a scene. She was so keeping him. And stabbing a knife into the heart of any debutante/trophy-wife-wannabe who came within sniffing distance.</p><p>\u201cI expect,\u201d he whispered in her ear during a rare minute of privacy, \u201clarge amounts of sexual favors for being this good.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>And she was. Done over thoroughly.</p><p>By the time they reached the apartment, she was burning up for him. They didn\u2019t make it to the bed the first time. Her pretty, slinky dress ended up in shreds at her feet as Deacon took her against the door, his mouth fused with hers. She came with a hard rush that had her clutching at his white dress shirt with desperate hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The second time was slower, sweeter.</p><p>Afterward, they lay side by side, face to face. It was an indescribably intimate way to be, and she hardly dared speak for fear of breaking the moment. \u201cThere goes your secret identity. As of tomorrow, you\u2019re going to be in gossip columns from here to Timbuktu.\u201d</p><p>He nipped at her upper lip. \u201cI bought the tux.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked. \u201cYou bought the tux.\u201d Bubbles of happiness burst into life inside her, rich and golden. \u201cMore cost-effective than renting one if you plan to use it a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the guy at the store said.\u201d Shifting closer, he stroked his hand over the sweep of her back, his skin a little rough and all perfect. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m too happy right now.\u201d</p><p>A smile against her lips. \u201cThis \u2018but\u2019 you have to deal with, Ms. Guild Director.\u201d Light words. Serious tone.</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to resign as the Slayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, of course.\u201d As of tonight, he was too well-known, and more importantly, by staying with her, he\u2019d get to know too many hunters . . . make too many friends. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a replacem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was doing. I have a candidate for you.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Sara stroked her fingers over the square line of his jaw. \u201cI can\u2019t be your boss.\u201d It was a solemn realization. \u201cI need to be your lover.\u201d</p><p>Deacon reached out to draw a circle around the spot where her necklace had rested before he\u2019d taken it off. \u201cI figured I\u2019d go totally independent with the weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat works.\u201d The tightness in her chest eased. \u201cKind of seems one-sided though. You\u2019re giving up everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get you.\u201d A simple statement that meant more than she could ever articulate.</p><p>She swallowed the knot of emotion in her throat. \u201cI talked to Tim a week ago.\u201d</p><p>Deacon frowned. \u201cTim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The frown turned into a slow, spreading smile. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d She threw a leg over his and snuggled close. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep one of the pups for me. I was going to call it Deacon.\u201d</p><p>He started laughing, and it was infectious. She buried her face in his neck and gave in.</p><p>The puppy was black as pitch, with big brown eyes and feet so big he promised to become a monster like his mom. Since it would\u2019ve been a little confusing to have two Deacons in the house, they decided to call him Slayer.</p>  </body></html>"]
