The man was young, exotic and gorgeous, a humanoid shifter from the planet Tygeria who was also one of the most notorious men in all the galaxies. This was Kyle\u2019s first look at him and something about the man fascinated him. He traced a finger down one of the stripes on the face in the picture.</p><p>Extremely fit and muscular, Tygerians were even bigger than the Lycans, at an average of perhaps seven feet tall. Their skin was a golden-brown, and most were fair-haired. Tarr Bonnet\u2019s hair was long and curly and a shade somewhere between red and gold. His eyes, like all of his people\u2019s, were catlike, slanted, and a rich emerald green. In addition, the Tygerians had exotic, black tiger-like stripes running just under their skin, making the people look like some outlandish fantasy creature.</p><p>Gods, he was a gorgeous thing, and Kyle had to adjust himself a little as he stared down at the picture. Too bad he was a thieving, cold-blooded bastard of a Jolly Roger pirate.</p> <p>Blayde walked up behind him and stood looking over his shoulder. \u201cNice looking, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Kyle slanted him an incredulous glance. Calling Tarr Bonnet nice looking just wasn\u2019t adequate. The words were too tame, too ordinary for what he was.</p><p>Kyle nodded anyway and traced his finger over the picture again. \u201cThis one won\u2019t be easy to catch,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of the Tygerians are strong and smart, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Tarr Bonnet is for sure. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll need your help. I\u2019m not taking Ryan on this one, even though I hate to be away from him that long. If anything went wrong...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hells, that\u2019s right. The Tygerians love humans. They prefer them, they say, over all other species.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Blayde replied, his lips tightening. \u201cFor their submissive love slaves. If he got his hands on Ryan he\u2019d have him packaged up and sold to the highest bidder before I knew what hit me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan and Blayde had been mated for almost two full cycles, and still couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other. Blayde had every right to be cautious about him, though. The young man was beautiful and a former porn star, whose vids had been circulated all over the known galaxies. Not to mention the fact that he was a blond humanoid from the planet Earth, and exactly the type the Tygerians were so fond of as their concubines. They would pay a lot for a prize like him if they could get their hands on him. Though the Alliance would love to put a stop to it, the Tygerians had been trafficking in human slaves for many years, and paid little attention to anything the Alliance wanted. Tygeria had been at war with the Alliance for over a century.</p><p>It had all started when the Alliance of Planets had discovered how rich Tygeria was\u2014rich beyond belief\u2014in diamond deposits. Probable reserves using Alliance standard measures had been estimated at five hundred million cubic meters of ore at an ore grade of 2.29 carats per one hundred cubic meters. With diamonds as the primary monetary system of the Alliance, its governing body first tried diplomacy\u2014and when that didn\u2019t work, they tried invasion.</p><p>The Tygerians fought off the Alliance forces with unparalleled ferocity. In the first wave of invasion, almost ninety years before, the invading starship troopers had been totally annihilated by the Tygerian forces when they shifted into massive tigers and wiped out the first wave of troopers to the last man. At that time, they took no prisoners, and made an example of the ones they managed to catch. The bodies the Alliance forces managed to recover had been ripped to pieces.</p><p>Then an Alliance ship had crashed on the planet while attempting a covert operation, and its entire crew of one hundred and fifteen men had been taken mostly alive. The Tygerians had imprisoned them and used them in their Exhibition Games, gladiator-style games that were fought before a huge crowd of spectators, with only the most fit and brave Alliance warriors surviving to fight again. At the end of the games only a handful of men had survived, and they were taken as love slaves by their victorious opponents in order to humiliate the Alliance.</p><p>They paraded the men around the arena naked and almost defenseless. Young Tygerian warriors came out to face them, and the crowds in the stands gave a thumbs up or down to determine which of the Alliance warriors deserved to live after the dust settled.</p> <p>The Tygerian battle commander himself had taken one of the survivors as his slave and concubine and fallen in love with him. Since then, Earthan humanoids had become very popular on the planet as love slaves, but any humanoid species whose planet belonged to the Alliance was fair game.</p><p>Now, almost a hundred years later, neither diplomacy nor war had brought the Alliance any closer to their goal of taking over the planet. Tygeria was one of the largest planets in the known galaxies, with resources and technology their enemies could still only guess at. The entire planet was shrouded in thick gases that shielded its surface from its sun\u2019s searing rays and from all but the most determined alien intrusion. The Tygerians wanted only to be left alone, but with the diamond standard growing higher every year, it was unlikely that would ever happen.</p><p>Since the Tygerians became aware that diamonds were the monetary standard of the Alliance and its planets, diamond mines had begun to proliferate the planet. As a result, most of the Tygerians now had little need for any other income, and the wealthy Tygerians had plenty of time to indulge their leisure activities, like trading in gorgeous, young, male love slaves. The Alliance was desperate to stop it, and that was where the Balanescus came in. Considered the best bounty hunters in the known galaxies, they had a reputation for always getting their man.</p><p>The one the family was after now was Tarr Bonnet, the foremost dealer in Tygerian love slaves. It was a lucrative business and Tarr thumbed his nose at the Alliance laws.</p><p>To obtain the slaves, Tarr Bonnet had circumvented the huge and far-reaching influence of the Planetary Alliance and set up trade agreements with the Nilaniums, or the so-called Jolly Rogers. Most of the Jolly Rogers were Nilaniums, an ancient culture, dating back thousands of cycles. The Nilanium home planet was destroyed when their sun went supernova two centuries before, but rather than find a home on another planet, the survivors became nomads, traveling the galaxy in their ships. Like the Tygerians, they were warlike and unfriendly to outsiders, considering themselves superior to most other races.</p><p>At some point in their history, the Nilaniums became space pirates, known as Jolly Rogers, so-called after the skull and crossbones flag they painted on the sides of their ships. Little more than cutthroats and thieves, the Rogers made their living preying on the ships up and down the space corridors. Usually piloting small, fast ships, they used docking technology to allow them to latch onto a larger starship, and, once docked, enter by force, rob and terrorize the crew before taking off and losing themselves in the vastness of space. If the crew had any young, good-looking members or passengers, Tarr and the Rogers would often take them along as captives to be sold on the slave markets. They became just another valuable commodity to be sold or traded.</p><p>\u201cHow did a Tygerian come to be a member of the Rogers anyway?\u201d Kyle asked.</p><p>Blayde shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but he\u2019s a major player and runs most of their slave traffic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTygerians only buy males, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tygerian males and females don\u2019t mix. That is, the females don\u2019t live with the men and don\u2019t want to. The gods only know how it got started\u2014some say the early Tygerians bred too much and their planet was seriously overpopulated and running out of resources, but it\u2019s only speculation. For whatever reason, the women have stayed in their own sectors for hundreds, maybe thousands of cycles and the men in theirs. They breed with each other only by artificial insemination\u2014then if the child is female, it\u2019s raised by the mother. If male, the father takes it to rear. That\u2019s one reason the Tygerians purchase love slaves. The slaves rear the babies for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like nannies?\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Blayde shook his head. \u201cNo, more like concubines. They call them their nobyos. To them, it\u2019s almost like a spouse and another father for their children. They keep them very submissive, but it\u2019s said they\u2019re well-treated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Bonnet trades in these love slaves, or what did you call them? Nobyos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, primarily, but never underestimate him. He\u2019s tough and ruthless and able to shift into one of the Tygerian tygers, huge, vicious creatures\u2014more than a match for our wolves.\u201d</p><p>Kyle\u2019s family, the ancient Balanescus, were Lycan shifters, commonly referred to as werewolves, though there were significant differences. Lycan wolves had supernaturally strong metabolisms and lived a long time, but weren\u2019t supernatural or immortal, by any means. If their opponent was big enough and strong enough, they could be defeated. Tygerian tigers, it was said, could be up to sixteen feet long and stood at least five to six feet tall at the shoulders\u2014tough to beat by anyone\u2019s standards.</p><p>\u201cRemind me again why I decided to help you with this bounty. I was all set to enjoy a couple weeks off.\u201d</p><p>Blayde clapped him on the back and laughed. \u201cJust be careful Bonnet doesn\u2019t get the drop on you or else you\u2019ll wind up being led around on a leash as some Tygerian\u2019s pet nobyo. You always were the pretty one in the family.\u201d</p><p>Kyle\u2019s snarl and look of outrage had Blayde bounding out of reach and laughing at him. \u201cSorry, just kidding! But I\u2019m serious about one thing. If he catches either one of us, we\u2019ve had a bad day. We could really wind up as Tygerian nobyos, taking care of little tiger babies. Both of us are young enough to be concubines, and we\u2019re Lycan alphas. Those facts alone would appeal to some of the Tygerian buyers. They hate us in particular, because the prisoner of war camps for captured Tygerians is on Lycanus. Bonnet\u2019s just twisted enough to think enslaving and selling us would be some kind of humiliating coup, not to mention making an example of us for what happens to anyone who comes after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, duly noted. We both need to be careful. Do you have a good lead on him yet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blayde nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re on our way to Leeria. He has some kind of hangout there\u2014a bar of some kind. It\u2019s fairly near Jayron, as a matter of fact.\u201d Kyle knew that out-of-the-way planets like these were often used as the Rogers\u2019 bases of operation, and this sector in particular was being used more and more by the Rogers in this star system.</p><p>\u201cThe Leerians have been trying to buy a shipment of Lycan bauxite ore for a while now, but no one wants to risk a delivery. Of course, you remember what happened on Jayron with Nikolai.\u201d</p><p>Kyle remembered only too well. He\u2019d been the one piloting the ship when his brother Nikolai went down to arrange the payment and delivery. The next thing Kyle knew, Nikolai had pressed a panic device he wore on his clothing, and using safeguards already in place, Kyle had taken off immediately, leaving his brother on the planet\u2019s surface. It had almost killed him to do it, but he was following strict protocol. That fiasco had been due to Jolly Rogers, too, and though it had worked out well enough\u2014Nikolai had found his mate in the Jayronian prince, the exotic and beautiful Jagger\u2014it wasn\u2019t an experience Kyle ever wanted to repeat.</p> <p>\u201cSo you think they\u2019ll attack and try to steal our shipment, like they did on Jayron?\u201d</p><p>Blayde shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s a distinct possibility, and we have to be ready for that. But I think the Leerians won\u2019t allow it. They\u2019re already having trouble finding anyone willing to trade with them. An attack on our ship would likely end trade for them altogether. They\u2019ve made extravagant promises about safe passage for the ship, so I think we\u2019ll be okay on that score.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how will we find Bonnet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have information on this hangout of his on Leeria. It\u2019s a bar he either frequents or owns, and he\u2019s supposed to be there most evenings he\u2019s on the planet. It\u2019s on the seaside, near the docks and called Blood in the Water, after the rust-colored water in the Leerian oceans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I like that name too much, considering,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cSo what\u2019s your exit plan? No way we can just march in there and pick him up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but he\u2019s all Tygerian in one way, at least. He likes good-looking men. So you being the aforementioned pretty one and all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no! You\u2019re not using me as bait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to think of it as a strategic ploy to entice him outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBalls! Which, by the way, I have no intention of risking on your behalf. Now I\u2019m beginning to see why you left Ryan at home. Too dangerous for your boy, so hey, let\u2019s call Kyle. He\u2019ll do it. Well, not this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh c\u2019mon Kyle, give me a break. There\u2019s very little risk\u2014probably. I\u2019ll be right outside, and the minute you step out with him, I\u2019ll be ready with a tranquilizer gun. He\u2019ll never know what hit him, and he\u2019ll wake up back on board our ship in a holding cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me you\u2019re skipping a whole lot of steps. You just told me the man\u2019s not stupid. How the hells am I going to get him to follow me outside to some dark alley? Then even if I do manage to get him outside and we tranq him, how do we get him back on the ship? He\u2019s not exactly small, you know, if he\u2019s a typical Tygerian. And what are his men doing all this time we\u2019re luring him outside, knocking him out and toting him to the ship? The idea\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, valid points. So maybe I didn\u2019t think it through so well. What if I offer to sell you to them? We\u2019ll set up one of those sting operation like in some of those Earth vids that Ryan watches. I could say you\u2019re having an affair with my mate behind my back or something, and I found out and want to get rid of you. I could ask for a meet and then we grab Bonnet\u2014hold a gun on him, force whoever comes with him off the ship, and take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could work, I guess. Despite the fact that, once again, my ass is on the line.\u201d Kyle angled a wry look at Blayde.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then you make the offer to sell me. Say that I\u2019ve been after your mate or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t know I don\u2019t have a mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would they know that, Kyle? It\u2019ll work. They\u2019re all disloyal bastards and think everybody else is too. Bonnet will totally buy into the story, because it\u2019s probably the kind of thing he would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we set up a meeting with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know his hangout. After we deliver our shipment, we\u2019ll go there for a drink and scope it out. Then we play it by ear, and try to find a way to speak to him. If you can get close enough, you can set something up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think we should have brought more men with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone was busy. And Lucas has the new baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his new mate. Thank the gods I haven\u2019t been trapped with the curse yet. Larsson and I are the only hold-outs.\u201d</p><p>Blayde settled himself beside Kyle in one of the two chairs on the comm deck. \u201cYou\u2019ve just been lucky so far. When the curse hits you, it hits hard and you can\u2019t resist it. You just wait\u2014you\u2019ll see,\u201d he warned, though Kyle only smiled at him. It was true the curse hadn\u2019t struck him yet, though it had taken its toll on his brother, Nikolai, and three of his cousins, Blayde, Lucas, and Konnor. Only he and his youngest cousin, Larsson, had remained unscathed.</p><p>Until the curse struck Blayde, they\u2019d thought it was an old legend and put little credence in it, though their elders declared it was all true. According to the legend, Kyle\u2019s great-grandfather, Gunnar, had seen a beautiful human woman on a voyage to Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and had kidnapped her. The inhabitants of the moons of Jupiter had long been rumored to practice witchcraft, but Gunnar was wild and more than a little crazy. He wasn\u2019t interested in the woman for himself\u2014his preference was for handsome males, but the female Lycan who was his mate liked other females.</p><p>He took the woman to give to his mate as a companion, to help her raise their children. Sometimes Lycans took these \u201ccompanions\u201d as lovers. In fact, Gunnar lay with the woman at the same time he impregnated his mate, so that both produced sons at around the same time. The human female produced a son, red-haired and handsome, half Lycan and half human. And though she eventually grew to love her Lycan mistress, the human female never made a secret of her utter hatred for Gunnar.</p><p>Gunnar made a second trip to Europa and kidnapped the companion\u2019s handsome twin brother to be his own concubine. Not only was Gunnar intrigued by his beauty, but since his mate was now really more interested in her lovely human, he was free to indulge his own needs. He thought he would make an excellent love slave. He had no idea that the man was also a powerful warlock.</p><p>The male, whose name was Ivan, was furious with Gunnar, but also fiercely attracted almost against his will. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to hurt Gunnar, it was said, though his sister urged him to. He eventually decided to curse all of Gunnar\u2019s descendants, not in a hurtful way, but one that would ensure all of them would be males and all alphas. It was well-known that alphas had great difficulty living together in harmony, so he had, in effect, ensured that all of Gunnar\u2019s offspring would be at each other\u2019s throats. In addition, and maybe because Gunnar left him alone so often to voyage around the galaxies, Ivan cursed them to fall madly, irrevocably in love while still young, and never be able to be without their mates again.</p><p>No, Kyle had been lucky so far, and he intended to do everything in his power to keep it that way. He was still young and looked forward to playing the field for many years to come. He glanced down into the by-now blank screen of the compnet at his reflection there. Blayde said he was the prettiest of them, and he was vain enough to wonder if it was true, though the word pretty made him cringe a little. Surely he was far too masculine for such a word. It was true he wore his dark hair a little longer than the rest of his cousins, but mainly because he couldn\u2019t be bothered to have it cut most of the time.</p><p>His eyelashes were a bit too long and curled up almost like a female\u2019s, and he\u2019d always hated it. His eyes were the deep red of all the Lycans, though his were so dark as to be almost black, and this drew a lot of attention to his eyes. He snapped the cover closed and sat back in his chair\u2014attractive, perhaps, but definitely not pretty.</p><p>Tarr Bonnet saw the Lycans the moment they entered the bar. His usual table was in the corner, tucked away in the shadows, and so far neither of the bastards had so much as glanced his way, but his senses went on high alert immediately. He fucking hated Lycans, and most especially since his twin brother had been captured by them.</p><p>His brother, Taz, had been a passenger on board a freighter carrying a shipment of diamonds to one of their Nilanium allies when they were attacked by Alliance ships. The shipment was stolen and his brother taken prisoner. He had been sent to the prison on the planet Lycanus, because it was theorized that only Lycans stood any chance of keeping Tygerians contained without resorting to strong drugs.</p><p>Since there had already been fatalities among Tygerian prisoners due to these powerful drugs, the Alliance decided it might be cruel and unusual punishment to drug them constantly to keep them from shifting. Lycan wolves were the only thing that came close to matching them in power and strength.</p><p>Tarr had managed to attack the Lycan prison ship as his brother was being moved to a larger facility on Lycanus 2, and freed him after an intense and bloody battle that cost him two of his best men. He retrieved his brother, but he owed the bastards payback, and he thought he might know how to get it for both his brother and himself.</p><p>He gaze swept over these Lycans now, assessing whether or not they posed any threat if he went through with his idea. They were both muscular and well built, though one was a bit larger than the other. Both were handsome, too, even if they were Lycan. The larger one might have been a couple of years older, dark-haired, with those strange red eyes all the Lycans had, giving him what Tarr thought of as a devilish look. The Tygerian religion warned of devils who were seductively handsome despite their red hair and eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other Lycan was almost sinfully good-looking, with plump, luscious lips, high cheekbones and eyelashes as long as any female\u2019s. The idea of what he might do with these Lycans grew in Tarr\u2019s mind\u2014it was outrageous, but rather a stroke of genius, if he did say so himself.</p><p>Tarr had just received a message from his brother telling him to be on the lookout for a suitable nobyo for him. He asked him to purchase one right away if he found one he thought he\u2019d like, as his first child was due to arrive soon. One of these Lycans would be eminently suitable to fulfill his request.</p><p>There was no appropriate translation for the word nobyo, but to the Tygerians it meant lover, or paramour. It was even used as a term of endearment for their concubines. A nobyo was like a spouse, in a way, though, of course, marriage to an alien species was out of the question\u2014only female Tygerians were accepted as marriage partners. The Tygerian female never lived with the male, but they kept in close contact when they had children together. Even more, though, a nobyo was a life companion, and was in charge of rearing all the children.</p> <p>The nobyo was even closer to the Tygerian than a wife, because he was well-loved and cared for his entire life. Even if the unlikely happened, and the long-lived Tygerian passed away first, the nobyo was cared for and cherished by the children for as long as they lived.</p><p>Tarr wondered how Taz would feel about a Lycan for his nobyo. It would take a lot of training and a strong hand, but the challenge would definitely be fun. And since his capture, Taz hated the Lycans on general principle. To have one as his submissive love slave would be sweet. Tarr let his gaze wander over both Lycans again. He could try for both of them, but his chances would be better to capture at least one if he could separate them\u2014the smaller one, perhaps. He was pretty and looked a bit more malleable too, more open to persuasion than the bigger one.</p><p>As he watched and sipped his drink, trying to figure out if he could separate them in some way, he saw the smaller one slip something to the bartender. Interested, he watched as the bartender turned and moved to the other end of the bar, where he appeared to be reading a note. Then he glanced up and caught Tarr\u2019s gaze. Amazingly, he walked directly over to Tarr\u2019s table and handed the note to him.</p><p>\u201cThe Lycan dog over there slipped this to me for you, sir. The note says he\u2019ll make it worth my while to give this to you. Should I kill him for his insolence in disturbing you?\u201d The bartender was a fiercely loyal slave who had worked with Tarr for years. The bar itself was owned by Tarr, and he used it not only for his amusement, but as a way to meet potential buyers for his collection.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ozrom, I\u2019ll handle this. You did the right thing to bring the note to me.\u201d</p> <p>Ozrom nodded and moved away. He had belonged to Tarr\u2019s family most of his life. His Earthan mother had been captured when he was a small child, and her new owner had allowed her to keep him. As he grew up, and it became apparent he\u2019d never be pretty enough to be a love slave, he\u2019d become a service slave, and Tarr\u2019s father bought him when he was only sixteen cycles. He\u2019d trained him to work in the bar, a much easier life than most service slaves endured. Since Tarr\u2019s father treated all his slaves well, even allowing service slaves to take lovers if they wished, he\u2019d earned the man\u2019s undying gratitude.</p><p>Tarr opened the note and quickly read the contents. Written in the Galactic Standard text in a small, neat handwriting, the note was short, asking for a meeting. It said the Lycan had some important, unnamed business to discuss. Tarr scribbled his reply and caught Ozrom\u2019s eye. Ozrom began to work his way over to his master as unobtrusively as possible so he could return the note to the Lycan. This was turning out to be a very interesting evening indeed.</p><p>Kyle walked back into the bar three hours later, alone. He spotted Tarr at the same table in the corner, and wondered briefly if he\u2019d been there ever since Kyle had left with Blayde earlier in the evening. In the note he\u2019d sent back, Tarr said he would meet with Kyle at midmoon\u2014but only if Kyle came alone. The note said Blayde had to remain on their ship and his men would monitor him to be sure. If Kyle didn\u2019t come alone, then he shouldn\u2019t bother, because as Tarr said in the note, he was \u2018familiar with Alliance tricks.\u2019</p><p>Kyle had no doubt he was telling the truth about monitoring the ship, yet he\u2019d had a terrible time trying to convince Blayde to stay onboard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably be walking right into a trap, damn it!\u201d Blayde yelled at him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kyle said for seemed like the hundredth time. \u201cBut how else can I speak directly to him? Sure, he could take me prisoner, but why settle for taking me when he could take the deal I\u2019m going to offer him? He\u2019s a businessman, after all, so surely he\u2019ll recognize a good deal when he hears it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming he\u2019ll even give you a chance to tell him the deal. What if he grabs you the minute you walk in there?\u201d Blayde continued his pacing back and forth across the comm deck on the ship, occasionally running his hand through his hair, something he often did when he was agitated. \u201cNo, it\u2019s too fucking risky. We\u2019ll try something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Look, we\u2019re here\u2014I\u2019ve made contact. I think we should go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t!\u201d Blayde slammed down his hand on the arm of Kyle\u2019s chair. \u201cAnd this is my bounty. No, it\u2019s out of the question. I forbid it. We\u2019ll figure out something else, but this is just stupid.\u201d</p><p>With that, Blayde had turned his back and left the command deck, going down to his own quarters, leaving Kyle to stare at the closed door in outrage. Blayde wasn\u2019t his alpha, and even his cousin Lucas, his true alpha, would never lay down an order like that to one of the family. He resented the tone Blayde had taken with him. Blayde may have been a few years older and had more experience with bounties, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let Blayde tell him what to do. Perhaps Blayde had worked with his mate Ryan too long if he thought Kyle would roll over and obey him just because he fucking forbade it.</p><p>For a long time, Kyle had questioned whether or not he was truly an alpha. His brother and all his cousins were, and the curse foretold that all descendants of old Gunnar would be alphas, but did that necessarily make it true?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a gamma either\u2014he liked giving orders, but he was also comfortable in not taking the lead. He often found himself as a pilot, ferrying the bauxite around the galaxies, along with one of his cousins, and he was happy to let that cousin do most of the negotiations with the clients. Maybe a strong beta, then\u2014that seemed more likely to Kyle. He liked the role of strong right-hand man, and as a Balanescu, he\u2019d never had to go through the selections like most other Lycans. They chose their own alpha on Lycanus 3 and that was Lucas.</p><p>So the issue of his rank had never really come up. Still, he didn\u2019t like the tone Blayde had taken with him. Kyle knew he was capable and strong, and could handle himself. He didn\u2019t appreciate Blayde telling him what to do. Kyle got up, checked to make sure he had the pouch of diamonds he\u2019d need to make the deal, and defiantly left the ship, heading back to Blood in the Water. Blayde might be pissed when he found out, but so be it. He\u2019d be happy enough when he\u2019d made the deal and arranged the sting. Or at least that\u2019s what Kyle kept telling himself.</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>From the moment he left the ship, he felt like he was being observed, but it could have only been his imagination, despite Tarr\u2019s threats. Still, he was feeling a little nervous, and wondered if he wasn\u2019t making a huge mistake.</p><p>When he walked into the club, nothing seemed to be any different than earlier in the evening. The place was still mostly deserted, with only a few customers standing near the bar, talking quietly. The bartender glanced up as he walked in and nodded shortly, but still frowned at him. Across the room, from the same corner, he saw the Tygerian, Tarr Bonnet, watching him from the shadows.</p><p>Kyle glanced around him, but saw no outward sign of any of Tarr\u2019s men. The men at the bar could have been Nilaniums, but they barely glanced at him and didn\u2019t seem to show much interest. He knew they must be around, though, and he\u2019d need to be on his guard if this were to have any chance of working. He walked slowly over to Tarr\u2019s table and stood in front of him, looking him over curiously.</p><p>He was as handsome as his picture indicated, though his curly hair looked a little greasy and he was in need of good bath, in Kyle\u2019s opinion. Lycans were scrupulously clean, and he couldn\u2019t help wrinkling his nose a bit at the strong, though not altogether unpleasant body odor coming off the Tygerian. His stripes were exotic and beautiful, and Kyle found himself fascinated by the man.</p><p>Tarr smiled up at him and fired something off in a rapid language Kyle didn\u2019t understand. When Kyle simply looked at Tarr blankly in response, Tarr gave a short laugh, showing strong white teeth, and spoke again in heavily accented Lycan. \u201cSit down, wolf. I won\u2019t bite\u2014not much, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He bared his teeth again and indicated a chair across from him. \u201cI must admit I\u2019m interested in what you might have to say to me. It\u2019s been my experience that the Lycans are as bloody-minded as their Alliance cohorts and have little use for Tygerians. I wonder what you could possibly have to say to me that I would be interested in.\u201d</p><p>Kyle sank down to the chair across from Bonnet, took the pouch of diamonds from his jacket and laid it on the table between them. \u201cThis is yours if you\u2019ll hear me out.\u201d</p><p>Tarr glanced over at the pouch, and one corner of his mouth quirked up. \u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind, Lycan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to give you a love slave\u2014that\u2019s your business, isn\u2019t it? Well, I\u2019ll give you a valuable one and even pay you to take him if you\u2019ll agree.\u201d</p><p>Tarr glanced again at his face and tilted his head a bit to the side. \u201cWhat sort of love slave? I have very exacting standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the man I was with earlier, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019m talking about him.\u201d</p><p>Bonnet narrowed his gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch? You two have the look of each other\u2014is he not some kind of relative of yours?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my cousin, yes, but there\u2019s no catch to this. He needs to disappear, that\u2019s all, and never come back. Suffice to say I have my reasons.\u201d He pushed the pouch of diamonds toward Tarr. \u201cHe\u2019s young and good looking, so you should be able to find a buyer for him, and I\u2019ll give you another pouch just like this one when you pick him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I pick him up, huh? That easy? And where might I find this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on my ship. I\u2019ll make sure it is easy for you\u2014I can slip him a sedative in his food. That won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Bonnet shook his head. \u201cIf he\u2019s your cousin, why would you do this? I understand Lycan families are quite close. Something about this doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a human mate that I\u2019ve fallen in love with, if you must know. I need him out of the way so we can be together. It doesn\u2019t really matter, does it? Just get him out of my way and I\u2019ll pay you any price you ask\u2014plus you\u2019ll have whatever you\u2019ll be able to get for selling him.\u201d</p><p>Tarr continued to stare at him, so he leaned forward, trying to make his case. \u201cIf that\u2019s not enough, I can get more. Just tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>Tarr smiled. \u201cWhat I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very kind offer, and I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re so willing to see to my needs. It will stand you in good stead in the years of service to come.\u201d</p><p>Kyle sat back in his chair, his heart beating a little too fast. This asshole was toying with him, that\u2019s all. He had to keep calm and not let him see he\u2019d rattled him. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me, Tygerian,\u201d Kyle said. He could feel his hackles rising on his spine.</p><p>Tarr shrugged. \u201cNo threats. But why do I need to go to any more trouble when I already have you, plus this little bag of diamonds?\u201d</p><p>Another icicle of alarm slid down Kyle\u2019s spine, but he sat up straighter, glaring at the Tygerian. He could feel his incisors dropping from his gums. \u201cI already told you. I\u2019ll give you my cousin plus more of these diamonds. As many as you say.\u201d</p><p>Tarr flicked his hand at the pouch, pushing it aside. \u201cI have no need of more diamonds. What I do have need of is a beautiful wolf, and I think you\u2019ll do quite nicely.\u201d He turned his head and nodded toward someone behind Kyle. Kyle jumped to his feet, whirling around, and saw six large men coming toward him from a curtained area behind the bar. He felt the shift come over him as he backed away, growling menacingly. He backed right into a hard body behind him and turned, snarling and ready to rip out the Tygerian\u2019s throat. Instead he found himself looking down the barrel of a gun pressed right between his eyes.</p><p>His split second\u2019s hesitation allowed the men coming up behind him to charge him. Grabbing his arms, they held him fast while he struggled, shouting his rage, and their combined weight bore him to the floor. A big knee landed on his chest and he found himself looking up into Tarr\u2019s green eyes. He held a syringe in his hand and jabbed it painfully into Kyle\u2019s arm as he struggled, helpless to stop him. A great lethargy began to settle over him and he found it hard to move his limbs. As blackness settled over him like a shroud, he lifted his snout and gave one last roar of defiance, a howl of rage and frustration and fear so loud the walls vibrated with the sound.</p> <p>Kyle felt as if he were swimming in a murky sea. There were times when he rose toward the dim light that seemed to come from above him and almost reached the surface, only to be pulled back down again, despite his struggles, by the relentless undertow. The water was so thick he felt as if he were swimming in some thick, syrupy substance. It weighed him down, confining him and bearing him to the murky bottom.</p><p>Only once or twice did he manage to almost break the surface, when his mouth was forced open and filled with water. He had no choice but to swallow it, and it lay heavy in his stomach. Once he vomited it back up and choked on it, but the currents rolled him to his side and pounded against his back, and then more water was forced down his throat. Again and again, the process was repeated and the only times he managed to find any peace at all was when the strong current allowed him to sink to the muck at the bottom of the sea and settle there, half-buried in it.</p><p>After an interminable time, the waters seemed to press him down a little less, and he was able to swim up closer to the surface. Someone was calling him, pulling on his consciousness. He opened his eyes and the first blinding headache hit, so hard and sudden it took his breath away. He closed his eyes and gasped at the pain, but he was being shaken by a strong hand. Opening one eye, he looked up and saw Tarr Bonnet staring down at him. There were some kind of bars over his face and for a few seconds, Kyle couldn\u2019t make any sense of it. He forced open his other eye and shook his head, trying to clear his blurry vision.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t bars over Tarr\u2019s face at all, rather it was bars to some kind of cage, and Kyle was naked and enclosed inside it. The bars were just inches above his face, and he was sitting slumped in a corner of a metal cage just barely large enough to contain him. He couldn\u2019t even sit up straight, but was hunched over, his head twisted to the side. He ached all over, but it was especially his head that hurt so much he could barely stand to keep his eyes open.</p><p>There was some kind of very sweet smell in the room, almost like the cookies his grandmother\u2019s concubine used to make for him and his brother when he was a little boy. It smelled delicious and made his mouth water. Despite the pain and nausea, his stomach was cramping for food. One part of his mind idly wondered if they were trying to starve him into submission.</p><p>He closed his eyes against the sharp pains in his head, thinking he might drift back down to sleep. Near him, he heard sharp, almost angry words spoken in some alien language he\u2019d heard before but couldn\u2019t quite place\u2014Tygerian, maybe? The voices grew louder. He opened his eyes again and thought he must be seeing double. There were two Tarrs now staring down at him, and oddly enough, one of them seemed to be really angry, while the other one seemed to be smirking at him with calm indifference.</p><p>The angry one suddenly put a hand through the bars and Kyle flinched away, thinking he was about to be hit. Instead, the hand retreated quickly and more rapid-fire Tygerian was shouted back and forth. The sneering-faced Tarr reached in and stroked his hair out of his face impatiently, so that the angry one could lean down closer to look at him. Kyle looked up at him too, trying hard to focus and blinking his eyes rapidly.</p><p>The second Tygerian\u2019s eyes were beautiful, thickly lashed and a strange shade of golden green. They were warm and admiring as they stared down at him, and his face softened. Finally, after what seemed like a long time, he pulled his gaze away and nodded over toward the other Tarr.</p> <p>Another rapid flurry of Tygerian words passed, and then the top of the cage was being lifted. Kyle saw two strange men who must have been some of Tarr\u2019s workers come forward. Two sets of strong hands came down and lifted him as if he were a child, pulling him up and out of the cage. He tried to pull away but found he was too weak. He found himself being set down on his feet, but when the hands released him, his knees gave way and he sank down to his knees, unable to stand alone.</p><p>The angry Tarr knelt down beside him and peered into his face again, murmuring to him. Kyle tried to focus on him, but couldn\u2019t quite clear his vision. This was definitely the source of the wonderful smell, though. It radiated off the man, surrounding Kyle with its sweet scent. Then he touched the side of Kyle\u2019s face and what felt like a jolt of electricity jumped from his fingers, searing into Kyle\u2019s brain. It screamed mate. Alarmed and amazed, Kyle recoiled, falling back on his ass and crying out again in alarm.</p><p>The two Tarrs looked at each other in surprise and then back down at him. Kyle tried hard to calm himself and shook his head again to clear it. This time when he looked back up, he realized that the smell and the overpowering urge to mate was coming from only one of the Tarrs\u2014the one he\u2019d termed the angry one.</p><p>Confused and shaken, he leaned toward the angry one\u2019s legs. Touching him again was a risk, but he felt almost compelled to do it, and besides, the man seemed to be more puzzled now than anything else. Feeling sick and hurt, Kyle wanted only to get closer to his mate for comfort. Kyle wrapped his arms around his legs and amazingly, his mate allowed it, even bending over to stroke his hair as the two Tarrs carried on a conversation above him.</p><p>One of the workers came closer and pulled him roughly away from his mate\u2019s legs and pushed him back down on his ass. His mate shouted at the man, who cringed away, and seemed to be apologizing profusely, dropping to his knees and then bending over to touch his forehead to the floor. The worker approached Kyle again, but this time he seemed much gentler as he strapped a kind of leather harness around Kyle\u2019s upper torso. A silver ring rested in the middle of Kyle\u2019s chest and to this ring, the man attached a sort of chain, or leash. He then handed the other end of the leash to the man who was Kyle\u2019s mate.</p><p>All of this registered on some level inside Kyle\u2019s brain, but he wasn\u2019t upset or worried about it, or about anything else, really. Drugs...they\u2019ve drugged me. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel like fighting any of this. It all seems like a dream. The explanation registered in his brain, but he still couldn\u2019t feel any real anger over it.</p><p>His mate squatted down next to him and spoke to him in a kind, sympathetic-sounding voice, not that he could understand a word of it. Kyle thought he might even be speaking Lycan\u2014the words flew around in the air around him like familiar, bright butterflies, but he couldn\u2019t seem to grab onto any of them long enough for them to register and make any kind of sense. He nodded anyway and was rewarded by a beautiful smile and a caress on the side of his face.</p><p>He leaned into the warm hand and looked up at his gorgeous mate, who then bent over to brush a kiss against his dry, cracked lips. His mate took off his own shirt and tied it around his waist, and Kyle gazed up at him with gratitude. He stood up and tugged gently at the chain, and Kyle got awkwardly to his feet, holding both hands out to the side for balance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His handsome mate nodded at him with approval and tugged again at the chain, slowly leading him from the room. Kyle looked down at his bare feet, trying to concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other, and it was far from easy. From time to time a wave of blackness overcame him and he stumbled. Each time, his mate stopped walking and allowed him to recover before moving slowly forward again. A part of his mind registered that other people were walking past them, but he couldn\u2019t spare them any attention. All of his focus had to be on making his feet move to follow his mate.</p><p>After what seemed like a very long time, he was helped into a seat, and strapped in. His head lolled back against the soft leather seat and Kyle felt the blackness trying to steal over him again. His physical condition must have been worse than he thought or else Tarr had loaded him up with drugs, but this time, the darkness wasn\u2019t quite as absolute. It had a softer quality, more like natural sleep, and when his mate reached over to put an arm around his shoulders, Kyle gave in to it and sank gratefully down in its depths.</p><p>Taz Bonnet was furious with his brother, Tarr. He\u2019d asked Tarr to help him find a nobyo a few weeks before and had actually almost forgotten about it until he received the message from his twin brother telling him Tarr had a surprise for him and asking him to be on the docks when he arrived.</p> <p>Taz had been there, of course. He loved his brother, and owed him everything, though they were very different people despite their looks. As identical twins, they\u2019d been told all their lives how much they resembled each other. So much so that Tarr often went without shaving and let his hair grow unruly and too long to avoid looking just like Taz. Tarr loved his brother, but always said he wanted to feel unique. He also sometimes affected the rough clothing of the Jolly Rogers he worked with, as well as their lack of interest in personal hygiene.</p><p>When Tarr jumped down on the docks and ran over to take him in a bear hug, Taz had returned the embrace good-naturedly, though to be honest, it offended his dignity somewhat. As a Tygerian senator, he had to be careful of his personal image. Pulling away after a moment, he smiled at his brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you too\u2014what could possibly have been so important I had to take a day away from my schedule to come down here to the docks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014I have a surprise for you.\u201d Tarr grabbed his elbow and began ushering him back toward the ship.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of surprise? I warn you, if it\u2019s another one of those animals you keep bringing me, you can take it right back where you got it from\u2014the last one ruined my floors.\u201d Tarr seemed to think Taz spent too much time alone, so he continually brought him exotic pets from all over the known galaxies. The last one had been a Kraponian bear, which, despite being a bear, was only a little over a foot high, with snowy white fur and quite possibly the longest tongue Taz had ever seen.</p> <p>He kept it rolled up in his mouth most of the time, but occasionally he would unfurl it to snag a treat from the dining room table from halfway across the room. The creature was adorable, really, but steadfastly withstood any and all attempts at housebreaking. By the time Taz found him another good home, he\u2019d had to replace almost all of his carpets.</p><p>\u201cNo, not any animal, exactly, though he will be a pet.\u201d Tarr laughed at the expression on Taz\u2019s face. \u201cYour nobyo, remember? You asked me to find one for you.\u201d</p><p>Taz stopped walking and pulled sharply away in surprise. \u201cA nobyo? But I\u2019m not prepared. Gods, Tarr, you could have given me some warning\u2014now I\u2019ll have to try and get some time away from work to train him properly. I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s already been trained? That would be too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might need to take a little extra time off. This one is going to be difficult to train, but he\u2019ll be totally worth it once you do.\u201d Tarr took his arm again and began pulling him toward the entrance to the ship, but once again, Taz pulled back, hesitating.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of this,\u201d Taz said, a hint of a frown forming on his face. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018difficult to train\u2019? What kind of nobyo have you brought me? He\u2019s handsome, I hope, and suitable to rear my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very handsome\u2014beautiful, really. And he comes from a very good family on his home planet. Very respectable, I assure you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd just where is his home planet? Is he from Earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarth?\u201d Tarr made a scoffing sound. \u201cNo, brother, not Earth. You and I are too bold and strong for such puny creatures. You\u2019d have been bored with such a one in only a short time. No, I\u2019ve brought you a real challenge, one that will be a delight for you to tame for many cycles to come. And if you succeed in making him submit to you, you\u2019ll be the envy of all who see him.\u201d</p><p>Taz began walking again and climbed aboard the ship, but slowly, still suspicious. \u201cExactly who is this paragon, then? Where is he from?\u201d</p><p>Tarr came to a stop in the by-now mostly deserted passageway and turned to gaze at him with a twinkle. \u201cHe\u2019s a Lycan.\u201d</p><p>Reeling back from him, Taz felt his breath catch in his throat at the word. \u201cLycan?\u201d he croaked the word harshly, his mouth suddenly dry. \u201cAre you crazy? You know how I feel about Lycans.\u201d</p><p>Tarr stepped in front of him, crowding him back against the wall. \u201cCalm down, brother. Yes, I know how the Lycans mistreated you when they held you captive, but this is your chance to avenge yourself. Imagine having one of the arrogant bastards under your complete control. You can beat him, fuck him, make him suck your dick, treat him any way you like and no one will say a word. Just think of it!\u201d</p><p>Taz pushed his brother away. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You\u2019ve purchased this person to be my nobyo, and we take our nobyos for life. To care for them\u2014not to treat them like back-alley whores. You\u2019ve been with the Rogers too long if you think I would ever abuse a nobyo under my care, even a Lycan.\u201d</p><p>Tarr grinned ruefully. \u201cWell, about purchasing him. It wasn\u2019t exactly a purchase.\u201d</p> <p>Taz mouth fell open in amazement. \u201cGods, you kidnapped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidnapping is such a harsh word. I prefer to say I temporarily denied him his freedom to bring him to a good home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not an animal, Tarr\u2014he\u2019s a person!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fucking Lycan, and they\u2019re little better than animals.\u201d At the look on his brother\u2019s face, Tarr held up a hand. \u201cBesides, we\u2019re at war with the bastards. Technically, he\u2019s a prisoner of war, and I captured him. He was trying to take me, brother. I\u2019d have wound up in one of their damn prisons if I hadn\u2019t taken him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how do I prevent him from shifting and eating my child?\u201d</p><p>Tarr chuckled. \u201cHe won\u2019t eat your child. He\u2019s one of the noble Balanescus, and once you have him trained, he\u2019ll be suitable to be around your baby. And the medicine I\u2019ve been giving him will prevent him from shifting until you have him properly trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedicine? You mean you have him drugged out of his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come with me to see him,\u201d Tarr said, taking his brother\u2019s hand. \u201cI told you, he\u2019s really beautiful, even with his red eyes. They\u2019re a dark color, almost black, and his hair will be lovely once you make him grow it out. His body is really magnificent and muscular, but he\u2019s not quite as large as the others in his family. I think you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\u201d</p><p>Taz pulled away and began walking back down the passageway. \u201cI\u2019ll see him, since you\u2019ve gone to so much trouble, but I\u2019ll have to find him another master. I won\u2019t have a Lycan in my home, not the way I feel about them.\u201d</p><p>Tarr said nothing more, just nodded knowingly, in his usual irritating manner. He led Taz down the passage to a metal door at the end. When he opened the door, Taz was shocked to see rows of metal cages, barely large enough for an Earthan to sit in comfortably, let alone a much larger Lycan. \u201cGods, how long have you kept him in a cage like this?\u201d he asked, pity for the Lycan flooding him, despite his negative feelings for the race.</p><p>Two cycles before, he\u2019d been captured by Lycans while he was traveling back to Tygeria after a diplomatic trip to one of the planets in what the Alliance called Bode\u2019s Galaxy, though the Tygerians had their own name for it, of course. He had hitched a ride home to Tygeria with a freighter to make it back in time for an important congressional vote, and their ship had been attacked by Alliance forces.</p><p>The entire crew, along with Taz, had been taken to the planet Lycanus to one of their prisons. They\u2019d been treated with a kind of casual cruelty, receiving very little food and rough handling from the Lycan guards. He\u2019d seen several of the younger crew raped and beaten by these guards, and the only thing that saved him from similar treatment was the fact that he had been carrying diplomatic papers.</p><p>Still, the experience had been a nightmare of maggoty food, freezing cells and sneering Lycan faces peering in at him through the bars. The Lycans were a handsome people, and prior to his capture, Taz had always admired their fierceness and courage in battle. Those guards were brutal, however, and even cruel. He\u2019d begun to fear for all their lives.</p><p>Taz had been interrogated twice and beaten both times when he refused to divulge any information. Finally, the entire crew was transferred to a more permanent facility on the sister planet of Lycanus 2. During the transfer, he and the others been rescued by his brother in a daring, dangerous raid. Most of the Lycan crew had been killed after putting up a vicious fight. The entire episode had taken him a long time to recover from, both mentally and physically, and he still harbored a host of negative feelings about Lycans.</p><p>Tarr ignored his question about the cages and kept moving steadily toward a back cage where Taz could see a man sitting hunched up in a corner. He was naked, and his muscular body was smeared with dirt and what looked like dried vomit. His thick, shaggy black hair hung down across his face, and he seemed to be only semi-conscious. Tarr reached through the bars and shook his shoulder, shouting at him in Lycan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWake up, Lycan! Your new master is here to see you!\u201d</p><p>The Lycan\u2019s head rose only fractionally, as the bars were too close to the top of his head for him to straighten up. He twisted his head to the side and peered up through strands of his filthy hair. Taz caught a glimpse of eyes that reminded him of a summer storm over the vast Tygerian plains, when the black clouds were lit up briefly from within by powerful lightning, and then went dark again just as quickly.</p><p>\u201cGods, Tarr, what have you done to him?\u201d He reached in to brush the thick hair from the Lycan\u2019s eyes and the poor thing flinched away fearfully. Taz pulled back his hand and rounded on his brother. \u201cHave you been beating him too? You bring me this poor, broken creature and expect me to keep him as my nobyo? My beloved? You\u2019ve ruined him!\u201d</p> <p>Tarr made a sound of impatience. \u201cNo, not at all. He\u2019s been drugged, that\u2019s all. No one\u2019s beaten him, though he didn\u2019t exactly come easy when we captured him. You know what dangerous creatures they can be\u2014I had to drug him. I\u2019ve tried to keep him hydrated, so he\u2019s not in bad shape at all, though he\u2019s probably a little hungry and tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Taz shook his head angrily. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do with this poor man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least look at him,\u201d Tarr said, and reached in to pull the Lycan\u2019s head around and get the hair off his face.</p><p>Almost reluctantly, Taz looked down and was struck at once with the Lycan\u2019s beauty. His skin was tanned and smooth, and his lips were full. The Tygerians believed this indicated passion. The pretty lips were parted slightly and the tip of his pink tongue showed slightly between his white teeth. Taz found himself wanting a taste of that tongue. The Lycan\u2019s eyes were as beautiful as he\u2019d imagined from the glimpse he\u2019d had of them through the fringe of thick hair, with long, sweeping eyelashes and that curious blood-red color. Taz felt unable to pull his gaze away and continued to stare down at him for a long time. Finally, he nodded at his brother. \u201cHe is beautiful. Please get him out so I can see him better.\u201d</p><p>Tarr called on his communicator for two of his service slaves, who came in right away and unlocked the cage to pull the Lycan out. When the Lycan was on his knees before him, Taz didn\u2019t feel the satisfying vengeance he should have felt. Instead he was entranced by those soul-searing eyes staring up at him.</p> <p>Unable to stop himself, Taz leaned over to pet the Lycan\u2019s head. At the first touch of his hand, the Lycan fell backwards, as if frightened. Taz shook his head. He\u2019d take a lot of work if he\u2019d been broken so badly that the slightest touch frightened him, but one good look at his beautiful face had convinced Taz he might be totally worth it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>Tarr looked puzzled and shrugged. \u201cI have no idea. I took him on Leeria from the bar. The Leerians told us we couldn\u2019t touch the Lycan ship, but they didn\u2019t say anything about the crew. All we knew was that some important Lycan family called the Balanescus were bringing in a shipment of bauxite, but other than that, I don\u2019t know anything about him. Call him whatever you like.\u201d</p><p>As Taz gazed down at him, the beautiful man got on his knees and shuffled forward, then wrapped his arms around Taz\u2019s legs.</p><p>Shocked, Taz turned to Tarr who was almost goggling at the Lycan in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hells, Taz? He fought us like a demon when we first took him. It took two injections just to put him down on the floor.\u201d</p> <p>One of the slaves stepped forward then to pull him sharply away and harness him, and Taz shouted at the man without thinking. \u201cHow dare you put rough hands on my nobyo? I\u2019ll have you flogged for such insolence!\u201d</p><p>The slave cringed and apologized, but Taz spared him barely a glance. Instead he looked over at his brother who was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cI knew you\u2019d like him. The moment I saw him I knew he was special.\u201d</p><p>Taz ignored his brother\u2019s gloating and accepted the leash now attached to his nobyo\u2019s harness. It was a cheap leather one that Taz would replace as soon as possible. He\u2019d buy a halter lined with a soft material for his nobyo, and attach a silver leash. He couldn\u2019t wait to get him home to bathe him and groom him properly. Before he took him, he wanted to hide his nakedness from the prying eyes on the docks. He took off his shirt and wrapped it around the Lycan.</p><p>He stood back up and glanced over at his brother. \u201cIs he an alpha?\u201d he asked his brother, and received a huge grin in response.</p><p>\u201cI think so. The Leerians said all the Balanescus are alpha. Once the drugs clear his system, he\u2019ll give you a lot of entertainment. I thought about plugging him for you, but figured you\u2019d prefer to do it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. He\u2019s a virgin, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019ll have to prepare him carefully and plug him as soon as I get him cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Tarr adjusted his trousers. \u201cDamn, I think I really do envy you, brother. Perhaps I should have taken his cousin for myself\u2014he was a handsome devil too\u2014but I did make promises to the Leerians. As it was, I had a hard time getting your boy off the planet. His family was beside themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever you managed it, I\u2019m grateful. I have him safely now, and he\u2019ll never have to go back to those animals again, will you, darling?\u201d He leaned over and caressed the side of his nobyo\u2019s face and spoke to him soothingly in the few words of Lycan he remembered, telling him he would care for him now.</p> <p>His poor nobyo didn\u2019t seem to understand, but he\u2019d teach him everything he needed to know once he got him home. The babies his female spouse was having weren\u2019t due for over a quarter cycle yet. At that time, his wife and her companion would keep the girl child and send the male to Taz. By that time, he hoped to have this nobyo trained enough to at least help his servants care for the child. Then later, he could take over complete charge himself.</p><p>The Lycan certainly had a great deal of intelligence in that expressive gaze, and once the drugs had cleared from his system, he\u2019d be able to teach him the Tygerian language\u2014the language of the people, which he would, of course, have to teach the children. He petted his nobyo\u2019s head in satisfaction again, and pulled on his leash to lead him down the passageway and take him safely home.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Kyle awoke some time later to softness and warmth, though he became aware the air around him was chilly. He was lying naked on a soft rug on the floor, and wrapped in some kind of furry blanket. He stretched a little, trying to wake up and clear the fuzziness from his head. He tried hard to remember where he was, but he couldn\u2019t quite grab hold of the memory.</p><p>A sudden image of golden eyes flashed into his brain, and a rush of happiness came over him. He\u2019d found his mate. It was Tarr\u2014or no, that wasn\u2019t exactly right. Someone who looked like Tarr, but smelled totally different. He was cleaner too, and more beautiful. Kyle sat up, rubbing his eyes. Where was his mate? He was suddenly afraid that finding his mate had all been in his mind\u2014some kind of drug-induced dream. In a panic, he threw the covers off and tried to stand up, but was stopped by a chain around his ankle. He pulled at it viciously but the length of chain remained firmly bolted to the wall, holding him so that he had a range of motion of only a few feet in any direction.</p><p>Furious, he tried to shift, but to his horror, nothing happened. He fell back down on his ass, rubbed a hand over his face and tried again\u2014and again. Nothing happened, not even the releasing of his incisors from his gums. He shook his head to clear it, but it didn\u2019t help. The drugs they\u2019d given him must have something powerful in them that prevented his shifting. He had to get free\u2014he had to find his mate.</p><p>He was aware enough intellectually to know he should calm down and try to figure a way out of this\u2014a part of him even wondered why he was so freaked out about finding his mate instead of worrying about being kidnapped away from his family and his home. Fuck, he didn\u2019t even know where he was or even if he was really still back in that filthy cage and dreaming all of this. He knew he should try to figure all that out, but he wasn\u2019t feeling very logical. Despite his efforts to calm himself, he slipped more deeply into agitation and confusion.</p><p>He fell down on the rug and began tearing at the cuff on his ankle. It was tight and made of some stiff, animal hide material, but lined with soft, black fur. He pulled and tugged at it, even tried biting it with his teeth, but it wouldn\u2019t give at all. His growls and whimpers grew even louder until he knew he was making a lot of noise, and the damn guards would be in soon to shut him up, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>A door opened behind him and he never even turned to see who\u2019d come in, figuring it was the asshole guards, come to hit him again or pour more water down his throat. He resolved to fight them this time, now that he could think a little more clearly. He wouldn\u2019t allow them to put him back in that cage\u2014they\u2019d have to kill him first.</p><p>When the rapid footsteps got right behind him, he turned and scooted backward, thinking he could make his stand better with his back to the wall. It was then the scent that had been assailing his nostrils since the door opened finally registered on him, and he went completely still, his mouth falling open a little.</p><p>It was his mate, crouching down beside him, a look of concern on his beautiful features. It wasn\u2019t Tarr. That was definite now, and Kyle couldn\u2019t figure out how he\u2019d ever mistaken the two. There was a strong resemblance, to be sure, but the exotic creature beside him was much more beautiful. He was huge, the sleeveless vest-like garment covering his chest doing nothing to hide his muscular chest and arms. His skin was exquisitely marked with faint, thin tiger stripes running just under the golden skin, and his hair was a golden-red color, as were his eyebrows and eyelashes. His eyes were as golden as his hair, and he was simply the most delicious thing Kyle had ever seen.</p><p>He said something rapidly in his language, Tygerian, of course, and then seemed to concentrate hard on the next words, which he spoke in Earthonian, a mixture of several of Earth\u2019s primary languages and the official language of the Alliance.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, nobyo. You\u2019re safe now. I had to chain you to keep you from trying to escape and hurting yourself. Do you understand me? You do speak Earthonian, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kyle nodded. Then, because his beautiful mate seemed to be waiting for him to say more, he cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cYes, I speak Earthonian. I understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d His voice sounded rusty and hoarse to his ears, but a lovely smile lit up his mate\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ve been asleep so long I was beginning to be afraid my brother damaged your brain with his drugs.\u201d He caressed Kyle\u2019s face with a warm hand and Kyle couldn\u2019t stop himself from leaning into the soft touch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sweet one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh...\u201d Gods, what was the matter with him? He couldn\u2019t even think of his own name. What kind of drugs had they given him? Then suddenly, the words popped up in his mind and he sighed with relief. \u201cIt\u2019s K-Kyle. Kyle Balanescu.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll put that on your papers, but of course, I\u2019ll call you Nobyo, and you must always answer to that. Understand?\u201d</p><p>His mate\u2019s nearness was intoxicating to Kyle, and he pretty much felt like agreeing to anything he said. Not that he clearly understood more than half of it. Everything was so fuzzy and muddled up in his head. What did he mean by his papers? He nodded anyway.</p><p>\u201cUse words, sweet one. My name is Taz, but you should address me as Taz-lan. It\u2019s a sign of your respect for me.\u201d</p><p>Kyle nodded again, and his mate gripped his chin firmly, pulling Kyle\u2019s face up to his. \u201cSpeak, Nobyo. Say, yes, I understand, Taz-lan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I understand. Taz-lan.\u201d He didn\u2019t, of course, but it seemed to please his mate, so he repeated the words.</p><p>Kyle was rewarded with a beautiful smile and a much-too-quick kiss on his lips. Kyle lifted his face toward him, chasing more, but his mate straightened up. \u201cThank you, Nobyo. Now let\u2019s get you out of this shackle and get you cleaned up. I\u2019ve been waiting for you to wake up before I bathed you.\u201d</p><p>Bathed him? Well, the gods knew he needed it\u2014he was filthy from rolling around in those cages, and he could even smell himself. But he wasn\u2019t sure about being bathed, even by his mate. Still, his mate certainly had been kind and even loving toward him so far, and it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t want his mate\u2019s hands on him\u2014or all over him, for that matter. Maybe it would be better not to fight him on the small issues, in case something much more burdensome came up later.</p><p>He didn\u2019t struggle at all when Taz took off his shackle, and helped him stand up. The drugs still in his system made him feel terribly weak, so he had to lean heavily on Taz to get to the bathing chamber.</p><p>Taz opened the door to a small room that contained a large pool, almost filling the space. Gentle steam was rising from it, and Taz stepped up beside it and began pulling off his clothes.</p><p>Though still feeling dizzy and groggy, Kyle perked up when he saw that golden flesh being revealed to him. Taz\u2019s body was magnificent, long and lean with well-defined muscles everywhere. The tiger stripes were all over his body, even his big cock, which was lined with the stripes right up to the mushroom-shaped head, which, to Kyle\u2019s surprise, was totally black in color. It was striking and outlandish and totally enticing.</p> <p>Kyle took a half-step towards Taz\u2019s cockwith his hand outstretched. Before he could stop himself he tripped over absolutely nothing at all. His mate turned and caught him in his arms, drawing Kyle\u2019s body up to his. The feeling of being in his mate\u2019s arms for the first time was so blissful, he closed his eyes and sighed. His mate chuckled in his ear. \u201cBe careful, Nobyo. The drugs are very strong. You\u2019ll have to let me help you for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while? No, I don\u2019t want these drugs. They make me feel so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but they\u2019re necessary to keep you from shifting until we fully bond. After we bond, you won\u2019t want to leave me, and I can stop giving the drugs to you.\u201d</p><p>Kyle looked up at him and shook his head. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t leave you\u2014I won\u2019t ever leave you.\u201d He tried to look him in the eye. His mate simply didn\u2019t understand. \u201cYou\u2019re my mate. I can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, darling. But we say nobyo. It\u2019s all right. You\u2019ll get used to it all soon.\u201d</p><p>He began pulling Kyle gently toward the pool, and Kyle went willingly enough until he put the first foot in the water. It was hot and tingly, and he quickly jerked his foot away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little warm, but it will help to soothe the bruises you have on your body. I had the servants put in some medicine to help them heal more quickly. Come, Nobyo.\u201d He pulled at Kyle\u2019s hand and Kyle followed him down the steps into the water, wincing at the temperature.</p><p>After a few seconds, though, his body adjusted and the heat of the water seemed to seep into his bones. Taz pulled him close and they simply stood together in the water for a few moments, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms. Kyle felt Taz\u2019s hard cock pressed against his stomach, and he rubbed against it with his own, causing Taz to groan and catch his breath sharply. He lowered his mouth to Kyle\u2019s ear and whispered to him.</p> <p>\u201cI knew you would be something special the first moment I saw you, but this...\u201d He kissed Kyle voraciously, leaning him backward and moving his hands down to cup his ass. He ground against Kyle, and Kyle felt his wolf trying to emerge again, so he could properly claim his mate. Taz drove his tongue deeply into Kyle\u2019s mouth, sweeping across the inside of it, tasting and claiming him. Kyle brought one hand down between them to clench Taz\u2019s cock, pulling at it frantically, wanting to pleasure his mate. Taz groaned again and arched his back, driving his hips forward. A slight noise behind them made Taz break off with a muttered curse. He whirled to face the door, pushing Kyle protectively behind him.</p><p>A servant stood there, holding a tray in trembling hands, his head bowed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sir. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. You asked me to bring you these soaps.\u201d</p><p>Taz sighed and nodded. \u201cYes, of course. Put them down, please, by the side of the pool.\u201d</p><p>The young man, Tygerian from the look of him, set the tray down and bowed his way out the door. Taz released his grip on Kyle\u2019s arm and moved over to the tray, then sat down on one of the steps leading into the pool.</p><p>He picked up a bottle and uncapped it, then motioned for Kyle to come closer. \u201cThis is a soap I have made especially for my household. Come closer, Nobyo.\u201d</p><p>Kyle moved between his legs and Taz poured a little of the soap in his hands and started to rub it first on Kyle\u2019s hair. He\u2019d never had his hair shampooed by anyone before, and he was surprised at how intimate and sensual the experience was. Taz stared straight into his eyes and Kyle leaned forward to bask in his delicious scent.</p><p>The soap smelled a little spicy and musky, reminding him of his mate, so he didn\u2019t mind having the soap rubbed over his body. He enjoyed the feel of Taz\u2019s hands on his chest and stomach. He moved farther down and his hand closed over Kyle\u2019s rigid cock, and Kyle gasped with pleasure. This close, his mate\u2019s scent was driving him wild, and would continue to do so, he knew, until they had mated properly.</p><p>The wicked hand continued down to his balls, which got the same close attention, and then Taz was turning him around, rubbing more of the soap over his back and buttocks. He reached his crease and ran his fingers along it, finding his hole and massaging the soap in gently, but thoroughly, with one of his fingers. He slipped in another finger, and began to stretch him slowly. Kyle flinched at the burn and tried to pull away.</p><p>\u201cBe still, Nobyo. I need to prepare you for our mating.\u201d</p><p>Kyle tried even harder to pull away. \u201cNo\u2014I\u2019ve never done this. Not there. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>The fingers stilled and Taz\u2019s voice sounded right by his ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t wish to mate with me?\u201d</p><p>Kyle turned in his arm and put his hands on Taz\u2019s waist. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. Of course, I want to mate with you. Just not...I\u2019ve never done that before.\u201d He tried to speak clearly and distinctly, though he heard the words slurring. The drugs must still be working on him, and he felt a bit floaty and like all of this was a dream.</p><p>\u201cI want to do that to you,\u201d he said, putting his head on Taz\u2019s big chest.</p><p>Taz gave him a beautiful smile, and twisted him back around so quickly it made him dizzy. He bent him over. \u201cNo, baby. That\u2019s not how it\u2019s done.\u201d Kyle felt the blunt head of something hard pushing against his entrance and he tried to stand back up straight, but Taz pushed him down again. It wasn\u2019t his cock, surely. It was too hard and unyielding for that.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Nobyo. Push back against the burn\u2014I promise to be gentle. We can take our time.\u201d He moved his hand over Kyle\u2019s shaft, sliding his hand rapidly up and down its length. Kyle surprised himself by lifting his ass higher in the air, then pushing back forward, fucking himself on Taz\u2019s hand. Taz caught his breath and moaned in Kyle\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight, Nobyo.\u201d He pulled the thing he was pushing in him out partway and then pushed in again. He was easing it in farther each time, and Kyle arched back against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve never done this before, Taz-lan. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be doing it often in the future, sweet one. You\u2019re mine now, Nobyo, and I will enjoy your beautiful body as much as I want. I\u2019m putting a plug inside you to stretch you for our first time. It will help you, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Kyle heard himself moaning. Taz\u2019s plug was pressing into him harder, and he felt it breach the tight ring of muscles at his hole and slide deeper inside him. Kyle growled at the burn, and tried to pull away. He felt a none-too-gentle slap on his ass.</p><p>\u201cOh gods,\u201d he groaned, and heard Taz give a satisfied chuckle. He shifted the plug a little and rubbed against something inside Kyle that made him cry out in surprised pleasure. What was that? It burned and felt like heaven all at once. Taz pulled the plug back out and then moved it in again, hitting the spot over and over, until Kyle was almost mindless with pleasure. He was afraid to move in case he was encouraging his mate, and surely he shouldn\u2019t be enjoying this. At the same time, he was afraid the feeling might stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Nobyo. Submit to me\u2014give me your body.\u201d He wrapped his hand around Kyle\u2019s cock again and with only three hard pulls, Kyle came hard, his cum surging out into the water in front of him. Taz hummed with pleasure and kept stroking him until he\u2019d wrung every drop from him. Kyle hung in his arms, his body limp with exhaustion, and feeling a little humiliated that he\u2019d come so easily from the movement of the plug inside him.</p><p>Taz pulled him back so he was sitting on his lap, still impaled by the plug. He tried to catch his breath, and he could hear Taz doing the same, even as he rubbed and caressed Kyle\u2019s body with his hands.</p><p>Taz leaned toward him, concern in his voice. \u201cAre you all right, Nobyo? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Taz tried to speak, to shake his head, but he couldn\u2019t. His breath wouldn\u2019t come, and he felt dizzy and confused. Everything in him ached and he let his head fall back onto Taz\u2019s shoulders, suddenly wanting only to be taken care of. A part of his mind told him something wasn\u2019t right, but his body soaked up the warmth and pressure of Taz\u2019s skin against his. His body felt like it was melting into Taz\u2019s. He was forgetting who he was, becoming little more than this alien\u2019s creature, and he had to put a stop to it.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t-can\u2019t do this. I have to...I need to c-contact m-my family...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your family now, sweet one. I will be your whole life from this point on, along with our babies. Don\u2019t fight it, darling. We\u2019ll bond soon and then you won\u2019t feel so unsettled.\u201d Taz\u2019s hand began to work his hand on his cock again, even though it was almost painful, since Kyle had just come. He whimpered a little and felt Taz\u2019s tongue sliding along the side of his throat, leaving a trail of fire. Trying hard to hold onto his consciousness, he blinked his eyes, but it was no use. The darkness enveloped him, and he slid helplessly into it as it wrapped itself around him.</p><p>Taz was alarmed when his nobyo collapsed in his arms. Damn Tarr and his carelessness. He should have been more careful in dosing his nobyo with the drugs to keep him from shifting. They\u2019d been developed by the prison system on Tygeria to contain the huge tiger shifters on the planet. Though Tygerians usually shifted only at the full moon, which occurred only four times a year, they were capable of shifting at any time.</p><p>A prison full of fourteen- to sixteen-foot long tigers would have been impossible to contain. Years before, Tygerian scientists had developed a chemical that inhibited the ability to transform by blocking neuro-transmitters in the brain. It was sometimes used for years at a time with the more violent prisoners, but it kept them a little weak and confused.</p><p>The problem was it was developed for Tygerians, not Lycans. He didn\u2019t know how big a dose his brother had given his nobyo, but before he administered any more, Taz would call his personal physician to check his nobyo over.</p><p>Taz picked him up and carefully dried his body before carrying him into the bedroom. He laid him on his back and stared down at him while he used his communicator to call for the healer. After receiving assurances that the healer was on his way, Taz sat down beside his nobyo and took his pulse. Not that he had any idea what the pulse of a Lycan should feel like, but he wanted to do something.</p><p>He tried to remember the physiology charts of the Lycans he\u2019d studied in the few hours since he\u2019d brought him home, but nothing about heart rate came to mind. He pulled a leather thong from the drawer and put it around his nobyo\u2019s waist, tying it in front to preserve his modesty in front of the healer. A thin flap of leather went down between the legs to cover his cock and balls and then pressed tightly against his hole to help him keep in the new plug. He\u2019d only have to wear the plug for a while, until they\u2019d made love several times and stretched him enough. Tygerians were large and he had no wish to harm his nobyo.</p><p>He looked down at him again and put a hand over his chest to feel his heartbeat. Lycan hearts were closer to the center of their chests than Tygerian hearts were. Thankfully, he saw his nobyo\u2019s eyelids fluttering already, and he leaned over to kiss his lips.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Nobyo. I\u2019ve called for the healer and he\u2019ll be here soon. Can you drink some water?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and Taz reached for the pitcher by the bed and poured him a glass, then helped him to a sitting position so he could drink. He pushed him back down again afterwards and smoothed his still damp hair off his forehead.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel pain anywhere, Nobyo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just feeling weak and so confused. I can\u2019t think straight. I-I can\u2019t seem to catch my breath either. I\u2019m worried too, about my family. They\u2019ll be frantic by now. I have to get word to them.\u201d Kyle tried to sit up, and Taz pushed him gently back down.</p><p>\u201cThat life is behind you now, Nobyo. I\u2019m never giving you up, so they\u2019ll have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to give me up\u2014that is, I want you for my mate, so they\u2019ll understand that, but I have to explain it to them. So they\u2019ll understand. Otherwise they\u2019ll never stop looking for me. They\u2019ll come for me.\u201d He was becoming agitated again, rolling his head back and forth on the pillow, so Taz soothed him by caressing his jaw and murmuring to him.</p><p>\u201cOf course, baby. You can talk to your family. But later. Now stop worrying and close your eyes. No one will take you from me. No one.\u201d</p><p>He finally seemed to drop off to sleep, and Taz hovered over him while he waited for the healer. His breathing seemed to be getting harsher and Taz was worried. He paced the floor until finally he heard the healer arrive. Pulling on a robe, he went to answer the soft knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in quickly, Healer, please,\u201d Taz said to the older man. He quickly explained that his nobyo was a Lycan shifter and about Tarr giving him the drug developed for Tygerians. \u201cDid it harm him in some way? He says he feels very weak.\u201d</p><p>The man gazed down at the sleeping young Lycan. \u201cHe\u2019ll no doubt feel weak, so long as he\u2019s on the medication, but it shouldn\u2019t have bothered him so much, unless your brother gave him too much of it. His humanoid physiology is much the same as ours, with a few significant differences, but still...let me examine him.\u201d</p> <p>For the next few minutes, Taz stood by tensely as the healer checked his nobyo. He\u2019d heard all his life about how intense the bond was between a man and his nobyo, but had never given the idea much credence or paid much attention to it at all, really, and they hadn\u2019t even bonded yet. What would he feel like after they\u2019d made love?</p><p>He was only beginning to discover how deep the bond could be, and for the first time he understood how much his father mourned when his own nobyo had passed away. He and Tarr had been teenagers and really distressed and grief-stricken, but his father had been downright inconsolable.</p><p>The healer began to examine his Lycan, murmuring to him in a low tone, though his nobyo still seemed to be unconscious. Taz watched carefully. After a few minutes, the healer pulled Taz aside. \u201cHas he said if he thinks you\u2019re his mate?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Taz nodded. \u201cYes, he did. I thought that was strange. He said I was his mate and he couldn\u2019t leave me. I haven\u2019t even bonded with him yet.\u201d</p><p>The healer nodded. \u201cYes, but he\u2019s Lycan. That would account for this lovesickness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovesickness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Lycans have a very strong mating instinct. Once they\u2019ve found their mates, they bond instantly, at a touch, and they mate for life. Did he react strangely the first time you touched him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, now that you mention it.\u201d Taz looked surprised. \u201cHe fell back on his backside and looked up at me strangely, then wrapped his arms around my legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd has he made love to you yet? Completed the mating?\u201d</p><p>Taz looked a little surprised. \u201cNo, of course not. He\u2019s my nobyo, not the other way around. I will make love to him.\u201d</p><p>The healer shook his head. \u201cYes, but you have a Lycan, and they\u2019re all very dominant. His wolf hasn\u2019t been allowed to claim its mate and that\u2019s what\u2019s making him lovesick. You may have to allow him to top you, though there can be side effects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of side effects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a Lycan mate, you wouldn\u2019t be able to make love to anyone except your Lycan, no matter how much you might want to. If you were separated from him, the effects would fade over time, but it would take a while. You\u2019d be physically incapable of mating. And if you, as a Lycan mate felt your Lycan was angry with you, you would get terrible stomach cramps. There\u2019s a bio-chemical connection, you see, injected by their sperm.\u201d</p><p>Taz looked affronted. \u201cRidiculous. No! We\u2019ll find another way. I will make love to him, as is only proper with a nobyo. I\u2019ll stop giving him the drug to prevent his shifting and perhaps that will help. I hate to restrain him, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ll have to do, I suppose. I can\u2019t have him getting sick, and I don\u2019t want him to shift. If he does, I\u2019ll punish him. He\u2019ll soon learn to obey his master.\u201d</p><p>The healer nodded. \u201cYes, restraints and a firm hand should do the trick. Fuck him often and tame his wolf if you can. That will help too. You might try the silken flogger on him, but wait until the chemicals from the drugs have cleared his system.\u201d</p><p>The silken flogger was an instrument of mild torture, though it certainly sounded tame enough. The silken strands contained chemicals that caused extreme sexual excitement for the victim. He would do anything, agree to anything, to get sex.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Healer. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to resort to chemicals, but I\u2019ll keep it in mind in case he\u2019s particularly resistant to training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he looks stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Taz smiled. \u201cYes. Well, so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The healer nodded and started for the door before turning back. \u201cYour Lycan will make you an excellent nobyo once you train him, I think. Be careful\u2014he has sharp teeth and claws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll find himself muzzled with his claws trimmed, and his ass sore. Have no fear, Healer. No matter how fierce he might be, I can handle him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The healer smiled. \u201cUnless you fall in love with him. Be very careful\u2014you may have met your match in this one.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Kyle dreamed that he was drifting underwater. It was peaceful and calm and in the distance he could just make out a little house with a low red roof and white walls. He almost opened his mouth to laugh. Why would there be a little Lycan house underwater? Then he remembered as a boy when the rains came for nearly two weeks and a small community on the outskirts of town flooded. The river overflowed its banks and completely covered the houses there.</p><p>A dam was built and the place became a huge lake. He and his cousins drifted in the water there sometimes in the next few months and took turns peering under the clear water to see the strange sight of the road and the houses with the doors sitting open underneath all that water. He started to swim down to one of them, when someone caught his arm and pulled him back.</p><p>He looked around curiously and saw that it was his cousin Blayde along with his alpha Lucas, swimming alongside him now in the crystal water. Blayde was shaking his head at him and motioning for him to turn back. Kyle shook his head. He wanted to swim down and go inside the house, but his cousins wouldn\u2019t let him. They both kept pulling at his arm and shaking their heads over and over. Lucas pointed below and shook his head frantically. What was it?</p><p>He finally pulled away and looked a little closer to see, and then he spied his mate, Taz, swimming just below and beckoning to him to follow. His long golden hair spread out in the water around him. Kyle wanted to go down to him, but Lucas was in front of him now, blocking the way. And suddenly his brother Nikolai was there too, grabbing him from behind. He struggled with them both to get to Taz, who was drifting farther and farther away from him. He had to get to him before it was too late.</p><p>\u201cNobyo, Nobyo, wake up. You\u2019re having a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>Kyle opened his eyes in a panic and found Taz leaning over him, his eyes lit up with concern. Kyle looked around wildly, trying to figure out where he was. He was so weak and disoriented. He and Taz were in a large bed together in what must have been the Tygerian\u2019s bedroom. The room had stark white walls with no decorations of any kind, yet it seemed rich and even opulent. Part of it was the gleaming richness of the few pieces of massive, dark furniture, including the big square bed in the center of the floor, which seemed to consist mostly of large, soft pillows on a flat wooden frame.</p><p>Kyle was currently sunk down deep in the feathery pillows, but he had trouble moving his feet. He peered down at them and found both ankles attached to a chain that stretched between them. The chain wasn\u2019t very long\u2014about as long as his hand and forearm together. He could move, but his movements were severely restricted. And what the hell was stuck up in his ass? He turned an incredulous gaze on Taz.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed frightened, baby,\u201d Taz said in Earthonian. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Nothing will ever harm you here with me. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d Kyle rubbed his eyes and focused on his mate\u2019s handsome face. Taz needed to shave, and he had a little soft, blondish red stubble on his chin and his upper lips. Kyle wanted to nuzzle it with his nose, but he stopped himself. He was furious and wanted to hold onto that fury a little longer. The drugs were making him too calm and placid, and he hated the damn floaty feeling they gave him.</p><p>\u201cYou have me chained up! And what the hells do you have up inside me?\u201d He twisted to pull at himself, noticing for the first time there was some kind of leather thong thing wrapped around his waist and covering his genitals. Taz caught his wrists and held on tightly.</p><p>\u201cStop, Nobyo. I have you plugged until we make love later. I\u2019m quite large, and the plug will help you to be ready for me.\u201d</p><p>Kyle stared at him incredulously. He tried to speak, almost choking on the words. \u201cYou have me plugged! Oh, gods no, that is not going to happen. Get this out of me! We\u2019ll mate, yes, but I\u2019ll make love to you.\u201d</p><p>Taz actually had the nerve to look affronted and made no move to release his wrists. \u201cYou forget your place, Nobyo. You\u2019re mine now. Your body belongs to me. Now no more foolishness or I\u2019ll chain your wrists as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Taz-lan. And take these damn chains off my ankles! I demand it!\u201d</p><p>Taz got a damn patient, I\u2019ll-humor-the-poor-thing look on his face. Kyle wanted to mash it right off\u2014with his lips, preferably. Damn him.</p><p>\u201cNobyo, you don\u2019t make demands with me. I\u2019m trying very hard to be patient, because I know this is all new to you. But you are no longer in charge of anything, darling. You belong to me now, and I\u2019ll make all your decisions in the future. As for the chains\u2014well, they\u2019re not chains\u2014exactly. The device is called a hobbler, and designed specifically for training our nobyos\u2014the difficult ones who try to run away. You can walk, but just not quickly. It will prevent you from trying to leave me, now that I\u2019m following the healer\u2019s orders and backing off your drugs a little. If you promise to calm down, I\u2019ll release your wrists.\u201d</p><p>Kyle thinned his lips and nodded, so Taz would let him go. Immediately after Taz took his hands away, Kyle reached down to grab the chain and tug on it. He pulled so violently, the cuffs on his ankles dug into his flesh, but he didn\u2019t care. He would not be chained up like a dog! \u201cI\u2019m not trying to run away, damn it! And I won\u2019t be chained like this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that right now or I\u2019ll have to punish you,\u201d Taz said in a loud, commanding voice. Kyle stopped pulling at the chain, or hobbler, or whatever he\u2019d called it, and looked up at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake, I will spank your ass and chain your wrists if I have to. Then chain you to the wall until you learn how to behave. Now will all that be necessary or are you going to calm down?\u201d</p><p>Furious, Kyle could feel his chest heaving. It was getting harder to breathe, and he wondered briefly if the air on the planet had enough oxygen for him.</p> <p>\u201cSpank me!\u201d he yelled furiously. He bent down and tore at the chain again, and his mate grabbed his wrists and pushed him to his back, rolling on top of him. Now he really couldn\u2019t breathe, and though he wrestled with Taz a little, he couldn\u2019t keep it up for long.</p><p>The fact that his gorgeous mate was naked and on top of him wasn\u2019t helping, despite the fact that he was so angry at him at the moment. He bit his lip and finally nodded. \u201cAll right. I won\u2019t fight you. For now,\u201d he said with a snarl. Had this not been his mate, he\u2019d have never complied in any way, but he realized that if they fought, even in his weakened state, he might hurt his mate. And that was completely unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Taz said, smiling at him and kissing his cheek. He rolled off beside him, though he kept his leg slung over both of Kyle\u2019s. \u201cYour training begins today, darling, but don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make you into the perfect nobyo in no time.\u201d</p><p>Kyle growled and ran a hand over his face, still trying to clear away the grogginess. Most of the drugs in his system seemed to have worn off, but his reactions were still slower than normal. And why couldn\u2019t he catch his breath properly? Since it was worse with agitation, he made a conscious effort to calm himself and his breathing eased a little. He decided not to pull on the chains anymore. It was getting him nowhere fast and making his ankles sore in the process. He glared over at Taz.</p><p>\u201cOn top of everything else, I\u2019m starving. Am I allowed some food before we start this training of yours, or is your plan to starve me into submission?\u201d he asked in a waspish tone. He was never in a great temper when he was hungry, and this time was proving to be no exception. He wondered just how long it had been since he\u2019d had any real food. Probably days from the way his stomach felt.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since your brother kidnapped me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday makes four sunrises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour? No wonder I\u2019m starving! You\u2019re trying to kill me!\u201d Kyle put his head in his hand, trying to remember just what he\u2019d eaten last, but couldn\u2019t even remember.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic, Nobyo. They couldn\u2019t very well feed you when you were unconscious. They gave you water, I believe, to keep you hydrated. You\u2019ve been mostly sleeping since I brought you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf-drowned me with it, you mean! I remember a little of that, I think. And stop making them sound so solicitous. They kidnapped me, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobyo, I realize you\u2019re upset, but I won\u2019t allow you to yell at your master. Now be good and I\u2019ll get us some food.\u201d Taz ignored Kyle\u2019s gasp of outrage at the word master and pressed a switch on the wall by his head. The door opened in mere seconds to reveal a servant, who bowed deeply at the waist.</p><p>Taz spoke to him in rapid Tygerian and sat up, holding out an impatient hand. \u201cCome, Nobyo. The servants are bringing us our first-meal.\u201d</p><p>Kyle tried to scoot to the foot of the bed, but got caught up in the damn pillows. The chain between his ankles snagged the corner of one of the massive things, and he was unable to get it unsnagged.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d He glared up at Taz. \u201cGet this fucking thing off me, now!\u201d</p><p>Taz folded his arms and frowned down at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like your tone, Nobyo. I\u2019ve already explained why the hobbler is necessary.\u201d He hauled Kyle to the edge, before picking him up in his arms and carrying him to the table and chairs in a corner of the room.</p><p>Kyle was large and not used to anyone carrying him around. He struggled a little and grabbed onto Taz\u2019s neck, afraid he\u2019d drop him.</p><p>Taz walked briskly over to deposit him on a chair by the table, not even breathing hard. The second he put Kyle in the chair, the damn plug shifted inside him and he made another grab for it, only to have his hand slapped away.</p><p>\u201cStop, Nobyo. The plug will stay in until I make love to you and we bond. Behave yourself or I\u2019ll chain your wrists while I feed you.\u201d</p><p>Kyle stiffened in outrage. \u201cI\u2019m not a damn child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop acting like one,\u201d Taz said calmly, seating himself across from Kyle.</p><p>Kyle glared at him as a knock sounded on the door and it opened to admit two servants, both carrying large trays of food. Kyle felt weak at the sight and smell of the hot food, most of which he didn\u2019t recognize, but any port would do in a storm. Gods, had he ever been so ravenous? Taz took a plate and filled it with a variety of foods and handed it over to him. \u201cNormally, I would have you serve me, Nobyo, but this is a special occasion. Our first meal together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kyle nodded, too intent on the plate of food in front of him to really pay attention. Still, hungry as he was, he waited to see if the Tygerian observed any religious rituals before eating they did on some planets. Taz gazed over at him approvingly.</p><p>\u201cThank you for waiting for my permission. You may eat, darling. I know you\u2019re very hungry.\u201d</p><p>Kyle gave him a resentful glare. He hadn\u2019t been waiting for permission, only trying to show good manners. Since his resentment was being ignored, however, he began eating some kind of bread with a spicy kind of butter on top. He found it to be delicious. There were small meat pies and what looked like yams too, piled high on his plate. Kyle gave each dish his attention until he\u2019d cleared it all away. He finished with a mug of sweet-tasting milk and leaned back in his chair to find Taz watching him carefully.</p><p>Taz smiled at him. \u201cYou have nice manners. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s very important as my nobyo that you be able to teach our children how to act properly.\u201d</p><p>Kyle narrowed his eyes. \u201cOur, uh, children? We\u2014I mean\u2014you have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, darling. Well, our first son will be here soon, anyway. I must have you properly bonded and trained by the time he gets here.\u201d He smiled and picked up his own mug of milk and took a sip.</p><p>The conversation Kyle had with his cousin, Blayde\u2014could it have only been a few days before\u2014suddenly came back to him. What was it he\u2019d said? That\u2019s one reason the Tygerians purchase love slaves. The love slaves rear their babies for them...They call their captives their nobyos. To them, it\u2019s almost like a spouse and another father for their children. They keep them very submissive...</p><p>Kyle felt stunned. He\u2019d joked with his cousin about it\u2014now it didn\u2019t seem to be funny in the least. So this was why he kept insisting on calling him Nobyo instead of his name.</p><p>\u201cYou-you really want me to be your damn nanny? I thought Blayde was exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>Taz frowned at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know who Blayde is, and I don\u2019t understand this nanny, but I don\u2019t like your tone. As I have explained, we call our love slaves our nobyos, and they are like our mates, as I believe you call it. Our nobyos are very special to us\u2014we trust them with our children. This is a very great honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know anything about children! Especially babies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe servants will help at first, Nobyo, and you\u2019ll soon learn. You worry too much. Are all Lycans like this?\u201d He stood up and came around the table toward Kyle, whose mouth suddenly went dry at the sight of his naked body. His brain went tilt and whatever they\u2019d been discussing suddenly didn\u2019t seem all that important anymore.</p><p>His wolf, who had been sleeping inside him, suddenly stirred and Kyle felt his cock thicken. His mate was so damn beautiful. Kyle stood to meet Taz and reached for him without thinking, drawing him into his arms.</p><p>Taz came willingly, smiling down at him. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful too, Nobyo.\u201d Kyle looked up in surprise to meet his twinkling gaze. Gods, had he said that aloud?</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019ve eaten, I don\u2019t think I can wait any longer to bond with you,\u201d Taz told him. \u201cAre you feeling well enough, darling?\u201d Taz held him tightly in his arms, rubbing his hands over his naked ass.</p><p>\u201cGods, yes,\u201d Kyle said, pulling Taz\u2019s head down toward him. He took his lips fiercely, thrusting his tongue inside his sweet mouth and rubbing his cloth-covered erection against Taz\u2019s naked groin.</p><p>Taz made a wordless sound and picked him up again by holding him tightly around his waist and walking backwards toward the bed with him, still ravishing Kyle\u2019s lips with his own.</p><p>As Taz carried him toward the bed, he thought how nice his nobyo felt beneath his hands, and he couldn\u2019t imagine how he\u2019d managed to wait so long to claim him. He tumbled him back on the bed and dropped down over him to continue their interrupted kiss. His lips were soft and warm, and he enjoyed the feel of his nobyo\u2019s tongue inside his mouth. This wasn\u2019t a custom of the Tygerians, but he found that he quite liked it. He would encourage his nobyo to service him this way in the future.</p><p>Taz pulled back to look down at him. He was so pretty, with his tanned skin and golden-red hair. And those eyes and eyelashes. Taz thought he\u2019d never seen any prettier, even on the females he\u2019d known. He ran his hands over the muscles on his nobyo\u2019s chest and stomach. All his and everyone he knew would be envious of this beauty and strength under his command. Taz bent down to nip at his neck, marking him. He wanted to cover his baby in bruises that would show everyone exactly who he belonged to.</p><p>Taz felt his nobyo\u2019s rigid cock beneath him and quickly untied his thong and ripped it off, throwing it down beside the bed. His Lycan\u2019s beautiful long cock sprang out, hard and hot.</p><p>He touched it and his nobyo groaned, pushing up into his hand. He answered him with a groan of his own and fell down on top of him, rubbing their pricks together. His nobyo\u2019s lovely cock leaked pre-cum copiously, and he was grinding back against him. Taz pulled his wrists above his head and held them there so he could bite his neck again.</p><p>His lover squirmed beneath him and struggled a little. \u201cN-no. Not like this, Taz-lan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sweet one, exactly like this.\u201d Taz moved up to cover his lips again, tracing them with his tongue. He moaned and practically attacked Taz, trying to fuck Taz\u2019s mouth with his tongue. Instead, Taz grabbed his tongue with his lips and sucked it hard into his mouth, taking control away from his nobyo. His eyes opened wide and though he didn\u2019t try to pull away, Taz could hear the growls start up in his chest.</p><p>He pulled away, laughing. \u201cYou like to fight, yes, Nobyo? Go ahead. It will make my victory over your body even sweeter.\u201d His nobyo made an angry sound as Taz moved his lips down to his nipples. Complaints and curses in what must have been his own Lycan language filled the air, but Taz ignored them, holding tightly to his wrists and biting now at his nipples. He worried one nipple with his teeth and his tongue until his nobyo was groaning and begging.</p><p>\u201cP-please stop, Taz. Gods, stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, beg me,\u201d Taz said, smiling down at him. Even though his nobyo was complaining and cursing, he still pushed his hips up and ground against Taz\u2019s cock restlessly. Taz knew he was enjoying this much more than he was letting on.</p><p>He smiled down at him again. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cif you really don\u2019t want me to make love to you, I will let you up. I have no wish to force myself on you.\u201d He lifted his body up a little by his elbows and knees, still holding his nobyo\u2019s wrists, but denying him the friction on his cock now. His nobyo bucked up wildly beneath him, trying to touch him again and gave a little cry of dismay.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I want...I want you, Taz-lan. I do want this.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his body back to cover his nobyo, who immediately ground up into his groin. His cock was jerking and swelling beneath Taz. Taz bit his nobyo\u2019s shoulder and then licked the hurt away. He leaned up on one elbow and started stroking his nobyo\u2019s cock in long, slow pulls that make him cry out and beg for more. His shaft was red and swollen, leaking more and more pre-cum, and Taz let his hand drift down to the flesh beneath the Lycan\u2019s balls. He felt the plug there. It had been held in by the tight thong, but was sliding slowly out, so he pressed the heel of his hand against it to push it back in.</p><p>His Lycan tensed and cried out, looking up at him with those big, beautiful, scared eyes. Taz kissed him again. \u201cWill you let me bond with you now, darling? I want you so much.\u201d</p><p>The Lycan hesitated a long time\u2014so long Taz thought he might refuse him, and he wouldn\u2019t force this on him. He\u2019d have to want to bond with him for the full effect to take place. Tygerians also secreted certain chemicals in their semen that, with males at least, created a strong, unbreakable bond. It was why Tygerians had to be careful to whom they made love, and never fucked anyone except their chosen nobyos, though oral sex or mutual masturbation was permissible. Young Tygerian males frequently used each other\u2019s bodies for that. True bonding, however, was reserved for their chosen ones.</p><p>After an achingly long time, his lover gazed deeply into his eyes and nodded. \u201cYes, Taz-lan. I want you to make love to me.\u201d</p><p>Taz caught his breath at the depth of emotion in his nobyo\u2019s eyes. He kissed him tenderly. \u201cI will always care for you, darling. I will keep you safe. You have my vow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my mate,\u201d he answered simply. \u201cI have to be with you. If this makes you happy, then I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><p>The sweetness of the reply struck a chord in Taz\u2019s heart, and he covered his nobyo\u2019s face with kisses. Tenderly, he reached down and pulled the plug gently from his nobyo\u2019s sweet hole and placed it on the table beside the bed. He found some oils he had left there and spread them liberally over his cock. Then he put some of the oil on his fingers and gently inserted one finger in his nobyo\u2019s ass, carefully checking to see if he was in any pain.</p><p>His nobyo held himself rigid, but the plug had done its work well, and stretched him properly. Seeing how stiff his nobyo\u2019s shoulders had become\u2014he was gritting his teeth as if this was something he must endure but not enjoy\u2014Taz crooked his finger up to touch the small bundle of nerves he knew was there. He and his friends had been taught that this spot would make their nobyos feel good so they practiced, locating this spot on the anatomy charts, so they could pleasure their nobyos one day.</p><p>When he found the spot on the Lycan, he swiped over it gently with his finger and enjoyed the look of surprise and pleasure on his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods!\u201d his nobyo cried out, and his eyebrows rose. Taz continued to rub his finger over it. His nobyo\u2019s eyelids got heavy and he licked his lips. Taz thought him very beautiful. He fell down between his legs, pulling out his fingers and nudging his cock against his nobyo\u2019s sweet hole. \u201cSweet boy,\u201d Taz murmured to him, and eased his shaft inside him. His hole clenched around him like a fist, despite the stretching by the plug, and Taz was almost overcome by the heat and the sensations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDeeper,\u201d his nobyo cried out, and Taz wanted to shout in triumph. Instead he gave him what he wanted and began to set up steady strokes, each angled so that it brushed over the place inside him that gave him so much pleasure. He was so tight that Taz was still afraid he\u2019d hurt him, but his lover was making little whimpering sounds and his cock, when Taz wrapped his hand around it, thrust up strongly into his grasp, hard and rigid.</p><p>Taz undulated his body over his nobyo\u2019s, pushing in and going deeper to make this bonding strong and solid.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Nobyo. Say it. Tell me no one else will ever have this body.\u201d</p><p>The Lycan thrashed his head on the pillows and gave him a needy little sound, but he was stubborn. Taz pulled all the way out\u2014just the tip of his cock poised at his entrance and heard his nobyo gasp. He thrust his hips upward for more, but Taz held himself up out of his reach. \u201cSay it, Lycan. Say you belong to me. Only me.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at Taz resentfully and finally seemed to sag\u2014his whole body going limp. \u201cI-I\u2019m yours. Yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you belong to me. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI belong to you! Only you.\u201d He shouted the words almost angrily, his whole body blushing a delightful pink color.</p><p>Taz smiled down at him. \u201cYes, darling. That\u2019s right. And I\u2019ll never let you go\u2014never let you leave me.\u201d</p><p>He thrust back down into him and pushed in hard, pounding against him. The muscles wrapped around Taz\u2019s prick were squeezing him tightly. Taz moved his hand harder and faster, catching the same rhythm. It was then he felt his boy\u2019s body clench and tighten. He cried out Taz\u2019s name and came hard, the white spunk hitting his own stomach. Taz squeezed him harder, milking him for every drop. He managed a few more thrusts before he was coming too. He arched his back as his cum shot into his nobyo, injecting him and filling him up with the semen that would ensure their bonding. His nobyo felt it because he opened his eyes wide and cried out, not in pain but in surprise.</p><p>His boy had been claimed\u2014well and truly claimed and the wolf had been tamed, made to lie down and roll over on his back while the tiger spunk left its mark inside his nobyo\u2019s body. \u201cMine,\u201d Taz exulted as he kept pounding into him, long after the Lycan wolf had given up and fled, leaving only his sweet nobyo.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Kyle was about to go out of his mind with boredom. After several days with him, Taz had left to go back to work, leaving Kyle with too much time on his hands. He\u2019d tried reading, exercising, even lying on the bed staring up at the ceiling, and he was still slowly but surely going out of his mind. Taz seemed to want to keep him as much in the dark as he possibly could about what he did for the Tygerian government, but Kyle had gleaned enough information to know that he was a pretty big deal. That morning a special transport had arrived to take him to wherever he was going, and as Kyle watched out the window, the driver had seemed very deferential.</p><p>The transport had some kind of official Tygerian symbol on the side as well. Taz had been wearing a pair of dark trousers and a longish red coat, buttoned all the way up and reaching almost to his knees. The material looked rich and expensive, and Kyle thought he looked really handsome, his face solemn and businesslike. To look at him, you\u2019d never know he kept Kyle up half the night fucking him in positions Kyle hadn\u2019t previously thought possible.</p><p>In order to watch out the window, Kyle had to first pull a chair over and climb up on it, because the windows in this house at least were some ten feet high on the walls and seemed to be designed to let in light, but not expose any views. As a result, the rooms seemed claustrophobic to Kyle and little better than a luxurious prison.</p><p>After Taz left that morning, Kyle had mostly rested and tried to regain his strength. The drugs were mostly out of his system by now, but they\u2019d taken their toll, leaving him feeling drained and weak. The first few days, when Taz hadn\u2019t been making love to him, Kyle had done little else besides eat and sleep. There was no doubt in Kyle\u2019s mind that the bonding Taz spoke of had taken place, because he never wanted Taz to be away from him. The bond was already intense, even before they made love, but now it seemed overpowering and simply took his breath away.</p><p>This morning, however, with his strength almost back to normal, and Taz leaving to go back to work, Kyle needed something to do or he\u2019d soon be climbing the walls. He was even feeling some separation anxiety, which he firmly told himself was ridiculous. He refused to succumb to this thing\u2014he\u2019d fight to keep his own identity and not lose himself to this bonding. His own mating urge was strong enough. Coupled with this Tygerian\u2019s so-called bonding, it would be enough to overpower him if he wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>Pacing up and down like a trapped animal, he remembered what Taz had told him only the night before. \u201cYour situation has changed, Nobyo, and you must learn to accept that fact. If you can, you can find peace and happiness here with me and my children, but if you can\u2019t, if you continue to fight this, it will eventually destroy everything we have between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that, Taz. You\u2019re my mate, but I\u2019m also a Lycan. I can\u2019t accept your domination. In my world, this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Taz stared steadily back at him. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer in your world, Nobyo. Whether or not you like to admit it, I am your master. I\u2019ll never give you up. And I\u2019ve told you before to call me Taz-lan.\u201d</p><p>Kyle glared at him. He refused to even try to understand how Kyle felt. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about anyway? Is it part of your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The suffix means \u2018master\u2019 in my language. It is the proper way a nobyo addresses his owner.\u201d</p><p>Kyle had snorted and pulled away. \u201cMy owner? Fuck that, Taz. No one owns me! I\u2019m here because your brother kidnapped me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a prisoner of war. He captured you. And my brother tells me you came to kidnap him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo arrest him! It\u2019s not the same thing at all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrest him? Oh whose authority? The Alliance? We\u2019re at war with the Alliance, Nobyo, as you well know, and we care little about what they think. What crimes did they say he had committed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarr Bonnet traffics in love slaves\u2014he works with the Jolly Rogers and they\u2019re a bunch of thugs. Surely you know what Tarr does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But doesn\u2019t your home planet also have love slaves? Along with other planets in the Alliance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>Kyle stood up and started pacing back and forth. \u201cIt just is! Our love slaves put themselves up for sale. They have contracts, and they get paid a lot of money. No one is forcing them!\u201d</p><p>Taz nodded. \u201cSo do ours\u2014except for captives of planets with which we\u2019re at war.\u201d He gave Kyle a long look. \u201cLike you, Nobyo. Do you feel as if you\u2019re being forced to submit to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do!\u201d At Taz\u2019s steady look, he backed off a little. \u201cOkay, so you\u2019re not exactly forcing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hate this so much and feel that you\u2019re being taken advantage of, then I\u2019ll let you go. I\u2019ll find a way to send you home\u2014perhaps a prisoner exchange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kyle shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want. Not unless you come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s impossible. I have a child about to be born. My life is here on Tygeria, and I can\u2019t leave it. I want you here with me, but we\u2019re at war with the Alliance. It\u2019s an ancient war and our scars are deep. The only role for you in my life\u2014the only future we have\u2014is for you to remain here as my nobyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m basically spoils of war? Just a prisoner?\u201d He stopped pacing and glared at Taz. \u201cIf I\u2019m only a prisoner of war, why am I not in one of your prison camps? Why did you come for me in the first place?\u201d</p><p>Taz sighed and shook his head. \u201cYou know the answer to this, Nobyo. Why do you persist in being so stubborn? My brother thought I would like you. I did. I wanted you from the first moment I saw you. If I hadn\u2019t taken you, then yes, you would now be in a prison camp. Do you want me to put you aside? Let you go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I told you that you\u2019re my mate. Once I saw you\u2014touched you\u2014I can no longer be without you. My family has a biological imperative to be with their mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we always discussing this?\u201d Taz snapped. \u201cDamn it! Even if you asked to leave me, I don\u2019t know if I could really let you go!\u201d He stood up and crossed the room to catch Kyle up in his arms and drag him over to the bed to make love to him. Most of their arguments ended the same way, actually, with Taz exerting his dominance over Kyle and trying to prove to him that he was in charge. Taz actually believed that he had vanquished Kyle\u2019s Lycan wolf in some way, deep inside him. Actually, nothing could have been further from the truth.</p><p>Kyle\u2019s wolf was still there, still very aware of what was happening. He was willing to submit to his mate, though not necessarily pleased about it. Still, in some ways he responded to Taz\u2019s extreme dominance. Did his wolf recognize a true alpha in Taz and wish to submit? It was the only possible explanation for why he mostly wanted to obey his mate, and why he responded with so much excitement to their lovemaking.</p><p>Though he still badly needed to complete the mating by biting and claiming him as well, his wolf had been pacified by the almost constant lovemaking they\u2019d been engaged in, and that was unusual for a true alpha. His cousin Lucas or Blayde would have gone insane by now. Perhaps he really was a beta, and thus, while he sometimes balked at his mate\u2019s domineering behavior, he mostly responded to his orders.</p><p>Taz had been careful so far never to allow Kyle to top him or be anywhere close enough to the back of his neck to bite him when they made love, but Kyle knew it was only a matter of time until he let down his guard. Until then, he was enjoying his mate and playing a kind of waiting game. The most he could hope for with the extremely dominant Tygerian would be a kind of partnership of equals. Kyle even thought he could allow him to be in charge, to a certain extent, but in order to accomplish either of those things, he had a lot more work to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kyle needed to convince his lover that he was as brave and as strong as he was, and that he needed no protection. He\u2019d be willing to submit to him, if that was what he needed, but he had to stop treating Kyle like some delicate, not-too-bright pet. And that was going to take a lot of persuasion.</p><p>In the meantime, Kyle was worried about his family back on Lycanus 3, and determined to let them know he was alive and not being tortured or mistreated in any way. They had to know Tarr Bonnet was involved and would naturally think the worst. They must all be frantic by now. He had to let them know that he\u2019d found his mate, and wanted to stay with him.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t even the only reason he needed to contact them. He was worried about their feelings, of course, and how worried they\u2019d be, but most of all he wanted to prevent any ill-advised rescue attempts that would ultimately be unsuccessful and might even lead to some of them being hurt or even killed. He knew Lucas and Kyle\u2019s own brother Nikolai\u2014hells, the entire family\u2014 would never rest until they found him. Taz was equally unwilling to give him up. It could prove to be a dangerous situation.</p> <p>Restlessly, he got up and walked to the door. When he tried the door knob, it opened for him right away, and he was a little surprised. Taz really had become complacent about him in the last few days. Kyle had no doubts the servants had been told to watch him, and if he tried to leave the house, he\u2019d be quickly stopped, but he seemed to have freedom of movement within these walls.</p><p>He could hear some of the servants outside working on the grounds, and the others were in the kitchen from the sounds of it. He slipped as silently as he could down the hallway to Taz\u2019s office and surprisingly found it unlocked. He knew Taz had a compnet, and worked on it most evenings. He wondered if he\u2019d be lucky enough to be able to get on and send a message to his family.</p><p>Taz had promised he\u2019d do it for him, but so far he\u2019d never asked for their contact information, and Kyle thought he was still just putting him off, perhaps thinking they\u2019d forget about Kyle eventually. If so, Taz had no idea how fiercely loyal Lycans were, especially to their families.</p><p>He found the compnet with no problem, and it wasn\u2019t even password protected, so he was able to get on soon enough. The problem came when he tried to send a message to Lycanus 3 or anywhere else outside Tygeria. A warning of some kind popped up\u2014in Tygerian, so Kyle had no idea what it said, but the red, flashing border around the message gave him a pretty good clue that the network wasn\u2019t wishing him a good day.</p><p>An idea occurred to him and he quickly wrote a message to send to the embassy of the planet Jayron. He was able to look up its address on Tygeria and hit the send button before he could second guess himself. Jayron was the planet his brother-in-law, Jagger, came from and had diplomatic ties to both Tygeria and the Alliance. Kyle had met Jagger\u2019s mother and father, the king and queen of Jayron, and he thought that maybe the embassy would at least recognize his name and pass on a message to his family for him\u2014if the message wasn\u2019t ignored or filed away by some bureaucrat as spam. All he could do was write the message and send it to through the diplomatic channel he found online and hope for the best.</p> <p>He turned off the compnet and stole quietly back out of Taz\u2019s office. On his way out, he stopped for a moment to look at Taz\u2019s trophy case, near the door. Like most young Tygerian males, Taz competed in the Gladiator games, a popular, if bloodthirsty sport that took place in the arenas. The wealthy young men on the planet loved to fight in the Exhibition Games, arena-type games held from time to time, and usually fought by slaves or prisoners. Though it was forbidden by Tygerian law, young warriors like Taz would sometimes take part, with officials turning a blind eye to it in the name of higher television ratings.</p><p>The games were always performed in front of large crowds, and broadcast to a huge audience on Tygeria and its allied planets. A warlike people, the Tygerians liked nothing better than a good fight, and sometimes, especially when they were fighting condemned prisoners, the fight was to the death. If the prisoner showed exceptional courage, he might even win his freedom, as the crowd decided the outcome with a raised fist if they wanted to spare the prisoner\u2019s life. They admired courage and bravery more than any other trait. However, if the prisoner showed fear by cowering or running away, the crowd would scorn him, and he would be dispatched quickly. Taz had shown Kyle his many trophies won in the games proudly, along with Tarr\u2019s. He kept them in this special case by the door.</p><p>Because of his participation in the games, Taz liked to stay physically fit. He had a well-equipped gym in his home and Kyle headed that way now. He spent the next hour or so using the weights and Taz\u2019s machines, then went and took a long hot soak in the bathing chamber. Later in the afternoon, he studied some of the Tygerian language books Taz had obtained for him, just trying to pass the time until Taz came home.</p><p>It was late in the afternoon when he finally heard the door open and Taz walked in, looking tired and a bit subdued. Kyle put down his book and smiled at him, knowing he liked it when he made a big deal of his arrival.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done today, Nobyo?\u201d Taz asked, gazing at him somberly.</p><p>\u201cNot much. I slept late. Exercised a while, then studied the language books after that. Did you have a good day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was...interesting.\u201d Taz slipped off his jacket and sat down at the table. The door opened within a minute or so and servants began bringing in the evening meal. Kyle sat down across from Taz, wondering if something had happened at work to make him upset.</p><p>In the meantime, the food smelled good and he filled his plate to begin eating. It was some kind of stew with a bit of a strange flavor, so Kyle decided not to even ask what it might be. He was hungry and concentrated on his food for a while before he noticed that Taz wasn\u2019t eating, but just sitting there watching him.</p><p>He touched a napkin to his lips and leaned back in his chair. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should tell me.\u201d</p><p>Kyle cocked his head. \u201cSure, I guess so. I was bored all day, but whatever...\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cReally? So bored you had to ask the Jayronian ambassador for help?\u201d Taz spoke quietly, staring across the table at him.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Kyle said, throwing his napkin on the table. \u201cThey contacted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded. \u201cThe Jayronian ambassador is a good friend of mine. As soon as your message crossed his desk, he messaged me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, hells, Taz.\u201d Kyle lifted his chin defiantly. \u201cI\u2019ve told you from the first day I needed to contact my family, and you\u2019ve refused to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you your life in Lycanus is over. You\u2019re with me now. You belong to me, and you\u2019re my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it doesn\u2019t work like that, Taz. I won\u2019t just forget all about the family I\u2019ve had all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather be with them than me.\u201d His voice was flat and emotionless, his eyes cast down at the table.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kyle slammed his hand down on the table. \u201cI\u2019ve told you that you\u2019re my mate. You must know by now what that means to Lycans and to my family in particular. I\u2019ll never leave you, Taz, and I don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t believe that. Have I made any attempt to escape? Have I even asked you to let me go?\u201d</p><p>Kyle stood up, too angry to sit still, and pointed his finger in Taz\u2019s face. \u201cDo you honestly think I would stay around here letting you make me into your little bitch if I hadn\u2019t been in love with you? If I could bear to leave you behind? I\u2019d have made you kill me first. I\u2019d have killed myself!\u201d He glared across at Taz, full of all the pent-up rage he\u2019d felt since he was taken in the bar back on Leeria.</p><p>Taz jumped to his feet and slapped Kyle\u2019s finger away. \u201cYou forget who you\u2019re speaking to, Nobyo! I should beat you for going behind my back this way and embarrassing me. This stubbornness of yours is coming between us and it has to stop. I\u2019ve told you before that your situation has changed and if you want to stay with me like you say you do, then you have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>Kyle stormed across the room and sat down on the side of the bed, crossing his arms over his chest and refusing to look at Taz. He was afraid he\u2019d take a swing at him and they\u2019d have to fight. Taz followed him over to the bed and stood next to him, trying to intimidate him with his nearness.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d contact your family, and I did. I sent them a message that you were alive and well on Tygeria. I told them you were training as my nobyo and that you were no longer any of their concern.\u201d</p><p>Kyle rolled his eyes dramatically. \u201cWell, you may as well have issued a direct challenge to them! Why not just spit in their faces while you\u2019re at it? They\u2019ll be coming for me, don\u2019t you see? And if they do, you\u2019ll fight them. Whether you kill them or they kill you, it\u2019s all the same\u2014it will destroy me! Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>Kyle covered his face, horrified to feel tears prickling the backs of his eyes. Taz sat down beside him right away and took him in his arms, tipping his head back to make him look directly at him.</p><p>\u201cI would never harm your family, Nobyo, but I have to break down this resistance you have to your new life. I think that worrying about them and what they might think about us has hampered you. I will break this resistance, Nobyo. Make no mistake about it. I have to become your whole world in order for that to happen. Your loyalty has to be solely for me.\u201d</p><p>Taz bent and took his mouth passionately. Kyle allowed it, even kissing him back, but pulled away and pushed at him until he backed off.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t just command me to forget my family and think I\u2019ll do it. I have a brother, a twin like you do, though we don\u2019t look that much alike. And all of my cousins are almost as close. I\u2019d do anything for them as they would for me, and they\u2019ll understand if I tell them you\u2019re my mate. Most of them are mated themselves and they know how strong the bond is. Once they know I want to stay, it\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right? I\u2019m so glad to have their permission.\u201d Taz stood up and started pacing. \u201cI think I have to punish you for this insolence, Nobyo. I can\u2019t allow you to dictate to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kyle jumped to his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight you, but I will if you try to do this. I\u2019m warning you, Taz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re warning me? Really?\u201d He took a step toward him and clenched his fists, raising his face to the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019d like to have you in the arena for a while. I would show you who\u2019s in charge here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me in the arena then!\u201d</p> <p>Taz looked at him in surprise. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019d never survive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you think so? Try me then. Let me face you in the arena.\u201d</p><p>Taz snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared of me? Afraid I\u2019ll win? Wouldn\u2019t that be embarrassing? A noble Tygerian warrior beaten and humiliated by his own nobyo?\u201d</p><p>Taz glared at him, his fists slowly clenching and unclenching. Kyle was a bit afraid he\u2019d pushed him too far, but he had to keep on. If he could get him to agree, he might have a chance to win and tell his family to back off.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, if you\u2019re so sure you can win this, then make a wager with me. Bet me that if you win it, I\u2019ll drop this subject and become your loyal little nobyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I lose?\u201d Taz asked, his tone of voice clearly revealing he didn\u2019t think it possible.</p><p>\u201cThen I get to visit my family and explain that I\u2019ve found my mate and that I\u2019m happy living here on Tygeria. I return as your equal partner, and you forget this nobyo shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisit them?\u201d Taz\u2019s voice dripped with scorn. \u201cYou honestly expect me to believe you\u2019d come back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would come back. You have my word. I don\u2019t want to live somewhere without you.\u201d</p><p>Taz stared down at him with disbelief. Kyle got to his feet to face him. \u201cMake a decision, damn it. Will you give me a chance to fight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t last five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you believe, then what do you have to lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Lycan,\u201d Taz said, his voice cold with fury. \u201cI\u2019ll fight you. I\u2019ll arrange some sparring time in the arena as soon as I can get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Kyle said, nodding firmly. \u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>Taz narrowed his eyes at him for another few seconds before turning on his heel and striding to the door. Kyle called after him. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my office. I wish to be alone tonight.\u201d He slammed the door behind him with only one more scornful backward glance. Kyle walked over and tried the door. It was locked.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d he whispered and went back across the room to fall on the bed. \u201cStubborn, unmitigated asshole.\u201d He stared up at the ceiling and tried his best to calm down. It was going to be a long night.</p><p>Three long, mind-numbing days passed before Kyle even saw Taz again. He spent those days locked in the bedroom, with his meals delivered to him. It wasn\u2019t exactly uncomfortable\u2014he had full access to the bathing chamber and bathroom, and of course, the room was luxurious. But with no books, no vids, nothing to do except study those damn Tygerian language books, Kyle was going stir-crazy.</p> <p>For spite, he refused to even look at the language books, and instead tore the pages out and used a pen to make a deck of playing cards. He\u2019d learned about playing cards when years before he had seen an Earthan bounty playing a game he called Solitaire for hours on end. To pass the time on the long voyage to deliver him to prison, he\u2019d asked the prisoner to show him the game. He even sent away for his own decks of cards. It had come in handy many times since then to pass the time on long, lonely voyages through space.</p><p>He knew Taz was staying away from him on purpose, probably because he was angry, but he also knew that he was probably suffering as much if not more than Kyle. After all, since he\u2019d brought Kyle home, he\u2019d wanted to make love every night, sometimes for hours at a time. So Kyle was determined not to be the first one to cave in and beg him to come back.</p><p>It was on the morning of the fourth day that the door opened to admit Taz, who walked in and sat down at the table as if it had only been a few hours instead of a few days since they\u2019d seen each other.</p><p>Kyle, seated on the bed with his makeshift cards spread out between his legs, never even looked up. He wouldn\u2019t give Taz the satisfaction.</p><p>Taz cleared his throat. \u201cIgnoring me, Nobyo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know. It\u2019s what you\u2019re good at.\u201d</p><p>A long silence passed as he watched Kyle with a moody expression on his face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying solitaire. I thought it was appropriate\u2014me being in solitary confinement and all.\u201d</p><p>Kyle got a sharp look for that remark, but he continued to play, his body very aware of Taz\u2019s presence in the room. He fervently hoped Taz was suffering too. A surreptitious glance at the way his pants were bulging at the sight of the nearly naked Kyle with his legs spread out on the bed told him he was.</p><p>\u201cIs that paper you\u2019ve torn from the books I gave you? Your language books?\u201d Taz\u2019s voice had risen in outrage with every word.</p><p>Kyle continued his slow shuffling through the deck. \u201cWhy, yes, it is. Thought I could put them to some good use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how expensive and hard to obtain those books were? They\u2019re very old\u2014some of them date back to the time when the Alliance actually had an embassy on Tygeria. Over one hundred cycles ago!\u201d</p><p>Kyle lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cAll right. They were just old used books, then.\u201d</p><p>Taz glared at him. \u201cDo you want me to beat you, Nobyo? Is that what this is all about?\u201d Taz took a menacing few steps toward him. Kyle put the little stack of papers down on the mattress and gazed back at him, keeping his face as blank as possible.</p><p>\u201cYou can try.\u201d He scooted to the edge of the bed and stood to face Taz. \u201cGo ahead. Give it your best shot. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Taz seemed to be barely able to control himself. Furiously, he turned his back on Kyle and strode back to the door. \u201cThree hours,\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cIn three hours we\u2019ll go to the arena to spar and settle this once and for all. I\u2019m granting you your wish, Nobyo. You can face me in the ring and prove to me just how strong you are. But if you lose...\u201d He turned and pointed a finger at him. \u201cBe prepared to become my nobyo in more than just name. You\u2019ll submit to me and show me the proper respect from now on, or I\u2019ll beat you every day.\u201d</p><p>He stormed through the door and banged it behind him, leaving Kyle a little stunned. Submit to him. Was he really ready to do that? His legs suddenly shaky, Kyle sat back down on the edge of the bed. This had seemed almost like a game for the past few days, and now it was all too real. He\u2019d made the wager and would have to live with it. The words Blayde had spoken to him what seemed like so long ago came back to him. They call their love slaves their nobyos. They keep them very submissive...</p><p>He remembered how horrified yet amused he\u2019d felt, thinking about the poor bastards who became the Tygerian love slaves. That seemed like a long time ago now. For the first time in days, he tried to shift and found that his incisors dropped down and he bulked up a little, but the shift still wouldn\u2019t fully come. They were still drugging him some then\u2014probably in his food. Still, even if he shifted, would he be able to fight what was happening to him? He couldn\u2019t harm his mate, plain and simple. He wouldn\u2019t harm him, ever. That only left submission.</p><p>The way out of this was clear, if unlikely. He had to win the fight. He paced a little by the bed, trying to remember everything he knew about the Exhibition Games in the arena.</p><p>He\u2019d seen an old vid once, the film grainy in black and white. The Tygerians were using old style video camera technology at the time, probably seventy or eighty cycles before, and had filmed one of the Exhibition Games to broadcast to their people. The Alliance had been sent a copy to taunt and humiliate them, since some of their captured prisoners were on the film.</p><p>Some fifteen or twenty survivors, crewmen and soldiers from a downed Alliance ship circled a huge, dusty ring, as a Tygerian crowd jeered and threw things at them from the stands. The prisoners wore loincloths, and looked completely worn out, their bruised and battered bodies showing the results of their ill treatment up to this point.</p><p>A loud horn sounded and the gladiators, young Tygerian warriors, emerged from behind gates on all sides of the arena. They towered over the prisoners, wearing animal skin leggings and vests over their naked chests. Each of them carried what looked like chains and maces. A mace, Kyle had since learned, was a type of club with a metal or stone end used to smash in body armor. He could only imagine the kind of damage a weapon like that could do to flesh.</p><p>The young warriors played to the crowd, mocking and toying with the prisoners as they dispatched them one by one. It was a cruel and vicious display, and only three of the Alliance prisoners were spared at the end, not because they\u2019d won, but because the crowd thought they\u2019d fought bravely and spared their lives to fight again.</p><p>The Exhibitions were fought at night, and this was not such a trial by fire. This was more of a friendly game, wasn\u2019t it? Taz had mentioned a sparring session, so there\u2019d be no jeering crowd of spectators watching them. Kyle didn\u2019t delude himself that he could win this thing easily. Taz would be a formidable opponent. As for Kyle, he would be waging an entirely different kind of attack than Taz\u2019s, because he would have to be careful not to harm his mate. He wasn\u2019t so sure if Taz would be quite as careful. He\u2019d want to humiliate Kyle and teach him a lesson.</p><p>Kyle knew he didn\u2019t have the physical prowess to win a fight between them on strength alone. Taz had big advantages of height and weight on him, not to mention the fact he hadn\u2019t gone through the ordeal Kyle had experienced in Tarr\u2019s cage, half-starved and drugged out of his mind. He\u2019d only begun to recover his strength from it.</p><p>He thought, though, that he just might have the advantage of speed, coupled with some training in hand to hand combat. If he could gain even a slight advantage, he could count on Taz\u2019s unwillingness to badly hurt him to help him succeed. All he would need was a little luck, and he might be able to gain the upper hand long enough to make Taz lose the wager. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Taz attacked him with everything he had, there was no way for Kyle to win. There was also no way he\u2019d ever seriously harm his mate, no matter the provocation, so he sent up a few silent prayers to his gods and sat down to prepare himself mentally for what was to come. If he could win this thing, he\u2019d become more of an equal partner in their relationship and he\u2019d be able to at least talk to his family and try to make them understand. The stakes, then, were high for Kyle.</p><p>A few hours later, he was waiting quietly for Taz to come for him. The door opened and Taz came in, dressed much like the warriors in the old vid Kyle had watched, with leggings, loin cloth, and a vest. He threw a loin cloth and leggings to Kyle. \u201cPut these on,\u201d he said tersely. \u201cI have a transport waiting for us outside.\u201d</p><p>Kyle pulled on the clothing and tied the cloth around his waist. He\u2019d seen the almost predatory look on Taz\u2019s face as he\u2019d pulled off the thong-like covering, exposing his groin, and it warmed him. Taz\u2019s gaze never left Kyle as he got ready.</p> <p>He walked past Taz, unable to resist giving his hips an extra twist and out into the corridor. From there he could see the light from the twin suns of Tygeria streaming brightly through the glass door, his first real glimpse of sunlight in days. His window in Taz\u2019s room was heavily shaded by the dense grove of trees growing just outside, even if he\u2019d felt like climbing up on a chair to look out it.</p><p>It seemed strange to travel through the streets of the bustling city after being cooped up inside Taz\u2019s home for so long. He glanced over at Taz, who was staring straight ahead, expressionless. Neither of them said a word to each other, and Kyle wondered if he really would be able to defeat him. If not, the ride back home might be entirely different. It made his pulse race faster to think about becoming Taz\u2019s submissive nobyo. Could he do it? He\u2019d given his word he would.</p><p>Taz glanced over at him. \u201cYou know I won\u2019t be easy on you, just because you\u2019re my nobyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kyle said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to be.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to want to say more, but turned his head back to stare straight ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to back out. We don\u2019t have to do this. You can stop all your foolishness and apologize.\u201d</p> <p>Kyle looked at him sharply before turning his head to stare out the window. Was he having second thoughts about fighting him? He knew he\u2019d been a disappointment to Taz in a lot of ways, and he wanted to please his mate, but Taz had to listen to him. He had to realize the real danger his attitude was putting them in. No matter that the planet of Tygeria was like an impenetrable fortress. His family would find a way to get to him\u2014Kyle had no doubts about that. It terrified him to think that Taz might get caught in the crossfire when that happened, or that some of his well-loved family members might be injured, all because of Taz\u2019s stubborn refusal to allow him to talk to them.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I want this. I have to have the chance to speak to my family.\u201d</p><p>Taz couldn\u2019t resist a huff of breath. \u201cI\u2019m your family.\u201d</p><p>The transport arrived at the arena, and they disembarked. Kyle followed Taz into the building, walking through cavernous halls to get to the dressing rooms, where several Tygerians were in various stages of undress. Several of them gave Kyle a long, slow look, before glancing up at Taz. He glared back at them until they turned around, and then he unlocked and slammed open a large bin containing his weapons. He jerked out a mace, along with a long length of chain.</p><p>Kyle was surprised when he turned and held them out to him. He held his hands up in front of him. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want those. What would I do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefend yourself,\u201d Taz growled at him.</p> <p>Kyle refused to be intimidated and shook his head. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t use those.\u201d</p><p>Taz looked at him, nodded and put them back in the bin. \u201cBare hands, then.\u201d He motioned toward the arena and Kyle turned to the door, with Taz right behind him. As they exited a side door, a large, sweaty young man came in and stood aside to let them pass. Kyle nodded at him and he smiled suggestively, practically leering at Kyle. The young man teasingly raised Kyle\u2019s loin cloth to pinch his ass as he passed him. Kyle whirled to face him, but before he could make a move, Taz had the man by the throat, pressed up against the wooden door.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you lay a hand on my nobyo? I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t know! I thought he was a prisoner!\u201d The young Tygerian stammered out an apology but Taz was in no mood to listen. The young man\u2019s feet weren\u2019t even touching the floor and he was gasping for breath as Taz held him effortlessly up in the air with one hand. Before Taz could do him any further damage, some of the young man\u2019s friends rushed over to help him and calm Taz down. They looked at Kyle curiously, speaking rapidly in Tygerian. Because of his truly limited efforts with the language books, Kyle couldn\u2019t understand a word.</p><p>Kyle had taken a few steps back from the altercation, amazed at Taz\u2019s show of strength. He realized again how little chance he really stood against his mate and wondered if he should save himself the bother and the bruises and just concede now before this went any further.</p><p>After a few minutes of furious shouting back and forth, Taz pulled himself away from the group of young men and stormed over to where Kyle was standing, taking him by the arm and practically dragging him outside. His grip tight on Kyle\u2019s upper arm, he jerked him forward to the arena, and once there he pulled Kyle around to face him. \u201cMust you always flaunt yourself like that in front of every man you see?\u201d</p><p>Kyle\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I wasn\u2019t flaunting anything and I never said a word to that guy! Can I help it if all you people are sex-crazed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you smile at him. Once you lose this challenge, I might take you home and lock you up until you\u2019re too old to attract anyone!\u201d He whirled him back around and gave him a two sharp smacks on his ass.</p> <p>Shocked, Kyle fell away from him and looked up at him in outrage. \u201cDid you just spank my ass?\u201d</p><p>Furious, Taz yelled back at him. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing compared to what I\u2019ll do when I get you home.\u201d</p><p>Leaping forward, Kyle jumped on Taz, bearing him down to the ground. He tried to pin his hands by his head, but Taz quickly recovered and jerked out of his grasp, bucking him off and rolling to his side and back up to his feet. Taz\u2019s entire body language changed as if someone had flipped a switch inside him. He tensed his muscles and a feral gleam came to his eyes. He loomed over Kyle, who was still lying on the ground at his feet and snarled with menace.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d he said, but barely gave Kyle a chance to scramble to his feet before he was on him, his volatile temper snapping, he caught Kyle on the chin with a quick left hook. Kyle staggered back, stunned, and Taz came at him again, but this time when he swung, Kyle swung with him and managed to deflect the blow a little, catching some of it on his shoulder. He awkwardly jabbed his elbow into Taz\u2019s midsection and both of them grunted in pain.</p><p>They each fell back a little, and Taz began to circle. Kyle still hadn\u2019t had a chance to fully recover from the two stunning blows when Taz charged him again, bending at the waist and plowing into Kyle before he could dance out of his way. It knocked the breath clean out of him and he hit the ground hard, pain slicing through his shoulder where he landed. Instinctively, he rolled and felt Taz land next to him on the ground. He knew he\u2019d had a narrow escape. If Taz had landed on him, this thing would have been over almost before it started. Kyle would have been pinned under his weight and would have had no choice but to surrender.</p><p>Kyle jumped back up to his feet and kicked at Taz\u2019s hip, but Taz turned and caught his foot in his hands, twisting it and bringing Kyle crashing back down to the ground. He could feel the pain shooting through his back and knew he\u2019d have plenty of bruises to show for this tomorrow. He knew that he should give up now, but his pride wouldn\u2019t let him. If he gave up meekly, Taz would never have any respect for him. It already looked pretty certain he was going to wind up as Taz\u2019s bitch, but at least he could keep a little of his self-respect intact.</p><p>With no warning, Taz lunged for him again, and this time Kyle couldn\u2019t get out of the way quickly enough. He braced for Taz\u2019s weight to crash down on him, but at the last second, Taz caught him in his arms and rolled with him, keeping him on top so he wouldn\u2019t be crushed by his weight. Kyle knew he was going easy on him, trying not to hurt him too much, and the idea made him furious. Taz pushed Kyle\u2019s arms behind his back and held them there. \u201cDo you yield?\u201d he shouted at Kyle, but he stubbornly shook his head and snarled back at him.</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>With a loud snort, he released Kyle, pushing him to the side and allowing him to roll away as Taz got to his feet, not even out of breath. Kyle rushed toward him and latched onto his wrist, pulling his arm over his shoulder and then jamming his body into the larger man to launch him head over heels to the ground. Kyle was surprised to hear a smattering of applause. He spared a quick glance to the stands and saw a few of the warriors who\u2019d been sparring alongside of them stopping now to watch.</p><p>Taz actually laughed, letting out a huge whoosh of air before springing back up to his feet. He smiled at Kyle in surprise and almost pleasure, and Kyle realized he was enjoying this.</p><p>Kyle, however, was getting tired. Throwing Taz\u2019s big body over his shoulder had taken up some of his last reserves and when Taz leaped at him, he was barely able to dodge out of the way in time. Taz landed behind him rolling to miss the brunt of the kick Kyle aimed at his ribs. Kyle\u2019s mouth opened in surprise as Taz twisted and grabbed both of Kyle\u2019s ankles, giving them a tug, and spilling Kyle onto the ground. He sat down hard on his ass, biting his tongue and feeling pain shooting up into his lower back. Damn, Taz was going to kill him if this went on much longer.</p><p>Taz stood a few feet away, motioning at him to get back up. Kyle got the strong impression he was only toying with him and could end this whenever he wanted. Wearily Kyle got back up to his feet again, raising his fists as he did. He refused to back down. If Taz wanted to end this, he\u2019d have to do it himself. He lunged forward, striking out with his right fist and hitting Taz in the jaw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again, the applause started up, and Kyle lost his focus just long enough to stagger back as Taz came at him with blinding speed and a hard fist to his stomach, doubling him over. A quick uppercut to the nose, and Kyle was lying on his back again, looking up. The back of his head had cracked the ground a little when he fell, so he was seeing a few stars along with the clouds in the sky. He felt blood trickling down the back of his throat and out of his nose. He wiped at his nose absently with the back of his hand. Maybe the worst thing was that Kyle knew Taz had been pulling his punches.</p><p>Taz loomed over him again. \u201cStay down!\u201d he shouted, but Kyle was already dragging himself back up and trying to steady himself. His knuckles were skinned, his back was in agony, his whole face hurt and his head felt like someone was on the inside trying to hammer their way out. If Taz came at him now, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to get out of his way. He stood swaying on his feet, blood dripping from his nose. Taz stepped up to him and grabbed two handfuls of his vest, pulling Kyle toward him and up onto his toes.</p><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d he asked harshly and Kyle doggedly shook his head. Taz made a sound of impatience and then kissed the shit out of him, sliding his tongue inside his mouth and sweeping it around before pulling away with a little bite to Kyle\u2019s lower lip. He shook Kyle a couple of times, so hard his head flopped backward on his neck. \u201cI said, are you done? Stop this\u2014you\u2019re hurt. Now answer me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d Kyle said this time, too wiped out to fight him any longer.</p><p>\u201cTell me that you yield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI yield,\u201d Kyle said, his eyes closed and slurring his words.</p><p>Taz nodded, hoisted him up to throw him over his shoulder and strode with him from the ring.</p><p>The five huge Lycan males made the room seem small as they crowded around Kai and Lucas\u2019s main living area. Kai, Lucas\u2019s mate, stood with his back against the counter in the adjoining kitchen. He could see the vid screen from where he was standing, but he\u2019d watched the slightly out of focus film several times now, and he had no wish to see it again. He kept his eyes on the floor as Lucas, his brother Blayde and the cousins watched the short vid that Lucas had received the evening before.</p> <p>The only sounds in the room were an occasional sympathetic or furious gasp as they watched the smaller figure, dressed, according to Lucas, in traditional Tygerian gladiator gear and being tossed around in some kind of arena setting.</p><p>His opponent was much taller and heavier, and it was hard to believe how often the smaller man that had to be Kyle kept getting back up after being slammed to the ground. Near the end of the short vid, when Kyle was viciously punched in his midsection, Nikolai, Kyle\u2019s brother jumped to his feet with a wordless cry. Lucas put a hand on his arm to pull him back down beside him, and the vid ended a few seconds later with the Tygerian male pulling Kai up by the front of his vest. His back was to the camera, but it looked like he was yelling in Kyle\u2019s face before throwing him over his shoulder and carrying him out of the ring.</p><p>As the vid ended, there was a short, heavy silence in the room. Then an alarming series of snarls and growls filled the room as at least three of them started shifting into their beasts. Konnor let out a string of Lycan curses and punched the wall near where he was standing with a huge, clawed hand, while Blayde cursed. Nikolai just seemed stunned after his earlier outburst, and Larsson hovered near the vid screen looking like he might be thinking of kicking it in.</p><p>\u201cOkay, everyone calm down a minute,\u201d Lucas said, pulling Larsson out of the way just before his big foot connected with the innocent screen. Kai straightened up uneasily. He was glad he\u2019s sent the baby over to Ryan\u2019s house before all this started. He\u2019d known they would be angry, but he\u2019d never seen them all so out of control. Even though it wasn\u2019t directed at him, it was a little frightening, and several of them had ripped right out of their clothes when they turned. Lucas glanced over at him and sent him a brief, reassuring nod before turning back to the others.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re all upset, but we have to try to assess this situation calmly or we\u2019ll do something rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalmly?\u201d Nikolai shouted, jumping to his feet to stand next to Larsson\u2019s looming beast. \u201cAfter watching that son-of-a-bitch almost kill my brother? How do you expect me to be calm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI watched the thing ten times at least last night, and it makes me sick, too, but that\u2019s not helping Kyle.\u201d</p><p>Blayde lowered his hands and spoke in a surprisingly quiet voice. \u201cLucas is right. He called me over last night to see it with him, and I lay awake half the night trying to figure out how we can get to him.\u201d</p><p>Larsson, the youngest of the cousins, spoke up angrily, though his body was beginning to resume its normal shape. \u201cWe just go in and get him, that\u2019s all. And kill any tiger asshole that tries to stop us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we can\u2019t do that,\u201d Lucas said, shaking his head. \u201cWe show up in Tygerian airspace, and they\u2019ll shoot us out of the sky before we have a chance to even negotiate. We can\u2019t sneak in either\u2014their planetary detection radar is too good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegotiate, hells!\u201d Larsson yelled. \u201cWe take him by force. Surely the Alliance will back us on this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for only one man,\u201d Lucas replied. \u201cThey\u2019ll include him in the list of prisoners they\u2019ve been negotiating for, but that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve already talked to them, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re on our own in this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been there before,\u201d Nikolai said. \u201cHow soon can we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what, Nikolai? Get ourselves captured too, or killed? We have to be smart about this. I\u2019ve given it a lot of thought, and there may be another way.\u201d</p> <p>Konnor had been quietly brooding on the side of the room since his outburst. Kai glanced over at the wall behind him now, wondering what Lucas was going to do to get that dent out. Maybe they could hang a picture over it? Konnor\u2019s shirt was hanging around his shoulders in tatters, but he was still the first to answer Lucas.</p><p>\u201cTell us what you have in mind, Lucas. We\u2019ll do anything to get him back home.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cOur contact on Tygeria, the one who sent us the vid he took on his communicator, says the Tygerian\u2019s name is Taz Bonnet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaz Bonnet?\u201d Blayde said in surprise. \u201cYou mean that\u2019s not Tarr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, even worse. It\u2019s his twin brother, and he\u2019s an important person on Tygeria. Some kind of senator, and we can\u2019t underestimate him. According to our source, he\u2019s not much like Tarr, except physically. The man\u2019s mate is expecting a child, so it\u2019s more than likely he bought Kyle as his...\u201d Lucas glanced up at Kai again, as if he gathered strength by looking at him. \u201cKyle is probably his love slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Konnor said softly. \u201cYou mean just like Nikolai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not like Nikolai at all. Nikolai was just playing around with Jagger, and it wasn\u2019t like Nikolai was being abused by his mate,\u201d Lucas said. Kai had to smother an inappropriate smile at the idea of the huge, muscular Nikolai being abused by Jagger, who, though fierce and exotically handsome, was the smallest of any of the mates, barely coming up to his own shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas continued. \u201cKyle is being physically abused as we can see on this vid. He\u2019s probably being raped, beaten and forced to be this Tygerian\u2019s slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he shift? And why was he fighting in gladiator gear? This doesn\u2019t look like an Exhibition.\u201d Nikolai had started the vid again, and everyone was watching it intently.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas replied. \u201cThey must be giving him drugs to prevent the shift. And according to our source, they were sparring in the ring\u2014practicing, I guess. Taz Bonnet participates in the Exhibition Games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not enough to drug him and abuse him at home,\u201d Nikolai said bitterly. \u201cHe also has to take him to the arena and beat him up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back to what you were saying, Lucas,\u201d Konnor said, breaking in. \u201cTell us your plan.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cThis man who has Kyle is Tarr Bonnet\u2019s brother. Tarr makes frequent trips off planet to trade in love slaves, along with the Rogers. I think we have to go back to Blayde\u2019s original plan\u2014we have to take Tarr into custody. Once we have him, we can use him as a bargaining tool. We can offer his brother a trade\u2014Kyle for Tarr.\u201d</p><p>A short silence fell over the room and then Blayde cleared his throat. \u201cI think that will work. They\u2019re known to be very close.\u201d He glanced over at Nikolai. \u201cLike most twins.\u201d</p><p>Nikolai and Kyle were twins, and though not identical, their connection was strong. Nikolai dropped his head in his hands, unable to watch the vid any longer. \u201cThe only problem is how to take him,\u201d Blayde continued. \u201cHe hangs out a lot at his club on Leeria, so if we could find a way to stake it out\u2014we could wait for him and then move in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll attract too much attention to go in where we can be seen. The Leerian officials were furious with him when he took Kyle and now Leeria\u2019s lost all their Alliance trade agreements. I think if we made them certain promises, they\u2019d cooperate with us. They might even arrest him themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one problem,\u201d Blayde said, laying a hand on Nikolai\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be patient for that to work. Tarr\u2019s smart and he knows the Leerians aren\u2019t happy with him. It may be a quarter cycle or more before he lands on Leeria again.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head. \u201cToo long. Kyle could be dead if we wait much longer.\u201d</p><p>Larsson made a growling sound. \u201cWho knows what kind of abuse that bastard is subjecting him to?\u201d</p><p>Silence fell over the room again, as each man became lost in dark, violent thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThen we find him, wherever he might be in the galaxies. We\u2019re not without resources of our own, and we have many friends and customers who trade with us. We\u2019ll put out the word that we want Tarr Bonnet taken alive and offer a reward.\u201d Lucas looked around at each of the cousins in turn. \u201cI, for one, won\u2019t rest until we find him.\u201d Angry sounds of agreement and support echoed loudly in the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kai sighed and turned around to make a pot of the hot Lycan tea Lucas liked so much. Poor Kyle\u2014he was the sweetest of all the cousins and always seemed to have a smile on his face. Kai felt a pang like a real physical discomfort as he imagined the tortures Kyle must be going through, even as they sat here discussing him. He sent up a quick prayer to whatever gods might be listening to spare Kyle any further pain.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Kyle shifted uneasily, trying to get comfortable, as he lay naked on his stomach, sinking down in the big feather pillows on the bed. It had been two days since their fight in the arena and Taz still had to help him walk from the bathing chamber to the bedroom.</p><p>Taz was rubbing more medicine on the bruises on his back. \u201cStubborn, willful, hardheaded.\u201d Taz punctuated each harsh word with a kiss to his shoulder, as he massaged Kyle\u2019s upper back.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you defy me so? And why did you fight me so long in the arena if you were being hurt? Were you showing off to that bunch of idiots watching us? They were looking more at your ass than at how well you fought, you know.\u201d He moved his hand down to caress the ass in question. \u201cYou were fighting me so hard I thought you were enjoying yourself. I had no idea you Lycans bruised so easily. It wasn\u2019t until I saw the blood that I knew you were really hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruise easily?\u201d Kyle grumbled, looking at him over his shoulder. \u201cYou almost killed me in that ring.\u201d</p><p>Taz rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d hit my baby cousins harder than I hit you if I faced them in the ring. In the future I\u2019ll remember how delicate Lycans are. But I hope you got that all out of your system, Nobyo, because that will never happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the gods,\u201d Kyle muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I hope you got some of the defiance out of your system too. The more you fight me, the more resistant I think you become. It takes us farther apart, and I don\u2019t like it. No more, Nobyo. From now on, you must assume your proper role. You\u2019re not my sparring partner, and I didn\u2019t bring you home to fight and argue with me all the time. We Tygerians hold our nobyos in high esteem, and we take great care in choosing them. The first time I saw you I made a quick decision that I had to have you, and I don\u2019t regret it. But I want a willing partner\u2014a true lover. Our mating bond must be forged more completely.\u201d</p><p>Kyle turned and sat up, gazing at him defiantly. \u201cHow? By locking me up until I\u2019m too old to attract other men\u2019s attention, like you threatened in the arena? Or maybe you can just beat me into submission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made a wager, Nobyo. I would have hoped you\u2019d honor it,\u201d Taz said quietly.</p><p>Kyle blushed, but stiffened defiantly. \u201cI want to be your mate, an equal partner. I can play the game in front of the Tygerians, if you need that, if your laws require it, but I can\u2019t be what you want me to be. No more than you could if the situation were reversed.\u201d</p><p>Taz was silent for a long moment and then his voice hardened. \u201cDo you forget that you made a promise?\u201d</p><p>When Kyle remained silent, staring back at him, his lips pressed tightly together, Taz shook his head. Kyle felt a momentary pang at the look in his eyes. He looked a little hurt. Kyle was drawn to Taz as his mate and always would be, but he was struggling. He\u2019d made a vow to himself that he would keep his pride intact and never let his family down. How could he debase himself in their eyes by kneeling to anyone\u2014even to his own mate? He didn\u2019t think he could do this.</p><p>\u201cFuck this, Taz. No! I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your Lycan honor so weak that you can break your word so easily? You promised me that you\u2019d submit and take your place as my nobyo.\u201d</p><p>Kyle shook his head wordlessly and turned away. He\u2019d been furious since they got home from the arena, both for losing the damn fight and for underestimating just how strong these tiger shifters were. He\u2019d relied all his life on his own size and brute strength, and for the first time both of them had been irrelevant. Up until that day in the ring, he\u2019d figured Taz was a little stronger, but he actually thought he could hold his own.</p><p>Now it was painfully clear to both of them that his strength was puny in comparison and Kyle wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about that. Actually he was sure\u2014he hated it and resented Taz for it. He hated himself even more for making the damn bet. He remembered all too well what he\u2019d said. Bet me that if you win, I\u2019ll become your loyal little nobyo. Did his word have any value? He knew he was going to have to submit to this thing, and he resented Taz for making him do it.</p><p>Was this how Ivan felt so long ago when Kyle\u2019s grandfather captured him and made him his love slave? The legends said he\u2019d been so attracted, almost against his will that he was incapable of harming Gunnar, even though his powers were strong enough to do real damage. Gunnar had made him suffer, but he couldn\u2019t stop loving him. Instead, he\u2019d cursed all his descendants, partly the reason Kyle was in his present predicament.</p><p>Kyle raised his chin and gazed into Taz\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not breaking my word\u2014I\u2019ll be your nobyo. But don\u2019t make me hate you, Taz. I don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate me?\u201d Taz\u2019s face flamed and he got up angrily and paced the room. He looked furious, and it was obvious that he was giving himself a little time to calm down before he spoke to Kyle again. Finally, he turned and faced the bed. He was still naked from his bath earlier and almost took Kyle\u2019s breath away. Suddenly, Kyle was so tired from the fighting and tension of the past few days he thought he might be able to sleep for a week if Taz would just lie down beside him and let all this go. He wanted to curl up around his mate and rest in his arms and be soothed by his presence. Instead he could feel the gulf between them widening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you the offer again, Nobyo,\u201d Taz said, his voice dead and cold. \u201cAnd this is the last time I ever will. If you\u2019re so unhappy, then I\u2019ll release you. I\u2019ll find a way to send you home to your precious family.\u201d When Kyle started to speak, he held up a warning hand. \u201cBut if you decide to stay, then all this foolish, stubborn pride of yours is finished. It has no place between us and keeps us apart. Make your decision. Either stay with me as my nobyo, or go back to the Lycans.\u201d</p> <p>Kyle dropped his face in his hands. How could he leave him? He needed him now like he needed to breathe. They hadn\u2019t completed their mating in the true Lycan sense\u2014Kyle had never given him the mating bite, never topped him. Yet the bond was strong between them. He might be able to survive without his mate, but did he want to? Kyle had no more strength to fight. If his family thought less of him for it, then so be it. The need he felt for Taz was even stronger than the love he had for his family.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay with you,\u201d he said quietly, dropping his head. He was aware of Taz stepping closer to the bed and felt his hand on the back of his neck, stroking it gently.</p><p>\u201cThen rest, darling. We\u2019ll speak no more of this.\u201d</p><p>Kyle leaned into him, drawing strength from his nearness. He thought it might still make him feel ashamed to want to be with Taz instead of going back home, but all his surrender had brought him was a profound sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to rest,\u201d he replied, his breath hitching in his throat. \u201cMake love to me. Remind me why I need to do this. Show me.\u201d</p><p>Taz groaned and pushed Kyle to his back, following him down. His hands traveled over Kyle\u2019s body, and his cock grazed Kyle\u2019s stomach, making him gasp and roll his hips toward the touch. Taz answered with a slow grind of his own and bent to kiss and lick at Kyle\u2019s nipples, teasing the pink nubs with his lips and teeth so he could suck them. Kyle moved mindlessly under him, feeling the teasing in his groin, as if there were an invisible string directly attached.</p><p>He moved restlessly under his mate, needing him to touch his dick, trying to make him move more quickly and get to the main event. \u201cWhat is it you want, nobyo? Are you so eager?\u201d</p><p>Taz had raised himself on his arms and was smiling down at Kyle. \u201cIs this what you need?\u201d He bent to drag a hot tongue slowly up the length of Kyle\u2019s shaft. His tongue was long and slightly rougher than a Lycan\u2019s. The sensation against the smooth skin of Kyle\u2019s cock was making him crazy. He ended with a rough swirl over the head and lifted his head to smile down at him. \u201cOr perhaps this?\u201d</p><p>He put both hands under Kyle\u2019s hips and raised him off the bed a little. Then he bent between his legs and licked up Kyle\u2019s crease to find his hole. Kyle screamed Taz\u2019s name as he rimmed him with that rough, hot tongue. Kyle tightened his legs around his head, unable to stand so much sensation and pleasure. He bucked his body almost involuntarily, but Taz only chuckled and held onto him, making it clear Kyle wasn\u2019t in charge of any of this. When Kyle finally surrendered to it and let the orgasm overtake him, he thought he might be dying. He felt the hot cum spurting up on his stomach\u2014he\u2019d never had an orgasm without direct stimulation before, and this one had left his body limp and lifeless.</p><p>Taz raised his head to gaze at him. \u201cThis is mine, Nobyo. I\u2019ll never give you up now. Mine forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kyle breathed out softly, the word only a soft hiss.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep, baby. I\u2019m not through with you yet.\u201d</p><p>Kyle felt Taz push back his legs and then felt his huge cock bury itself inside him. Wearily he opened his eyes as Taz began to push into him. Kyle\u2019s body began to rock a little with the force of his thrusts. Then he changed his angle a bit and was landing each thrust on the spot inside Kyle that always made him lose control. Steadily, relentlessly, he hit the sensitive bundle of nerves until Kyle was moaning continuously. Taz was claiming him, marking his territory, leaving Kyle with no doubt as to whom he belonged.</p><p>After only a few minutes, he reached his climax and filled Kyle with his cum. Kyle could feel it inside him, the hotness seeming to fill him and bathe every inch of him inside. Unwilling to move, Taz collapsed down between his legs and pressed his lips to Kyle\u2019s chest. He lay there for a long time, softening inside him, before he finally rolled to the side. Kyle could feel his cum dripping from him, but Taz wouldn\u2019t let him get up. He threw one big leg over him and pulled him up close. \u201cMine,\u201d he said, satisfaction coloring his voice. \u201cNo more defiance, yes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kyle agreed softly. \u201cNo more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more, Taz-lan,\u201d Taz reminded sleepily.</p><p>\u201cNo more, Taz-lan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a spanking in the morning for forgetting to show me proper respect. I\u2019m too tired right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Instantly awake, Kyle struggled to sit up and stare down at an almost asleep Taz.</p><p>He opened one eye and chuckled, pulling him back down beside him. \u201cJust a little one, baby. I\u2019m a kind master. You\u2019ll see.\u201d He leaned over and kissed Kyle on the lips, nuzzling his nose against his face.</p><p>His nobyo had slept badly. For an hour or so after they went to bed, he\u2019d tossed and turned restlessly, and Taz thought it might be the stickiness of his skin. He got out of bed and obtained a warm cloth, coming back to tenderly wash the dried cum from his nobyo\u2019s stomach and the backs of his legs. The entire time he cared for his nobyo, he\u2019d looked steadily up at him with those beautiful, strange eyes.</p><p>When Taz got back in bed, he\u2019d scooted his ass up to him and sighed like a tired child, but he\u2019d still been uneasy the rest of the night, having bad dreams, from the way he squirmed and reached back for Taz. Taz held him tightly in his arms the rest of the night.</p> <p>Taz wondered if he was worried about the spanking he\u2019d promised him and smiled to himself. He\u2019d been mostly teasing the night before, but the more he thought about it, the harder his dick became. Not because he had any desire to humiliate or hurt him, but because he thought it might add spice to the sex that already far exceeded any of his expectations.</p><p>His poor nobyo was so confused, and it hurt Taz to watch his struggles. His nobyo still thought submission was a sign of weakness, and he longed to show him it was more a sign of deep trust. If his nobyo could only learn to trust him with everything\u2014his fears, his embarrassment, his doubts\u2014then they could begin to build their future. He only wanted to care for his nobyo and give him a perfect life.</p><p>Taz knew the main obstacle was that he worried too much about what his Lycan family might think of him, instead of just relaxing and letting things happen. He\u2019d been aware from the beginning that his nobyo wasn\u2019t a true alpha. He\u2019d met these Lycan alphas when he was held in their prisons. Many of them had been his guards, and they were an arrogant, domineering bunch. Not so with his nobyo, who was gentler and much more reasonable. He was strong and brave too, and would make an excellent life partner. If only Taz could kick the other alphas in the family out of their bedroom. He decided there was no time like the present to start that process.</p><p>\u201cWake up, sweet one.\u201d He bent over his face and kissed his cheek. \u201cTime to wake up. Shall we have your punishment before breakfast and get it out of the way?\u201d</p><p>His nobyo widened his eyes and stared up at him. \u201cMy-my...punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, darling.\u201d Taz stretched and scooted up so that his back was against the massive headboard of his bed. He made himself comfortable by pulling the pillows behind his back, then patted his lap. \u201cCome here, Nobyo.\u201d</p> <p>He saw his lover take a long look at the door, wondering perhaps if he could make it. His face was so expressive that he clearly saw the realization that even if he did, he\u2019d only be brought back. He crawled slowly toward Taz and knelt beside him, looking down at his lap. \u201cIs this really necessary? Can\u2019t I just stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. This will be much more comfortable for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, maybe.\u201d He cut his eyes up resentfully and then sighed. \u201cSorry, Taz-lan. Just-just give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d he said, smiling. Taz reached for him and hauled him over his lap so that he was lying face down. His naked cock lay against Taz\u2019s thighs, and he was glad that it was not entirely soft at all. He reached beneath him and rubbed a thumb over the head. Pre-cum had begun to dampen it, and his nobyo moved restlessly. He got up on his elbows, but Taz pushed him back down.</p><p>\u201cNo, lie still.\u201d He smoothed his hand down his ass slowly and trailed a finger down his crease.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me why this is necessary, darling?\u201d</p><p>His nobyo shook his head. \u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><p>Taz gave him a little smack to the roundest part of his ass. It couldn\u2019t have hurt, and Taz smiled to see him jump. \u201cOkay, okay. I guess something about me not showing proper respect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Taz asked, stroking his ass.</p><p>His nobyo gave a resigned sigh. \u201cYou want me to do it. To say Taz-lan when I talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it means...\u201d He made a little choking sound on the word. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that I\u2019m your master, sweet one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...yeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>Another smack. His nobyo rose partially up, only to be pushed back down. \u201cStay still.\u201d Taz spread his legs so his nobyo\u2019s cock fell down between his thighs and then clamped his thighs together, drawing forth a huge intake of breath from his nobyo.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I said yes, damn it\u2014I mean, Taz-lan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm...I didn\u2019t believe you. It was in your tone. Very unconvincing.\u201d</p><p>His nobyo blew out a frustrated breath and Taz smiled. It was fun teasing him like this. He stroked up and down his lover\u2019s ass for a long time, enjoying the feel of his skin. He found his puckered hole, wet a finger and began to draw little circles around it.</p><p>His nobyo groaned and banged his head against the soft pillows of the bed. \u201cHells, Taz-lan. Just get on with it.\u201d</p><p>Taz gave him another slap, enjoying the sight of his pink hand prints on the smooth, white skin. \u201cI\u2019ll decide when to get on with it, as you say. I assure you, I\u2019m in no rush at all. Are you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Smack! \u201cDo you really wish to be so impertinent considering your position across my lap? It\u2019s not your business what I think. Answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, Taz-lan. Damn it!\u201d</p><p>Another slap landed on his cheeks, accompanied by Taz\u2019s sigh. \u201cBaby, why do you make me hurt you? No cursing. I think I\u2019ll make that a rule for you, because you really do use shockingly bad language. Not a good example for our little one when he comes.\u201d</p><p>Taz caressed his nobyo\u2019s ass with one hand while he slipped the finger in and reached up to find the little place inside his nobyo that made him so excited whenever he touched it. As he swept his finger over it, his nobyo\u2019s hips rose and then slammed back down, apparently enjoying the friction of Taz\u2019s thighs on his cock. He was breathing hard, and Taz allowed him to fuck himself for a few seconds before pushing his hips back down.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is supposed to teach you a lesson, Nobyo. I think you\u2019re enjoying it too much.\u201d</p><p>His nobyo turned a shocked gaze up to him over his shoulder. \u201cI am not!\u201d His face, however, turned an interesting shade of pink.</p><p>\u201cOne or two more then, and we can go have first-meal. Unless, of course, you are enjoying it and wish to stay in bed with me for a while longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your hard cock between my legs means what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust please get on with this, Taz-lan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you might be able to come just from a spanking, darling?\u201d He slipped another finger inside, crooked them both up and gave his spot inside a wickedly hard rub while he slapped his ass a little harder with the other hand.</p><p>His nobyo surged down with his hips to get away from the mixture of pleasure and pain, and Taz tightened the muscles of his thighs to give him maximum stimulation. He rose back up with a little gasp to meet another smack and another internal rubdown, and that did it. With a shudder, his nobyo climaxed long and hard, shooting his cum between Taz\u2019s thighs before collapsing back down, breathing hard and groaning.</p><p>\u201cGods, I hate you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A little silence, then, \u201cNo...I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Taz pulled him up sharply, surprising a little noise out of him. He positioned him so that he was facing him, with his legs on either side of Taz\u2019s body. He settled him right on top of his own aching cock and pushed him down firmly on top of it, eliciting another sharp intake of breath.</p><p>His cheek pressing against his nobyo\u2019s, Taz turned his head so that he brushed their lips together. \u201cI think our first-meal will have to wait after all, baby,\u201d he said, and began to thrust his hips.</p><p>The servants fiddled with the camera equipment as Kyle waited impatiently for them to set it up and start filming. This wasn\u2019t at all what he\u2019d envisioned a few days before when Taz told him he could finally contact his family back on Lycanus, but he would take what he could get. Taz would film his message and send it electronically to Lycanus 3 through government channels.</p><p>Since Tygeria was at war with the Alliance, no direct channel could be opened to them by law. Taz said some people still managed to download vids or contact relatives on other Alliance held planets through illegal channels, but as a representative of the Tygerian Senate, he had to set a proper example.</p><p>A couple of days before, Taz had surprised him with this gift as they lay in bed together.</p><p>Kyle had just awakened and was stretching his arms over his head when he winced from an old bruise he\u2019d received in the arena when he sparred with Taz.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Nobyo?\u201d Taz leaned up and solicitously and put a hand on Kyle\u2019s hip.</p><p>Kyle smiled down at him. \u201cNothing really. Just some sore muscles still from that beat-down you gave me in the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I really thought you were only playing around at first. When I saw the blood, I stopped at once.\u201d</p><p>Kyle sighed and lay back down to snuggle into him. \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault. I probably never should have challenged you, and I should have quit sooner. I just wanted you to respect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do respect you, darling. You were very courageous to fight me, and everyone remarked on how lucky I was to have such a brave, handsome nobyo. I had three offers for you before we got back home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood ones, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when do I leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d Taz tightened his arms around Kyle, and he was careful not to touch any of the bruises on Kyle\u2019s back. \u201cI told them you weren\u2019t for sale at any price.\u201d Kyle smiled until Taz\u2019s next remark. \u201cEven though you are too much trouble.\u201d He smiled down at Kyle\u2019s frown. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to let you contact your family,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? But I lost the bet. I thought you said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I said a lot of things because I was angry. But I don\u2019t want you to be unhappy. If contacting your family means so much to you, then it\u2019s a small enough thing to do for you. I\u2019d planned to let you speak to them anyway at some point, but I wanted you to settle in first, and begin to think of me as your family.\u201d</p><p>Kyle swung his leg over Taz\u2019s hips to get in close and grind his cock against Taz\u2019s. \u201cI do think of you as my family. You\u2019re my mate, and the closest person in the world to me. But I have to reassure them that I\u2019m happy. That I\u2019m okay, or else they\u2019ll come to rescue me.\u201d</p><p>He put a finger on Taz\u2019s lips to stop his outraged reply. \u201cI know\u2014I don\u2019t need rescuing, but they don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p> <p>Taz nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll contact them then, if you want to.\u201d He pulled Kyle back down on the pillows as he tried to get up. \u201cI\u2019ll make the arrangements after you take a nap. And stop rubbing against me like that, or neither of us will get any sleep.\u201d</p><p>Kyle settled back beside his mate, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to talk him into contacting them any sooner. Taz\u2019s cock was still rigid as it lay alongside his own, and he moved restlessly against Kyle. With a little smile, Kyle slid out of his arms and down to kneel between Taz\u2019s legs, licking Taz\u2019s cock from base to tip. Taz raised up on his elbows and drew in a rough breath as he gazed down at him.</p><p>Kyle smiled and licked him again. \u201cSleep really is highly overrated, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Now, a few days later, Taz was sitting rather impatiently beside him as the servants set the focus and fooled around with the camera interminably. Finally, they had it ready and signaled to Taz.</p><p>Sitting in his chair behind a gleaming, massive desk, Taz fixed the camera with an imperious glare and began to speak.</p><p>\u201cI am Taz Bonnet, of Tygeria, Imperial Senator of the Tygerian Ruling Council. Beside me...\u201d He held out a hand, and Kyle stepped up beside him to take it. \u201cBeside me is my nobyo. He wishes to give you a personal message.\u201d</p> <p>Kyle cleared his throat nervously. \u201cI wanted to let you know that I\u2019m alive and doing well. I\u2019m happy here with Taz\u2014he\u2019s my mate.\u201d Kyle tried to give as much emphasis as he could to the word, so they would understand. \u201cDon\u2019t try to come for me. I don\u2019t need rescuing.\u201d He glanced down at Taz as he squeezed his hand. \u201cPlease understand, Lucas. And Nikolai, don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll explain everything later when I see you again, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you soon. Things are tricky now with the war, but this thing can\u2019t last forever, can it? I know this will be hard for you to understand, but please try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Nobyo,\u201d Taz said, and the servants pointed the camera back over at him. \u201cAs you see, he has no need of any assistance from you. Any foolish attempts to come for him would only be the cause of your destruction. If you have any emergency messages for him, you may send them through official channels.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at the servants and they ended the filming. Kyle hoped the message would be enough. His family could be a bit...intractable at times. At least the message would let them see he was still alive and unharmed. He\u2019d told them Taz was his mate, so maybe they\u2019d understand. It was all he could do. Taz stood up and pulled him into his arms. \u201cThere, Nobyo, I hope this will ease your mind a bit. They\u2019ll be able to see that you\u2019re well and happy, yes?\u201d</p><p>Kyle shrugged and smiled back at him. Really, Taz had no frame of reference when it came to his family. Taz and his brother Tarr were close, but it wasn\u2019t the same kind of thing at all. Maybe it had to do with their beasts\u2014tigers were, by nature, social but solitary animals, whereas Lycan wolves naturally organized themselves into packs to maintain stability and assist each other. The hierarchy in a pack was of primary importance, one reason why Kyle had slowly but surely been adjusting to Taz as the more alpha male in their relationship. He was thinking and acting more and more like a beta every day, and he was surprised at how natural it felt to him.</p><p>Though he still needed to claim his mate, he was much more content than he had been in the early days. When he first came back from the fight in the arena, he\u2019d expected Taz to treat him more or less like a slave. Instead, the show of dominance and Kyle\u2019s acceptance of it had soothed his need to prove himself over and over. As a result, their relationship had become more loving and even closer.</p><p>\u201cYou know the baby will be coming soon, Nobyo. Are you ready to be a father?\u201d Taz\u2019s fingers drifted over the skin on his back, coming to rest over his hips.</p><p>Kyle shook his head. \u201cNot really, seeing as how I know nothing about babies. It\u2019s kind of terrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll care for the child together, and of course, the servants will help. You know, I\u2019ve decided to name the baby Kylon, after my father. I also like it because it\u2019s a little like your name,\u201d he said off-handedly, his hand still teasing around his crease.</p> <p>Kyle\u2019s mouth fell open a little as he stared at his mate. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think you knew my name. You never use it.\u201d</p><p>Taz rolled his eyes. \u201cOf course I know the name of my own nobyo,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cBut in Tygeria, we never use our nobyo\u2019s names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that, anyway, Taz-lan?\u201d Kyle asked, in an irritated tone. \u201cIt makes me feel...almost generic. Like I could be anybody.\u201d</p><p>Taz lifted one shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>At Kyle\u2019s sharp gaze, Taz smiled. \u201cNo, I can see you don\u2019t understand. Let me try to explain. The gods of our religion can be a bit jealous. If you love something too much, the gods may try to take it from you, so it\u2019s best if they don\u2019t know your children or your nobyo\u2019s names too well. When the baby gets here, you may call him by his name, of course, because the gods take little notice of aliens.\u201d He kissed away the little frown on Kyle\u2019s mouth. \u201cHowever, I will call him son, just as I call you simply Nobyo, in the hope that the gods will become confused with so many and leave me the dearest things in my life.\u201d</p><p>Kyle nodded, a little overcome with the unexpected emotion he felt at Taz\u2019s words and slipped his hand inside Taz\u2019s, who gave him a sweet smile. \u201cSo I\u2019ll record the baby\u2019s new name on his papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout these papers. What are they exactly? You said the same thing to me when I first got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour birth papers. We don\u2019t consider you to have been properly born until you arrived here on Tygeria to join the people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so that makes you way too old for me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. I hope you manage to curb this unseemly sarcasm when you\u2019re around our child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do. So we\u2019ll do his room together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What color do you think we should have the servants paint his room?\u201d</p><p>Kyle shrugged. The sum total of his knowledge about babies was very small, limited mostly to the sparse contact he\u2019d had with Lucas\u2019s child. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014blue, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Taz frowned. \u201cBlue? What a silly color for a warrior-child. No, it must be bold and strong. Perhaps red\u2014a shade like your beautiful eyes.\u201d</p><p>A knock on the door of Taz\u2019s office interrupted them, and Taz called out impatiently for whoever was outside to enter. It was one of the older servants, all of whom had learned at their peril to always knock on any closed door since Kyle had arrived. The poor man, stooped a little with age, looked frightened and upset.</p><p>Taz straightened in his chair. \u201cWhat is it, Wyn? Has something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA message for you, sir. Very urgent, about your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother?\u201d Taz was already on his feet and reaching for the paper the servant held in a trembling hand. He scanned it quickly and turned an incredulous and shocked gaze on Kyle.</p><p>\u201cY-your family has my brother. They\u2019ve taken him prisoner and are holding him on your home planet. They say that I have only a few days to contact them with a decision.\u201d</p><p>Kyle shook his head, still trying to understand. \u201cBut why? A decision about what? Are they angry because he kidnapped me? What do they hope to accomplish by it? What do they want?\u201d</p><p>Taz looked up at him, his face drained of color, so that the tiger stripes under his normally golden skin had never before looked so striking. His eyes turned more gold in color and took on a feral glow. His voice was shocked and harsh. \u201cYou, of course. They want to trade my brother for you. They say if I refuse to make the exchange, they\u2019ll send him back to one piece at a time. Gods, they\u2019re monsters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaz, listen to me,\u201d Kyle said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to contact them right away. I can talk to them.\u201d</p><p>Taz shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019d never believe it,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion. \u201cThey\u2019d think I coerced you. Forced you to say you don\u2019t want this exchange.\u201d He looked up sharply at Kyle. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! How can you even ask me that question? I told you I never want to leave you.\u201d Kyle took his hand and gazed into his eyes, trying to show him how sincere he was. Taz glared back at him for moment before his eyes softened, and he drew Kyle close to him, holding him tightly in his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll never give you up! No one can make me!\u201d</p><p>Kyle allowed himself to be held for a moment, trying to soothe his mate, but then pulled gently away. \u201cTaz-lan, there\u2019s a simple solution to this. I have to go see them. Agree to the exchange to get Tarr back unharmed, and then once I explain things to them, I\u2019ll come back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taz drew back and then flung Kyle away from him, his face mottled with fury. \u201cI knew it. I knew you\u2019d choose them over me. You\u2019re lying about wanting to stay with me. You want to go to them, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Kyle could see Taz\u2019s eyes changing again. He\u2019d never seen Taz\u2019s beast before. Usually the Tygerian beasts were well-controlled and came out only at times of great need or really strong emotion, but now his eyes were becoming those of a cat, the pupils growing large and elongating. A few times during the year, Taz had told him their moon was at its fullest point and their beasts roamed all over Tygeria. On those nights, he would lock his nobyo away, he said, for his own safety. Unlike the Lycan wolves, the tigers became fully bestial, and once they were completely transformed, they no longer had the thought processes of a humanoid creature.</p><p>Still, Kyle stood his ground, growling back at him when Taz made the low, inhuman noise in his throat. \u201cListen to me, damn it! I\u2019ve told you over and over that I want to be with you. I don\u2019t know how to say it any other way. You have to trust me, Taz. You can exchange me for Tarr and then I\u2019ll come back to you as soon as I can. I give you my word.\u201d</p> <p>Taz shot him a disbelieving glare and started pacing rapidly back and forth in front of his desk, reminding Kyle of the Earthan tigers he\u2019d seen in zoos back on Lycanus. \u201cThe word of a Lycan! Bah! You haven\u2019t been away from them long enough for me to teach you yet how to be honest. You\u2019d say anything to get away from me and go back to your precious family. No, I don\u2019t believe you. How can I? I\u2019ll find out where they\u2019re holding him and attack them. Violence and a show of force are the only things a Lycan understands.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and walked rapidly from the room, leaving Kyle behind. He was stunned and fell down in Taz\u2019s big chair. His family had Tarr. He had no doubt they would carry out their threats if Taz didn\u2019t comply with their demands. Worse yet, Taz would attack the planet and many innocent lives could be lost. His family could be lost. Even...his mind skittered over the possibility that his family might kill his mate, an image too horrible for him to hold onto for long. There was simply no good outcome for this. The only way to avoid any bloodshed was for Kyle to go to them.</p><p>Thinking he might be able to wait until Taz calmed down a bit and speak to him again, he got wearily to his feet as the door to Taz\u2019s office reopened. Wyn stood in the doorway apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. But Taz...I mean to say Taz-lan wants you locked in your room. I\u2019m supposed to take you there now and make sure you\u2019re locked securely inside.\u201d</p><p>Kyle\u2019s lips thinned to a grim line. Taz, as usual, was completely overreacting. Arrogant, suspicious bastard.</p> <p>Wyn\u2019s slight slip of the tongue over Taz\u2019s name reminded Kyle that it was far from the first time the servant had used the name in his presence. Taz had never reacted with impatience or anger, hinting to Kyle that they must have a closer relationship than he knew.</p><p>\u201cWyn,\u201d he said, a sudden idea occurring to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve known both Taz and Tarr a long time, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, sir. Since they were born. Their nobyo, who was a fine person, even though he was a human, had to travel frequently with his master, their father. He was a diplomat, you see, and he wanted his nobyo with him. In their absence, I often cared for the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. So you might say you care a great deal for both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, stiffening a little. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for either of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Kyle said, moving closer and putting an arm around Wyn\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThen I have a proposition for you. If it works, and I think it will, it could save both Tarr and Taz. You know what\u2019s happened to Tarr, don\u2019t you? I saw your face when you came into the room to tell Taz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir, and I\u2019m worried. I don\u2019t know what Taz is going to do. He was frantic when he left here a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kyle said grimly. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll blame himself if anything happens, because he always does. And he\u2019ll wind up hating me for it too, because it\u2019s my family, even though I\u2019ve been telling him that something like this was going to happen. He\u2019s a stubborn man, Wyn.\u201d</p><p>Wyn nodded. \u201cYes, but he\u2019s always been that way, even as a small child. He tries to take care of everyone. It\u2019s one of the reasons I was so happy when he found you, sir. Since you\u2019ve been here, you\u2019ve made him very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook Wyn, I have an idea. I know I can convince my family that being here with Taz is my choice. It is my choice, you know. He offered me my freedom, but he\u2019s my mate. I can\u2019t live without him now.\u201d</p><p>Wyn nodded. \u201cBut as you say, he\u2019s stubborn. And I think he doesn\u2019t believe you won\u2019t try to leave him, despite what he might have offered you. He would be heartbroken if he lost you, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t lose me. I promise you that. If you\u2019ll help me, I think there\u2019s a way out of this for all of us. But it means I have to get to my family and make the exchange before Taz attacks them. I need help, Wyn.\u201d</p><p>The old servant looked alarmed and pulled away. \u201cI-I can\u2019t do that, sir. He would never forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to know. You must know some of Tarr\u2019s associates here on Tygeria. Maybe some of the Rogers? I know Tygeria has offered the Nilaniums asylum, and they have a camp here. If I could get a message to them, I think they might help me. My family could give them a reward, plus they\u2019d be liberating Tarr. C\u2019mon, Wyn. Just please think about it. But quickly, before Taz does something rash. He could kill my family, or get himself and his brother both killed or badly hurt. You don\u2019t want that, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Lost in thought, the old man stared at him for a long time before slowly nodding his head. \u201cI know someone. He\u2019s a friend of Tarr\u2019s. Perhaps he can help, but you must never tell Taz-lan I did this. He would be...\u201d He shook his head and Kyle remembered Taz\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll never tell him. You\u2019re doing the right thing, Wyn. This will work, and then I\u2019ll come back and we can be happy together\u2014you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right, sir. But I\u2019m an old man, and if I\u2019ve learned anything over the years, it\u2019s this. Most things don\u2019t go as you plan them, and sometimes, there simply is no good ending to a problem.\u201d</p><p>A shiver traveled down Kyle\u2019s spine at the words, but he shook himself, and refused to believe it. This would work because it had to. There simply was no other choice.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Kyle looked nervously out the porthole of the inter-space transport and wondered what Taz was doing right at that moment. He\u2019d been heartsick and miserable since that morning when the captain of the transport had allowed him to try to contact Taz, but Taz had refused to take the call. Refused! Kyle could only imagine what that must mean.</p><p>The \u201cescape\u201d from Taz\u2019s house had gone so smoothly, it was hard to believe it. The day after he\u2019d spoken with Wyn, there was a knock on his bedroom door and Wyn opened it to admit a large, swarthy Nilanium who gave him an interested look before nodding civilly at him. Taz had left early that morning after a restless night, still adamantly refusing to speak to Kyle about an exchange of prisoners.</p><p>In a matter of moments, the Nilanium, whose name was Robosium Jex, had agreed to Kyle\u2019s plan and even refused the reward Kyle told him his family would pay.</p><p>\u201cTarr Bonnet has been my friend for many cycles,\u201d Jex said. \u201cAnd a good friend to my people. I\u2019ll help you, Lycan, even though if Taz Bonnet finds out, he\u2019ll have my head. Literally.\u201d He shook his head and gave Kyle the ghost of a smile. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll figure it out. If you come back, he\u2019ll get over it. If not...\u201d he shrugged. \u201cA permanent home is not for me, anyway. Life here on Tygeria is making me soft. I\u2019d rather be traveling through space, I suppose, like my people have done for centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will come back, I promise you. This is the only thing I can think of to save Tarr and make my family understand.\u201d</p><p>Jex nodded. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready, we\u2019d better go now. I have the ship waiting.\u201d</p><p>A little startled at how quickly things were moving, Kyle nodded and found some clothes that belonged to Taz in his clothing drawers. They were too big, but better than the thong he had on, so he quickly dressed, rolling up the trouser legs and tying the shirt around him. He looked odd, but it was the best he could do. He took one last look around and then pulled out the note he\u2019d written the day before where he\u2019d hidden it under the mattress. Wyn had told him things might move quickly once he contacted Tarr\u2019s friend, so he had the note ready.</p><p>The note told Taz how much he loved him and promised him he\u2019d be back. There wasn\u2019t much more to say really. He wondered if Taz would even read it or just rip it up in a rage when he found out Kyle was gone. Propping the note up on his pillow, Kyle followed Jex to the front door.</p><p>That had been almost a day ago, and now Taz was refusing to even speak to him. Kyle felt like some winged creature was inside his stomach, beating its wings and trying to batter a hole through it. He\u2019d never felt so discouraged.</p><p>Someone cleared their throat behind him and he turned to see Jex standing by the hatch into the room. \u201cWe\u2019ve entered Lycanus 3 airspace, and been contacted by your people. We told them we had you on board, and they agreed not to shoot us down and eat us. A fair trade, I think.\u201d</p><p>Kyle tried to smile, but he couldn\u2019t quite pull it off. Jex gazed at him and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry so, Lycan. Taz Bonnet will come around. His pride is hurt now, and he thinks you betrayed him. He\u2019s never trusted Lycans, and he probably thinks this only proves his point.\u201d</p><p>Kyle turned back to the porthole. \u201cWell, that makes me feel a lot better, Jex. Thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>Jex chuckled and came to stand beside him, clapping a big hand on his shoulder. \u201cAn ancient Nilanium poet once said, \u2018The course of true love never did run smooth.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kyle quirked an eyebrow at him. \u201cI think that\u2019s an ancient Earthan poet, William Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Well, he must have stolen it from our man.\u201d He nudged Kyle with his shoulder. \u201cCome on and get strapped in your seat. We\u2019ll be landing soon and then you can get all of this straightened out and go back to your big Tygerian. They are a handsome people. A little crazy, but very handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stay in our airspace and take me back with you?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cYour people said in and out\u2014quick-like. They\u2019ll have Tarr on the docks waiting for us. We push you out the door to their waiting arms, grab Tarr and take off. But don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, at seeing Kyle\u2019s crestfallen expression. \u201cYour family will take you back to him once you explain. Or to some neutral ground where he can come for you.\u201d</p><p>Kyle shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think Taz wants anything more to do with me. He wouldn\u2019t even answer when I tried to contact him earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...maybe. But I\u2019d hate to get between you and him if you showed up at his front door. He may beat you a little, but he\u2019ll get over it in a year or two. Maybe three.\u201d</p><p>Kyle laughed in spite of himself, and punched Jex on the shoulder. \u201cThanks, Jex. I\u2019ll go sit down and get ready for the landing. Things will probably be wild for a few minutes once we land, so I want to thank you now for helping me. I know you did it for Tarr, but I still appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Jex blushed and turned away, mumbling something under his breath that may have been a thank you. Kyle liked him a lot, even though he was an unabashed thief and a scoundrel.</p> <p>Some twenty minutes later, the transport was coming in low over his home planet for a landing. Through the window, Kyle could see the desolate hills of his home planet. Kyle got a sudden pang as he thought about how very far away from Taz he was, and wondered if he\u2019d ever get back to him again. He knew he could convince his family to let him go\u2014that wasn\u2019t the problem. It was Taz himself, and his damnable pride. Kyle hadn\u2019t counted on the fact that he might be feeling too damn angry and betrayed to let him come home to him. Still, there had been no other solution that he could see to recover Tarr safely. Not when everyone involved were such asses.</p><p>The transport hovered briefly right over a tiny spaceport landing dock, as the pilot prepared to land. It looked like it had been raining recently and the ground looked muddy. Kyle could see what looked like all the alphas standing on the docks, along with a slightly larger form, wearing shackles. It was Tarr Bonnet and he looked much the worse for wear. Bruised and battered, he\u2019d lost his shoes at some point and his clothes hung from him in tatters. Kyle realized he must have shifted to his tiger sometime during his capture or subsequently. He was waiting patiently enough now though as they came in for a landing. Kyle glanced out the side window again and saw his brother and his cousins, their faces tense, their hands on their weapons. They must still suspect some kind of trick.</p><p>He unbuckled himself and hurried to the door of the transport, which was slowly rising. When he came into view, he saw his family\u2019s face light up and he started to jump down and greet them, when he felt Jex\u2019s hand on his arm.</p><p>Lucas, who was standing closest to him snarled and started forward, but Jex took out a gun and held it to Kyle\u2019s head, whispering in Kyle\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, boy, but they don\u2019t know that. All I want is Tarr, and I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>Nikolai made a move to rush forward, but Lucas grabbed his arm. \u201cLet him go, asshole.\u201d He pulled his own gun and stuck it to Tarr\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019ve got your man, too.\u201d</p><p>When Lucas put the gun to Tarr\u2019s head, Kyle noticed Larsson, way at the back of the group, gave what sounded like an involuntary sound of anger. Tarr glanced back at him and shook his head. What the hell was that about?</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute, now, Lycan,\u201d Jex said quickly before things escalated even further. \u201cI have no wish to double cross you. Why don\u2019t we both put down our guns and let our boys go at the same time, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Lucas bared his teeth into what might have been a smile. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>Jex shrugged and lowered his gun, removing his hand from Kyle\u2019s arm. Before he did, he gave him a final squeeze. \u201cGo on, boy. Go to your family.\u201d</p><p>Kyle jumped down from the door and Lucas released Tarr to step forward. As he passed Kyle, he gave him a dark look, but Kyle grabbed his arm and made him turn around. Kyle could hear the uneasy movements around him as the others tried to figure out what he was doing.</p><p>Tarr looked down at his hand contemptuously, but Kyle leaned in toward him. \u201cTell Taz I only did this to get you released. I want to go back to him.\u201d</p><p>Tarr looked surprised, and stared back at him without acknowledging what he\u2019d said. Kyle released his arm, and saw him glance once more at Larsson, who was watching them both. Tarr turned back to the ship and Kyle took another few steps before he was caught in a massive hug by Lucas. He passed him over to Nikolai next for more mauling. Blayde was slapping him on the back and the other cousins were crowding around him, shouting questions at him, when Kyle heard the transport powering up behind him. He glanced up at it as it hovered above them for a moment before shooting off at a rapid speed. He was happy to be home\u2014happy to see his family again. But what in the name of all the gods was he going to do next?</p><p>Nikolai insisted on taking Kyle home with him, and of course, all the others trooped along with them, despite Kyle\u2019s need to crawl in a bed somewhere and go to sleep. The gorgeous Jagger met them at the door, and threw his arms around Kyle\u2019s neck. It was good to see him, but his presence only reminded Kyle of his own mate, so different from little Jagger, yet the way he felt about Taz was the same as Nikolai felt about Jagger. Yet they were here together, and his own mate was light years away. In more ways than one.</p><p>Kyle was exhausted, depressed and heartsick. All he wanted to do was slink off to lick his wounds, not be subjected to an enthusiastic homecoming. He appreciated the sentiment, but he\u2019d be back on Tygeria right this minute if not for their well-meaning meddling in his affairs.</p> <p>He laid his head back on the sofa in Nikolai\u2019s main living area, closing his eyes. He knew he wasn\u2019t being fair\u2014they had no idea Taz was his mate. There hadn\u2019t been time for them to receive that last message he and Taz had recorded for them.</p><p>A sudden memory of that day, when afterward they\u2019d talked about the baby\u2019s name hit Kyle hard and a wave of sorrow and loss washed over him. He may never even see the baby now, not if Taz chose to freeze him out and never forgive him. He felt a hand on his knee and opened his eyes to see Lucas leaning towards him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called the doctor, Kyle. I think he should check you over.\u201d</p><p>Kyle shook his head wearily. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need any doctor. You don\u2019t understand the situation.\u201d</p><p>Konnor, leaning against the wall next to him, spoke up. \u201cWhat\u2019s to understand? They kidnapped you, abused you, raped...uh...took advantage of you.\u201d He made a growling sound low in his throat. \u201cThis thing isn\u2019t over yet, damn it! We\u2019ll make that bastard pay for what he did to you!\u201d</p><p>Nikolai sat next to him, with Jagger perched on the arm of the sofa beside him. Nikolai threw an arm around his shoulders and squeezed him so hard Kyle thought he might be in danger of a dislocated shoulder. \u201cDamn right. Don\u2019t worry, little brother, we\u2019ll get revenge for what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>Kyle rolled his eyes. Nikolai was older than he was by exactly six minutes, but had acted like this their whole lives. Little brother, indeed. Like he needed someone to look after him. Had Nikolai known all along Kyle wasn\u2019t the same as he was? That he wasn\u2019t a true alpha? Had everyone known except for him?</p><p>Shrugging him off, Kyle turned on him. \u201cI don\u2019t want revenge. I want to go back home to my mate.\u201d</p><p>A stunned moment of silence followed his words. When it went on for a bit too long, he realized they were all embarrassed for him. Lucas, who was the only one who seemed to be able to meet his gaze, looked at him sympathetically. \u201cKyle,\u201d he said in the tone of voice people used to talk to mental patients or people about to jump from a ledge. \u201cWhen people are kidnapped and held for a long time, there\u2019s a condition that makes them identify with their captors. That\u2019s what this is. It\u2019s perfectly understandable and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kyle yelled, dry-washing his face with his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not any fucking condition and I\u2019m not crazy, damn it, so everybody stop acting weird.\u201d He glared around at each of his family members in turn. \u201cTaz Bonnet is my mate. I know it\u2019s crazy, but that\u2019s how it usually works with this damn curse of ours, doesn\u2019t it? It just happened the moment I saw him. And he feels the same way about me as your mates feel about you. Except that now he thinks I betrayed him and chose you over him. I had to sneak away and get friends of Tarr\u2019s to help me because he didn\u2019t want to risk losing me!\u201d He put his face down in his hands. \u201cNow he probably hates me\u2014he thinks I betrayed him.\u201d</p><p>Another brief, shocked silence met his words, but then Konnor shook his head. \u201cNo, wait a minute. That can\u2019t be right. We saw the tape of you in the arena with him on Tygeria. He almost killed you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How did you see that?\u201d</p><p>Nikolai spoke up beside him. \u201cThe Alliance has some undercover contacts on Tygeria. Lucas had them following Taz Bonnet once we found out he had you. We saw the whole thing, Kyle. It was brutal.\u201d</p><p>Kyle shook his head doggedly. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I initiated that whole thing. I\u2019d been asking him to contact you to let you know I was fine and that he was my mate, but he was suspicious and afraid it was too soon. I insisted and made him an offer\u2014if I could beat him in the ring, he\u2019d let me come back for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeat him in the ring?\u201d Blayde said from his chair next to Lucas. \u201cKyle, he\u2019s huge. It took two of us to put Tarr Bonnet down when we captured him\u2014I\u2019m surprised you lasted as long as you did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have if he\u2019d actually been trying to hurt me. Don\u2019t you see? He was just fooling around\u2014when he realized I was hurt, he put a stop to it fast. He\u2019s bonded with me. He\u2019s my mate, don\u2019t you get it?\u201d</p><p>Lucas leaned back on the sofa looking thoughtful but Nikolai persisted. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe it. You couldn\u2019t have left him if that had been the case, not once you\u2019d claimed him. And the same goes for him! Nothing would have made me let Jagger go, unless maybe...\u201d</p><p>He broke off with an astonished expression and Kyle nodded, his lips thinned out to a furious line. \u201cUnless some maniacs were threatening to cut your brother up in little pieces and ship him home to you one piece at a time? And I haven\u2019t claimed him\u2014not exactly. He\u2019s claimed me plenty, though, and I-I love him.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas\u2019s face was a little red, and he was shaking his head. \u201cWe had no idea, Kyle.\u201d</p><p>Kyle sagged, feeling worn out. \u201cI know. He\u2019s just as stubborn as all of you. He didn\u2019t believe me when I told him you\u2019d try something to rescue me. Arrogant fool.\u201d</p><p>Larsson, standing behind Lucas, had been quiet throughout all of this. He spoke up quietly now. \u201cSo you never needed rescue at all. And all this was for nothing.\u201d Everyone in the room gazed at him sharply, but he shook his head and gripped the back of the sofa, looking down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kyle. It\u2019s not that I regret anything, you know that.\u201d He looked back up. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you. But if I understand what you\u2019re telling us, then letting Tarr go was...\u201d</p><p>Kyle looked back and forth among his family. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What are you talking about, Lars?\u201d</p><p>Lucas was the first to reply, and his tone was grim. \u201cLarsson thinks he imprinted on Tarr Bonnet, of all people.\u201d</p> <p>Larsson turned abruptly and stormed into the adjoining kitchen, walking over to the counter and slamming his hand down on the counter. \u201cI told you, damn it! I told you he\u2019s my mate! I can\u2019t help the way I feel about him. But I\u2019ll get over it. I have to!\u201d</p><p>Kyle\u2019s mouth fell open as he stared at Larsson. Konnor, Larsson\u2019s brother, was studiously ignoring him, his mouth tight and angry. Everyone else just looked uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me...? Have you mated with him?\u201d</p><p>Larsson shook his head. \u201cOf course not. I couldn\u2019t have let him go, otherwise. But he\u2019s my mate. He felt it too\u2014I know he did, even though he tried to deny it.\u201d</p><p>Kyle felt completely astounded. \u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t have allowed them to really hurt Tarr, would you? It was all a bluff.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cApparently, this whole thing has been a fuck-up from the start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the godsdamned curse. It has to be. Nothing else had ever messed up our lives like this.\u201d Kyle folded his arms across his chest and fell back against the sofa. Everyone was quiet for a long moment and then Jagger, who up to this point hadn\u2019t said a word, leaned across Nikolai to touch Kyle\u2019s hand, lying limp on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cKyle, you all call this thing a curse, but is it really? You\u2019ve all found your perfect mate now\u2014every one of you, from all over the galaxies. There had to be a little supernatural help in all that. Would you really wish it away? Are any of you sorry that you met your mate?\u201d</p><p>He glared at Nikolai, who grinned up at him. \u201cNo, baby. You\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s never been a curse at all, has it? Old Ivan gave us a gift.\u201d He stood up and rubbed his hands together. \u201cNow let\u2019s stop fighting about all this and get down to business. How are we going to get Kyle and Larsson\u2019s big kitties back for them?\u201d</p><p>Kyle smiled despite himself at the idea of the fierce Taz as a \u2018big kitty.\u2019 For the first time since he left Tygeria, he was feeling a little better about things. His family would help him, and Taz Bonnet didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>Taz put down the papers he\u2019d been reading at his desk and leaned back in his chair. It had been almost a full quarter cycle since he\u2019d last seen his nobyo. The heartbreak just didn\u2019t seem to go away, and he remembered how his father was after his poor nobyo had passed away so unexpectedly. It was a different situation, of course. His father\u2019s lover hadn\u2019t wanted to leave him.</p><p>Kyle\u2019s betrayal still filled him with rage. Oh, not at first. When he\u2019d first come home and found him missing, Taz had been stunned and broken. He\u2019d read the letter he\u2019d left on the bed telling Taz he loved him over and over, looking for some kind of message or code to tell him it was all a joke\u2014he was really hiding in another room and would come back in any minute, laughing at him, his pretty eyes sparkling.</p><p>He knew it wasn\u2019t true, though, and his nobyo\u2014Kyle\u2014was really gone. No use in not saying his name now. The gods had found out Taz\u2019s secret and had spirited Kyle away. When the ship\u2019s captain had contacted him, saying Kyle wanted to speak to him from the transport, Taz couldn\u2019t bring himself to talk to him. He was afraid he\u2019d break down and beg him to come back home, and he couldn\u2019t chance that. It was better to let his nobyo remember him as strong and confident. He\u2019d keep his pride that way at least.</p><p>Then once he had Tarr back home safely\u2014a strangely chastened, downcast Tarr, who refused to speak of his time with the Lycans\u2014Tarr had told him of Kyle\u2019s message to him. Tarr said he told him that he\u2019d only done it to get Tarr released and that he wanted to come back home. So Taz had waited impatiently for his message, asking to return. He\u2019d already decided to play a little hard to get\u2014maybe deny him permission a few times to teach him a lesson, then when Kyle had begged him enough, he\u2019d finally allow him to come home. When he got back, Taz would be cold and stern. He may even have to punish him a little. His nobyo had to learn to obey him and never question his judgment.</p> <p>Except it never happened like that. No messages were received. Kyle never tried to contact him. Once he got back home with his family, he\u2019d completely forgotten Taz even existed, just as Taz had told him he would. For once, being proved right didn\u2019t make him feel better in the least.</p><p>His office door opened to admit Tarr, who strode over to the chair in front of his desk and threw himself down in it. Tarr had been staying with Taz since his return. He wouldn\u2019t talk about what had happened to him on Lycanus 3, but it had Taz worried. Since he came back, he hardly went out any more, preferring to stay mostly in his room. He seemed distracted and angry too, and when Taz questioned him, he\u2019d said he had something on his mind, but that he\u2019d handle it. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t been able to handle it very well so far. He was looking more morose and more like he\u2019d been dragged behind a speeding land transport every day\u2014wounded, beaten up and like he ached all over.</p><p>Taz waited patiently for him to indicate why he\u2019d come in, but nothing seemed to be forthcoming. Tarr stared down at the desk in front of his chair as if the secret to something important was carved into it.</p><p>\u201cWhat now? Is it something with the baby?\u201d</p><p>Taz\u2019s son had arrived two weeks before. The servants were caring for him and Taz tried to spend as much time with the beautiful child as possible, although all he could think of was how he and Kyle were supposed to be doing this together. Tarr had offered to help, since he was staying with him, though he hadn\u2019t been much help yet. He was too distracted, his mind seeming to be miles and miles away.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh no, no, the baby is fine. Wyn\u2019s feeding him and putting him down for a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the matter? Got something on your mind?\u201d</p><p>Tarr straightened in his chair. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do. I\u2019ve been thinking about those damned Lycans.\u201d</p><p>Taz winced a little, but nodded. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to make them pay, that\u2019s what!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay how, exactly?\u201d Taz asked quietly.</p><p>Tarr jumped to his feet and began to pace. \u201cBy going after them, that\u2019s how! They humiliated me in front of my men, and the only way I got released was by an exchange for your nobyo. That\u2019s unacceptable, damn it. If we don\u2019t fix this and soon, we\u2019ll be a laughing stock.\u201d</p><p>Taz nodded, feeling a little excited by the idea of making Kyle pay. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting your nobyo back for one thing. I know you\u2019re miserable without him.\u201d He held up a hand to stop Taz\u2019s protests. \u201cDon\u2019t even bother to lie. I know you too well. You bonded with him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Taz nodded dejectedly. \u201cFor all the good it did me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I say we go after him! And maybe, since we\u2019re there anyway, we\u2019ll grab another one of them and make him pay too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d Taz looked blank. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Tarr threw himself back down in the chair. \u201cHis cousin, damn it. Larsson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarsson? Why him in particular? Was he cruel? Did he hurt you in some way you haven\u2019t told me about?\u201d Taz jumped to his feet. \u201cGods, Tarr, did he...rape you?\u201d</p><p>Tarr growled at him. \u201cHells, no. Give me a little credit. No, he did something even worse.\u201d</p><p>Taz\u2019s eyes opened even wider. \u201cWhat? What did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me, okay? And\u2014did other things. He came in my cell while I was chained to the wall and he-he...the son-of-a-bitch made me like it. I need more of him, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Taz was stunned for a moment before falling back in his chair laughing. Tarr glared at him until he finally had himself under control, wiping his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve found your nobyo, haven\u2019t you? And it\u2019s Kyle\u2019s cousin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh all you want. It is funny, I guess. I never thought I\u2019d find a Lycan attractive, but the bastard\u2019s gorgeous, okay? There\u2019s just something about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they were going to hurt you. Cut you up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was all a bluff. Though I wouldn\u2019t have put it past that Blayde or Konnor. Larsson stood up to them, though. Told them they\u2019d have to come through him first. They backed off after that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taz still stared at him in amazement. Finally, he seemed to find his voice. \u201cSo, did you and this Larsson...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not exactly. I wanted to, though. I still do. It\u2019s all I can think about, damn him. When I finally do get hold of him, I\u2019m going to bend him over every piece of furniture I can find. I\u2019ll make him my nobyo and take him with me on my trips around the galaxies. He\u2019ll make a nice little bedwarmer for those long voyages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, good luck with that. Those sound like the plans I had for his cousin. It didn\u2019t work out exactly that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will for me. He needs a strong hand, and he\u2019ll find one in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk as if you already have him. Just how are you planning to get your hands on him? On both of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my sources watching them now. Larsson used to go after bounties a great deal with his brother, only occasionally transporting bauxite. Now it seems that has changed. He\u2019s been doing runs of bauxite with his cousin, Kyle...your nobyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know who he is, Tarr, thank you. But why the change? Could it be some kind of set-up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? They seem to have forgotten we even exist,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cKyle has even been seen with other men at the bars on Lycanus 3 lately.\u201d</p> <p>Taz stiffened. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he said, his voice menacing.</p><p>\u201cBetter yet, get him back and remind him who he belongs to. The two of them, Larsson and Kyle are set to leave on a transport tomorrow, according to my sources. I say, we attack. We\u2019ll take a small, fast ship, latch onto their starship then dock. We can get in fast and take them, leave a few of my men to pilot the ship back to Tygeria and bring them home.\u201d</p><p>Taz\u2019s blood was already racing through his veins at the idea of having his nobyo back in his bed. He might just chain him to it for a few days\u2014or weeks. Other men, huh? He might have to give him daily spankings then too, until he never even so much as looked at another man again. The memory of the last spanking was still as fresh in his mind as the day it happened. Taz groaned at the thought and adjusted himself. Naked, and in his lap was where his nobyo belonged. Tarr was right. It was time to bring him home.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Kyle sat behind the comm of the transport, wondering if the blip on the screen showing a fast-moving object coming alongside his starship could finally be what he\u2019d been waiting and hoping for. As the small ship came more fully into view on his screens, he spotted the tell-tale skull and crossbones on the side\u2014the sign known as the Jolly Roger. He pressed a button on the comm deck in front of him to warn Larsson to come up quickly. Then he made a quick maneuver to bring down their speed. The last thing he needed was a collision with the smaller ship and it was headed toward them at an incredibly fast rate.</p><p>Its captain, however, was skilled. Kyle wondered if it was Tarr himself. At the last possible moment he brought the smaller ship alongside and powered up his side engine stabilizers to bump the two hulls together, while matching his speed to Kyle\u2019s. Powerful magnetic grapplers attached the smaller ship to the hull of the starship like a barnacle to a whale and a hailing frequency opened up on his command screen. It was Tarr all right, looking a great deal like the pirate he was as he grinned into the monitor.</p> <p>\u201cOpen your loading doors, Lycan, or we\u2019ll blow them open.\u201d</p><p>Kyle heard the door behind him as Larsson came running in, skidding to a stop beside his chair, and staring into the monitor. \u201cTarr,\u201d he said quietly, and Tarr\u2019s grin became even wider.</p><p>\u201cHello, Larsson. Did you think you\u2019d seen the last of me? I believe I told you once that I\u2019d make you and your family sorry they ever messed with me. I think that day has come, boy.\u201d</p><p>Larsson grinned back at him. \u201cIs this where I\u2019m supposed to beg for my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll beg before I\u2019m through with you,\u201d Tarr said. \u201cNow do I blast your doors open or are you going to be sensible and open up?\u201d</p><p>Larsson and Kyle looked at each other and Larsson nodded, flipping a switch on the comm desk. Tarr nodded approvingly. \u201cGood boys. Maybe I\u2019ll let you puppies share a juicy bone in your cages tonight.\u201d He smiled at Larsson again. \u201cThere\u2019s a bad joke in there somewhere. Throw down your weapons and no one will get hurt.\u201d</p><p>When both Kyle and Larsson just stared at him, he raised his voice. \u201cI said, throw down the damn weapons. Now!\u201d</p><p>Kyle unbuckled his sidearm and let it drop to the floor, but Larsson stared into the screen and shook his head. \u201cNot me. You\u2019ll have to come and get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d Tarr said smoothly and the screen went dark. They could hear the sounds of the scraping on the side of their ship as the smaller ship settled closer against theirs, sealing the gap.</p><p>Larsson glanced over at Kyle. \u201cGet ready. When that hatch opens, I\u2019m betting Tarr and Taz will be coming through and things will start to happen fast.\u201d</p><p>Kyle nodded, his heart racing. The hatch door flew open then and Taz was the first one through, his eyes never leaving Kyle. He looked like a pirate himself, big and dangerous as he rushed toward him and swept him up in his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t fight me, boy. You\u2019re coming with me!\u201d</p><p>Tarr had been right behind him, followed by at least three other Tygerians, their huge bulk filling up the deck area. Out of the corner of his eye, Kyle saw Tarr and Larsson grappling together. He\u2019d already disarmed Larsson and was picking him up to throw him over his shoulder when the door to the command deck opened and the other four Balanescus, along with five of their men, came surging into the room. Taz pulled Kyle behind his back and turned to face the men coming toward him. He was swarmed by three of them and went down hard, kicking and biting.</p><p>Tarr didn\u2019t fare much better. He\u2019d almost made it back out the hatch door with Larsson when Lucas pulled him around and swung at him. He dodged mostly out of the way, only catching part of the blow and then, as they backed him up toward the door, he threw Larsson at them and ducked behind the door, slamming and locking it behind him. By the time the Lycans picked themselves up off the floor, Tarr had made it back to his ship, along with two of his men. They managed to quickly disengage and take off before the Lycans could stop them. But Taz and the other Tygerian were putting up a vicious fight.</p><p>Afraid he\u2019d be injured, Kyle reached for the tranquilizer gun in his console and shot a single dart into Taz\u2019s hip. It still took almost five minutes before he collapsed under the weight of his attackers. Kyle quickly knelt down beside him and checked his pulse. He found it steady, if a little fast. He nodded at Lucas, who was standing by staring down at them, still trying to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. Help me take him down to my quarters.\u201d He got an arm around his waist and Lucas helped him pick Taz up from the other side, but it took three of them to get him down to Kyle\u2019s room. They left them alone and Kyle quickly stripped his clothes off and secured his wrists and ankles to the chains already in place. He stood back up and stared down at his mate. He could only imagine how furious he\u2019d be when he woke up.</p><p>He\u2019d only given him a very light dose of the tranquilizer and he was already waking up, moaning and trying to pull his arms down from above his head. Kyle sat down on the side of the bed next to him and waited for him to wake up. He didn\u2019t have long to wait.</p><p>Taz\u2019s eyes flew open all at once. One second he was out and the next second he was staring up at Kyle, his eyes wild and fierce.</p><p>He pulled frenziedly at the cuffs and chains holding him in place and snarled up at Kyle. \u201cWhat is this shit? Let me out of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyle! Don\u2019t do this!\u201d Taz had made his voice firm and deep, but his eyes were a little panicked, and his voice cracked a little. Kyle wanted to soothe him, so he sat closer to his side and ran his hands over his chest.</p><p>\u201cShhh...calm down, baby. You\u2019re all right. No one\u2019s going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Despite his attempts to calm him, Taz\u2019s eyes opened wider and he began to struggle so hard, Kyle was afraid he\u2019d do himself an injury. He climbed up on top of him and stretched out, holding him down until he exhausted himself.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Taz,\u201d Kyle said when Taz finally stopped struggling for a moment to catch his breath. \u201cI said no one will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Taz snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you hurting me,\u201d he yelled, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of any damn Lycan!\u201d</p><p>Breathing hard, his gaze wide and golden, he glared directly into Kyle\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll kill myself before I let you do this to me,\u201d Taz growled dramatically.</p><p>Kyle raised his eyebrows. \u201cReally? And just how do you think you\u2019ll do that when you\u2019re cuffed and chained?\u201d</p><p>He pulled wildly at the cuffs. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me chained forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I could,\u201d Kyle said, rubbing his hand soothingly over his sides. \u201cBut I won\u2019t. I only have you tied down so I can get some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswers? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew why I left, but then you didn\u2019t want me to come back. I want to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t think it would work. But it did. You got Tarr back safely, and you would have gotten me back if you hadn\u2019t been such an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s over between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Taz got a surprised look on his face, and he turned his face to the wall. \u201cI...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to get me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe when you came in the door to the comm deck you said, \u2018Don\u2019t fight me, boy. You\u2019re coming with me.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. Let me out of this, Kyle.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Kyle continued. \u201cThis was my cousin Lucas\u2019s idea, you know. Larsson and I have been traveling back and forth on transports for weeks trying to see if you and Tarr would come for us. He said that you wanted me to beg, but if I ignored you, you wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have no interest in what he said. Or what you say, for that matter.\u201d Taz practically spat the words at him.</p><p>Kyle slid off him and sat on the bed beside him, still gazing down at him.</p><p>\u201cSo you have no interest in having me come back to be your nobyo?\u201d</p><p>He was silent so long Kyle didn\u2019t think he was going to answer. Finally he growled out an angry reply. \u201cYou left me. You left our child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I only left you. The baby hadn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201d</p><p>Taz glared at him and then turned his head away, his body language making it clear he wasn\u2019t going to dignify that with an answer.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to be your nobyo, I can still let you go. I haven\u2019t claimed you, you see. So while I\u2019d be sad, and it would take me a long, long time to get over you, I might still be able to do it. Find another mate. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at Kyle with a bitter, angry expression. \u201cYou just can\u2019t help yourself, can you? You want someone else? I heard you were seen in bars with other men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that got back to you, huh? Lucas said it would. What would you think if I said yes, I would like someone else who treated me more like an equal?\u201d Kyle asked, tilting his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think you were a whore! And I\u2019d be right. You belonged to me. And you were very well treated!\u201d Taz pressed his lips together bitterly and cast an accusing glance at Kyle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t want me anymore. What difference does it make to you? And in my culture, I wasn\u2019t cheating on you at all. I haven\u2019t properly mated with you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve mated you, as you say, in every possible way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t mated you. That\u2019s what forms our bond. That and the bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I make love to you and give you the mating bite, then I would never be able to leave you\u2014never be able to be away from you or ever want another man.\u201d</p><p>Kyle saw Taz listening carefully, but he still kept his face turned away. Sighing heavily, Kyle got up to leave. \u201cI\u2019ll have someone come in and release you, and send you back to Tygeria.\u201d</p><p>He got as far as the door before Taz spoke again. \u201cI guess it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, this mating thing. If that\u2019s what you need to keep you from being a whore.\u201d</p><p>Stopping with his hand on the door, Kyle smiled a little before he turned back around. \u201cYou\u2019re a sweet talker, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d He took a step closer to the bed. \u201cSo are you saying you\u2019d like me to give you the mating bite? You want me to make love to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes to get you to come back home where you belong...and take over your responsibilities. I guess I could make that sacrifice. The baby needs a nobyo, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Do you want me to be your nobyo?\u201d Kyle asked softly.</p><p>Taz rolled his eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what I just said?\u201d</p><p>Kyle sat down on the bed beside him again. He took a key from his pocket and released Taz from the cuffs. He leaned over and kissed his forehead, his cheeks, his lips. Taz squirmed under his attention, and put a hand on his chest to push him gently away.</p> <p>\u201cStop\u2014I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Kyle wrapped a hand around his rapidly filling cock. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Taz ignored him. \u201cWell, how do we do this? Let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie down\u2014face down.\u201d Kyle took his shoulder and urged him to turn over in bed. Grumbling, he moved to his stomach and rose on one hand to look over his shoulder at Kyle, but Kyle pushed him back down. \u201cNo, just relax. Stay down.\u201d</p><p>Taz let out a long, put-upon breath, but did as he asked and turned back around, holding himself up on his elbows. \u201cHurry this up, will you?\u201d</p><p>Kyle smiled and took off his pants with hands that trembled with desire. He didn\u2019t want Taz to see how much he wanted this, and he didn\u2019t trust his voice right now. He shoved his pants and underwear down and stepped out of them, went to the small table beside his bed, and pulled out a small bottle of oil. He drizzled the cool, slippery liquid onto his hand and down between Taz\u2019s ass cheeks, stopping for a moment to admire the rounded ass. He massaged the lube into the crease, finding Taz\u2019s hole and enjoyed the needy little sounds coming from Taz\u2019s throat, the ones he was trying so hard to hold back.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d Kyle dipped a well-lubed finger inside. \u201cDoes that feel good?\u201d</p><p>Taz\u2019s back stiffened, but his breathing rate had increased noticeably. He nodded, keeping his face turned away. Kyle couldn\u2019t resist smacking his bottom. Taz jumped and cast an angry glare back at him.</p><p>\u201cSuch a beautiful ass,\u201d he murmured appreciatively, and Taz shrugged a bit.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, immodestly. \u201cTygerians have the most beautiful bodies of any species in the galaxies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrettier than mine?\u201d Kyle teased.</p><p>At first Kyle thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer, but he finally lifted one shoulder again. \u201cYours is quite\u2014nice\u2014for a Lycan.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Kyle added another finger and pumped in and out, twisting every few strokes and ignoring the squirming Taz began doing. Putting one hand down on the small of his back to keep him still, he searched gently with his fingers until he found what he was looking for, rubbing his fingers hard over the spot. Taz cried out and almost came off the bed. It was all Kyle could do to keep him on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that? What did you do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spot inside you that makes the pain worth it. Don\u2019t tell me you never felt that before. You showed it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied sullenly. \u201cHow would I know how it felt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you ever...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI knew it was there, but that\u2019s for nobyos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what you\u2019ve been missing?\u201d</p><p>Taz\u2019s eyes widened a bit and he slowly nodded. \u201cIt might have its merits. Perhaps when you come back home where you belong, I may allow you to touch me there again with your fingers. Now are we finished?\u201d</p><p>Kyle grinned. \u201cNot by a long shot, baby. Get up on your knees.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling, Taz rose to his knees and patiently moved his legs apart. \u201cGet on with this, Nobyo. I grow weary of it.\u201d</p><p>Kyle noticed the name he called him, and thrilled to hear it again, but he said nothing. Instead, he moved up to kneel behind him and poised the head of his cock against Taz\u2019s hole. \u201cReady, baby?\u201d Kyle asked, rubbing his hand over Taz\u2019s hip.</p><p>Taz nodded, tense again. He glanced over his shoulder and his voice was so quiet, Kyle had to strain to hear it. \u201cWill...will it hurt?\u201d His voice sounded a bit ragged.</p><p>Kyle hesitated. \u201cA little. But I\u2019ll try to make it good for you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed Taz\u2019s back and then slid inside him, the velvety tightness gripping his cock and squeezing it until Kyle gasped and he pulled out a little. \u201cLet me in, baby. You\u2019re so tight. Push out, okay? I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Taz was breathing rapidly, his whole body trembling with the effort to stay still and both hands gripping the sheet beneath him so hard Kyle figured his sheets would be torn to shreds before this was over. \u201cRelax, sweetheart. I want you to enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>Taz nodded and relaxed the tiniest bit. Kyle kissed his back and rubbed his hands down his sides, keeping his cock just inside, letting him adjust to it. Gradually, Taz began to relax his death-grip on the sheets.</p><p>Kyle reached beneath his body and took hold of Taz\u2019s softened cock, gently stroking it as it filled out in his hand. Taz groaned and a wave of tenderness washed over Kyle. \u201cLet me love you, baby. I only want to make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>Taz nodded, and Kyle continued stroking him. When he was hard, Kyle began pushing gently into his tight, little hole. Matching his movements to that of his hand, he set up a slow, gentle rhythm, and was able to push deeply inside Taz as his muscles relaxed. Kyle pressed his cheek to Taz\u2019s back. \u201cSo good, Taz,\u201d he said softly, and Taz pushed his butt back against Kyle\u2019s groin. He shifted his angle, found the sweet spot, and brushed over it again and again. Taz groaned loudly and arched his back.</p><p>Kyle began to move faster, unable to resist thrusting harder against him, and Taz reached behind him to put his hand on Kyle\u2019s hip. \u201cMore, Nobyo,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Kyle moaned, thrusting in and out as his hand curled around Taz\u2019s cock, moving over it faster. With a guttural cry, Taz came, spilling over Kyle\u2019s hand. Kyle\u2019s own orgasm rushed over him, and he thrust hard hard into Taz\u2019s ass, squeezing his cock at the same time. Kyle pulled Taz up so that his back was against his chest and bit him deeply on the back of the neck, sinking his fangs in his flesh. The orgasm intensified for both of them as Kyle came so hard he thought he might pass out. He put his head back and a howl ripped from his throat before he could stop it.</p><p>Taz\u2019s knees gave way and he collapsed to fall down on the bed. Kyle went with him, still inside him, and not really wanting to ever pull out. He sucked the blood as it seeped out, then licked the back of his neck where the blood was trickling down, kissing the spot over and over. Taz rolled on his side so that Kyle could spoon him, and they both lay still, trying to catch their breath. The bite mark had already started to heal over but it would leave a scar, marking Taz as his mate. He had made the bite mark high on his neck so it would always show that he\u2019d been claimed by his Lycan mate.</p><p>Kyle gazed over at that mate now. Taz was reacting to Kyle\u2019s bite and was already intoxicated by the venom and the force of his orgasm. His eyes were half closed, and he was breathing fast. Kyle knew that he would run a high fever now for at least a couple of hours, depending on his Tygerian metabolism. The venom wouldn\u2019t harm him, just change his body chemistry a bit. Most mates became stronger and even more beautiful from the effects. Damn, if Taz got any stronger or more handsome, Kyle wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be able to stand it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He eased over to his back and pulled the blanket over both of them. Wrapping an arm around his mate\u2019s waist, he sighed and decided to try and take a short nap until Taz awoke. For the first time in a long while, his wolf was content inside him, having finally staked his claim on this man. Kyle nuzzled his face in the back of Taz\u2019s neck and drifted down into sleep.</p><p>Hours later, he awoke to kisses on the side of his face and turned sleepily toward the source so that one fell directly on his lips. Kyle\u2019s eyes sprang open to see Taz leaning over him. He smiled up at him and stretched contentedly. \u201cHow do you feel, Taz-lan?\u201d</p><p>Taz\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cSo now you call me Taz-lan? A little late for that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Kyle lifted his head up and stole a quick kiss. \u201cNever. I claimed you as my mate, but I recognize you as my alpha.\u201d</p><p>Taz got a frown mark between his eyes. \u201cYour alpha, huh? So you finally plan to be my obedient nobyo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Taz-lan. I\u2019d like to go home with you and try, anyway. And I\u2019m dying to see our baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is quite handsome, of course. And very strong, though I think he needs his nobyo.\u201d He dropped another kiss on his lips and gazed down into Kyle\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think I need my nobyo too. If my nobyo thinks he can stay with me this time...\u201d He smiled, but his eyes still held a hint of pain.</p><p>Kyle slid his arms around Taz\u2019s neck, pulling his head back down. \u201cAlways,\u201d he murmured against his lips. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Taz nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d he said with satisfaction. \u201cNow let\u2019s see about going home where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could wait until morning,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cI can think of ways to pass the time till then.\u201d He pulled Taz down to him and proceeded to show him exactly what he was talking about for a long, long time.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Larsson was alone on the command deck, having volunteered to pilot the ship while the others got some rest. Kyle was below decks with his mate, and Larsson was glad things had worked out for them. He couldn\u2019t help being envious and wishing that he\u2019d been able to keep Tarr with him, but he tried not to think about it and put it out of his mind. He\u2019d been so close\u2014he almost got his hands on him again, only to have him slip away. He\u2019d find him again, though. He had to.</p><p>A sudden ding from the computer in front of him made him look down at the screen to see a message coming in addressed to him. They were in deep space, far from any space port. His entire family was with him onboard. There was only one person who could be sending him a message and his heart began to thump with excitement.</p><p>Trembling, he opened the message and saw at once that it was from Tarr.</p><p>Don\u2019t think this is over, Lycan. If my brother is harmed, I\u2019ll hold you personally responsible. I\u2019m coming for you, and once I have you, I\u2019ll never let you go. You can run from me, but you can\u2019t hide. It\u2019s only a matter of time.</p><p>Larsson grinned. \u201cMy sentiments exactly, sweetheart,\u201d he said softly, and he tapped out a brief message in reply.</p><p>Bring it.</p><p>Sinking back against his chair, he smiled softly to himself and relaxed for the first time that whole long day.</p><p>*THE END* </p> </body></html>"]
