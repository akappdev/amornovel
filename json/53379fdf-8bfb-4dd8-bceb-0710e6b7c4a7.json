Sheer exhaustion from the work she engaged in at the house on Dauphine Street. Sheer exhaustion had finally allowed her to drift off to sleep. The word, the whisper, was something she had conjured in her mind; she had been so desperate to hear it spoken again.</p> <p>Waking, not opening her eyes, she listened to what was real. The sound of musicians down the street, and the spattering of applause that followed their jazz numbers. The deep, sad heartbeat of the saxophone. The distant noise of the mule-driven carriages that took tourists around the historic French Quarter. Sometimes, the sound of laughter.</p><p>She breathed in the smell of pine cleaner, which they had been using on the house. Beneath it\u2014drifting in from the open French doors that led to the courtyard of the beautiful home\u2014was the sweet scent of the magnolia trees that grew against the rear wall. They\u2019d finally gotten their home in the French Quarter, with its subtle and underlying hint of strange days gone by.</p><p>Some said that it was haunted by those days, by that history, certainly not always so pleasant. This house had been, after all, owned by Madden C. Newton, the killer who had terrorized many a victim in the years following the Civil War. The tour group carriages rolled by with tales of ghosts and ghastly visions seen by previous owners. But neither she nor David believed in ghosts, and the house had been a steal. Now, of course, she longed with her whole heart to believe in ghosts. If they existed, she might see her Jacob again.</p><p>But ghosts were not real.</p><p>The house was a house. Brick, wood, mortar, lath, plaster and paint. She and David had both grown up on the \u201cother\u201d side of town; they had dreamed of owning such a house. They had, however, never dreamed that they would live in it alone.</p> <p>Yes, she knew what was real, and what wasn\u2019t. She was learning to live without the painkillers that had gotten her through the first months after Jacob had been lost. The painkillers had given her several strange visions, but none of them ghostly.</p><p>\u201cMommy.\u201d</p><p>But she heard the word, and she heard it clearly. She opened her eyes, and a scream froze in her throat.</p><p>A little boy stood there. A little boy just about Jacob\u2019s age, seven. He was dressed in Victorian-era breeches, a little vest and frock coat, knickers and boots.</p><p>And an ax blade cut into his skull, the shaft protruding from it. A trail of blood seeped down the sides of his face.</p><p>\u201cMommy, it hurts. It hurts so badly. Help me, Mommy,\u201d he said, looking at her with wide, blue, trusting eyes.</p> <p>She so desperately wanted to scream. She had seen her son in dreams, but this wasn\u2019t her son. She knew the stories about the house, knew about the murders that had taken place here just after the Civil War....</p><p>Yes, she knew, but at the worst of times, she hadn\u2019t had such strange and horrible visions.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t real.</p><p>Sounds emitted from her at last. Not screams. Just sounds. Sounds of terror, like the nonsense chatter of an infant. She wanted to scream.</p><p>\u201cMommy, please. Mommy, I need you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Jacob, and it wasn\u2019t Jacob\u2019s voice. And Jacob had been killed in a car accident six months ago; a drunk driver had nearly killed them all, veering over three lanes on I-10 late at night.</p><p>Jacob had died at the hospital, in her arms. He had been buried at Lafayette Cemetery, dressed in his baseball uniform, which he had loved so dearly. She wasn\u2019t hearing her son\u2019s voice.</p><p>Just his words.</p> <p>Mommy, it hurts. It hurts so badly. Help me, Mommy.</p><p>Jacob\u2019s words, those he had spoken when she had held him at the hospital, just seconds before the internal bleeding had taken his sweet, young life.</p><p>This was not Jacob.</p><p>No.</p><p>She closed her eyes, unable to scream. She prayed that David would come home, Senator David Holloway. Her husband, handsome, even, lucid, rational, wonderful, ever there for her in their shared grief. David could hold her, and she would find strength. He was due home. Dusk had come. Dusk, and yet, there had still been pink-and-yellow streaks remaining in the sky, casting light upon the dust motes that had danced in the room. Dust motes that became the image of a murdered child.</p><p>He would go away. He wasn\u2019t real. He was the result of the local lore about the house, that was all.</p><p>\u201cMommy, please, I need you. Please, just hold my hand.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. He hadn\u2019t gone away. He was standing there, anguished eyes on her, reproach and confusion in them. The boy was wondering how she could ignore him, stare at him with such horror in her own expression.</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not...not there,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMommy, don\u2019t leave me! I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m so scared. Take my hand, hold it, please, I\u2019m so scared!\u201d he said.</p><p>And then, the little boy reached out. She recoiled inwardly, sheets of icy fear sweeping through her with the rage of a storm. And then...</p><p>She felt the little hand. That little hand, reaching for hers. It was warm, it was vital, and it seemed so alive.</p><p>The fingers squeezed hers. She squeezed back.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Mommy,\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t scream. She managed words. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said.</p><p>Suddenly the twilight became infused with dust motes that sailed on pink-and-yellow ribbons of light, a palette fueled by the dying of the day. Soon, the harsh neon lights of night would take over on Bourbon Street, and the rock bands would reign over the plaintive drumbeat of jazz. Soon, David would come home, and she would hear some psychobabble about her imagining the ghost of a long-dead child to take the place of Jacob.</p><p>No one could take her son\u2019s place.</p><p>But suddenly she wasn\u2019t frightened. She needed to reassure a child.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be dark. See, outside, in the courtyard, it\u2019s going to be dark,\u201d the little boy said.</p><p>\u201cThere are lights everywhere. In the courtyard, on the gates,\u201d Regina said. \u201cI\u2019ll turn on the room light. I won\u2019t leave you in darkness.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, still feeling the cling of that little hand. She walked to the French doors; it was spring, and the air was so fresh and beautiful, as if newly washed, and the scent of flowers was in the air. The inhabitants of the Quarter loved to twine vines and set flowers out on their patios and balconies. For a moment, Regina inhaled deeply.</p><p>Yes, she was desperate. In so much pain. They would say that she was seeking a companion to make up for Jacob, not replace him. That sounded insane. She would never make up a little child with an ax sticking out of his head.</p><p>\u201cI love the courtyard, Mommy,\u201d he said, leading her.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s so pretty,\u201d she said. Hysteria started to rise in her again. She was thirty-five years old, and now she had an imaginary friend.</p><p>He looked at her again, leaning against the railing. Suddenly, it seemed that the light hit the child\u2019s great blue eyes strangely. There was a look of cunning in those eyes.</p><p>She thought she heard something behind her. She turned and frowned with confusion.</p><p>And then shock.</p><p>She was dimly aware of being pushed.</p><p>She was fully aware of falling.</p><p>Her scream tore from her lips at last, until it was cut off abruptly.</p><p>Skull shattered, neck broken, Regina lay dead with her eyes wide open.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Jackson Crow sat staring at the pile of dossiers before him. This was his first meeting with the man on the other side of the desk: Adam Harrison, white haired, dignified, slim and a taste for designer suits. The office was modest, nicely appointed, but far from opulent. Plate-glass windows looked over row houses in Alexandria, Virginia, and other companies with shared space in the building had names such as Brickell and Sons, Attorneys-at-Law, Chase Real Estate and B. K. Blake, Criminal Investigation.</p><p>Adam had just handed him the folders. \u201cJackson, do you have any idea of why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d returned to his old Behavioral Sciences Unit in D.C. to discover that he was being given a new assignment. His leave of absence, it seemed, was somehow permanent.</p><p>His last assignment, despite the excellent work done by him and his colleagues, had ended with three of them being dead. Yet if it hadn\u2019t been for his intuition, two other fellow agents might have died as well. Local police had not responded to the call sent out, and there was no way to blame himself.</p><p>Naturally, he did.</p><p>Maybe the empathy of his superiors had caused them to give him a new assignment, in a different place\u2014behind a desk.</p><p>He\u2019d heard things about Adam Harrison. He\u2019d worked solo over the years\u2014and for the government where the government could not act officially. Adam went in where others did not.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t because of extreme danger. Rather, it might be considered that he went in because of extreme weirdness.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cFirst, let me assure you, you are not being let go. You will still be working for Uncle Sam,\u201d Adam told him. \u201cThe assignments will come from me, but you\u2019ll be heading up the team. A new team.\u201d</p><p>A cushy job somewhere behind a desk that didn\u2019t involve serial killers, kidnapping or bodies discovered beneath concrete.</p><p>Jackson wasn\u2019t sure how he felt; numb, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cTake a look at this.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t had a chance to look at the files yet, but Adam now handed him a month-old New Orleans newspaper bearing the headline Wife of Senator David Holloway Dies from Fall into Courtyard.</p><p>He looked up at Adam.</p><p>\u201cRead the full article,\u201d Adam suggested.</p><p>He read silently.</p><p>Regina Holloway, the wife of beloved state Senator David Holloway, died yesterday in a fall from a balcony at their recently purchased French Quarter mansion on Dauphine Street. Six months ago, the Holloways lost their only son, Jacob, in an accident on I-10. While there is speculation that Regina cast herself over the balcony, David Holloway has strenuously denied such a possibility; his wife was doing well and coming to terms with their loss; they were planning on building a family again.</p><p>The police and the coroner\u2019s office have yet to issue an official cause of death. The house, one of the grand old Spanish homes in the Quarter, was once the killing ground of the infamous Madden C. Newton, the \u201ccarpet-bagger\u201d responsible for the torture slayings of at least twenty people. Less than ten years ago, a teenager who had broken into the then-empty house also perished in a fall; the coroner\u2019s office ruled his death accidental. The alleged drug dealer had raced into the vacant house to elude police. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An uneasy feeling swept over Jackson, but he calmly set the newspaper back on the desk and looked at Adam Harrison.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tragic story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds likely that the poor woman did commit suicide, and the senator is in denial. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve seen other instances in which a woman could not accept the loss of her child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany people are insistent that the house is haunted,\u201d Adam said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that a ghost committed this murder?\u201d Jackson asked. He leaned forward in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m not at all sure I believe in ghosts, Adam. And if they did exist, wouldn\u2019t they be things of mist and imagination? Hardly capable of tossing a woman over a balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe senator has friends in high places, though he\u2019s still only a state senator. He absolutely insists that his wife did not commit suicide,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cDoes he suspect murder?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cThe house was locked, no lower windows were open, and the gate to the courtyard was locked as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone could have crawled over the wall or gotten through the gate,\u201d Jackson suggested.</p> <p>Adam nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s possible, of course. But no witnesses have come forward in the past month to suggest that such a thing might have happened. The death was determined to be a suicide fairly quickly. Are you familiar with the city of New Orleans, the French Quarter or Vieux Carr\u00e9, specifically?\u201d</p><p>An ironic smile curled Jackson\u2019s features. \u201cLand of vampires, ghosts, voodoo and fantasy. But some of the world\u2019s best cooking, and some truly great music, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then. You work in behavioral science. Don\u2019t you agree that people\u2019s beliefs can create actions and reactions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Son of Sam... Berkowitz believed that howling dogs were demons commanding him to kill. Or, it was a damn good defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways a skeptic,\u201d Adam said. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019re not really, are you?\u201d Now, Adam smiled.</p><p>\u201cI am a skeptic, yes. Am I open to possibility? Yes,\u201d Jackson said carefully.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, both of your parents were amazing believers,\u201d Adam reminded him. Jackson hesitated.</p><p>Yes, they had been believers, both of them, always believing in a higher power, and it didn\u2019t matter what path someone took to that power. Jeremiah Crow had been born a member of the Cheyenne Nation, although his ancestry had been so mixed God alone knew exactly what it was. He had loved the spiritualism of his People, and his mother had loved it as well. Nominally Anglican, his mother had once told him that religion wasn\u2019t bad; it was meant to be very good. Men corrupted religion; and a man\u2019s religious choice didn\u2019t matter in the least if it was his path to decency and remembering his fellow man.</p><p>But his maternal grandmother had come from the Highlands of Scotland, and her tales of witches and pixies and ghosts had filled his childhood. Maybe that\u2019s why it had been while he was in the Highlands, and not on his Native American dream quest, that he had found himself in a position to question life and death and eternity, and all that fell in between.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here because you are the perfect man for this team, Jackson,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to refuse to investigate what seems like the impossible, but you\u2019re also not going to assume a ghost is the culprit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. So you want me to go to New Orleans and find out exactly why this woman died? You do realize there\u2019s a good chance that, no matter what the husband wants to believe, she committed suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Jackson, most people will believe that she committed suicide. It is the most obvious answer. But I want the truth. Senator Holloway has given his passion to many critical committees in our country. He has made things happen often when the rest of the country sits around twiddling its collective thumbs. He is a man who can weigh the economy and the environment, and come up with solutions. He wants the truth. He\u2019s young in politics, barely forty, and if he doesn\u2019t bury himself in grief, he will continue to serve the American people with something our politicians have lacked heavily in the past fifty years\u2014complete integrity. People in Washington need him, and I\u2019m asking that you lead the group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s my assignment, I\u2019ll take it on,\u201d Jackson paused. \u201cBut...do I really need a unit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so. I\u2019m giving you a group to dispel or perhaps prove the existence of ghosts in the house. They all have their expertise as investigators as well.\u201d</p> <p>He was quiet, and Adam continued, \u201cWhen several members of your last unit were killed, you got to the ranch house quickly enough to save Lawson and Donatello. No one knew where the Pick-Man was killing his victims. No one knew that he had arranged for your agents to be at the ranch house.\u201d</p><p>Jackson felt his jaw lock, and despite the time he had taken for leave, he swallowed hard. They\u2019d lost good agents. Among them Sally Jennings, forty-five, experienced, and yet vulnerable no matter how many years of service she had seen.</p><p>He\u2019d felt that he\u2019d seen Sally; dreamed that he\u2019d seen her, standing there at the house.</p><p>And it had been that dream that had brought him to the ranch house, and there he had discovered that she had been the first to die.</p><p>\u201cI shot the Pick-Man,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the only chance Lawson and Donatello had, since, had he seen you before you warned him and fired to kill, he\u2019d have put that pick through Donatello\u2019s chest,\u201d Adam said. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve watched you for years, Jackson. I actually knew your parents.\u201d</p><p>That was surprising.</p><p>Adam might well have known about the event when Jackson had been riding near Stirling, Scotland, and been thrown. His friends had gone on, thinking that he had left them; that he\u2019d won the race and the bet. He\u2019d encountered a stranger after, one who had saved his life. And then....</p><p>It had been long ago.</p><p>And yet, hell. He\u2019d spent his life debunking ghost stories and dreams like the one he\u2019d had. Finding the truth behind them. Proving that the plantation in Virginia was \u201chaunted\u201d by a cousin of the owner who wanted him out of the estate. Proving that there were no ghosts prowling the Rocky Mountains, that a human being named Andy Sitwell was the Pick-Man, even if he supposedly believed that the ghost of an old gold-seeking mountaineer was causing him to commit murder.</p><p>Six months had passed since he had shot and killed the Pick-Man. Six months in which he had tried to mourn the loss of his coworkers. He\u2019d been back to Scotland to visit his mother\u2019s family, and he\u2019d spent a month with his father\u2019s family\u2014helping them organize their new casinos and hotels.</p><p>But he was ready to get back into the kind of work for which he knew he had a talent. Digging. Following clues. Whether it meant studying history, people, beliefs or a trail of blood. He was good at it.</p><p>He had the mind for it, and the mind for the kind of unit Adam Harrison was putting together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m open to possibilities,\u201d he said to Adam. \u201cPossibilities\u2014there are a lot of people out there manipulating spiritualism and making a lot of money off the concept of ghosts.\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s true, and I actually like your skepticism. As far as believing in ghosts, well, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not important. I\u2019ve got you scheduled for a flight into Louis Armstrong International Airport at nine tomorrow morning. Is that sufficient time to allow you to get your situation here in order?\u201d</p><p>His situation here?</p><p>The apartment in Crystal City had little in it. All right, a damn decent entertainment center because he loved music and old movies. A closet of adequate and workable clothing. Pictures of the family and friends he had lost.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSure. What about these?\u201d He lifted the file folders, the dossiers on his new unit. \u201cWhen do I meet the crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll arrive tomorrow and Wednesday,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the dossiers; read up on them first. I figured you might want the house all to yourself for a few hours. Angela arrives first\u2014she\u2019ll get in tomorrow evening around six. You\u2019ll know who they all are when they arrive if you\u2019ve done the reading.\u201d Adam stood, a clear sign that the interview had come to an end. \u201cThank you for taking this on,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDid I actually have a choice?\u201d he asked with a rueful grin.</p><p>Adam returned the grin. Jackson was never really going to know.</p><p>He started out of the office. Adam called him back.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you have a gift for this, Jackson. And you can really take on anything you want.\u201d</p><p>Jackson wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, either. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cI know you will. And I know that we\u2019ll all know what really happened in that house on Dauphine.\u201d</p><p>X-Files. The thought came to Jackson\u2019s mind as he finished with Adam Harrison.</p><p>He went down to his car, still wondering exactly what it was he was getting into.</p><p>Yeah, it was sounding like the X-Files. Or Ghost-files.</p><p>And he was going to have Ghost-file helpers. Great.</p><p>In his car, he glanced through the dossiers, scanning the main, introductory page of each. Angela Hawkins, Whitney Tremont, Jake Mallory, Jenna Duffy and Will Chan. The first woman, at least, was coming from a Virginia police force. Whitney Tremont had started out life in the French Quarter; she had a Creole background and had recently done the camera work for a paranormal cable-television show. Jake Mallory\u2014musician, but a man who had been heavily involved in searches after the summer of storms, and been called in as well during kidnapping cases and disappearances. Then there was Jenna Duffy. A registered nurse from Ireland. Well, they\u2019d be covered in case of any poltergeist attacks. And Will Chan\u2014the man had worked in theater, and as a magician.</p><p>It was one hell of a strange team.</p><p>Whatever, Jackson figured; it was time he went back to work. There was one thing he\u2019d discovered to be correct\u2014the truth was always out there, you just had to find it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The house seemed to hold court on the corner. It sat on Dauphine, one block in back of Bourbon and three or four blocks in from Esplanade. The location was prime\u2014just distant enough to keep the noise down in the wee hours of the morning when the music on Bourbon Street pulsed like an earthly drum, and still close enough to the wonders of the city.</p><p>The actual shape was like a horseshoe; a massive wooden gate gave entry to the courtyard, while the main entrance on Dauphine offered a sweeping curve of stairs to the front downstairs porch and a double-door entry that was historic and fantastic in its carvings.</p><p>Jackson turned the key in the lock. As he stepped in, the alarm began to chirp and he quickly keyed in the code he had been given.</p> <p>\u201cStraight out of Gone with the Wind,\u201d Jackson murmured aloud as he surveyed the house. \u201cTara meets city streets.\u201d The front room here served as an elegant reception area, perhaps even a ballroom at one point in time. He could almost see Southern belles in their elegant gowns swirling around, led by handsome men in frock coats. A piano sat to the far end near an enormous hearth with tiled backing and a marble mantel. A second, identical fireplace was at the other end of the wall. Midroom was the grand, curving staircase.</p><p>What furniture remained was covered in dust sheets.</p><p>The hallway on the second floor led to the right and left as he headed up.</p><p>He moved on around an ell and came to a long hallway of bedrooms. Here. At the end.</p><p>This was the room.</p> <p>He turned on the light. It seemed to be completely benign, a pretty room, one that had already been prepared for occupancy\u2014or that had been occupied. A beautiful four-poster canopy bed sat on a Persian rug, covered in white. Handsome deco dressing tables sat to either side of the room, and large French doors, draped in white chintz and lace, opened out to the balcony that wrapped around the house as it faced the courtyard. Would he feel anything? He did not.</p><p>He walked over to the French doors and threw them open, stepping out on the balcony.</p><p>The courtyard below explained why a house that came with such a tragic history could still win over buyer after buyer. It was paved with brick, and in the center, typical of New Orleans, was a fountain and sculpture. A beautiful crane spread its metal wings above the bowl and the water splashed melodically below it into a large basin.</p><p>There was a car park to the side, and elegant little wrought-iron tables, shaded by colorful umbrellas, sat across from them. He realized that the kitchen and dining room were behind the round tables, and that food could easily be passed out from the kitchen through a pass-over counter area. He wasn\u2019t sure that had been part of the original house. He was going to have to study the blueprints again.</p><p>The only thing that marred the beauty stretched before him was the chalk mark down on the bricks where Regina Holloway had lain after she had fallen.</p><p>And died.</p> <p>The blood stain had been cleaned, and yet it seemed to remain.</p><p>The courtyard was closed in by the house itself, and by a nine-foot brick wall, and the double wooden gate, large enough to let a car in. But the gate was locked, and it had a key-in pad the same as the main entrances to the house. Senator Holloway had never been a fool; the alarm had gone in the second his signature had been dry on purchase papers. All this Jackson knew because he had read the police reports on the \u201csuicide.\u201d</p><p>He noted, though, that it would be almost impossible to reach the wall from the end of the house. There was a good four feet between the end of the balcony and the wall; a statue of Poseidon with a trident was positioned there, so it would be a pleasant fall if one were to attempt a leap\u2014and not make it. But, again\u2014not impossible.</p><p>Just so damn improbable.</p><p>Maybe it was a good case for his first back in the working world; it was incredibly sad to think about the death of Regina Holloway, but he could hardly begin to imagine the loss she must have felt. He\u2019d seen it before. Parents weren\u2019t supposed to outlive their children. Any loss of a child was unbearable.</p><p>He heard the doorbell ringing and grimaced, thinking that the house had definitely been built at a time when the third floor housed a number of servants; the main entrance was a good distance from this wing. But he was expecting Detective Andy Devereaux, so he left the balcony and the room, pausing one minute in the doorway. Still, he felt nothing. The room was just a room. He hurried on back to the front door.</p><p>Andy Devereaux was a tall man, light mahogany in color, with powder-blue eyes that testified to his mixed heritage, if the attractive shading of his skin did not. He was bald, clean-shaven, fit and trim and tall. He wore a baseball cap to protect his pate, jeans and a tailored shirt beneath a casual, zip-up jacket. He offered Jackson a firm handshake when they met.</p><p>\u201cDetective Andrew Devereaux, Andy, to my friends,\u201d he said briefly.</p> <p>\u201cJackson\u2014first name, not last\u2014and that\u2019s what I am to my friends,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cThanks so much for meeting me here.\u201d</p><p>Devereaux nodded grimly. \u201cHey, I\u2019d do anything I could for the senator and his family. It\u2019s a crying shame about Regina. A sweeter woman never drew breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on in, and just give me the lay of the land, will you? I got as far as Regina\u2019s master bedroom at the end of the horseshoe,\u201d Jackson told him.</p><p>Devereaux stepped into the house, removing the Saints cap that had shielded his eyes and sticking it into his jacket pocket after unzipping it. When the jacket front moved, Jackson could see that the man was on duty\u2014and armed.</p><p>\u201cYou know the history of the house, right?\u201d Andy asked him.</p><p>\u201cBasically, the \u2018ghost\u2019 stories began back after the Civil War. And, apparently, there have been a number of suicides, or murders made to look like suicides, since then,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cYep. You\u2019d never know it, though, standing in this parlor,\u201d Andy said. \u201cRich folks keep buying the place. It\u2019s usually a good deal. One time, it went higher than a kite\u2014folks were trying to buy places like this, chock-full of stories. Though before Senator Holloway bought the house, it had been empty for several years. Before that, it was bought by some hotshot New York banker. The fellow wanted to make a haunted bed-and-breakfast out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And one of his first guests wound up dead\u2014in the courtyard\u2014and he sold out, right?\u201d Jackson asked. He hadn\u2019t read all the material on the house\u2014that would have taken several years. But he\u2019d gotten the gist of what had gone down.</p><p>\u201cThat one was cut-and-dried, too, I\u2019m pretty damn sure, though I was still a kid in high school when it happened. Apparently, the banker was expecting all the people who oohed and aahed over a good ghost story. What he got was a fellow who had just had his life seized by the IRS. Man\u2019s wife left him, and his kids disowned him. Guess he figured it would be a good place to check in\u2014and check out. There was lots of whispering when it happened,\u201d Andy said. \u201cBut, from what I understand, the police work that was done was solid back then, too. That was about fifteen years ago, now. Place was sitting around, mostly all renovated but covered in dust, when Senator Holloway bought it. His son was killed in an accident soon after, which set them back on the renovations, for want of a better way to put it. He and his wife had just started fixing up the place until a couple of weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe senator is absolutely convinced that she didn\u2019t commit suicide,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Andy grimaced, angling his head to the side. \u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat a ghost pushed her over the balcony?\u201d</p><p>Jackson shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just here to explore every possibility. I don\u2019t believe that ghosts push people to their deaths. I do believe that people do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alarm never went off. No one tampered with the locks. Maybe Mrs. Holloway let someone in, but how did he get out? I suppose it\u2019s possible that someone scaled the wall, but hopping down? He\u2019d have surely broken a few bones,\u201d Andy said.</p><p>\u201cUnless he had help from the outside,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t say that something of the kind is impossible, but I can tell you that we searched this place up and down and inside out. There was just no evidence, no evidence whatsoever that anyone else was ever in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>Jackson shrugged and grimaced. \u201cI work for the man. I go where I\u2019m told,\u201d he said. And it was pretty much so the truth. The last thing he wanted to do was offend a good officer who had probably made all the right moves. Hell, he wanted the police on his side\u2014and because they wanted to be, not because they had been told they had to be.</p><p>\u201cThing is,\u201d Andy told him, \u201cwe all wish to hell there was something that we could tell him. Senator Holloway is a fellow who isn\u2019t all talk, air out the backside, you know what I mean? Not many can keep their souls once they get into politics. He\u2019s rare. He\u2019s one of the few representatives the people have faith in these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he must have enemies,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhat about the people around him? Anybody have arguments with his wife? Someone who wanted something from him, and she might have been the naysayer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know about. David Holloway insisted it wasn\u2019t anybody close to him,\u201d Andy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about household staff?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cThere were two maids. They were employed full time, nine to five, but they\u2019re not working anymore. I\u2019ll get you the files on them,\u201d Andy told him. \u201cAnd those closest to the family. That would include the chauffeur, a fellow named Grable Haines, and...\u201d He was thoughtful for a minute, scratching his chin. \u201cWell, most importantly, the senator\u2019s aide, Martin DuPre. He can help you with other things you might want to know. He\u2019s with the senator all the time. Then there\u2019s Blake Conroy. He\u2019s Senator Holloway\u2019s bodyguard. I\u2019ve got those files all set for you.\u201d He studied Jackson for a minute. \u201cI\u2019ve got two shootings and an apparent drug overdose right now, but I\u2019m here to help you anytime you want. You get top priority. I can even drop the files by.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andy Devereaux was telling the truth when he said that he liked the senator; Jackson wasn\u2019t sure that investigating what had already been investigated and ruled a suicide was more important than the other cases in his workload.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bother you as little as possible,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cYou bother me when you need to. I understand there are others coming?\u201d Andy asked.</p> <p>\u201cFive,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey\u2019re here to inspect the house, more than anything else. A woman named Angela Hawkins is due tonight. She\u2019s good at talking to people, so she\u2019ll probably have a few conversations with the senator and those around him. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s inspecting the house going to do?\u201d Andy asked. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that our forensics people are damn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a problem in the world believing that,\u201d Jackson assured him. \u201cAnd that means you know this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Andy told him. Hands on his hips, he looked around. \u201cIt sure is a beautiful place. No one mucked it up too much, modernizing it. Back before the 1880s, the kitchen was on the outside. They attached the place after that point, according to the plans. Added the second two stories over there, and added it all on together. It became an academy for young ladies in the 1890s, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there was a suicide. One of the girls went out a third-story window,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done your reading,\u201d Andy said approvingly. \u201cSome say there was just an evil presence in the house, and it caused people to do bad things. The local rags picked it up at the time. There\u2019s rumor the girl was pregnant, but there wasn\u2019t an autopsy on her. The parents wanted her interred right off, and they were rich and they got their way. The records still exist, they just don\u2019t say much,\u201d Andy told him. \u201cI\u2019ve got copies of all the old stuff at the station\u2014the house has become a bit of an obsession for me.\u201d He paused for a minute, and then said, \u201cI guess that history is why you ghost people are here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not ghost people,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Andy shrugged. \u201cSure. But it\u2019s odd, I\u2019ll say that. It all goes back to Madden C. Newton. He was pure evil, and evil doesn\u2019t just go away.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>No one answered Angela Hawkins\u2019s knock on the door. She\u2019d arrived at twilight. For a moment, she appreciated the fine lines of the house, and the size of it. She\u2019d been in New Orleans plenty of times before, and she had always loved the city and the architecture.</p><p>But Jackson Crow was supposed to have been there.</p> <p>She had a key, but she didn\u2019t want to take him by surprise. He had been an ace agent who had brought down one of the country\u2019s most heinous serial killers of recent times.</p><p>He might be quick on the draw.</p><p>Hopefully, a member of the Behavioral Science Unit of the bureau would have the sense not to shoot her, but she did know that he\u2019d been out on leave, and she really didn\u2019t want to die that way.</p><p>She knocked again, saw the bell and rang it, and waited, and no one came. He was in the city, she knew, because she\u2019d received a terse text from him. At the house. She hadn\u2019t even known how to reply. Good? Good for you, hope you\u2019re comfortable?</p><p>About to board the plane, seemed the simplest response.</p><p>She checked her phone. She had received another text from him. At the station.</p><p>What station? She had to assume he meant the police station. Wherever, he wasn\u2019t here. She used her key and entered the house.</p><p>She paused in the entry, the door still open, hoping that the atmosphere inside wasn\u2019t overwhelming. It wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t depressing. The room was simply beautiful, huge, and when she flicked the switch by the door, a glittering chandelier dead center came to life, casting glorious prisms of light about the room. Amazing that something so beautiful could have remained so for almost two hundred years. People had a tendency to destroy the old to make way for the new, something that was sometimes necessary. But that progress had kept the house so pristine and so unchanged it was just short of miraculous.</p> <p>She left her luggage and carry-on at the door, pausing to delve into her bag for the book she read on the plane. It was a little out-of-print bargain she had managed to acquire from a show with which she traded frequently. One nice thing about her side job was that her antiques business created a network of friends with strange and awesome things\u2014including books. Might as well find a place to wait until Jackson chose to show himself.</p><p>Departing the entrance hall was like entering a different home; the foyer might have remained in limbo for centuries, while here the modern world had burst in hard. An entertainment room caught her eye. She didn\u2019t have a good sense of dimension, and could only think that the TV screen was huge; it was surrounded by cabinets that offered all manner of audiovisual equipment. Here, too, there was plenty of space for visitors; there was a wet bar\u2014just in case the kitchen, right around the corner, she believed, was too far\u2014a refrigerator, microwave station and a half-dozen plush chairs, recliners and sofas. Entertainment had definitely been done right.</p><p>Moving into the kitchen, she was met with a pleasant surprise. The room was absolutely beautiful, remodeled and state-of-the-art with an enormous butcher-block workstation in the center with rows of pots and pans and cooking utensils above it on wire stainless-steel hangers. The sink and counter area had a large window that was a bypass to a counter outside on the courtyard. There was a massive refrigerator-freezer combination, dishwasher, trash compactor, microwave, all manner of mixers, and all was shining and immaculate.</p><p>The senator\u2019s wife had intended to entertain, so it seemed.</p><p>There were eight chairs around the kitchen table, and Angela drew one out and took a seat. She opened the book she had found\u2014her true treasure trove of information on the house.</p><p>In 1888, Jack the Ripper terrorized the denizens of White-chapel; in 1896, the man known as H. H. Holmes was hanged, having confessed to the serial killings of at least twenty-seven victims before he was hanged. Before that, New Orleans had its own monster, Madden Claiborne Newton. While the mystery of the identity of Jack the Ripper makes him one of the most notorious fiends to find his way into the pages of history, Holmes far surpassed his body count\u2014as did Madden C. Newton.</p><p>Angela paused. She looked around the kitchen and felt nothing. It was so modern. Yet, this was still the home in which the atrocities had taken place.</p><p>She flipped a few pages.</p><p>Newton\u2019s first murder (in New Orleans, at least) was suspected to be that of Nathaniel Petti, the bankrupt planter from whom he had purchased the property. Nathaniel Petti was a desperate man, selling his New Orleans \u201ctownhome\u201d to Newton for whatever he could. He had already lost the family plantation on the river, and while Lincoln\u2019s plan after the Civil War had been that the North should \u201cforgive their Southern brethren,\u201d the death of the strong and humane leader left many in the country in a mood for vengeance, and the laws during Reconstruction were often brutal on the native inhabitants of the South. Such was the case in New Orleans. Nathaniel was being taxed into the grave. He disappeared after the sale to Newton, who was newly arrived from New York City. Petti\u2019s wife and child had died during the war years, and the official assumption\u2014if there were such a thing at the time\u2014was that Petti had left, unable to bear the pain of being in New Orleans. While martial law became civil law, politics created almost as much of a war as that which had been fought. While the Freedman Act became law, the \u201cold guard\u201d of the South rose, and organizations such as the KKK came to life. Race riots in 1866 cost more than a hundred souls their lives, and there could be little worry given to the fact that one disenfranchised man had disappeared.</p><p>This set the stage for Madden C. Newton to begin his reign of terror.</p><p>To this day, it is not known whether or not he killed Petti; what is known is that Petti disappeared, and the motto of the day for the Reconstruction populace was, \u201cGood riddance!\u201d</p><p>Angela twisted the book to read the old, fraying dust jacket. It had been written by a man named James Stuart Douglas, born and bred in New Orleans in 1890, when the Civil War, and the era of Reconstruction, would have been fresh in historical memory. There was definitely a bit of skew in his telling of the story.</p><p>According to Douglas, the killer, Newton, found those who had newly arrived in the city, and offered them a place to stay. He also found those who were suddenly homeless\u2014apt to leave the city and look for an income somewhere else. The first known murder had been of the Henderson family from Slidell. They had been about to leave for the North, searching for a place where Mr. Henderson could find work. His son, Percy, had been twelve; his daughter, Annabelle, had been ten. All four of the Hendersons had perished after accepting Newton\u2019s offer of hospitality. The children had been brutally killed with an ax in the room where they had slept; Mr. and Mrs. Henderson had died after being tied to chairs in the basement, cut to ribbons and allowed to bleed to death. Newton had found watching people bleed to death particularly stimulating. Before Newton\u2019s execution, twenty-three known victims later, he described his crimes, and told police where to find most of the bodies.</p><p>Angela stopped reading again. No wonder the house was on all the ghost tours in the city.</p><p>Darkness had come. She reminded herself that she wasn\u2019t afraid of the dark.</p><p>Maybe that wasn\u2019t true\u2014here. The house suddenly seemed to be alive with shadows. It was probably a bad idea to read the book when she was alone and night was coming on. She wasn\u2019t really afraid of the dark, but she didn\u2019t want to start seeing things in her mind\u2019s eye that weren\u2019t there.</p><p>She sat still for a minute, thinking about the past. She could recall the day of the plane crash she had survived\u2014but which had killed her parents and everyone else on board\u2014at any given time.</p><p>So clearly.</p><p>She was incredibly lucky to be alive.</p><p>Alive and still so aware of the strange events that had occurred when she had opened her eyes with flames and sirens all around her... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A doctor had told her once that strange things could happen when the neurons in the brain were affected, causing such things as the \u201clight\u201d so many people with near-death experiences saw, so, according to him, she hadn\u2019t seen the \u201clight\u201d of spirits leaving their mortal forms; she had experienced neurons crashing in her head. After her sessions with the doctor, she had learned to keep quiet. Nor did she ever explain why it seemed that sometimes she had more than intuition. She\u2019d always had a good grip on the world\u2014in many ways there were very thin lines between the truth and insanity. People\u2019s perception of the truth was often the difference between leading a normal and productive life\u2014and having someone lock you up for your own welfare.</p><p>Adam Harrison seemed to be different, as had many of the officers she had worked with at the police force in Virginia. She had become known for her use of logic, careful study of a crime scene and the victim, and the possible personality of the perpetrator or perpetrators. Police officers tended to believe in intuition; good detectives always seemed to rely upon gut instinct.</p><p>Sometimes, she had almost been frightened of herself. But she had to tamp down the fear; good could come when she allowed the thoughts and \u201cinstincts\u201d to run through her.</p> <p>Take the Abernathy case. The one in which she had really made a difference. The baby had been kidnapped by kids just wanting to make money. Two teens, seventeen and sixteen. They\u2019d easily managed to steal the baby from the babysitter. But they\u2019d buried the little boy, and if she hadn\u2019t come to the house, if she hadn\u2019t added it all up\u2014no break-in, no signs of disturbance, no prints or even smudges on the windowsill\u2014and felt certain that the child was close, they might never have found the baby, buried in the crate right in the backyard. She would never forget the joy in the mother\u2019s face when they had dug up that baby, and she had heard her awaken at last and cry....</p><p>She had entered the mind of the Virginia Stalker, and found the remains of Valerie Abreu, allowing the courts the evidence to put the man away.</p><p>There were battles, of course, that she couldn\u2019t win. Life was full of them.</p><p>She had lost her parents. And she had lost Griffin.</p><p>Griffin, her fianc\u00e9, had died in her arms, with his mother softly sobbing at his side. Cancer was as cruel as any enemy she could ever face and she had been helpless against the disease. Griffin, who had seemed to understand her and love her for all that she was.</p> <p>But Griffin had found peace, and Griffin had loved her. He told her that she had a special gift, and that she should always use it to the best of her ability.</p><p>Yes, she had a gift. And now she had knowledge and experience. The police academy had saved her and she\u2019d served with the force as an officer just before the call had come from her superiors, informing her that she\u2019d been asked to meet with a \u201cFederal\u201d man named Adam Harrison.</p><p>Thanks to her time with the police, she now dared to take chances she might not have before.</p><p>She stood up, determined to know, now, while she was in the house alone, why the area was driving her so crazy, making her feel so uncomfortable. Some of the houses in the French Quarter actually had basements, she remembered. Getting a better sense of the physical place would definitely be the logical move to make now.</p><p>The French Quarter was barely above sea level, but it was \u201chigh ground\u201d for the area. The basement was only halfway below the ground, and its roof was the floor where she stood now. She still needed to spend time studying the original blueprints of the house first.</p><p>But she felt a draw she couldn\u2019t withstand.</p> <p>Angela walked toward the door and turned the handle.</p><p>The door opened, and darkness stretched before her. The basement.</p><p>Andy Devereaux appeared to be easy and low-key, something that probably served him well when interrogating suspects. His voice lulled. He was soft-spoken. Everything about him seemed easy\u2014except that he had the sharpest gaze known to man. And like a lazy-looking, tail-twitching great cat, he could move in the blink of an eye. The uniformed officers at the station seemed to like and respect him.</p><p>Jackson stayed at the station long enough to meet some of the district personnel with whom he might come in contact when exploring all angles of the Holloway case, and then Andy drove him back to the house on Dauphine. Jackson realized that he was lucky; Devereaux seemed to like him.</p><p>Andy loved the city of New Orleans, and he loved being a cop. He wanted Jackson to understand the city, and the police force. \u201cThis department is a damn good one, and believe me, it\u2019s had its ups and downs, and we still go through some hell now and then\u2014God knows, things that test a man\u2019s patience to the core. Katrina, the oil spill\u2014we just get on our feet again and get knocked down, so you\u2019ve got destruction, desperation and poverty, and all of them clashing together. Some folks love the city, some folks just sweep down to make a living on the misfortunes of others. We had a force down here early on, early 1800s, and then just like now, some years were good, the city was organized and reorganized\u2014the French Quarter, Vieux Carr\u00e9, that\u2019s the original city\u2014but the Marigny came in on it early, just like the area we call the CBD now, Central Business District. And the Americans came in to form the Garden District\u2014or the \u2018English\u2019 area. Anyway, they get a police force going, but along came the Civil War. By 1862, the Union had taken over and you have military rule. Then, the war ends, and carpetbaggers sweep down. Lincoln is dead, and Johnson isn\u2019t really sure he wants black men to be equal with white men, but the ball is rolling. For years, that ball bounces up and down, equality\u2014kill the upstart Africans\u2014equality, no not really, just don\u2019t own the man.\u201d He glanced sideways at Jackson. \u201cI don\u2019t have any chips on my shoulder. History is history,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cRemember when we were talking earlier and you asked me if I believed that a ghost had pushed Regina Holloway over the balcony? Well, I said no, and I meant it. But I think that people can play on the emotions of others with the power of suggestion, and the history of the house is tremendously important in that respect. And the history of the New Orleans police force fits right in there, because everything written about Madden C. Newton suggests that he managed to get away with all those murders because the city was in such a knot\u2014emotionally, socially and governmentally\u2014when he was committing the killings.\u201d</p><p>Andy nodded and pulled the car to a stop on the side of Dauphine in front of the house. \u201cBest hamburgers in the world about three blocks from here on Esplanade,\u201d he said. \u201cA place called Port of Call. Seriously, best burgers anywhere, and best potatoes, go figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d Jackson said, exiting the unmarked police car.</p> <p>Andy drove off.</p><p>Shadows had settled around the house. Though it was in excellent shape, it carried a poignant hint of the decaying elegance that made up so much of the city.</p><p>He walked up the steps to the porch\u2014Angela Hawkins should have arrived by now. He unlocked the front door, calling out, \u201cHello,\u201d as he did so, not wanting to startle anyone with his presence. He stepped into the grand ballroom or parlor. The great chandelier was lit, casting a haunting glow over the sheet-draped furniture.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he called out.</p><p>The woman was here; a big shoulder bag and a carry-on suitcase sat by the door. She traveled like a cop, he noted. Light.</p><p>\u201cMiss Hawkins?\u201d he said, his voice loud and strong.</p><p>Still, there was no answer. Of course, the place was huge.</p><p>He went up the stairs first, following the horseshoe, thinking she might be choosing a bedroom for the stay. But she wasn\u2019t upstairs, so he came down to the kitchen. \u201cMiss Hawkins?\u201d he said again. She wasn\u2019t there either, but she\u2019d left a book on the table; an old one. He looked at the title. Madden C. Newton:</p><p>The True Story of New Orleans\u2019s Own Jekyll and Hyde.</p><p>He leafed through it. Interesting, and surely, almost impossible to acquire.</p><p>Where the hell was she?</p><p>The courtyard caught his eye, and he looked out, for a moment dreading the possibility that he might see a body smashed and broken on the ground. But there was no one outside\u2014no bodies lay on the bricks. \u201cMiss Hawkins?\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, he heard a whack. The sound was hard. Like an ax hitting wood, or...a pickax slamming into hard ground.</p><p>He hurried to the nearest door and threw it open, once again, strange and deadly visions coming to his mind despite his perpetual search for rationality.</p><p>She found the ghost of the ultimate evil in man. Madden C. Newton. And the ghost had taken form and shape, and was hacking up the elusive Miss Hawkins...</p><p>Whack, whack, whack.</p><p>\u201cMiss Hawkins!\u201d</p><p>Wooden stairs led down to a shallow basement. Someone indeed had a pickax, and looked as crazy as all hell.</p><p>Angela Hawkins was attacking the floor with a pickax and a vengeance. The dry dirt floor just beneath the staircase.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d He might have been a fool to race down the stairs to accost her\u2014she knew how to hold an ax. The basement held an incongruous sight. Angela was about five foot eight and slender, though shapely. Despite her height, she was almost fragile in appearance. She paused for a moment, staring at him with enormous, bright blue eyes that belonged on an anime character.</p><p>Ah, great! He was being given the nut-job assignment. He should have said no. He should have just resigned, and headed off to work the casinos.</p><p>Angela remained frozen for a second longer, obviously a bit disconcerted by being discovered at her task.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014hi! I\u2019m Angela Hawkins. You must be Jackson Crow.\u201d Maintaining a grip on the pickax with her left hand, she offered her right in a strong handshake.</p><p>\u201cYes, hi, nice to meet you.\u201d The words seemed a bit ridiculous. At least she wasn\u2019t swinging the ax at him.</p><p>He hoped he betrayed nothing in his expression. Did she know about him? That he had taken down the Pick-Man?</p><p>Was this a test?</p><p>He tried not to sound as hard and angry as he felt when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jackson Crow.

Her soft-knit, cap-sleeved dress completed the perfect picture of sensuous femininity, which seemed so opposed to the strength of her handshake\u2014and her prowess with a pickax. But then, she\u2019d recently gone through the rigors of a Virginia police academy, so she must be in excellent physical shape. She\u2019d been through a lot, the death of her parents, and the death of her fianc\u00e9. Maybe she had been through too much.</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be a crazed light in her eyes. Which was a positive sign.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a body,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cDead\u2014I\u2019m assuming.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, or bones, I guess. I\u2019m not sure what would happen to a body buried down here for over a hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a reason you think you\u2019re going to find a body buried down here? The house has gone through a great deal of construction over the years. The bodies buried here were discovered over a hundred years ago,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAh, some, but not all,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the body of a man named Nathaniel Petti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetti\u2014the fellow Newton bought the house from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows what really happened to him,\u201d Jackson reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for him,\u201d she said. With a mighty swing, she hit the ground again.</p><p>Whack!</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to tear the place down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat makes you think that he\u2019s under the ground there?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. Just a split second. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been reading, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Whack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading, and that led you to a space beneath the stairs?\u201d Jackson asked, trying to remain courteous while he cursed Adam Harrison.</p><p>They\u2019d sent him a maniac.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m honestly not sure how to explain this, but I\u2019m almost positive that I\u2019m doing the right thing,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She was destroying the floor of the basement.</p><p>\u201cYou do know that we\u2019re supposed to investigate the house\u2014not tear it down?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Once more, she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve gone this far...\u201d</p> <p>That was true.</p><p>Whack.</p><p>He was about to stop her. He was going to step in and tell her that he\u2019d been charged with being the head of the team.</p><p>But the last whack did something.</p><p>She had managed to get down about three feet. And that was all it took.</p><p>He saw\u2014a bone. A distinctive bone. A jawbone.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he told her, taking the pickax from her.</p><p>\u201cWait! Careful,\u201d she warned.</p><p>He knew how to be careful. He used the pickax a bit away from the skull, and he used it with a strength it was simply biologically impossible for her to possess.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, he had most of the skeleton showing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Petti,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s Petti, and he was the first victim.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible to argue. It might have been someone else, but what did it matter? She had managed to discover a skeleton\u2014almost complete, he was certain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call Devereaux\u2014the local detective in charge of the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll let him tend to the remains. Because, after all, actually, they are his.\u201d</p><p>Jackson eyed her as he dialed. Her discovery after being in the house a little more than an hour seemed uncanny.</p><p>It made him think about his own experience as a boy. Made him think about the men in the Cheyenne Nation, the ones who talked about the things they had seen on their dream quests. Made him...damn uneasy.</p><p>\u201cI have a book,\u201d she said, as if reading his mind. \u201cA book on the murders. It was only logical to think that Newton had killed Petti, the man he bought the house from. He would have put him here, under the stairs, where it was unlikely that future digging might be done, just because of the awkwardness of the stairway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stairway is wood, it\u2019s surely been repaired many times over the years,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cBut not moved, because there\u2019s the doorway,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>Andy Devereaux came on the line. Jackson told him what had happened, staring at Angela Hawkins all the while. She looked back at him, never flinching.</p><p>There were no sirens. Devereaux and a team of crime scene specialists and pathologists from the coroner\u2019s office arrived quietly. Jackson watched while Angela gave her flat and logical explanation again, and then, as they stepped away to allow the crime scene unit and then the pathologists take over, she excused herself to wash up.</p><p>He stared after her, shaking his head. The woman was a witch. She had been pleasant, serene and completely at ease, certain of herself as she had spoken to the detective. She was certainly beautiful enough with her golden hair and crystal-blue eyes, lithe figure and easy poise.</p><p>That didn\u2019t make it any better. She was calm now, but she\u2019d been wielding a pickax with a vengeance.</p><p>With an inward groan, he wondered what the hell it was going to be like when he met the rest of the team.</p><p>The bones had been taken by a pathology team that had been called in along with the crime scene unit, and after a great deal of discussion on exactly who should be collecting the bones. They were planning on sending the bones on to another team at the Smithsonian, a team that specialized in bones that were over a hundred years old.</p><p>Frankly, Angela didn\u2019t need any team to tell her a simple truth; the bones were those of Nathaniel Petti, the man who had owned the house before selling out to Madden C. Newton. But the exact cause of Petti\u2019s death might be determined, and the man with such a sad life and death might be put to rest at last.</p><p>Angela wondered if it was wrong to be starving after she had just found the remains of a human being. But she was alive herself, and being alive meant that the machine must be fueled. She couldn\u2019t wait for the last of the police\u2014even though she really liked Andy Devereaux\u2014and the crime scene unit to leave.</p><p>Of course, it was a bit uncomfortable, having Jackson Crow watch her throughout the proceedings as if he was studying a strange and foreign object\u2014or meeting an alien.</p><p>Her hunger was going to have to wait. When the other officers had left, Jackson asked Andy about the police shooting range. Andy arched a brow. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we still get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a little target practice,\u201d Jackson said. Angela felt her cheeks color. He didn\u2019t want target practice; he wanted to see if she was really capable with a weapon.</p><p>Andy looked at his watch. \u201cCome on, then, let\u2019s get the house locked up, and I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>Jackson stared at Angela. \u201cShall we get our weapons?\u201d</p><p>Yes, she thought. She was being put on trial. Fine; she\u2019d go to target practice.</p><p>It was quiet when they arrived; two men were down the row, earmuffs stifling the constant sound of the explosions.</p><p>Andy wasn\u2019t practicing; he set up Jackson and Angela.</p><p>Her gun was a Glock and she knew how to use it. Somehow, she\u2019d been blessed with twenty-twenty vision, and the ability to utilize it and her weapon properly to aim. Her stance was steady, and comfortable, and she used both hands in a grip known as the Weaver position, her weaker hand\u2014her left\u2014supporting her grip. She was stronger than she looked, and ready for the powerful recoil on the gun. She didn\u2019t let Jackson\u2019s presence disturb her, and in a matter of seconds, she\u2019d removed the entire heart area from her target.</p><p>She turned and looked at Jackson, who hadn\u2019t fired a shot yet. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>He had the grace to grin. \u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re ready for whatever comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dossier must have told you that I can shoot,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSome things are best viewed in the world,\u201d he said with a shrug. He turned away from her. \u201cAndy, this was great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ll get you back. It\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>Andy brought them back to the house. Angela\u2019s stomach had begun to ache. She couldn\u2019t help it; she was feeling resentful and irritated. She was being judged.</p><p>At last they closed the front door on Devereaux, and Angela noted that although she had taken out her weapon as requested, she hadn\u2019t taken her suitcases, small as they were, anywhere yet, and she should probably pick a room before going out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to throw those somewhere and find a place to eat,\u201d she said to Jackson, whose gaze remained on her.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I haven\u2019t had dinner, or, anything that really resembled lunch, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>Not an emotion in sight. Jackson Crow was an interesting and arresting man. She\u2019d assumed that his surname, Crow, definitely meant something of a Native American background. His eyes, however, were an extremely deep shade of blue\u2014not black at all, as she had first imagined. A strong contrast with his black hair. He seemed excellent at concealing his thoughts and emotions, but she had seen a look in those deep dark eyes a few times that seemed to judge her as being certifiably insane. Then again, of course, given the way he had found her, she supposed it might be quite logical that he\u2019d look at her as if she was a bit askew.</p><p>If she quit on the first day, would they let her back on to the force?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to quit. No matter how he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cDid you pick a room?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d take one that\u2019s straight up the stairs and to the left. I put my bags there. Some of them need sheets and a dusting, but there are three rooms on the level just above us that have apparently been kept up... I\u2019m assuming the senator and his wife were prepared for company, live-in help, and probably, the senator\u2019s aide, chauffeur and bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s just us now?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cJust us. And the others will be in tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met any of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. We\u2019re all a surprise to one another,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was pretty sure that she\u2019d been quite a surprise to him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll just run these bags up. You\u2019re in the last bedroom on the left-hand side once I\u2019m up there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI can take your bags up for you,\u201d he offered.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I never travel with what I can\u2019t carry. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>She felt his blue gaze on her as she grabbed her carry-on and her shoulder bag. As she reached the landing, she saw that there were three rooms to her left; the first seemed the easiest place, and so she deposited her luggage on the floor by the foot of the bed. The room was handsomely designed with a black-and-gold motif, almost \u00e0 la the New Orleans Saints. Angela imagined that Regina had carefully planned it as a guest room, which, definitely, did not sound like the act of a woman contemplating suicide. In fact, from what she had seen, the grieving mother had been dedicated to making the house the perfect home for a man-of-the-people politician.</p><p>Angela wasn\u2019t an expert on the depression that led to suicide, so she couldn\u2019t really be sure how people might behave before taking their own lives. A call to a few forensic psychiatrists was in order.</p><p>\u201cAny particular cuisine in mind?\u201d Jackson asked her as she came back down the stairs.</p><p>She gazed at him questioningly. \u201cIt is New Orleans,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnywhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost places are open until at least ten. How about Irene\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d</p><p>They locked the house and strolled two silent blocks down to Royal, passing the burst of sound that was Bourbon as they did so. Two mounted-police officers at the corner watched over the night, lest the revelers become a bit too happy. Come-on persons were in the street, hawking the cheapness of an establishment\u2019s drinks, the wonders of the band or the exotic talents of the dancers within a certain club.</p><p>Even when Jackson was approached by a slightly long-in-the-tooth woman urging him to an upstairs establishment to see Wicked Wanda on a pole, he seemed amused.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m with a friend tonight,\u201d he told the hawker.</p><p>\u201cShe can come, too!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2014I know that I\u2019d just love Wicked Wanda,\u201d Angela said. \u201cBut we\u2019re heading off to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe serve food!\u201d the woman told him. \u201cWe have an amazing menu. Two amazing menus, actually. Spankings are five dollars a shot, pants up or down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then the servers bring you your food,\u201d Jackson said, grinning. \u201cSorry,\u201d he lied, \u201cwe have reservations.\u201d</p><p>They managed to elude the persistent woman, and walk quickly on down to Royal where they reached relative quiet. Royal Street was known for its antiques shops and boutiques, and was more serene than the raucous Bourbon by night.</p><p>Arriving at Irene\u2019s, they were ushered past the first dining room to wait at the bar, where a pianist played and sang old tunes, nicely performing \u201cAt Last.\u201d Jackson asked her if she\u2019d like a drink, and she opted for a cabernet.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I could get the drinks,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re on an expense account. Let me use the company\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what the taxpayers would think about that,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cActually, Adam Harrison funds the special unit. I believe he started off in a nice financial place at birth, and managed to parlay his inheritance into a tidy sum through investments and real estate. The last thing he would begrudge his people, I think, would be drinks and dinner after digging up a corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBones,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cDead man,\u201d he said with a grin and a shrug.</p><p>By the time he acquired the drinks, the hostess returned to lead them to a table. Angela had always liked Irene\u2019s; the food was delicious, there were fine white cloths on the table, and the noise level was at a gentle hum.</p><p>Angela couldn\u2019t help but note the way Jackson fascinated their server. She herself had set out to dislike the man, or, if not dislike him, set up a reserve against him. She knew that he knew a great deal about everyone on his team, while the team knew almost nothing about him\u2014or each other. Though tall enough to stand just an inch or so above most men, he had an easy courteous manner and a slow smile that appeared to enchant everyone around him. Perhaps it was natural that he should attract attention.</p><p>\u201cSo, here we are, one day in. Body\u2014discovered,\u201d he said, taking a swallow of his scotch on the rocks.</p><p>\u201cIt was only logical,\u201d she said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOnly logical. That man has been buried beneath the stairs since Reconstruction, and you found him in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an extremely logical person,\u201d she said, running her fingers up the stem of her wineglass.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your story?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYou know my story. You have the dossiers. I start the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your background?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cObvious, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerican Indian. What kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheyenne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish\u2014well, Scottish, originally, but my mom grew up in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Are your parents alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My mom died from cancer eight years ago, my father had a heart attack four weeks later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy folks are gone. You know that. They died in a plane crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since the plane crash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cDo you know your family\u2014or families?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, very well. I like family. You? What is your feeling for your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore him. My turn. Siblings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. You\u2019re an only child,\u201d she said gravely.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, grinning. \u201cI\u2019ve met a few people who were an only child within their household, and they came out okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Preconceived notions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that, rich or poor, a person who has siblings has had to share upon occasion. There will always be a time when what happens in a sibling\u2019s life is more important. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I\u2019m Cheyenne,\u201d he said, a quirk of amusement on his lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all about community, and the People.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Leaning back on your pedigree,\u201d she said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget that part of me is clansman,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll for the good of the clan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re big into standing up for one another in feuds,\u201d he said. \u201cActually and honestly, I do play well with others.\u201d</p><p>Their server arrived with their food orders. She opted for another glass of wine and Jackson decided on a second scotch. He laughed and teased the pretty girl serving them, pleasantly, and not obnoxiously, Angela noted. He was still smiling when she left them at the table with their fresh drinks and plates of food.</p><p>\u201cDo you see ghosts?\u201d Jackson asked her.</p><p>She froze, startled by the sudden impact of the question. She had to force herself to swallow her bite of food.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she replied.</p><p>He took another sip of scotch, and his eyes met hers squarely. \u201cI believe that the world is full of possibilities. Do I believe in ghosts like the ones on TV? No. I\u2019m pretty sure that if ghosts exist they are around both by day and night, and that we don\u2019t need to see a lot of people with their eyes wide open\u2014deer-caught-in-the-headlights\u2014jumping at every sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogical,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogical. If they exist, they must exist in daylight as well as in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Griffin?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Once again, she froze. He had a knack for throwing in a tough question just when she had relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d she asked dully. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever \u2018see\u2019 him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two were together for years,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cFive, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t foresee his death?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She stared at him, every muscle in her body as tense as piano wire. \u201cWhen they told us that the cancer had spread into every organ and riddled his bones, yes, I foresaw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI wondered if it made you\u2014susceptible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusceptible to what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cSeeing ghosts. I just wanted to make sure that you were over it, and that you were standing on even ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I over it? Do we ever get over the loss of loved ones? No\u2014I have never managed to do so. My parents, and Griffin, are always alive in my heart. Do I accept the reality of it? Yes. And they are all gone. Gone. They don\u2019t come and take my hand and direct me to dead bodies\u2014or to lost children, for that matter.\u201d She paused, needing to wet her lips. She didn\u2019t sip her wine, she chugged it. Most unattractive, she was sure; she didn\u2019t care. He could be so completely courteous. He could make her comfortable, he could make her laugh. And then, he could home right in for the kill.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she demanded more heatedly than she had intended. \u201cDo your lost field agents come and speak to you in the night? Do they ask you how you didn\u2019t happen to get there in time to save them?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t so much as a crack in his expression, not a change whatsoever in the steady dark blue eyes that surveyed her.</p><p>\u201cNo. They are gone. Like you, I accept that they are gone. Like you, I do remain haunted by the lives they once led.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. He should feel badly for badgering her about the losses in her life. She was left feeling similarly\u2014but she had phrased her words in a much meaner manner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured uncomfortably. Damn him! She didn\u2019t need to be apologizing to him.</p><p>\u201cOne thing is true\u2014we can\u2019t undo the past. We can only do our best in the present, and hope to find the answers in the future. Dessert? Coffee?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant to split a bread pudding? It\u2019s out of this world here.\u201d</p><p>She sat back, still uneasy, and totally baffled by his ability to remain so unruffled. She had been tested throughout dinner, she realized.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother glass of wine?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine, why not?\u201d</p> <p>He ordered brandy and bread pudding, and she had another glass of wine. His conversation turned casual. He talked about his love for the city; he had worked here for nearly a year when he had first joined the bureau. \u201cThings are always just a little bit different in these parts. Louisiana laws are still based on Napoleonic Code\u2014French law\u2014while the majority of the country is based on English law. It\u2019s not major, but there are some differences. You\u2019ll note they have parishes instead of counties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Tulane. I know that,\u201d she told him. Inane. He had her dossier.</p><p>\u201cAnd majored in history and philosophy,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI spent six years in college. I liked it. I might have stayed a college student all my life, but it doesn\u2019t pay the bills. World religions, history and psychology.\u201d</p><p>Angela frowned. \u201cPsychology, of course. You were with a Behavioral Science Unit. So, tell me, because I was thinking today that someone as involved as Regina was in preparing that home to be the perfect welcoming point for her husband wouldn\u2019t have committed suicide. And to be honest, suicide had sounded like an entirely rational explanation to me before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. I didn\u2019t know her,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Dessert and drinks arrived. He was persuasive; she did try the bread pudding, and it was delicious. And it felt oddly intimate to share a dessert. She hadn\u2019t done so in years. Since Griffin had died.</p><p>He sipped his brandy. \u201cIt does seem as if she was devoted to her husband, and as if she had determined to put her life to good use. That speaks against suicide. But then again, the loss of a child might have made her snap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that kind of snap? Going over a balcony?\u201d Regina asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here to find out,\u201d he told her.</p><p>They left soon after. The walk back down Chartres Street was quiet; they took St. Peter\u2019s up to Dauphine and crossed Bourbon once again. They were at the more subdued end of Bourbon there, but distracted, Angela had been walking a few steps ahead.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey, wanna party?\u201d someone asked.</p><p>He was a blond frat boy. He looked harmless. He was with other blond frat boys.</p> <p>She could take care of herself, she knew. But Jackson stepped forward easily, slipping an arm around her. \u201cNot tonight, but you all have a good time, and take care,\u201d he said pleasantly.</p><p>The frat boys waved and went on. Jackson\u2019s hold on her eased, but they walked next to each other.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything; neither did she. He knew she could have managed on her own; she knew that he had quickly defused the situation.</p><p>And then they were back. They\u2019d left lights on, and the house on Dauphine stood white and dignified in the moonlight, captured in shadow and in a soft glow. The windows might have been eyes, and, Angela thought, the ghosts of dozens of lost souls might have looked out from behind them, gazing at the world they had left behind. The house wasn\u2019t evil, but evil had lived behind the facade.</p><p>Angela was suddenly certain that Regina Holloway had not committed suicide.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Before retiring for the night, Jackson had done a survey of the house, studying the alarm system.</p><p>He\u2019d learned two things: every window in the house was properly wired; and though the gate to the courtyard was wired as well, only the gate was wired. It would have been possible for someone to climb the wall into the courtyard. However, once that happened, they\u2019d have to have the code to get through the alarm.</p><p>Even so, it was possible and probable\u2014no matter how excellent a police force might be\u2014that someone had come over the wall. After that...</p><p>It had been twilight when Regina Holloway died. A time when someone might have slipped over the wall. A time when she might have had the alarm off, since she had been out on the balcony. She might have had the doors locked, but if she had opened her bedroom doors to the balcony\u2014or if anything had been left open by one of the maids\u2014there would have been access to the house.</p><p>The night, however, was uneventful.</p><p>Angela Hawkins was still asleep when he came down to the kitchen. There was little there, but someone had seen to it that some basics had been stocked, so he was able to brew coffee and munch on one of the English muffins that had been left in a package in the refrigerator.</p><p>He called to set up an interview with the senator. First, he reached a secretary, and then was put through to the senator\u2019s aide, Martin DuPre, and while he was asking DuPre if the senator would be available for an appointment, DuPre\u2019s protective hedging came to a quick halt when the senator himself came on the line. He assured Jackson that he\u2019d be there that evening around five or five-thirty, and that their investigation was the most important issue in his life at the moment. He was glad to be in New Orleans at the moment, since the state legislature wasn\u2019t in session. He hadn\u2019t lived at the house since his wife had died; he had taken an apartment in the city.</p><p>Jackson was in the kitchen, working on notes for the investigation, when the doorbell rang.</p><p>Answering it, he discovered a young man with a guitar case strung over his shoulder and an overnight bag in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the visitor said.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>The young man extended a hand. \u201cYou have to be Jackson Crow. I\u2019m Jake Mallory. I know it\u2019s kind of early, but I grew up in the Garden District, and I was awake\u2014and here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake. Good to meet you. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>Jackson kept his tone level, his greeting polite.</p><p>But he wondered what the hell Adam Harrison had been thinking.</p><p>Jake Mallory was tall, probably half an inch short of his own height. He had auburn, slightly long hair, an angular, well-defined face and light green eyes. His build was more lanky than bulky, but he looked as if he was about to play guitar on the streets for money. It wasn\u2019t that he looked unkempt; he was fastidious and probably extremely attractive to young women. He just didn\u2019t have the look of someone about to become part of an elite investigation unit. If this was, in truth, an elite investigation unit.</p><p>Then, again, maybe he looked exactly the part, just because he didn\u2019t offer the customary appearance.</p><p>Jake walked in and whistled at the great entry slash ballroom. \u201cWow. I\u2019ve heard about this place all my life. I\u2019ve never been in it.\u201d He set down his bag and let the guitar case slide slowly to the parquet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a house,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake met his gaze. \u201cAmazing. Huge, so it seems. How was your night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUneventful,\u201d Jackson assured him. \u201cWant the grand tour? Or did you want to take it alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way,\u201d Jake said, shrugging and shoving his hands in his back pockets. He laughed. \u201cWe used to come and stare at the place when we were kids. Dare each other to go up close and all that. There were great ghost stories about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what the ghost stories say, and I\u2019ve got blueprints, but you might know a lot that I don\u2019t,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake laughed ruefully. \u201cYep. Forgot that you probably know just about everything about me, too. I have to admit, it\u2019s amazing to be here. To actually sleep here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not afraid of ghosts,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by the possibilities!\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Jackson had read that Jake was a local boy by birth; he\u2019d also gone to school here, and gotten a music degree from Yale. He\u2019d returned to New Orleans and worked with a musicians\u2019 coalition in the city.</p><p>Adam had apparently found him fascinating because of his ability to find people. He\u2019d been responsible for finding both survivors and those who had not survived after the summer of storms wrought their havoc on the city and its residents. Jackson wasn\u2019t sure just what his specialty was, beyond an uncanny ability to find the dead. There didn\u2019t seem to be a real investigator in his group, Angela\u2019s police training notwithstanding.</p><p>Jake looked at Jackson with a sharp and steely look in his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re all being tested, though, I assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m called frequently to find the lost. So, I have to admit, I\u2019m curious about exactly why I\u2019m here. Regina Holloway isn\u2019t lost, she\u2019s dead. Everyone knows where she is. But then, you found a body last night, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find it. Angela Hawkins found it. And how do you know about that already?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve turned on a television or read the local paper today,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Jackson frowned. \u201cReporters got in on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. This is the Deep South, and it\u2019s Louisiana. Though we have a history of corrupt politicians, sweet tea and a slow, steady lifestyle, our reporters are sharks\u2014just like everywhere else in the country. You had police and forensics experts in here last night. That kind of thing doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, especially when it\u2019s the second time it\u2019s happened. Detective Devereaux had the police spokesperson give an official statement. But...well, the speculation on what happened is far more intriguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need a newspaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry...there\u2019s one in my bag,\u201d Jake said. \u201cI\u2019ll call and get a paper delivered here every morning. That way, you\u2019ll know what we\u2019re up against as far as gossip goes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been written about us being in the house?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, just that the senator has brought in a team of investigators. People believe that he\u2019s so heartbroken, he had to do something to try to prove that his wife didn\u2019t commit suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know her?\u201d Jackson asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. But, I\u2019ve seen her. She was really loved here\u2014just like the senator. Hey, he\u2019s like a breath of fresh air. Especially in Louisiana.\u201d Jake\u2019s wry grin deepened. \u201cThe people loved Huey Long because he shook things up and worked for every one despite his carousing. Senator Holloway, he\u2019s loved the same way. He wants big money to take care of big-money problems, and he wants to create work for everyone. And he was an honest-to-God family man.\u201d</p><p>There was a sharp intelligence beneath the laid-back exterior of the man, Jackson thought. He might prove to be a far greater asset than Jackson had imagined at first sight.</p><p>\u201cPoliticians, in one way, seem perfectly understandable, but then it\u2019s always hard to tell what is lurking in their minds, they\u2019re so accustomed to wearing masks,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I do know New Orleans, and a lot of the players here,\u201d Jake offered.</p><p>Conversation paused. Jackson had the curious feeling that they were being watched, and he turned to see why.</p> <p>Angela Hawkins looked down at them from the second-floor landing. It struck him again that she was an exceptionally beautiful woman, far too angelic looking, really, to have been a cop. Despite last night, she retained a reserve that was no less daunting than a suit of armor. Though beneath it all, he sensed her capable of a smile that would light the world. Studying her personality was an intriguing and appealing concept.</p><p>\u201cHi, there!\u201d Jake called to her.</p><p>\u201cAngela, Jake, Jake, Angela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you sleep? Any ghosts prowling the halls?\u201d Jake asked. He might have been asking her if a shopping mall had been busy.</p><p>\u201cI was out like a light last night,\u201d she told him. \u201cWelcome to the crew!\u201d</p><p>Jake smiled at her. And Angela returned it. They seemed to have an instant, easy rapport. He was surprised to find himself envious.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s good to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get Jake up to speed on what I know about the house,\u201d Angela offered.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Hmm. He heard the tension in his voice. What he was feeling was ridiculous; they were peers. He knew better than to feel a macho, ego-driven need to be the divine leader, most respected and most admired\u2014and liked. He found himself thinking about his last team; they had worked so well together for so long. Each member with his or her own specialty and all of them learning to work like a well-oiled machine. But, he had to remember, they\u2019d been together five years. This was a new team; despite his lingering feelings of pain for his last coworkers, he had to make himself start fresh, and give each member of this new team a chance to fall in\u2014just as he had to learn to lead again, as smoothly as he had in the past.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said again. \u201cThat will be great.\u201d</p><p>He almost managed to laugh at himself as he headed back to the kitchen, to finish the notes he had been making after his conversation with Andy Devereaux, and after they had discovered the bones of Madden C. Newton\u2019s probable first New Orleans victim.</p><p>Almost. It was one thing to understand the way the human mind worked. It was another to buck against it when you were the human in question.</p><p>\u201cI play a lot on Frenchman Street,\u201d Jake told Angela. \u201cThings have changed a lot since our season of storms. The demographics in the city have changed, and it\u2019s kind of like a movement for survival. Let\u2019s face it, the history here is great, but tons of the tourism comes because of Bourbon Street, for people to have a good time in the old Big Easy. So, now, you don\u2019t hear all the different stuff you used to hear\u2014well, not as much. The bars on Bourbon mostly have pop\u2014Journey, Bon Jovi, hard-hitting fast stuff. Of course, everything is a contradiction. Next thing you know, the best sax player known to man will show up working at one of the tourist places!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been a city of contradictions,\u201d Angela assured him, liking the young man very much.</p> <p>\u201cYou know it well?\u201d he asked, arching a brow as she led them at last to the entertainment slash family room. He sat at the end of the sofa and she perched at the other, winding her legs beneath her as she faced him.</p><p>\u201cFrom college,\u201d she told him. \u201cI grew up in Virginia, but I absolutely love New Orleans, so it does feel just a little bit like coming home. Despite the gruesome reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me, Miss Hawkins, what do you do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a \u2018finder,\u2019 too. That\u2019s what you do, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, shrugging. \u201cI guess I have a certain sense for...finding people.\u201d He lowered his voice, looking toward the door.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a minute, then said, \u201cFriends of mine almost went insane. Their five-year-old was kidnapped, and two boys had been kidnapped right before. One\u2019s body had been found. I had a dream about a child holding my hand, taking me down into an area of bayou near Slidell. I found the body of the second. And it was amazing, because when I found it, I also found the old swamp house where they were keeping my friends\u2019 little boy. He survived. I was so grateful, but the experience shook me up\u2014that was for certain. But I didn\u2019t dwell on it. Knowing things, seeing events and people\u2014it isn\u2019t always good. Some people turn away from you; they think that you\u2019re out to hurt them, or they want to put some distance between you and them, because there might be something really odd about you.\u201d He paused again. \u201cI think I lost a best friend that way.\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cActually, the love of my life. But...well, if you have experiences like mine, you stay sane yourself by learning to use whatever talent you have, gift or curse, to do what you can to help stop some of the depravity and evil in the world. New Orleans is my home, so my talents came in handy when the city was in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your ghosts come in dreams,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Yours?\u201d</p><p>She found herself looking to the door as well. \u201cI get feelings that seem almost like a divining rod\u2014and yes, I get the dreams. I\u2014I saw something when my parents were killed in a plane crash. I saw them walking toward the light, along with a lot of other people. The therapist who worked with me afterward told me that I saw what I needed to see in order to be able to bear the grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never believed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my time with the therapist made me extremely careful about what I say to other people!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his green eyes still bright. \u201cWell, I do know people who see them\u2014ghosts\u2014and see them easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll introduce you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey live here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cDoes Adam know about them? Why wouldn\u2019t he have brought them in on this team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, frankly, Nikki and Brent have three small children now. I\u2019m sure Adam would have liked to have them on a team, but they\u2019re busy parents. I don\u2019t believe they would work away from the city, not with their children growing up. They have their schools, their church, their sports teams...they\u2019re good people, though. I met Adam through them, actually...\u201d Jake paused in thought.</p><p>\u201cI see. And I understand\u2014I think. Adam wants a team that will stay cohesive for a while, a group that starts out together and learns to work together,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cYou think Regina Holloway committed suicide?\u201d</p><p>Angela simply looked at him for a moment and admitted, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the house is haunted?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She laughed. Once again, she chose her words. \u201cSay I believe that a house can be haunted. Perhaps things go bump in the night\u2014or ghosts prowl the hallways. I don\u2019t think that ghosts pushed Regina Holloway over the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood conclusion.\u201d</p><p>The voice came from the doorway and Angela turned quickly to see that Jackson Crow had finished whatever work he was doing and stood there, watching them. She felt color flood her cheeks. Just how long had he been there?</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to let Jake know that he needs to go ahead and pick a room,\u201d Jackson said, his blue eyes as enigmatic as ever. \u201cThe rest of the crew will be arriving soon. You might want to get settled. The two maids who worked in the house when Regina was alive won\u2019t come back to work here, but they should be here in a few minutes to show us where the linen can be found, towels, cleaning articles, all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I think I\u2019ll go ahead and take that third room in the hallway where you two are,\u201d Jake said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty good at picking up after myself. I can cook, too,\u201d he assured them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cI just have my guitar and my bag,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the guitar for you\u2014and treat it like gold,\u201d Angela assured him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to drop it on the way up the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, and they both walked past Jackson. Angela felt that he watched them, and she wondered why. She was equally curious as to why she was suddenly trying to avoid him.</p><p>Because the meeting over the pickax remained between them\u2014and she didn\u2019t really want him knowing that, despite her credentials, she definitely still had her vulnerabilities.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure. She was confident, and she knew how to keep her own counsel. But there was something about the way that he looked at her...</p><p>She usually didn\u2019t care, she realized. She wanted Jackson Crow to like her.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>The fourth member of his team, Whitney Tremont, had just rung the bell. She\u2019d been born and bred in New Orleans just like Jake, but with the difference that Jake came from an \u201cEnglish\u201d background and Whitney was pure Creole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was, he thought, a compelling little bundle of energy. She was little, no more than five-two or five-three, slim, with curly hair and hazel eyes, and skin the color of amber. She had a smile that was infectious, and a soft, sweet voice.</p><p>They had sent him another child.</p><p>No, there was a keen intelligence in her eyes. She had been a straight-A off-the-charts student; she had studied ethnicity, religion, philosophy, modern and ancient beliefs, while also receiving her degree in film from NYU. Her maternal great-grandmother was a noted contemporary voodoo priestess, and owned a shop called As You Believe up near Rampart Street. She had helped the local police crack down on a cult of would-be voodoo worshippers who had taken it upon themselves to bastardize the beliefs for the sake of human sacrifice\u2014two young people had died during blood-drinking rituals. According to her file, she had a chameleon-like ability to slip into any group and be accepted as one of them\u2014and somehow manage to film or video events and people who had never allowed such a thing before. Her expertise was cameras and film, and Jackson knew that she, like Will Chan, whom he had yet to meet, had been brought in for their work with cameras and sound.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, reaching for her large, tapestry travel bag. \u201cCome on in. Whitney, right? Miss Whitney Tremont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson Crow. Love the name,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve already been digging up bodies\u2014I\u2019m late to the party,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cA skeleton. Angela Hawkins found it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed, and the majority of the people in the city are convinced that now all the ghosts who might not have been busy yet will be crawling out of the woodwork. Anyway, if they do, I\u2019m hoping that we catch them on film. I have a lot of equipment out in the van.\u201d</p><p>He looked over her head. There was a fellow in the driver\u2019s seat who looked so much like her that he had to be her brother. The man waved to him; Jackson waved back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open the courtyard gate. And call the troops to help. Well, the two who are here now,\u201d Jackson told her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother, Tyler, over there. I\u2019ll get him to come around the corner,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>Whitney went out; he called for Angela and Jake, and soon they were all in the courtyard, meeting Tyler and hauling heavy boxes out of the van. They decided to set up in the grand entry slash ballroom, so Jackson shut off the alarm entirely in order for them to open the middle courtyard doors and take the shortest route.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take them more than thirty minutes to bring everything in.</p> <p>Tyler was as tall as his sister was short, ranging a good foot over her head. He was as pleasant with the others as if he had been leaving his sister at summer camp, but when he was actually ready to leave, he gave her a huge hug and said seriously, \u201cYou be careful, and you don\u2019t take any chances, and you don\u2019t go getting your nose in where it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all grown up now, Tyler,\u201d she reminded him, but she hugged him in return.</p><p>\u201cShe has a tendency to rush in\u2014right into people who have guns,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jackson grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch out for her. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded. \u201cAdam wouldn\u2019t have set her up with you if you weren\u2019t good people. And if she wasn\u2019t going to be safe.\u201d He paused, looking around. \u201cSo this is the Newton house. It doesn\u2019t look like a dark torture chamber, but...I\u2019m sure it\u2019s creepy as hell at night. You all be careful, huh? I remember when the kid took a header when the cops were after him about a decade ago. Brought it all back. And now Mrs. Holloway...it\u2019s a shame, and it may just be that the place is bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all be looking out for each other,\u201d Jake said solemnly.</p><p>Hugging his sister and warning her to call him, Tyler left at last.</p><p>Jackson looked at the four members of his team and the mass of boxes in the living room. \u201cWell,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Whitney shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad, really! Somebody else is in film, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Chan, but he\u2019s not here yet,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWe follow orders well,\u201d Angela assured her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m way brawnier than I look,\u201d Jake added, laughing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Because you can all start while I check the doors, windows and the alarm system again,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cHere are the rules\u2014no one opens the gate without me knowing it. We\u2019re going to be opening the balcony doors from our bedrooms, so I\u2019ll have the alarm set during the day so that we can do that. Though it will sound if we don\u2019t key ourselves in and out of the front door\u2014everyone understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and thank God! I can\u2019t imagine not going out on that beautiful balcony,\u201d Whitney said. She didn\u2019t seem the least disturbed by the house\u2014simply fascinated.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll dig on in and help Whitney start getting set up,\u201d Angela assured him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be that long.\u201d</p><p>He was long, though. Longer than he intended.</p><p>None of them had been up to the third floor yet. After taking the grand stairway to the second floor, he briefly checked each of the rooms on the front end of the house, and came around to the middle section, and the stairway there. He went up to the third level. Thankfully, the middle section was one big expanse of space. With remnants from the decades that the house had stood.</p><p>No one had gotten up here yet to start on the cleaning. The area was rife with dust; it almost felt as if he took a step back into a different time. Dressmakers\u2019 dummies were along the wall, near one of the three dormer windows. Jackson checked them; the alarm wires were in place. Clothing on the dummies ranged from an antebellum ball gown to a World War II\u2013era swing skirt.</p><p>A huge old sewing machine was in another corner, and a wire crate held toys from eons past, wooden soldiers, dolls that might have been collectibles, croquet mallets, balls and wickets. More\u2014he couldn\u2019t discern everything in the container.</p><p>He walked through the low hallway at the one end, arriving at the area over the ballroom, and discovered that it had been set up as a row of dormitory-style rooms, and he assumed that the rooms had been slave quarters for the household staff at one time, and servants\u2019 quarters at another.</p><p>It was slow going, but he checked each of the dormer windows. He walked back through the main storage room and through the low-ceilinged hallway to the last ell; here, he found just two rooms, both of them large, and both of them empty. But the alarm wires were in place, and the windows were secure. He walked back down to the second floor and went through all the motions, finally reached the first, and checked that all the windows not facing the courtyard were secure.</p><p>The place was huge. Despite the fact that the police had searched the premises, and despite the alarm system, Jackson still wondered if there hadn\u2019t been a way for someone to slip in\u2014uninvited, and unknown.</p><p>Back in the ballroom he discovered that his crew had been busy. There was a set of television screens arranged at the far end of the room, cables, cords, lights and more equipment aligned against the wall.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to decide which rooms should get the cameras first,\u201d Angela told him. She stared at him peculiarly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a ghost yourself,\u201d Whitney said, giggling.</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ve been playing in a pail of plaster,\u201d Jake added. \u201cYou went up to the attic? I\u2019m guessing there hasn\u2019t been a cleanup crew there.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and looked at his arm. The sleeves of his cotton shirt were white.</p><p>Once again, the doorbell rang and he walked to the door, expecting the remainder of the team.</p><p>A tall, slender woman of African descent stood there as straight as a ramrod, and as ancient as one. She frowned, seeing Jackson, and murmured something that seemed to be a prayer against curses.</p><p>Angela swiftly came running to the door, catching the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Angela. Jackson is just dusty\u2014can we help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran-Mama!\u201d Whitney cried. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d</p><p>Jackson spun back to look at the old woman. Angela had reached out a hand to invite her in.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jackson demanded.</p><p>\u201cI am Mama Matisse. Whitney didn\u2019t tell you that she asked me to come?\u201d the woman asked. \u201cWhitney, child! I don\u2019t come where I\u2019m not invited!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran-Mama,\u201d Whitney began, her face chalky, \u201cI just haven\u2019t had time to talk to them yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019re a priestess? A voodoo priestess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I am also Whitney\u2019s great-grandmother,\u201d the woman explained.</p><p>Jackson wasn\u2019t sure whether or not to be indignant at her demeanor. But he had the feeling that this woman could help them, and that the wisdom in her eyes ran deep. He bowed his head slightly. \u201cWhitney didn\u2019t mention you, but, please, yes, stay, help us.\u201d He cast Whitney a frowning glare; she lifted her hands helplessly.</p><p>\u201cGran-Mama\u2014Mama Matisse\u2014was friends with both the maids who worked here. And she knew Regina and the senator. I thought you might want to hear what she can tell us,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Jackson nodded at her. \u201cI\u2019ll run up and take a two-minute shower. Mama Matisse, Whitney will take you into the kitchen and get you some coffee or water or whatever. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here to help you,\u201d Mama Matisse said with tremendous dignity. \u201cI will do my best. You see, the police have not much cared for what I\u2019ve had to say, but I can tell you this\u2014the very day that Regina Holloway died, her maid, Rene, came running over to tell me that there were ghosts in this house. There were ghosts, and there is tremendous evil, and whether or not they are one and the same, that you must discover.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Mama Matisse drew a long bony finger down her teacup as she sat at the kitchen table. \u201cWhitney asked me to come here today because of the maids\u2014and because I was here, and worked with Regina Holloway,\u201d Mama Matisse explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou worked with her?\u201d Angela looked from Mama Matisse to Whitney.</p><p>\u201cRegina Holloway was very fond on my great-grandmother, and believed in her wisdom,\u201d Whitney explained.</p><p>Mama Matisse nodded gravely. \u201cThe maids will not come back in this house, Trini or Rene,\u201d she assured Angela. \u201cThey are afraid. They have taken money from the senator to live on while they look for new positions. They need to keep working in this city, so if you were to try to call them and ask them questions, they would not come to you with a ghost story. They don\u2019t mind if I speak to you in their stead. If you question them, if the police question them again, they will not speak about the ghosts, and that is all that there is to it. But they have talked to me, and I don\u2019t believe they care that I talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cThey are afraid that people will think that they are crazy,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cLoco, as Trini says,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cMy great-grandmother is considered to be extremely wise,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cMany, many people come to her. Whether they are voodooists, Jewish, Buddhists, Christian or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, we\u2019re not going to repeat anything that you say,\u201d Angela assured her.</p><p>Mama Matisse looked at her. \u201cIf you were to repeat what I say on behalf of the maids, it wouldn\u2019t matter. I have said it, and not them.\u201d</p> <p>Angela nodded. Mama Matisse did not easily trust people, but Whitney had asked her to come, and so here she was.</p><p>\u201cThe women, both Rene and Trini, worked here the day that Mrs. Holloway died,\u201d Mama Matisse said.</p><p>\u201cDid they tell you that they saw something?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, they saw a ghost. Or they thought they saw a ghost. He was in the hallway, Trini told me. They saw a man, and then he disappeared. They didn\u2019t tell Mrs. Holloway. She had said that she didn\u2019t believe in ghosts. And the man disappeared, so he couldn\u2019t have been real. Mrs. Holloway had told them that she was going to lie down. They later heard that she was dead, that she had killed herself, going over the balcony. They were very upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Angela murmured.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it a minute when they said that she committed suicide. Neither did her maids. She was Catholic. She went to church every Sunday morning, and sometimes, during the week. Her faith was strong. To a Catholic, it\u2019s a grave offense to God for us to take our own lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut she was very upset about the loss of her little boy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was sad, yes,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cSo sad\u2014I was here when the senator told his wife that they always wanted more children, and that they would try again, that they would have several. Mrs. Holloway told him that they couldn\u2019t replace Jacob. The senator said no, they would never try to replace him. But they had always wanted more children and they would try. And she said that yes, she loved children, and she loved him, and that she would fix up the house, and that one day, they would have a family. And they talked about all the needy children in the world, and maybe they would have a child, and adopt a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like someone about to commit suicide,\u201d Jackson said from the doorway to the kitchen.</p><p>He had showered away the dust, and appeared clean, striking and confident as he came in to join them. He was casual, pausing to pour himself a cup of coffee before taking a seat across the table from Mama Matisse. \u201cShe sounds like the nicest woman imaginable. What about the other people in their lives? Those closest to them? What about their day-to-day lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about their day-to-day lives, Mr. Crow,\u201d she said. Angela didn\u2019t remember that Jackson had ever introduced himself, but Mama Matisse knew who he was. \u201cI haven\u2019t been here before on a day-to-day basis. I can tell you this\u2014Mrs. Holloway had many friends. But she needed time to be alone\u2014because people kept telling her how sorry they were about her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really need to speak with the maids,\u201d Jackson reminded.</p><p>Mama Matisse merely stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe maids will not speak to you. They will not speak to anyone anymore. They talked to the police, and they have nothing more to say. They are afraid. They have their lives to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this case ever goes to court\u2014\u201d Jackson began.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that everything is solved in a court, Jackson Crow? I think that you know differently,\u201d Mama Matisse said.</p><p>Jackson stared back at her. Angela was certain that he had reacted inwardly, but, as usual, she saw nothing change in his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou are right. You can\u2019t always force the truth in court,\u201d Jackson agreed. \u201cSo, please, tell me, who was closest to them. Tell me what you can. David Holloway is a politician, so his life is full of people, but tell me what you know about his relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think about those around him... There is Mr. DuPre, and Senator Holloway\u2019s secretary, Lisa Drummond. Lisa Drummond protects the senator at his office. Martin DuPre tries very hard to be the go-between. He protects the senator\u2019s time. The senator still appears to be reeling from what has happened. He is dependent on those around him. He must have an aide. He is proud of Mr. DuPre, and thinks that one day he will step into politics on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m curious. The government is in Baton Rouge. Why was the senator so determined to have a wonderful home in which to entertain in New Orleans, do you know?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Mama Matisse smiled. \u201cThat is no mystery. New Orleans is their home. There need be no other explanation. They had an apartment in Baton Rouge, of course,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jackson said, \u201cWell, of course. I\u2019m sorry. Of course. And Baton Rouge isn\u2019t so far, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just eighty miles,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cBut that\u2019s why Senator Holloway has a chauffeur. He works in the car when he drives there and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he must have stayed over in Baton Rouge often enough,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mrs. Holloway stay here alone when he was gone?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, many times. Of course, the senator was home a lot. The first week they moved in, the state legislature wasn\u2019t in session,\u201d the old woman told him. \u201cYou must understand, while I knew Mrs. Holloway I was not her spiritual adviser. She had her priest, but she did have me do a banishing spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA banishing spell?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, as a precaution against all evil,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cBut you must remember that Regina Holloway clung strongly to her own faith. Father Adair came and blessed the house. However, this is New Orleans, and she was part of the fabric of the city. A banishing spell is not black magic. Black magic is when you wish someone ill.\u201d</p><p>Whitney cleared her throat and told them, \u201cMy great-grandmother does banishing spells often. And when you do a spell, it has to be done the right way. You are always careful not to wish anyone ill. If you wish a ghost to leave, you wish that the ghost finds peace, and you hope that leaving is what will bring the ghost peace.\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Angela wasn\u2019t sure that he really \u201csaw\u201d anything, but she didn\u2019t say so. Instead, she asked, \u201cSo, she wasn\u2019t afraid of the house?\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse shook her head slightly. \u201cNo, I do not believe that she was afraid of her own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the chauffeur, Grable Haines? Is he still with the senator, and did he drive for Mrs. Holloway as well?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge,\u201d Mama Matisse said, \u201cMrs. Holloway never drove, and she only got into a car when she was going someplace with the senator. Friends picked her up sometimes, but otherwise, she did everything in the French Quarter. She liked a hat shop on Royal Street... She bought groceries just down on Royal, too. She liked to walk to Jackson Square, and go sit in the cathedral. She didn\u2019t like to leave the area... She hated cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause her son was killed in a car?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Mama Matisse lifted her hands with a shrug. \u201cSo one might think. She didn\u2019t own a car. She just rode with the senator when he wanted her with him. So, that means, if she had to go somewhere, she went with the senator\u2014and Grable Haines. Oh, I believe she liked Grable. Everyone likes him. He is a handsome man,\u201d Mama Matisse said. She leaned closer across the table toward Jackson. \u201cBut, sometimes, a man can be too handsome. Too many things in the world come too easily to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Mama Matisse smiled. \u201cYou understand, but you don\u2019t accept many things,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jackson smiled at her; they were challenging one another, Angela thought, and yet, it also seemed that they respected each other innately.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that a ghost killed Regina Holloway?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Jackson flashed Angela a quick look. \u201cI\u2019m asking,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cJust asking. Do you think that a ghost might have killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I wasn\u2019t here the day she died,\u201d Mama Matisse said.</p><p>\u201cBut what do you think?\u201d Jackson persisted.</p><p>\u201cThis is what they told me\u2014 Rene yelled for Trini. She was in the laundry room.\u201d She pointed. The laundry room was a small area next to the kitchen, but the two rooms didn\u2019t attach. \u201cTrini said that she came quickly, and she thought she saw a man, vanishing into thin air. She made a cross on her chest and they both prayed to the Virgin and came into the kitchen, but there was nothing in here then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not telling me what you think,\u201d Jackson said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI think that evil can exist, that\u2019s what I think,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cI can only tell you what they said to me. If it\u2019s true or not, I don\u2019t know. But, soon after this happened, it was time for them to leave for the day. Mrs. Holloway came to the door with them, and they left. They were very frightened. That\u2019s why they talked to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey never told Regina Holloway about the ghost?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said that she didn\u2019t believe in ghosts\u2014the maids would not have told her that they had seen one,\u201d Mama Matisse said flatly, staring at Jackson.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the alarm?\u201d Jackson asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey heard her set the alarm. She was always careful when she was alone.\u201d Mama Matisse hesitated. \u201cBut...she didn\u2019t like the basement. She never went there when she was alone. She locked the door that led down to the basement.\u201d</p><p>Jackson looked at Angela. She kept staring at Mama Matisse.</p><p>\u201cDid she say why she was scared of the basement?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mama Matisse shook her head. \u201cShe just said that basements\u2014and attics\u2014were inherently strange places. They were like depositories for the past, and she just didn\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>Jackson mulled that information over for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cShe did believe, I\u2019m sure, that she and the senator lived with a certain amount of danger and uncertainty because he was a politician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jackson then asked her, \u201cTell me about Senator Holloway\u2019s bodyguard, Blake Conroy.\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse sniffed.</p><p>\u201cHe should have been guarding Mrs. Holloway, maybe,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cThe girls told me that he was always eating. Making a big mess in the kitchen, and thinking that he could make a big mess anywhere that he went. He is a big man,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWas he mean, or rude?\u201d Jackson asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rude to make a mess of a clean kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Angela smiled; she saw that Jackson did, too.</p><p>\u201cDid Mr. Holloway have a bodyguard just because he was a politician?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, there are some people\u2014and some groups\u2014who don\u2019t like the senator,\u201d Mama Matisse said.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who? Can you tell me about them?\u201d Jackson coaxed. He apologized. \u201cYou see, we love New Orleans, but you know so much more than we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenator Holloway said all people did was fight when what they needed to do was figure out a solution. To live in our world, we had to learn to compromise. Senator Holloway likes to give speeches. He says that he believes in New Orleans and the state of Louisiana\u2014it\u2019s a place for everyone to live, and to live together, and to remember the past so that we never repeat it,\u201d Mama Matisse said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound as if you believe all that,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Angela was surprised; she hadn\u2019t heard anything out of the ordinary in Mama Matisse\u2019s voice.</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cHe is a politician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who disliked him? Who would want to hurt him?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Aryans, for one,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave they become a political group in this town?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cThey are bigots, that\u2019s what they are,\u201d Jake Mallory, who had been leaned against the counter, said irritably.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Louisiana based, but they\u2019re an offshoot of a group that formed up in North Dakota. Most people around here ignore them,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThey could make Archie Bunker look like a bleeding-heart liberal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArchie Bunker?\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t you ever watch TV?\u201d Jake asked her. \u201cArchie Bunker, All in the Family, a major television show in its social honesty, reflecting the changing times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we can do television history at another time,\u201d Jackson mimicked.</p><p>\u201cRight. The Aryans do hate Senator Holloway,\u201d Whitney said. She was next to Jake, and she lifted a hand dismissively. \u201cThey have a campaign against interracial marriage. Ridiculous.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI\u2019d be a poster child for what not to do! They are convinced that we\u2019ve diluted America, and that all mixed babies should be aborted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound charming,\u201d Angela said dryly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another group, too,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cThe Church of Christ Arisen.\u201d</p><p>Jackson waited, and Whitney explained, \u201cThey are like the Baptists, the Catholics and the Presbyterians all rolled into one.\u201d</p><p>Jake sniffed. \u201cThat insults the Baptists, the Catholics and the Presbyterians!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t believe in anything but early to rise, early to bed. No dancing, no drinking, no sex before marriage. Adultery means you\u2019re banished from the church,\u201d Whitney explained. \u201cThey believed that Haiti got what it received\u2014just like New Orleans\u2014when nature swept in and killed people. That was God taking vengeance on sinners. They campaign against Senator Holloway because he\u2019s a huge believer in social reform. He opened a home for unwed mothers. They were horrified.\u201d</p><p>Jackson frowned, confused. \u201cBut\u2014they don\u2019t believe in abortion, I take it. Why wouldn\u2019t they want to help unwed mothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnwed mothers shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d Whitney explained.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the senator needed a bodyguard,\u201d Mama Matisse said, nodding solemnly. \u201cI believe that the senator spent time investigating the groups, trying to find out what they might be up to next. But it was all very hush-hush, so I can\u2019t really tell you much. He was worried that they might mean to take physical action against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they do believe in assassination?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cThere was a doctor who came down from New York City and opened a clinic\u2014a family-planning clinic. He was on a lot of the local talk shows. He denied that he had come because they call New Orleans the Big Easy,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cHe was a smart man, from what I could see. He said that it was better for a confused young woman to abort a child early than to give birth in a ladies\u2019 room and flush the living child down the toilet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Whitney looked at her with a sad grimace. \u201cHe died in a hit-and-run accident just outside his clinic. It was over in the CBD\u2014the Central Business District. Unrelated to their son\u2019s accident.\u201d</p><p>Angela could see that Jackson seemed to have acquired all that he wanted from Mama Matisse.</p><p>\u201cYou have been so kind to come and talk to us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse rose. She looked at Whitney. \u201cYou know where I am. Come to see me, and we can talk more if you wish.\u201d She turned to Jackson, studying him. \u201cYou have the ability to find all the answers\u2014if you let yourself do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for your faith. I\u2019ll see you out,\u201d Jackson offered, rising. \u201cDo you need a ride anywhere? It would be the least we could do.\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse shook her head. \u201cI am nearing ninety. I am nearing ninety because I walk the French Quarter every day. But thank you. You do have courtesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d Jackson said. Angela was surprised when Mama Matisse offered him her hand. Jackson took it. There was an interesting exchange of gazes between the two. Mama Matisse smiled. They walked out together.</p><p>\u201cThis is so, so sad,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it was good of your great-grandmother to come. Especially because she\u2019s right. We can\u2019t make the maids talk to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Rene thought that she saw a ghost. And she won\u2019t tell anyone\u2014but my great-grandmother. Neither was here when Regina died,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cBut I knew that they had spoken with Gran-Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but was it a ghost? A trick of the light, or her imagination\u2014or was someone really in the house?\u201d Angela asked reflectively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that we opened a can of worms,\u201d Jake said, shaking his head. \u201cNow it doesn\u2019t just seem like someone might have been responsible, it seems that way too many someones might have been responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay too many someones,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWhitney, I love your great-grandmother. She\u2019s fascinating. I hope to see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is wonderful. She has so much wisdom\u2014and kindness in her heart. But she\u2019s not a fool, and she doesn\u2019t like people easily.\u201d She laughed suddenly, looking to the door. \u201cOur fearless leader is a skeptic, and she knows it. But I think she\u2019s seeing something deeper inside him. Something that makes him special.\u201d</p><p>Angela wasn\u2019t sure about that. Jackson Crow was courteous, and he knew how to be completely stoic.</p><p>Except for the fact that he didn\u2019t seem to think much of her. She winced inwardly; oddly enough, she felt a great deal as Mama Matisse did.</p><p>There was something deep in him that he didn\u2019t give away easily. And more oddly still, she wanted to know what it was, wanted to know more about the real man beneath the facade. Why had he been chosen to lead their team?</p><p>Firsthand knowledge and work with human behavior, she told herself dryly.</p><p>But she did have a certain gift, whether he wanted to acknowledge it or not.</p><p>She rose. \u201cExcuse me, you all. I\u2019m going to run upstairs for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want us with you?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cNot right now,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Leaving them, she hurried up the stairs to the second floor\u2014and to the room where Regina Holloway had been.</p><p>Right before she had died.</p><p>She paused for a minute, and then she lay down on the bed as Regina might have done that fateful day. She closed her eyes.</p><p>She imagined the woman who had been Regina Holloway. Her life had so recently been perfect. She\u2019d had a loving husband. And a child. A son.</p><p>She had lived in this house; she hadn\u2019t been afraid.</p><p>She had been lost and hurt.</p><p>Angela let the pain sweep into her, and she opened her eyes....</p><p>She could see them. Two children. They were adorable. They were near the foot of the bed, and they had a game of jacks. The little girl had blond pigtails, and she wore a calico dress that probably ended at her ankles; the little boy was in breeches and a bleached cotton shirt and gray vest. They were both seated cross-legged, facing one another as they played. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lay very still on the bed, never sure if she was imagining, or if there was a place somewhere deep in the human soul where one could \u201csee\u201d what had gone on in the past.</p><p>\u201cAnnabelle!\u201d the little boy said. He sighed and leaned over to catch the bouncing ball. \u201cYou have to drop it right where you are, or it will roll away. Look, watch me.\u201d</p><p>The little boy dropped the ball, collected a number of jacks and caught the ball again. \u201cSee?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Annabelle nodded and took the ball from him. But her lower lip trembled. \u201cI\u2019m so scared, Percy. I\u2019m so scared. I don\u2019t like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be scared. Mommy and Daddy are here; that nice man, that Mr. Newton, he\u2019s helping us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a home anymore, Annabelle. We don\u2019t have a home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy said we were going away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will go away, unless Mr. Newton can give Daddy some kind of work. Then Daddy can work, and we can buy a house again, and we won\u2019t have to leave our friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur friends are all gone,\u201d Annabelle said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been gone since the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe war is over, Annabelle.\u201d The little boy\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cWe lost. So now we all have to start over again.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle started to cry.</p><p>Percy took her into his arms, soothing her.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, Annabelle. It\u2019s going to be all right....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Jackson Crow\u2019s deep voice interrupted her; the children vanished.</p><p>Angela bolted to a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cWere you napping?\u201d Jackson asked her, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cNo, thinking,\u201d she told him. She rose. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to lunch.\u201d He might have realized that she was about to say that she would just stay in the house while they went, because he thwarted her attempt before she could make it. \u201cIt\u2019s important. I want everyone to have a chance to connect away from here, to get to know one another as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. But when he turned away, she paused.</p><p>This room. She had \u201cseen\u201d the children here, and Regina Holloway had been here before walking out on the balcony.</p> <p>And then dying.</p><p>\u201cAngela!\u201d</p><p>Jackson Crow was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to move into this room,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. It\u2019s going to be important that I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI respect your abilities, but it\u2019s just not a good idea for anyone to sleep in here. Especially not you.\u201d</p><p>She set her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m not depressed or crazy, and I\u2019m not going over the balcony. I\u2019d like to be in here. I think I may find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the room we\u2019re investigating,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>\u201cThat would be the point,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stared at her, irritated. \u201cIf you move in here, I\u2019ll have to come over to this wing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to. Adam Harrison brought me in on this for a reason,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI think that I need to make this room my own. I think it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, I\u2019m not leaving you in this part of the house alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a cop,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cGood for you. I am the head of this team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, as such, you should use whatever talents Adam Harrison has given you. Jackson, really, I\u2019m not mentally deficient. We are taking serious care with the alarms and the locks, and if you move over to this wing, you\u2019ll be there to rescue me\u2014if I need rescue. I\u2019m not a piece of blond fluff,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He looked at her for a minute. \u201cWe\u2019re all vulnerable. Weapons don\u2019t really change that. The most accurate shot in the world is vulnerable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re vulnerable. Yes, I know,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>He was quiet for a minute, studying her with his deep, intense blue eyes. She thought he was going to deny her again, insist that he was the head of the team again, and it was his way or the highway.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He let out a deep, aggravated sigh.</p><p>\u201cAll right, fine. When we get back, we\u2019ll settle the rooming situation.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ll be glad to have you near,\u201d she said.</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cWhat a smile you have when you get your way,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I think it\u2019s important,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot that\u2019s important on the agenda now,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s head out and get lunch, because the senator is due himself this afternoon. And before he gets here, I want to find out what our ghost-hunting \u2018children\u2019 intend to do with all the photographic equipment.\u201d</p><p>Still smiling, she preceded him out the doorway.</p><p>The ballroom was empty when they reached it; she looked at Jackson.</p><p>\u201cThe kids have gone on,\u201d he said.</p><p>Angela laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re not all that young!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMid-twenties,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRight, and how old are you\u2014Methuselah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four.\u201d A small smile curved into his features. \u201cIt\u2019s not the years, kid, it\u2019s the mileage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d she murmured, waiting as he set the alarm and then locked the house. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaspero\u2019s\u2014you know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she told him.</p><p>As they walked, she said, \u201cYou think that Mama Matisse gave us a lot of good information this morning, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she gave us a great deal. I think Whitney might have mentioned that she was coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that Whitney would have done so\u2014had she actually had a chance,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cThe police must have interviewed the maids after Regina was found. Do you think the cops are trying to hold out on us\u2014that they just want it to be a suicide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think the police believe that they came to an end on possibilities. They did interview the maids. You heard Mama Matisse. What could the maids have told them\u2014since they weren\u2019t going to talk about seeing a ghost? So, as far as it appeared, the house was locked up. Tight. The alarms were on. There was no sign of a struggle on Regina Holloway\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you believe that one of these cults or groups or whatever that hate the senator might be involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. But Regina Holloway didn\u2019t open her door to anyone, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about the \u2018ghost\u2019 Rene saw in the hallway?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cMight have been a ghost in her mind. Or there might have been someone in the house,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cBut she said that the \u2018ghost\u2019 vanished,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really the \u2018locked room\u2019 mystery. What do you believe about the power of suggestion?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think that it can definitely have power,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cA tremendous power,\u201d he said. \u201cTake a fortune-teller. The fortune-teller says something\u2014and the prophecy can be self-fulfilling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, say that a house is haunted, and you\u2019ll find a ghost?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t believe in a haunting at all?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cI never said that\u2014I believe that we\u2019re all haunted in one way or another,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the left, to the left, Miss Hawkins. You\u2019re wandering off on me. The restaurant is right over there.\u201d</p><p>Maspero\u2019s was open and easy, right off the square and popular with tourists. The food was reasonable and good, and the kids had already gotten them a table. The two were seated together on one side, leaving Angela and Jackson the two chairs on the other.</p><p>They\u2019d already ordered appetizers and passed around plates of shrimp and onion rings and boiled crawfish. Angela realized she was starving and helped herself to the offerings. The group ordered the rest of their meals, and when food arrived and they\u2019d started eating, their conversation turned back to the task at hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon, we\u2019re expecting a visit from the senator,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cAnd, sometime tonight, Jenna and Will are going to arrive, and our team will be complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do Will and Jenna do?\u201d Angela asked him.</p><p>\u201cJenna is a nurse\u2014Irish,\u201d Jackson said, shrugging. \u201cAnd Will is an actor and a musician\u2014an illusionist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d Angela said. \u201cYou were a profiler, working in the field. I was a cop. Jake is a musician\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a computer wizard and sound engineer,\u201d Jackson interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Angela murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd now we\u2019ll be getting an illusionist\u2014and a nurse,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cAnd, then, of course, you have me. An expert with cameras, film and what\u2019s fake on them and not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nurse must be coming in case we injure ourselves\u2014tangled up in film or sound equipment,\u201d Jake said, grinning.</p><p>Jackson kept quiet. Angela thought that there had to be another reason they were getting a woman who was a nurse. She looked at Jackson, but he just said, \u201cWill has gained a tremendous reputation for his illusions. He was asked to do a show for one of the paranormal TV networks. He turned it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Whitney said. She looked around at them all, and then sighed. \u201cJackson must know this\u2014I was working for a cable program\u2014and I was accused of doctoring the film to create an effect. And I didn\u2019t, and I was furious that anyone would think that I had. Anyway, I probably should have just said that I did it, let everyone have a laugh and gone on to get back to work. But I didn\u2019t doctor the film, and the film wound up disappearing, and I quit before I could be fired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat was on the film?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cIt looked like the ghost of a floating woman. We were out at one of the plantations. All kinds of companies have filmed out there, and you know, when it\u2019s going to be on television they reenact the \u2018haunting.\u2019 The thing is, we hadn\u2019t even started working on the images yet\u2014and there she was. I don\u2019t know how they think I pulled it off\u2014minus an actress, lighting, editing equipment\u2014but, supposedly, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntriguing,\u201d Angela said, looking at Jackson.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s usually something that isn\u2019t what it appears, and it usually is manipulated,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnyway, Will and Whitney are our film team, Jake is a computer whiz\u2014he can, and has, hacked into many places.\u201d He smiled, staring at Jake.</p><p>\u201cNothing terrible. I just know my way around a computer,\u201d Jake said in his defense.</p><p>When the meal ended, Jackson suggested that he and Angela go back\u2014just in case the senator arrived early\u2014while the others went and did some grocery shopping.</p><p>They left Jake and Whitney at the corner store on Royal, and headed on up toward Dauphine.</p><p>The house seemed just a house when they reached it again. Jackson opened the door and keyed in the alarm.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still sure you want to sleep in Regina Holloway\u2019s bedroom?\u201d Jackson asked her.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said earnestly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then we\u2019ll pack up our things and move to that wing. I\u2019ll take the bedroom right next to it.\u201d</p><p>They set about the task. As they did so, Angela realized that once the other two arrived, all six of them could be in the house\u2014and not even run into one another unless they descended to the kitchen or the courtyard at the same time.</p><p>She had just brought her belongings into the room and stepped out onto the balcony over the courtyard when the gate swung open and a black limousine drove in.</p><p>The driver stepped out. He was tall, dark-haired and handsome. He smiled, displaying deep dimples as he opened the back door. That had to be Grable Haines.</p> <p>First out was a hulk. A true hulk. She assumed it was the senator\u2019s bodyguard, Blake Conroy. He was clean-shaven bald, and muscled like a Titan.</p><p>Another tall man, lean and almost elegant looking, got out of the car. He seemed to be about thirty-five, and moved with a fluid grace\u2014and darting eyes. More than the bodyguard, he seemed to be on the lookout. He had to be Martin DuPre, the senator\u2019s aide.</p><p>She\u2019d seen pictures of Senator Holloway. He was a striking man, as tall as the chauffeur, solid and lean in build, with graying dark hair and a face that was well sculpted, but showing signs of strain and character. Sad in a way that she felt as if her heart tightened, watching him.</p><p>He looked up at the house and saw her looking down, and for a moment, his weathered features tensed; his hand came to his chest, tightly clenched.</p><p>She realized she was standing where his wife would have stood.</p><p>Before falling.</p><p>Before being pushed.</p><p>Before dying.</p> <p>She winced, and perhaps her horror at her accidental faux pas was evident, because he smiled at her then, lifted a hand and waved.</p><p>Then Jackson stepped out from the dining room doors below to greet the senator, and she quickly stepped away from the balcony and back into the bedroom.</p><p>She paused for a minute, wondering if she might feel anything of the woman who had lived here so briefly.</p><p>But there was nothing, and so she started to leave the room. And then, as she did so, she thought that she felt something. A touch on her cheek. A gentle touch. Something so light it might have been imagined.</p><p>\u201cRegina?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>But again, there was nothing. And so she hurried down the stairs, anxious to meet the senator\u2014and the men who followed behind him.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you, Mr. Crow. You know, I\u2019m grateful to Adam Harrison for setting up this team.\u201d Age became Senator Holloway. He was barely forty but looked more like fifty\u2014a good fifty. His graying hair was left alone to gray. He had good teeth when he tried to offer a smile, and his handshake was firm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to do everything that we can,\u201d Jackson assured him.</p><p>He turned. Angela, a little breathless, had come out the doors to stand behind him and to his side.</p><p>\u201cMiss Hawkins?\u201d the senator asked, offering a hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Angela,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, sir. And I\u2019m so sorry. I saw the way that you looked up at me, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d David Holloway told her. His smile was poignant. \u201cI thought I saw an angel standing there for a minute. I understand you\u2019re here to investigate, and that\u2019s where you need to be in order to investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenator Holloway, you did find your wife, right?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>Holloway looked over at Jackson. \u201cYou know that, of course. You\u2019ve read the police reports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I need you to go over everything again. With me,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go inside,\u201d Angela suggested. She looked at the senator steadily. \u201cRegina had an amazing talent as a decorator and homemaker. The house was coming along beautifully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was talented, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d the senator said. He looked up at the house for a minute, as if he wanted to refuse to go in. But he said, \u201cI like the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go hang around the kitchen table then,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cLet me introduce everyone and make sure I\u2019ve got it right, but even without files...\u201d Jackson said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m Jackson Crow, and this is Angela Hawkins. You are Blake Conroy, bodyguard, right?\u201d He said to the massive bald man. He didn\u2019t think that a man with so much bulk\u2014even muscled bulk\u2014might have scaled walls. \u201cAnd, Martin DuPre,\u201d he said, shaking the man\u2019s hand. \u201cWe may be calling on you frequently, Martin.\u201d DuPre\u2019s Armani suit couldn\u2019t conceal his litheness. And he stood close to the senator, a protective barrier, despite the hulky bodyguard nearby. \u201cAnd Grable Haines, you are responsible for getting everyone everywhere, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go where the senator tells me,\u201d Haines said. \u201cThat\u2019s my job to serve Senator Holloway\u2019s needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in and talk for a few minutes,\u201d Jackson said. He wanted to split them up. As they went through the courtyard doors, he said, \u201cSenator, would you take a walk with Angela and tell her everything that you did the night you found Regina?\u201d</p><p>Holloway\u2019s mouth was grim, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cSenator?\u201d Angela said softly.</p><p>It was evident that she had struck a sympathetic chord with the man. They might not get new evidence today, but at least he could see the dynamics between the men who served Senator Holloway, and perhaps get a better sense of the man who had believed so fully in his wife that he would not accept a verdict of suicide.</p><p>Angela looked back at him gravely. He nodded, and she smiled grimly. It was a good communication. He may not like her and he might well be convinced still that she was a loon, but he trusted her with talking to the man; she knew it.</p><p>Maybe they were becoming something of a team.</p><p>\u201cDid you come in through the front door that day?\u201d Angela asked Senator Holloway. \u201cForgive me if I ask you to repeat too much. I know this is hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. While Jackson had ushered the chauffeur, the bodyguard and the aide into the kitchen, she walked down the hall to the great ballroom with the senator. He stood there a minute, his eyes filled with sadness as he looked around the room. He frowned, noting the cameras and lights and screens set up, but then the frown faded and he just looked sad again as he surveyed the furniture, covered in dust cloths and shoved against the walls.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou still own it,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe really weren\u2019t fanciful people. We didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, and the house had been bought and abandoned, bought and abandoned over the years...its reputation had made it a deal when we bought it.\u201d Holloway studied her gravely. \u201cBut you dug up bones\u2014right after you got here. I knew if I went to Adam Harrison, he\u2019d find the right people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the bones in the basement had nothing to do with your wife,\u201d Angela told him. \u201cThat poor man was a victim, like many others in Madden C. Newton\u2019s circle. Newton was a predator, swooping down on the misfortunes of others.\u201d She segued back to the present. \u201cSo you came in by the front door? Didn\u2019t your chauffeur let you off in the courtyard that day?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t in session. I have an office over in the CBD. I was working there, and I had Grable on call. I didn\u2019t need him to hang at my side all day, so I told him just to pay attention to his cell phone.\u201d</p><p>There was no alibi for the chauffeur at the time Regina Holloway died.</p><p>\u201cSo you entered through the front door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used my key, and then I tapped in the code on the alarm pad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alarm was set, you\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAt least, I think I\u2019m certain. Yes, I\u2019m certain. I remember hearing the little chirps that warn you to key in the code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called out to Regina, but she didn\u2019t answer. Obviously,\u201d he added bitterly.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you went up the stairs and through the house?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s retrace your steps,\u201d she said.</p><p>He walked toward the grand staircase and she followed. He traversed the hall, turned at the ell and turned again at the last ell.</p><p>Then he paused.</p><p>There was absolutely no doubt in Angela\u2019s mind that Senator David Holloway had truly loved his wife. He stood still, looking older than his years, his face a mask of grief and regret.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>He nodded and moved on. \u201cI came to our room. I could see that she had been lying on the bed, resting. She loved this room. She was always so busy...she was industrious. That was why I wanted the house so badly. I knew she would work hard, embrace the project. And she did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened then? Did you go downstairs looking for your wife?\u201d Angela asked. \u201cDid you think she might have been in the kitchen, cooking, maybe?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI saw the doors open to the balcony. It was a beautiful twilight, and I figured she had stepped out to catch the night breeze. I walked out to the balcony, and I called her name again. And then I looked down.\u201d</p><p>Grief, poignant and fresh, had slipped into his voice. He covered his face with his hands. Angela touched him gently on the shoulder, and stood silent, waiting. Anything she might have thought of to say would have been inane.</p> <p>He took a moment, and then looked at her, his features contorted with pain. \u201cHer eyes were open,\u201d he said, his voice ragged. \u201cHer eyes were open. She lay on her back, her head at an awful angle, and blood was pooling beneath it. But her eyes were open, and she almost seemed to be staring at me. Or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cAs if she had seen something as she died. Something so horrible that she couldn\u2019t bear it. Something terrifying. And, I\u2019m afraid I know what it was.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Angela asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ghost.\u201d</p> <p>Confused, Angela stood still and quiet for a minute. \u201cYou said that you and your wife weren\u2019t fanciful people. That you didn\u2019t believe in ghosts,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Not until I owned this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014you believe your wife saw a ghost?\u201d</p><p>He let out a breath, staring at her. \u201cThere were places in the house she wouldn\u2019t go when I wasn\u2019t home. She said that they just made her uncomfortable. And I don\u2019t really know what I saw, but when I was in the kitchen once, I felt as if someone was watching me. I looked at the door to the basement\u2014and there was something there. I don\u2019t know what. It seemed like a big black shadow. It was there, and then it was gone. Was it a ghost? Hell, I don\u2019t know. I do know that I felt as cold as ice, and had rivulets of fear racing up and down my spine. I told myself I was being ridiculous, but, later, that night, Regina asked me if I believed in ghosts. I said no, and reminded her that neither did she. But, then, after she died...I started to think about it again. And when she died, people looked at me as if I had to be a monster\u2014as if I had caused her suicide. I didn\u2019t. I believe now that ghosts caused her suicide, and you people need to find out if they\u2019re real\u2014you need to prove it for me!\u201d</p><p>Jackson sat on the counter, trying to remain casual and easy while questioning the trio that continually surrounded Senator Holloway. They\u2019d chatted about the Saints and other local sports teams, and he learned that the hulk\u2014Blake Conroy\u2014had wrestled professionally. Grable Haines admitted to having done time in a juvenile detention center for petty larceny, and Martin DuPre had simply been in love with politics since he\u2019d been a kid. \u201cPolitics and power, they go hand in hand. And the right people need to be in power. I\u2019m lucky. I learn so much from Senator Holloway, it\u2019s like a miracle, a present from God,\u201d DuPre told him.</p><p>\u201cEverybody loves the senator,\u201d Blake said, nodding.</p> <p>\u201cBut he needs a bodyguard,\u201d Jackson pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a politician\u2014and no wishy-washy yes-man, either. He sticks to his guns. If he ever changes his stance on something, it\u2019s because he\u2019s received new information,\u201d Conroy said. He was drinking a soda\u2014the regular-size bottle dwarfed by his mitts.</p><p>\u201cMostly, some of the really right-wing religious groups are against him,\u201d DuPre told him.</p><p>\u201cI heard about a few earlier,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe Aryans and the Church of Christ Arisen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Aryans are assholes,\u201d Grable said.</p><p>\u201cFreedom of speech in this country\u2014nothing we can do about them,\u201d DuPre reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, thank God they don\u2019t have much of a hold here, not in New Orleans,\u201d Blake said. He slammed a fist against his palm. \u201cThey are neo-Nazis at their worst. Of course, it would be illegal to euthanize anyone with impure blood, so they use words as weapons. And they do it well. If God had wanted us to be all one race, we would have come that way, they say. God had separations in color for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014we come as one single race at the beginning, as far as I understand anthropology,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, go figure,\u201d DuPre said. \u201cThing is, the senator, he\u2019s always politically correct. No matter what those\u2014\u201d he stopped for a moment, glancing at Grable \u201c\u2014assholes do, the senator is calm and soft-spoken, just holding his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Church of Christ Arisen?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, they\u2019re just really weird,\u201d Grable told him. \u201cThey have some secret rituals, like the Masonic Lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t compare them to Masons!\u201d Blake protested. \u201cMy dad was a Mason. And a Shriner. Those guys got together and supported kids in hospitals. Don\u2019t even compare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have to be a member of the church to attend their meetings. There\u2019s a bishop, name\u2019s Richard Gull,\u201d Blake told him. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a high council, with five members. They\u2019re protected by law, but I don\u2019t think they should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s an enormous church in this country where people worship aliens, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d DuPre put in. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country, with separation of church and state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have all the laws in the world\u2014and that don\u2019t stop the Santeria groups from practicing animal sacrifice,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cOr voodoo priestesses from torturing snakes!\u201d Grable asserted, shuddering as he made a face.</p><p>\u201cYou feeling sorry for the priestess or the snake?\u201d Blake asked him, grinning.</p><p>\u201cWell, anyway, can you all tell me about the day Regina Holloway died?\u201d Jackson asked. They\u2019d been talking, the three of them, easily, coworkers who might not have a lot in common, except for their love for their boss.</p><p>But they sobered and went silent at the question.</p><p>\u201cShould have been a good day,\u201d Grable said, shaking his head. \u201cI was off most of the day. I gambled at the casino and won. Then the senator called me, and I picked him up and dropped him off. Wasn\u2019t half an hour later that I got the call about Regina. I got back here, but...by then, the coroner\u2019s office had been called in, cops and yellow tape were everywhere, and the senator was in the entertainment room, with DuPre.\u201d</p><p>Martin DuPre sighed softly. \u201cIt was horrible. Senator Holloway cried. Sobbed. I had to get him away from people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you with him?\u201d Jackson asked Blake. \u201cSorry\u2014 I mean, you are his bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe was just working in his office in the CBD that day. Going in and coming out. He said that he didn\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where were you all day, Mr. Conroy?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cAt home. I don\u2019t have much time to call my own, and it was like a picnic! I have a place uptown and I just worked out all day. But I came when I got the call, too. DuPre let me know what was going on, and I got here as fast as I could. I felt helpless as a baby, though. Never saw anything like the senator,\u201d Blake said. \u201cThe next week, it was like he didn\u2019t care if he died himself. I was working hard then, I\u2019ll tell you. Running after him, keeping up with him,\u201d the bodyguard said. \u201cHe\u2019d start working, he\u2019d want to walk. He\u2019d start working again, he\u2019d want coffee, he\u2019d need something at the apartment\u2014he was all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. DuPre?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cWhere were you that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I was at the office most of the day. I was going to come back here with the senator, but he said that he didn\u2019t need my help, he wanted to try to have a nice night with Regina,\u201d DuPre said sadly.</p><p>None of them had an alibi, except for DuPre.</p><p>Blake Conroy was just about the size of a yeti\u2014doubtful he had leaped down from any brick walls. Both DuPre and Haines were probably more agile.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. He needed to chase down the alibis on all three of the men.</p><p>He looked to the doorway. Angela was back down with the senator.</p><p>The senator handed Jackson a card. \u201cMy office address, and my business phone and cell phone are on that card. I\u2019ve taken an apartment in the complex down on Decatur Street, overlooking the river. I\u2019d just as soon we talk there from now on,\u201d he said.</p><p>DuPre, Haines and Blake stood, clearly aware that they were leaving.</p><p>\u201cI know it was hard for you. Thank you for coming here today,\u201d Jackson told the senator.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being here,\u201d the senator told him sincerely. \u201cFind out the truth. Maybe I can let Regina rest if I can just know the truth.\u201d He was quiet for a minute. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, dammit. But, I might have been the fool, and, of course, I couldn\u2019t say that to the police. There is something about this house. If I would have taken more time with Regina...but maybe that wouldn\u2019t have changed anything. Maybe there are ghosts. And maybe the ghosts were too much for her.\u201d</p><p>Jackson was startled by his statement, and looked at Angela. Her eyes widened and she subtly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou now believe that there are ghosts in here, Senator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you people confirm that sort of thing?\u201d the senator asked. \u201cI mean, Miss Hawkins was here one night, and she dug bones out of the basement. If my wife went over that balcony, something made her do it. God alone knows\u2014maybe it was a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I have a book on Madden C. Newton. Reading it led me to the bones,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cWhen was this book written?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYears and years ago,\u201d Angela assured him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the author find the bones?\u201d the senator asked. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t have a sixth sense,\u201d he said, nodding sagely.</p><p>\u201cActually, in the book, there was a mention of the fact that Madden C. Newton used to tell people that his basement was an amazing place, and that he loved the shadows beneath the stairs,\u201d Angela said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m afraid it was the book that led me to the skeleton.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Jackson said, a slight edge to his voice, \u201cthe author of the book didn\u2019t dig up the bones because he didn\u2019t have access to the house, and if he had had access, he might not have had Angela\u2019s ability to work inside the mind of a victim\u2014and a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the senator said softly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave it all in your capable hands, and, of course, these gentlemen are at your disposal,\u201d the senator said. He offered his hand to shake with Jackson, and then headed out the kitchen door to the courtyard. His trio waved and murmured goodbyes, following him.</p><p>Jackson slipped down from the counter to follow them out. Angela came behind him.</p> <p>It was evident that Senator Holloway was eager to find a killer\u2014living or dead\u2014as long as it meant that Regina Holloway had not killed herself. Grable Haines opened one side of the back door of the black sedan for the senator; DuPre entered before Blake Conroy, letting the massive bodyguard maneuver his bulk into the car last.</p><p>The gate opened; the car backed out carefully onto the street.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pecking order,\u201d he noted. \u201cDuPre is the closest to the senator. Then Conroy, and then the chauffeur, Haines. DuPre considers himself highest in the senator\u2019s esteem, and he\u2019s very aware he\u2019s the most educated. Probably the only bright future among them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they get along?\u201d Angela asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes. They seem to do well enough.\u201d He turned to look at Angela. \u201cWhat made him suddenly turn to ghosts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was surprised, too,\u201d Angela said. \u201cHe talked about the way that Regina had died,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said that he could see that her neck was broken\u2014or that her head was at an angle\u2014and that her eyes were open. She was staring, wide-eyed, as if she had been in terror of something. And he told me that he\u2019d seen a shadow in the kitchen that had given him the creeps, but that he had still denied it to his wife. He wants ghosts to have killed his wife. And he feels that people hated him after she died, because they believed that it was his coldness that had led his wife to suicide. I think he wants someone else to blame\u2014and he wants it to be a ghost. If we can prove that there are ghosts in this house, he\u2019ll be vindicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts don\u2019t kill people,\u201d Jackson said flatly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019ll prove\u2014beyond the scientific eye\u2014that ghosts exist. Maybe he believes that if he can get a crack team of paranormal investigators just to say that the house is haunted and there are ghosts here manipulating and terrifying people, that will be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to study the coroner\u2019s photos,\u201d he said, turning and heading into the kitchen. He opened his computer, still on the table from that morning, and accessed a number of the files he had downloaded.</p><p>She was standing behind him. He realized that he was drawing up a grisly death scene\u2014and that he was still aware of the subtle and alluring scent of her perfume. He was seated; a strand of her wheat-gold hair fell on his shoulder. She didn\u2019t notice. She was looking at the screen.</p><p>He had looked at the various photos\u2014Regina Holloway taken in death from several different vantage points\u2014several times. Now he looked again, studying the dead woman\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOnce, science actually studied the eyes in forensics\u2014believing the last thing a person had seen was preserved, like film, on the retinas,\u201d Angela murmured. \u201cIt does look as if she was terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified\u2014and looking at someone or something,\u201d Jackson mused. He moved the photos around and stood up, nearly knocking her over. He caught her by the arm, steadying her. \u201cSorry!\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cLet\u2019s get up to the room.\u201d</p><p>She was a distraction. He was concentrated on the position of a body, and he was still aware that touching her, he felt the softness of her flesh, and the vitality beneath it.</p><p>He gave himself a mental shake. They were becoming a team, he reminded himself.</p><p>And...and he didn\u2019t like the fact that though she didn\u2019t say so, she was convinced that ghosts walked around, and maybe even that ghosts would talk to her in Regina Holloway\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He paused, gritting his teeth. Was he afraid, maybe just a little, that everything he wanted to deny was true?</p><p>No, reality and truth lay at the heart of this death. There was a human being out there responsible.</p><p>He took the center stairs up to the second floor, aware that she was following him. He strode straight to the balcony in Regina\u2019s room and looked down to the courtyard, envisioning the position of the body. \u201cShe didn\u2019t dive forward,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cShe went over backward.\u201d</p> <p>Angela walked to the balcony and turned around, placing her palms on the railing. \u201cShe was standing like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you think that a suicide would have stood here, and flung herself over backward?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cRight. But you agree with me. It\u2019s highly improbable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but remember the old Sir Arthur Conan Doyle slash Sherlock Holmes adage?\u201d Angela asked him. \u201cWhen you get rid of the impossible, what\u2019s left is the only answer, no matter how improbable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConan Doyle believed in ghosts, and Senator Holloway sure seems to think we hunt them,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>She stared back at him. \u201cWe do, don\u2019t we?\u201d she asked quietly after a minute.</p><p>\u201cI used to be with a respected Behavioral Science Unit.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAnd I was a cop, looking to eventually become a detective. Jackson, apparently there are people out there who believe ghost hunting is a respected talent. Adam Harrison put us all together because he believes in us. He believes in our ability to prove that ghosts aren\u2019t responsible, just as much as he does in our ability to let our minds discover what really was in the past. What is a ghost? To some people, a ghost is a memory. To others, a paranormal experience might be a way of dealing with a loss, or something else terrible. If we can open our minds to all kinds of possibilities, accepting the fact that science hadn\u2019t really even begun to discover the incredible machinations of the human brain, we strip away whatever it is about this assignment that\u2019s embarrassing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed,\u201d he protested. He had been, he realized. He winced.</p><p>What were ghosts? Memories?</p><p>Face it. He\u2019d seen a ghost in his mind\u2019s eye\u2014or the machinations of his brain had brought a ghost to him\u2014and he had saved two lives because of it. Angela, looking at him so earnestly, was right. As a child, he\u2019d been saved by a ghost. A memory. Or a man who had become a ghost memory, because he\u2019d seen a portrait in a hallway of a medieval warrior.</p><p>There were times, even now, when he looked back and wondered. He\u2019d been a boy when he\u2019d been in Scotland, riding with his friends. Racing. All these years later, he could still remember falling from his horse\u2014and lying on the ground in the middle of the woods, thinking that his friends had gone on, assuming he was way ahead of him. And then the man had come to find him, help him, bring him home and leave him on his doorstep. Then, later, he had wandered his mother\u2019s ancestral home, and he had seen the man in a painting. A painting he had seen before, but hadn\u2019t connected with the man who had saved his life. But it was him. Or someone who just looked like him. He had always clung to that explanation. Yet there was always that question at the back of his mind.</p><p>He knew that he could do what Angela did; stop, clear his mind, concentrate. And the possibilities of what might be were out there.</p><p>She laughed suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen a ghost,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen ghosts,\u201d he accused her.</p><p>She was still smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve seen, really. I believe that there\u2019s more to life than what we see. All right\u2014I\u2019ve been places when a parent senses that a child is in danger.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, a bit annoyed; she seemed completely comfortable with her own beliefs, and confident in herself. She didn\u2019t run around broadcasting her talents, she just accepted them.</p><p>He smiled suddenly. \u201cSome things, we\u2019ll just figure out as we go. This is new to all of us\u2014I think we\u2019re an experiment Adam has wanted to orchestrate for a long time.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and he thought that she moved just a step closer, maybe even beginning to like him. \u201cYes, and it\u2019s actually really intriguing to be a part of it. It\u2019s a good group. I like the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are those kids?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey should be back from the store by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming they\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d Angela said. She frowned, and he realized that she was still standing with her back to the railing, leaned slightly back. He visualized the body falling from her position, and knew that with a bit of impetus\u2014a push or a shove\u2014she would land on the courtyard, just as Regina Holloway had landed.</p><p>Despite himself, he reached out and pulled her closer to him, and away from the balcony.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going over,\u201d she told him, looking up into his eyes. She wasn\u2019t angry, and she didn\u2019t move away from him. For a moment, chemistry\u2014animal magnetism\u2014coursed through him. Maybe her parents had known when they\u2019d named her that she was destined to grow into such a golden and elegant young woman.</p><p>He just wanted to stay close to her; to protect her, from herself, if need be.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to mind being close. She did seem a bit amused. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite competent at defending myself, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of competent people go down\u2014I\u2019ve seen cops go down, I\u2019ve seen the most brilliantly trained men I knew go down,\u201d he said, an edge that he hadn\u2019t intended in his tone.</p><p>She touched his cheek with the pads of her fingers; it was a nice gesture, one a friend might make. \u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand, thinking that he might say more, thinking it was a surprisingly intimate moment. He\u2019d known her a day now. Maybe the intensity of the situation made it seem they had known each other much longer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe animal magnetism was just that\u2014he would have been attracted to her no matter where or when or how they had met.</p><p>He found himself caught in her gaze, wanting to know more about her. \u201cAre you ever totally honest?\u201d he asked her gently.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI know about your work with the police\u2014before and after you became an officer. But what happened before then? What\u2019s the real story on the plane crash?\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him. He thought that she would brush him off with a casual remark. But she hesitated. \u201cYou already think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that the mind\u2014that the human brain\u2014is a frontier. Many things may be possible. Or the illusions that we create in our mind may seem very real. I\u2019m serious. Please. Tell me. What happened with the plane crash?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and looked away from him. He knew that the memory was painful, but she had apparently decided to share it.</p><p>\u201cThe weather was bad throughout the flight, but our flight attendant kept assuring us that it was like bumping over the waves in the ocean. I was only twelve then, but even I knew when it went straight to hell. The flight attendant went rushing by us, white as a sheet, crossing herself. The plane began to heave and twist, and when it went to the side, I knew that something was really, really wrong. I was sitting next to my mom, and she threw her arms around me, as if she could protect me. The passengers started screaming. I can still hear the sound in my mind sometimes...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jackson said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSome were pulling out their cell phones, trying to say goodbye to loved ones. Most were just screaming. Then it happened fast. The pilots struggled, I\u2019m sure\u2014but they were attempting to land against a terrible wind shear\u2014I learned that later. The plane broke up as it hit the ground. Luggage flew, no matter how it had been stowed. A wing broke off. The plane spun around. The next thing I knew, I was sideways down on the tarmac, and fire was bursting all over in spurts along with the remnants of the plane. I managed to undo my seat belt and fall face-first to the ground. I shouted for my mother and father. I tried to crawl through the wreckage.\u201d</p><p>She stopped speaking. Jackson urged her on. \u201cAnd what then?\u201d He almost whispered the words.</p><p>\u201cGames in my head? In my heart?\u201d She looked at him. \u201cI saw them. My fellow passengers. They had turned into yellow light, and they rose from the ground, heading for a greater source of light, and I wanted to get up and follow them. I saw my mother, and I shouted for her, but she was ahead with my father. They had found one another, and my father was looking at my mother with a pained expression that still held hope and love. I cried out for them both to wait. They didn\u2019t seem to hear me, but there was someone next to me. A man in some kind of white shift, so it seemed, and he hovered down by me. He smoothed back my hair and he said gently, \u2018No, little one, they have to go, and you have to stay. It\u2019s all right. If you look, you\u2019ll see all the light and the splendor, and you can know in your heart that you\u2019re always safe, for the light shines down upon you.\u2019 He touched my face, and I closed my eyes. When I opened them again, the sound of sirens blaring was all around me, and I was in excruciating pain. Luckily, I blacked out again. I spent weeks in the hospital. But Eamon was there for me, my brother. He hadn\u2019t been on the plane with us because he\u2019s three years older than me, and he was away at football camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you made it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd you believe that...you saw your parents walk toward the light\u2014heaven?\u2014and that you were told by an entity of good that you had to stay behind?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYes, that\u2019s more or less the gist of it. And, so now, you think I\u2019m crazier still, but maybe I have a right to be crazy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou survived,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I survived. My broken bones mended, and my burned flesh peeled away, and thankfully, I don\u2019t even bear a scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite believe that, but you went into law enforcement, and you\u2019ve helped in many cases,\u201d he said. \u201cAny connection?\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully. \u201cNot really. I fell in love, lost the man I loved to cancer, and knew that I had to use whatever I possessed to try to help others. I am not a particularly good soul or anything of the like\u2014it was what was left for me to do that seemed important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I do think that you are a good soul,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to. He liked her. Very much.</p><p>Despite the way he had met her. Pickax in hand.</p><p>They were caught there, in that intimate moment, not just physically intimate, but somehow, as a meeting of something that might be of the souls, though that sounded somewhat ridiculous.</p> <p>\u201cSo what about you?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cNone of us got to see your file, if you\u2019ll recall.\u201d</p><p>He was saved from having to answer her when they heard the doorbell ring, and shouts arise from the front, the sound carrying easily to them where they stood outside on the balcony.</p><p>\u201cHey, please! Carrying a heavy load out here, you know!\u201d</p><p>That came from Whitney.</p><p>The doorbell rang again, insistently.</p><p>Jackson stepped back.</p><p>\u201cAh, gee, honey,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cI guess the kids are home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>In the next few hours, bags of groceries were put away, and Whitney and Jake settled in.</p><p>Angela spent the time in her room\u2014Regina Holloway\u2019s room\u2014arranging her own clothing in drawers and closets, and pausing now and then to see if she could get a sense of the children again, and she wondered if finding them would really help the team in their quest to discover the truth. But she didn\u2019t see or feel anything; the room was just a room at that moment, a beautiful one. She kept the balcony doors open because the city had yet to grow hot and humid; spring was still in the air, the humidity was not at the eighty or ninety percent it could be and the breeze that came in was just beautiful.</p><p>She found herself wondering more about Jackson Crow. He had become human to her; she still couldn\u2019t believe that she had told him about the plane crash\u2014and the man who had spoken to her, telling her that it wasn\u2019t time for her to go to the \u201clight.\u201d</p><p>A tap at her open door interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>Jackson leaned against the door frame, his stillness so familiar despite their short acquaintance. Adam wouldn\u2019t have him heading up this unit if there wasn\u2019t a core of belief in life after death. She knew he had to be shaken up about his last experience in the field; people had died. Friends had died.</p><p>And despite the fact that two of the kids had only just arrived, making her the more senior team member, she could barely imagine what he had felt. She was certain that Adam had taken great care when putting their team together. They were people who were very different, but who had the talents and personalities that would complement one another.</p><p>\u201cAre you busy?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She nodded at the open drawers. \u201cJust finishing in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d sensed more bones in the wall. I wanted to be able to duck quickly,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, the pickax is in the basement,\u201d she told him, able to smile. He was actually joking. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked in. \u201cDo you have a hang-up about people sitting on the end of your bed?\u201d he asked. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>He sat. \u201cSo, what was your take on the senator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you heard him\u2014I think he really wanted ghost hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what did you feel about him? About his emotions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really devastated by his wife\u2019s death,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he is the one who found her. What did you discover in regards to his companions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery one of them is a possible suspect. The day she died, they were all in New Orleans. Senator Holloway was working. Blake Conroy was at his home gym, so he says, and Grable Haines was gambling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Martin DuPre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was at the office with the senator, but I doubt they were in clear view of one another all the time. You can walk here from the Central Business District. I\u2019d say it would take someone twenty to thirty minutes, walking briskly. A cab would take a few minutes, depending on traffic. Perhaps he has his own car. I didn\u2019t want them all together when I got into specifics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go from here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTonight? We\u2019re heading toward dusk, you know. I thought we should lie low, help set up the cameras and get started taking video or film or whatever they work with, and see if we have any surprises showing up on the screens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you expecting anything?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI never say never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost seven, it\u2019s been a long day\u2014I\u2019m heading down for a beer. Oh, Jake Mallory is a sushi freak\u2014and an expert sushi chef, so he claims. Do you eat sushi? He\u2019s doing up some noodles and stir-fry, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty safe on almost anything,\u201d she told him. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to try monkey brains, or anything, but otherwise...\u201d</p><p>He grinned, rising. \u201cYou coming down?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>It was twilight. Part of her wanted to just go with him; a beer did sound appealing at the moment. But this was near when Regina Holloway had died, and if there were things that might be seen in the room, this was the time. She should be open to allowing the past to talk to her now, whether that meant ghosts, or just something that she did with her mind.</p><p>She remembered talking to Jake, though, and Jake telling her ardently that he knew people who saw ghosts.</p><p>Jake and his friends were crazy. That was all she\u2019d allow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in just a few minutes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep your beer on ice,\u201d he said, leaving.</p><p>Sensations could indeed be strange. The room seemed empty when he left; drained of life. She tried to dismiss the thought, reminding herself that she had only known him one day. Last night, he\u2019d put her on the defensive. But maybe that was what he had felt he needed to do as the head of the team. Today, she felt as if she had seen behind his facade. He was vulnerable, too. He knew that he hadn\u2019t caused the deaths that had befallen his last team. Yet, he still blamed himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And, it was possible that he still believed that he\u2019d been assigned to some kind of slightly crazy unit, a babysitting unit\u2014a unit not actually meant for the hundreds of serial killers active in the country at any given time.</p><p>Regina Holloway was dead. There was no saving her now.</p><p>Angela lay down on the bed and closed her eyes. She tried to imagine the children as she had seen them before, on the floor, playing jacks. It was horrible to think how the children had died, and she wondered how Newton had managed such horrendous murders without being heard. She was pretty sure many of his torture-killings had taken place in the basement, but she thought that the children might have been killed in this room. She thought about Percy, trying to be an older brother, trying to reassure his little sister.</p> <p>It hurt to imagine the fear that must have seized them both when the man who was supposedly trying to help their father had come after them with an ax.</p><p>She found herself praying, so many years later, that somehow, they had died quickly, and that the pain hadn\u2019t gone on too long. And still...had Percy watched Madden C. Newton chop up his sister? Or had the older brother been the first to die?</p><p>Darkness was settling over the room. She hadn\u2019t opened her eyes, but she could feel it, just as she could feel the breeze that wafted in, and the way that it lifted the curtains by the French doors.</p><p>She opened her eyes slowly.</p><p>The little boy was there. He was watching her sorrowfully.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t move; she was afraid to blink. His face was old for his years, and his eyes seemed to carry the wisdom of the ages.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, please, be careful,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Was she dreaming?</p><p>\u201cPercy?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>But as if the breeze could dissipate illusion, he was suddenly gone.</p><p>She waited. She felt frozen. She realized that she was afraid, and yet she wasn\u2019t afraid of the little boy who had to be Percy.</p> <p>She was terrified, she realized, because it hadn\u2019t been a dream. It had been real; she had thought about him, and he had appeared.</p><p>The mind; a scientist would say that she could do such things only through imagination.</p><p>Anticipation and dread rushed through her body and she closed her eyes. Fear followed hope. She opened her eyes, but there was no one, nothing there.</p><p>She sat up, and felt the darkness in the room, alleviated by lamps that had come on in the courtyard, and from the light in the hallway. The room was drenched in shadow. The closet door was slightly ajar, as was that to the bathroom. For a moment, she had a child\u2019s ridiculous fear that a monster would suddenly rush out of the closet and attack her.</p><p>She waited, determined she would not be frightened out of the room. She did believe that something evil\u2014ill will? Something more tangible?\u2014resided in the house. But, whatever evil might lurk in the minds of men had nothing to do with the appearance of the child. She wanted to see the little boy again, the little boy she was certain had to be Percy.</p><p>But laughter drifted up to her from the kitchen, and she heard the sound of a guitar being strummed.</p><p>Jake, the musician, and computer and sound expert.</p><p>It was time for that beer Jackson had promised to keep cold for her.</p> <p>Jackson read the newspaper article on the discovery in the house, surprised to find himself comfortable on a stool near the counter pass-over to the courtyard. Jake was strumming his guitar while calling out orders to Whitney to do his prep work\u2014insisting it would come out to be a feast.</p><p>He was adept on the guitar. The instrument he had brought with him was acoustic, and he kept his tunes low and mellow\u2014but ridiculously bawdy at times\u2014causing Whitney to stop in the midst of her tasks that he had assigned to her and giggle. He had to admit, Jake made him laugh now and then, and it seemed like a good thing that, so far, they all seemed so easy and ready to get along with one another. But then, Whitney staged a revolt, laughing and telling Jake that she\u2019d set the table, fixed his flipping rice balls, and it was time for him to get back in the act.</p><p>Jake sighed, set down his guitar and started to work, thanking Whitney for all her excellent preparation. Jackson looked at the newspaper again.</p><p>The article contained little more than the facts, but with, of course, the questions about the house being haunted being raised again, and the tragedy of Regina Holloway\u2019s death coming to the fore once again. He liked the spin in the article, though\u2014the reporter had quoted Andy Devereaux\u2019s police spokesman as saying, \u201cThe investigation team that discovered the bones will be continuing to study the history of the house, and seek out any more such surprises, before Senator Holloway puts the house back up on the market. With its infamous past, it doesn\u2019t seem at all impossible that there may be more skeletons\u2014literally\u2014hanging in a few of the closets.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, the article didn\u2019t even hint at the unit being ghost hunters\u2014or, thank God, any type of sci-fi-driven team claiming that the aliens did it all.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. Whitney, smiling and cheerful, was offering him a bite of something off her tongs. He smiled, remembering Angela\u2019s earlier words. \u201cIt\u2019s not monkey brains, is it?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and Jake, standing over the range top, joined her. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never had monkey brains. And, as long as I\u2019m in the kitchen, there won\u2019t be any, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalmon, avocado, tempura shrimp and cream cheese,\u201d Whitney advised him.</p><p>He took the bite. The little piece of roll was delicious. \u201cWonderful. We\u2019ve found ourselves a cook,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cChef,\u201d Jake said in protest.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not every night,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cYou\u2019re too bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014you\u2019re supposed to be the assistant. I give orders, you assist,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I don\u2019t care who cooks, or if I have to follow a few orders\u2014as long as you don\u2019t make me the main cook,\u201d Whitney said. She wrinkled her face, taking over from Jake to stir the vegetables. \u201cI can prepare one delicious dish\u2014jambalaya. And it is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJambalaya sounds great, too,\u201d Angela said, entering the kitchen. \u201cWow. It smells wonderful down here,\u201d she said. \u201cAre we eating in here? Or in the dining room? Hey, do people actually eat in their dining rooms, ever? Or is that an only-when-company-comes kind of thing for real these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say the courtyard...it\u2019s gorgeous outside,\u201d Jake told them all. \u201cWell, the dining room isn\u2019t for eating, we all know it\u2019s just for show. No, the dining room ain\u2019t for eating, just for company, just for show, just when you bring that Bourbon Street stripper-ho-ho home, oh, yeah, just for show!\u201d</p><p>Whitney groaned.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s a good song!\u201d Jake protested.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly good song, but Jake had an amazing musical ability. Jackson had a feeling that he sat with that guitar, strumming out solutions to his problems.</p><p>\u201cCourtyard it is,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>It all moved quickly with the four of them taking out the food, lights and all that was needed. They were all aware, of course, of the place where Regina Holloway had fallen, but then they were there to investigate the death\u2014and therefore honor the life\u2014of the woman.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m pretty sure that Regina Holloway believed in spirits\u2014in some form or another,\u201d Whitney said, passing out the sushi rolls.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jackson asked her. \u201cYour great-grandmother said that she didn\u2019t believe in ghosts. What do you mean\u2014spirits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Regina Holloway went to my great-grandmother\u2019s shop sometimes for advice, but I think she was doing things on her own as well. I found red candles in the lower cupboard. They\u2019re part of a banishing spell that\u2019s used frequently here in New Orleans. And my great-grandmother didn\u2019t say anything about Regina buying candles from her. I\u2019m just curious as to what she was doing on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop by my great-grandmother\u2019s shop tomorrow,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI wonder if she sold Regina the candles, and if she knows anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must\u2014your great-grandmother is a wonderful contact, Whitney. Angela, I think it would be great if you were to go to the store and spend more time with Mama Matisse. She just might say something else that we haven\u2019t thought about that could turn out to be really important,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI would like to go with you,\u201d Angela said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t know a lot about voodoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Angela laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Whitney admitted sheepishly. \u201cBut most people believe it\u2019s all about black magic and zombies. For some people, it\u2019s a very serious religion. And for anyone who really practices voodoo, well, you wouldn\u2019t dream of doing anything evil. It\u2019s like the Wiccan religion\u2014anything evil that you do will come back at you. Take a banishing spell. I\u2019m not sure how well we explained it earlier. You can\u2019t just wish that someone you don\u2019t like will disappear\u2014that could mean that you wish a train would hit them, or that they would walk off a mountain, or, well, something bad. Say you have a pesky neighbor. You have to try to banish him by hoping that he gets a new job that will make him richer, and then he\u2019ll buy a new house. Or, you have to wish that he decides to go live with his sister in Cleveland, and that he\u2019ll be happy there.\u201d</p><p>Angela reached for the soy sauce and said, \u201cIn this instance, Regina wouldn\u2019t have been trying to get rid of bad neighbors. She would have been trying to banish ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So she would have had to have wished that they find peace, and leave her home,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that voodooism hasn\u2019t had its share of deviants\u2014like any religion. In Haiti, there are penal codes for anyone trying to create a zombie. And plenty of men in power did do so\u2014part of it, of course, is mind control. And part of it was by using the poison of a puffer fish.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut the religion is practiced by about sixty million people worldwide,\u201d Jake put in, adding soy sauce to his sushi. He looked up. \u201cIt came heavily into practice in the 1700s, when the Europeans bought or captured Africans from the kingdom of Dahomey, which is now more or less Nigeria, Togo and Benin. The word voodoo comes from vodu in the Fon language, and means spirit, or God.\u201d</p><p>Jake was rewarded with an arched brow and a small smile from Whitney. But then she waved a hand in the air. \u201cJake grew up here\u2014he should know something about voodoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jake protested.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, inquiring minds do want to know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Whitney continued, \u201cthere\u2019s a supreme god, or bon dieu, and a host of Ion, other gods, and they relate to the Catholic saints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMovies have made voodoo priests and priestesses into monsters,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really love to see your great-grandmother\u2019s shop,\u201d Angela said.</p> <p>Whitney shrugged. \u201cSee the good clean living of a voodoo priestess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you grew up Roman Catholic,\u201d Jackson reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, my dad\u2019s parents were both of Irish descent. My mom\u2019s dad was Brazilian, and my mother\u2019s family was originally from Haiti, though they\u2019ve been in New Orleans for countless generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Jake said, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve definitely got that going as a plan for you two to go tomorrow to Whitney\u2019s great-grandmother\u2019s place,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have Will and Jenna watching over the house\u2014if they get here by then, and if not, you stay, Jake. Whitney, whether you\u2019re here or not when he comes, Will can find his way around all the equipment that you brought, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Whitney teased.</p> <p>\u201cHe majored in film at UCLA,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll manage,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cAnd, Jake, you\u2019re coming with me,\u201d Jackson told the younger man. \u201cI may need someone with local know-how and knowledge of the political ins and outs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Where are we going?\u201d Jake asked him.</p><p>\u201cTo the senator\u2019s headquarters in the CBD. I want to see the offices. I want to know exactly where the senator was, and where his aide, Martin DuPre, was, when Regina Holloway died,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also got to get the chauffeur, the bodyguard and the aide separated so that we can get them talking about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gossip fest?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Jackson told.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d Jake said.</p> <p>Whitney looked at Jackson and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re certain that someone living had something to do with Regina\u2019s death?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stake my life on it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t believe in ghosts, or anything outside the normal experience of life that can be scientifically explained?\u201d Whitney asked him, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t say that I did. In my mind, the jury is out. I wouldn\u2019t exclude the possibility that things out of what we consider normal might exist. In this case, however\u2014gut hunch, a knowledge of the devious machinations living men can come up with\u2014I believe that there\u2019s a human being involved in what\u2019s going on.\u201d He turned to Jake. \u201cWhen we\u2019re done at the senator\u2019s offices, we\u2019ll head out to find out more about the Aryans and the Church of Christ Arisen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a hard time thinking the Aryans would kill a woman by somehow forcing her over her own balcony,\u201d Angela said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have opened the door to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fond of guns, and they are pretty clear about what they want,\u201d Jake said. \u201cA gun in your face can make you open a door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they didn\u2019t get in here,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve seen and heard Regina Holloway was a smart woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I believe she was killed by someone close. Someone who knew her, knew her habits, someone she trusted,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cStill, political enemies need to be checked out... Hey, I want to see what all those monitors are going to show us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably Jake sleepwalking,\u201d Whitney said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you hoping for something? Do I or do I not sleep in the nude?\u201d Jake teased.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Whitney protested.</p><p>Angela stood up and started to collect plates. \u201cRegina Holloway wasn\u2019t killed by the ghosts in this house,\u201d she said.</p><p>There was silence for a minute.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying there are no ghosts in the house?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t say that. If ghosts are memory\u2014the memory of pain and suffering\u2014then this place is full of ghosts. I just don\u2019t believe that the \u2018ghosts\u2019 in the house would have hurt Regina Holloway. I think they would have tried to help her.\u201d</p><p>Angela headed back into the house.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s finish picking up,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll finish. You can go work with your monitors and cameras. I\u2019d like to see if we catch anything overnight,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Whitney set off to set up more of the equipment while the rest of them cleaned up from the meal, suddenly subdued. Angela wound up sending Jake off to help Whitney while she and Jackson put the last of the food away. When they were done, they went to see where the cameras had been set up.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough equipment, obviously, to monitor every area at once,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve chosen a few for the night, and we\u2019ve decided that we\u2019ll take turns watching what we have here for a while, and when it\u2019s time for us all to crash for the night\u2014which we\u2019ll have to do to be halfway productive tomorrow\u2014we\u2019ll run tape. Right now, we\u2019ve concentrated on this room, the hallways where all the rooms are, so that\u2019s four, and we\u2019ve also done the downstairs hallway through the entertainment area\u2014and we have one camera left that we want to set up in the basement tonight,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Jackson said. As he spoke, there was a knock at the door. The other three froze, startled by the interruption of the sound.</p><p>\u201cAnother member of our team,\u201d Jackson said, smiling. He walked to the door and looked out the peephole first, not wanting to be the clich\u00e9 of the agent who opened up to stranger with a sawed-off shotgun.</p><p>But he was somewhat surprised to see that Will Chan and Jenna Duffy had arrived together. She had been coming in from Boston, and he from Miami.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Will said, offering his hand. \u201cWill Chan, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna Duffy,\u201d Jackson said, shaking hands with both, and opening the door to allow them to enter. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time. We\u2019re setting up the cameras for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s handy,\u201d Jenna said with a mild lilt. She stepped into the room.</p><p>The group wasn\u2019t shy, Jackson realized quickly. Will and Jenna had teamed up at the airport when Will had heard Jenna giving a cab at the curb the address for the house on Dauphine. They had introduced themselves, and they were quick and easy to do so with the others. Everyone was ready to help them with their luggage as well, Whitney and Jake quickly seized on the fact that Will had come equipped with some of his own microphones and recording equipment.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get these two in rooms, first,\u201d Jackson suggested.</p><p>\u201cThere are two nice ones left in the middle section,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cJake and I are just up the stairs\u2014we grabbed a couple of the good rooms Jackson and Angela vacated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stick together,\u201d Will said. \u201cWon\u2019t we?\u201d he asked Jenna.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes!\u201d she said, smiling pleasantly. \u201cI think I like having someone else close in this house.\u201d</p><p>Jenna looked just like the American stereotype of the Irish; she was five foot five, with bright auburn hair, styled in a soft pixie cut that framed her oval face nicely. Her eyes were bright green. Will Chan was tall, and he seemed a perfect mixture of all the races that had gone into his makeup; he had pitch-black, dead-straight hair, cropped short but not too short, almond-shaped dark eyes and a sculpted face that seemed to speak oddly of Greek in his distant heritage. He was of a sturdier build than Jake Mallory. The Indians, Chinese and English had settled Trinidad, and they had all settled in the body that was Will Chan.</p><p>\u201cTake ten, and then we\u2019re all back here,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>He waited, watching Angela, who wound up with nothing to carry, as the others all headed up the stairs with the newcomers\u2019 belongings.</p><p>She turned to him suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re making me uncomfortable, you know,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just keep thinking about Shirley Jackson\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House,\u201d he said. \u201cThe character of Eleanor has led a hard life, and she\u2019s literally sucked into the legends of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, low blow!\u201d Angela protested. \u201cVery low blow! I liked being a cop. And, yes, I lost people, but I loved them very much...that you would compare me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just easy to be swayed by legend.\u201d</p><p>She shook a finger beneath his nose. \u201cYou are a liar, Mr. Crow.\u201d</p><p>He was taken by surprise. \u201cI haven\u2019t lied to any of you,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cOmission can be a lie, and you haven\u2019t told any of us anything about your past, and you must think we\u2019re all dense if we believe there isn\u2019t a reason that you were chosen,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I was chosen to be the skeptic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou all have leanings toward\u2014well, you all are ready to believe in ghosts. I\u2019m a \u2018show me\u2019 type person. Show me the ghosts, and I\u2019ll believe.\u201d</p><p>She crooked a brow. \u201cSometime, you will tell me the truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned, hearing footsteps on the main stairs.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re all ready!\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Jackson moved over to the display of screens Whitney had set up in the grand ballroom. One mirrored the movements they were making; another showed the empty hallways and another showed the upstairs hall. While Whitney took one of the cameras\u2014attached to an incredibly long extension cord\u2014and headed toward the hall to reach the kitchen, Jake bounded back up the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll give a call and a wave,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Will positioned himself in front of the monitors.</p><p>\u201cYep, good,\u201d Will said. \u201cWhitney, wave at me when you\u2019re down in the basement, too, and it\u2019s all set up. Let me know that the camera is good, and that you\u2019re fine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with Whitney,\u201d Angela said, \u201cand give her help if she needs any.\u201d</p><p>She seemed concerned about the basement, Jackson thought. But then, she\u2019d dug a skeleton out of the floor there.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you stay. I\u2019ll give her a hand. That camera looks heavy,\u201d he said. \u201cAngela, would you watch the screens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said slowly, looking at him. Will and Jenna remained to watch the screens as well.</p><p>He carried the camera, and Whitney followed, laying cord out as close to the wall as she could, lest one of them trip over it.</p><p>They went the length of the house and down to the basement. He turned on an overhead bulb to light up the vast basement area as Whitney set up, and they waved. \u201cWe\u2019re here\u2014how\u2019s the angle?\u201d she called out.</p><p>Jackson looked at her, surprised.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cMics\u2014right there, see, at the bottom of the camera, right above the tripod.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou look good!\u201d he heard Will call to him.</p><p>\u201cYep, they\u2019re all working,\u201d Angela said. \u201cHallway, hallway, hallway, hallway, ballroom and now basement. All are a check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, we\u2019re heading back,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Whitney preceded him, and together they walked back to the ballroom where the others were waiting, watching the monitors.</p><p>Nothing was happening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay up for a while and keep an eye on things,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you tire out, just get me, and I\u2019ll take on a few hours,\u201d Jake told him.</p> <p>\u201cCool,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cGet me about four in the morning. That\u2019s when I woke up when I was working as a nurse,\u201d Jenna told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great then\u2014we\u2019ll make it through the night,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had tape for when we were all sleeping,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cHey, we do,\u201d Whitney said, \u201cbut if one of us is willing to be up, that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, if anyone gets too tired, just let the tape roll,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going up to sleep. If you want me or need me, just come get me,\u201d Angela told them.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Whitney assured her. \u201cBut the film thing is what Will and I are supposed to do, so...I guess we\u2019ll figure it out as we go along, right?\u201d she asked Jackson.</p><p>Jackson smiled. \u201cYep, I guess we\u2019ll figure it out as we go along.\u201d He was surprised to realize just how much he liked his team, though he had just met Jenna and Will. And it was odd. He hadn\u2019t quite reached his thirty-fifth birthday; Angela was thirty. The others were in their mid-twenties. But he and Angela were still the \u201cseniors.\u201d And the \u201ckids,\u201d as they had called them, seemed to have figured out the pecking order already. \u201cGood job, kids,\u201d he said. \u201cAngela, I think that means we\u2019re supposed to get our sleep.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHey, it works for me.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. She took it. \u201cOkay, then, we\u2019re leaving the whole thing in your hands, kids. Is everyone\u2019s door to the balcony locked?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He was answered with a sea of nods.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m setting the alarm after Angela and I go up and make sure that ours are locked as well. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Good-nights were exchanged. He and Angela headed up the stairs, down the halls and to their respective rooms. At the door to hers, he paused. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re going to be comfortable sleeping in there?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI need to be sleeping in here,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, Mom,\u201d he teased. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>His room was next to hers. He\u2019d hear her if she made the slightest noise. And he was still loath to leave her there.</p><p>He would have to.</p><p>\u201cGood night\u2014and I\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cMake sure your door to the balcony is closed,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right next door if you need me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m glad,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She kissed his cheek. He was surprised by the gesture, though it was smooth and fluid.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>Then she walked into her room. She didn\u2019t close the hallway door.</p><p>Jackson went into his room. He found the remote control that managed the house on the table next to his bed.</p><p>He opened his bedside table, making sure his Glock 22 was exactly where he had placed it. The pistol hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>They\u2019d been vigilant about the house, so he hadn\u2019t expected it to. But it was true that they were working for Senator Holloway. A man with a reputation like diamond. And threats that cut like one.</p><p>Thoughts raced through his mind as he lay down; he willed them to stop so that he could sleep.</p><p>The room didn\u2019t seem to offer any late-night sensations. Disappointment pricked at Angela.</p><p>Sleep claimed her quickly and she found herself in the midst of a dream.</p><p>The children were there again. They were at the foot of her bed, as they had been. Percy and Annabelle. Percy trying to make his younger sister stop crying. And then, he came into the room.</p><p>Madden C. Newton.</p><p>He had mutton chops on his cheeks with the customary clean-shaven chin. He was a man of approximately forty years, about five feet five inches in height, traces of gray showing in the slightly curly hair he wore to his shoulders. He was neither compelling nor unattractive; his eyes were almost colorless.</p><p>\u201cChildren!\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>They were still hugging one another.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d Percy said, stepping back just slightly as Madden C. Newton entered the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat a polite child!\u201d Newton said, feigning delight. \u201cWhat a lovely child. Polite and caring. Which leads to the question. If your sister was in danger, how willing would you be to protect her, boy?\u201d</p><p>Confused, and dreading what he began to sense was to come, twelve-year-old Percy still managed to say, \u201cI would die for her, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you shall!\u201d Newton told him.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d Percy said again.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Madden C. Newton pulled the ax he carried from behind his back and showed it to the children. The blade glittered in the light of the kerosene light that glowed within the room.</p><p>Young Annabelle was the first to realize that the man could seriously mean to use such a weapon against them.</p><p>\u201cNo, oh, no!\u201d she cried. \u201cMommy, Daddy!\u201d she cried hysterically.</p><p>And Newton laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re a bit tied up right now!\u201d he said, laughing again at his own joke.</p><p>\u201cAnnabelle, run!\u201d Percy advised. He shoved his little sister toward the door, but Newton was blocking the way. As she tried to escape, he swung, and with a vengeance. The little girl was caught directly in the throat with the blade.</p><p>Percy began to scream.</p><p>Madden C. Newton stepped forward.</p><p>Percy tried to run. He did run. He ran from place to place within the room, trying to get to his sister, trying to evade his attacker.</p><p>But in the end, there was nowhere to go.</p><p>Madden C. Newton raised his ax. And he struck hard.</p><p>In a sea of blood spatter, Percy fell dead. His eyes still open. Staring.</p><p>And panting, Madden C. Newton said, \u201cDelicious!\u201d</p><p>And began to lick the blood as it dripped upon the floor.</p><p>Angela awoke. The room was cast in the soft and shadowed glow of the moon. She had never closed the drapes. For a moment, she thought that she saw Madden C. Newton there, clutching the child he had murdered.</p><p>And despite herself, despite her training, despite the Smith &amp; Wesson .22 within reach in the bedside table, she began to scream.</p><p>A terrible, high-pitched scream that tore relentlessly through the night.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Jackson Crow had bolted out of bed before.</p><p>And still, he was pretty certain he had never bolted out of bed quite so fast.</p><p>He was at Angela\u2019s door in a split second. When he arrived, there was nothing there to cause such alarm.</p><p>Well, nothing other than Angela, jackknifed up to a sitting position. She was just staring\u2014as if a thousand aliens were attacking.</p><p>\u201cAngela?\u201d he said, his voice low, gentle.</p><p>At first, he received no response.</p><p>He walked into the room and sat on the side of the bed, but she didn\u2019t seem to see him. He set his arms on her shoulders; her body was like ice.</p><p>\u201cAngela,\u201d he said very quietly.</p><p>She blinked, and turned to stare at him.</p><p>Her eyes touched his, and she recognized his presence there, gasping softly, and flushing so completely, he could see the change in her color despite the dim light.</p><p>Little blonde princess, he thought. What could have made her scream as she had screamed?</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something that woke you?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIf you call screaming like a banshee something that might wake me, yes,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She was trembling. He was almost overcome by the desire to draw her against him, hold her, and tell her that everything was all right. He had to maintain the appropriate distance, and remember that he was the head of a team. But it was difficult. She seemed to warm beneath his touch, and her skin was like silk; her eyes were on his with tremendous trust, huge and blue, and golden-blond tendrils of her hair swept over his fingers like moonlit temptation. If he wanted to, he could draw her to him, and feel far more of the woman beneath the thin cotton knit of her nightshirt. She was dressed so appropriately for sleeping in a house with others, and yet, he wasn\u2019t sure that any outfit could have made her more sexually alluring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry,\u201d he told her. She was leaning toward him. He was in a pair of long flannel pajama pants himself, and shirtless, and if she came against his chest, he wasn\u2019t sure he could control the sheer physical reaction that was sure to arise\u2014no pun intended, he mocked himself.</p><p>\u201cHow stupid!\u201d she said, angry with herself then. \u201cI\u2019ve had nightmares before\u2014we all have them. I\u2019ve never screamed like that\u2014I\u2019m not a screamer, really.\u201d</p><p>She was drawing on anger, trying to shake off the trembling that still had a hold on her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cA nightmare, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t all.</p><p>But before he could question her, he heard footfalls as the others came running down the hallway, then Jake burst in first, followed by Will, Jenna and then Whitney.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Jake demanded.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Lord! I am so sorry,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Jackson knew he had to be grateful for the arrival of the others. He leaned back; the moment of longing to just drag her into his arms\u2014comfort her\u2014and then turn it all into something else entirely wasn\u2019t quite tamped, but he was under control.</p><p>\u201cAngela had a nightmare,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cA nightmare?\u201d Will asked, puzzled and curious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this before, really,\u201d Angela apologized.</p><p>\u201cOh, Angela! Please, you don\u2019t need to apologize!\u201d Whitney said, coming to sit by her on the other side of the bed. \u201cI was in a bed-and-breakfast once in England, and I dreamed that the neon lights flashing out on the street were alien ships making a landing. I screamed my fool head off\u2014and nearly got my boyfriend arrested for assault. It was a small place, and everyone heard me...at breakfast the next day, you should have seen the way everyone looked at us!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo everything is all right?\u201d Jake asked, clearly concerned about Angela.</p><p>\u201cFine. Honestly. I\u2019m just humiliated that I\u2019ve woken everyone up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t actually sleeping,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Jenna said, but she smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I worked E.R.s at all odd hours\u2014I can get back to sleep. I hope you can, too. Want me to come in here and stay with you?\u201d she asked Angela.</p><p>Angela shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Humiliated. Mortified. Besides that, I swear, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good night then. I\u2019m heading back to bed,\u201d Will said, yawning. \u201cAnd feel free to scream anytime, seriously, anytime you need us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Preferably not tonight, but absolutely,\u201d Jake teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want me to stay?\u201d Jenna asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. Everyone, please, get what sleep you can before tomorrow. Go, shoo, go back to bed\u2014and thank you!\u201d Angela said.</p><p>The four left, heading back down the hall. Jackson heard Jenna and Will saying good-night to Whitney and Jake as they continued to the front; he didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d whispered anything else to one another.</p><p>Angela looked at Jackson again. They were still nearly touching. Nearly. Not quite.</p><p>\u201cSo what really went on in your dream?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She looked away from him, evading his eyes. \u201cYou know how dreams are, they\u2019re fresh the minute you wake, then they fade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a nightmare that makes someone scream like that. I don\u2019t think you should be in this room,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cThere\u2019s something here that I\u2019m going to be able to feel, to sense... It\u2019s important that I\u2019m in here.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cRemember what I said earlier? Didn\u2019t you ever read the Shirley Jackson book or see the movie? Eleanor goes quite crazy and kills herself to get to stay in the house,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cStop using that reference!\u201d she told him angrily. \u201cI\u2019m a together person. I hunted down the bad guys, remember? I\u2019m not going to go crazy. Of course, sometimes I get the impression that you do think I\u2019m crazy already,\u201d she said, grimacing.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy. All right, a little crazy. But I guess we all are. And the thing about that movie\u2014the idea was to find out if anything paranormal existed. So, if ghosts are playing some kind of dangerous game with you\u2014even if those ghosts are in your mind, or your dreams\u2014this could be dangerous for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I need to be in this room. And, yes, it was really terrible, and I screamed, but I can take care of myself, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that you have to vacate this room\u2014except for tonight. We really have to get started tomorrow, and you need sound sleep, real sleep\u2014without dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like picking up and moving right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go over to my room. I\u2019ll finish out the night here,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, I don\u2019t want to put you out like that!\u201d she told him. She jumped up suddenly. There was enough moonlight to filter through cotton. He could see her far too clearly, and the mystery of what he couldn\u2019t see was beyond compelling.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be putting me out,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She had begun to tug at the large, antique dresser that stood against the wall.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now I am starting to think you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She turned to him, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s a door behind it\u2014see the outline in the wallpaper? The door has to connect to your room. We\u2019ll just open the door\u2014and then we\u2019ll be no more than a few feet away from each other.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, studying the paper behind the dresser. She was right. It was cleverly aligned, and it looked as if it was just the place where two wallpaper sheets met, but it was a door.</p><p>He quickly went to her side, curious that the dresser had been put there. He pushed with Angela, and the dresser slid across the hardwood floor.</p><p>There was a doorknob; it had been hidden by the dresser.</p><p>He turned the knob and opened the door; it opened an inch before crashing into the dresser that leaned against the wall in his room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We\u2019ll move the dresser in your room,\u201d she said.</p><p>She was already out in the hall, heading into his room. She flicked on the overhead light and the sudden illumination was brilliant. She was already shoving at the dresser in his room. She might be a crack shot, but she needed his help. He supplied it. She threw open the door, and he realized he could actually see her right from his bed.</p><p>For joy.</p><p>Nothing like seeing the vision that was already starting to slip into his mind and libido like the sweet scent of honeysuckle on the air.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Angela said, delighted.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>She ran over to him, clutched his wrists and rose on her toes to plant a quick kiss on his cheek. She slid against the naked flesh of his chest as she went down on flat feet, and for a moment, she paused, her gaze connecting with his.</p><p>And he knew that she felt it. Whatever it was exactly. The strange force that was simply nature, that drew one person to another. Older than the hills.</p><p>She stepped back, awkward, and, in his mind, more charming. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, this way, I stay in the room, I\u2019m all safe and sound, anything I hear, you\u2019ll hear, anything that happens, you\u2019ll know. You can even see me breathe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back again. Almost as if she didn\u2019t trust herself.</p><p>\u201cGood night and thank you. Thank you. Really.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at last, amused at them both, even if he had just cast himself into an hour of torture. She had endured nightmares. The sweetness of his dreams and the events taking place in his imagination would be no less agonizing.</p><p>But he managed to remain where he was. Despite everything that begged him to forget that they were colleagues, a team. He\u2019d spent his life being completely professional. He\u2019d often made work his life.</p><p>A woman had died\u2014it might be the same as if they were on a case in which a madman was terrorizing a community or crisscrossing the country in the midst of a killing spree.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t on vacation, and he wasn\u2019t on leave anymore. They were here for a reason.</p><p>The only reason at this moment seemed to be the one that begged him to step forward and grab her and drag her back with him to his bed, and to forget the world as they went at it like a pair of rabbits.</p><p>But she turned then, racing back to her bed and plowing into it, pulling the sheets around her. \u201cSleep well!\u201d she called. \u201cThank you. Thank you, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink nothing of it,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>He walked over to turn off the light, and then went back to crawl into his own bed. If he closed his eyes, maybe...</p><p>No. If he closed his eyes, he\u2019d start the dreaming while he was awake, and that wasn\u2019t going to be a good thing at all.</p><p>And so, he watched her.</p><p>He just watched her breathe.</p><p>\u201cGran-Mama!\u201d Whitney said enthusiastically, greeting the woman who was not behind the counter in the store, but who had been helping a group of tourists as they perused the shop.</p><p>\u201cWhitney, child!\u201d the woman said happily, stepping forward to greet Whitney. Angela loved Mama Matisse\u2019s look. There was something special about her appearance. Her hair was graying, but there were still strands with dark glossy pigment. She had one of the most arresting and fascinating faces Angela had ever seen, with high structured cheekbones, emphasized by her lean physique, a straight nose, generous lips and brilliant dark eyes. Her hair was in a neat queue, and she wore a flowing cotton dress in a multitude of colors.</p><p>\u201cYou met my friend Angela Hawkins yesterday,\u201d Whitney reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I remember. I\u2019m not daft, child!\u201d Mama Matisse said, taking Angela\u2019s hand. \u201cI like what Whitney has said. She just called you her friend, and not her coworker. Whitney has no friends who are not good people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI really wanted to see your shop.\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse did not let her hand go. She held it, studying Angela\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou are a special friend. I feel your energy,\u201d she told Angela.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Angela said.</p> <p>She quickly understood the power of the woman and of the place. The shop was beautiful and fascinating. The place was filled with exquisite artwork, books and posters, and more. It was all laid out in a fashion to draw the eye. There was a table filled with gris-gris and gris-gris bags, another held potions and oils, another had wellness spa packages. There were the usual voodoo dolls, but she noted that many of these were different; they offered pins, but the dolls were marked in different areas on their bodies. The area of the heart said, For Matters Involving Love.\u201d The area of the head and neck were labeled, \u201cFor Help with Troubling Questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what can I do for you, little one?\u201d she asked, still looking at Angela, but obviously addressing Whitney. \u201cI already answered questions for your group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand more,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnd, frankly, you have greater insight than anyone else we\u2019ve met. I was hoping you could tell us a bit more about your own opinions, and about the people who are involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I told you, I was glad to perform a banishing spell\u2014a dangerous thing, if it was not done correctly,\u201d Mama Matisse said. \u201cBut that was my only time at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina had many red candles, and I think she might have been performing other spells at sometime.\u201d</p> <p>Mama Matisse shook her head. \u201cI knew nothing about red candles. But I\u2019m not surprised if Regina did play at magic. She wasn\u2019t a happy woman. But then, I am one of those who isn\u2019t madly in love with Senator Holloway, so perhaps she wouldn\u2019t have told me about all her unhappiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama Matisse,\u201d Angela said, \u201cyou\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve met who doesn\u2019t like the senator\u2014other than a few fanatical groups.\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse shrugged. \u201cWhen there is a storm, I want to see a man in the ghetto\u2014in the midst of the crack houses and the poor, picking up. I mean, really, digging in, picking up\u2014not posing. Yes, in ghettos, you will find the crack houses. You will also find the poor, who have no chance. I believe in a man who picks up the pieces, who works with his hands, and doesn\u2019t pay others to do so. And when there is an oil spill, I want to see that man walk among the fishermen. I want to see him with volunteers, cleaning the birds with his own two hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he was terribly busy, trying to deal with those who must find the massive machinery needed to stop a spill,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Mama Matisse shrugged again; she wasn\u2019t going to argue. \u201cYou have come to me for my feelings\u2014I am giving you my feelings, that is all. But I haven\u2019t cared for those, either, who only clean the shoreline and the birds when the television cameras are rolling. I give you my opinions on this, nothing more.\u201d She smiled. \u201cCome. We can talk in my office. Sandra is here, and she can manage the customers. Sandra?\u201d</p><p>She raised her voice slightly, and a young woman disengaged herself from the couple she had been helping. She smiled at Mama Matisse and waved at Whitney.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be in the back,\u201d Mama Matisse told her young clerk.</p><p>The girl nodded, and walked around to the counter and the cash register. Not even a voodoo shop was immune to thieves, but, then again, thieves plagued many churches, and every different kind of house of worship that existed.</p><p>They passed through the main body of the shop to an area that was apparently a little place of worship for the true believers. There were floor mats in the room, and against the one wall, a voodoo altar. There were several statues there\u2014many of them of saints\u2014along with a skull mask, African tribal pieces and an arrangement of coins and small wrapped candies.</p><p>\u201cLoa,\u201d Whitney whispered to her, referring to the little statues and those in other forms she didn\u2019t recognize as well.</p><p>\u201cYou wish to understand our religion and our ritual,\u201d Mama Matisse said when they reached her office. It had all the right equipment for an office, handsome filing cabinets, computer, printer, a state-of-the-art calculator and a beautiful, hand-crafted desk along with cushioned chairs to sit before it. It was also a personal place. Mama Matisse had a wealth of pictures of children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren on the bookshelves near the desk, along with an assortment of her own reading material. She had a number of books on spiritualism, a Bible, and then a host of mysteries and thrillers. Clearly, Mama Matisse liked to be entertained.</p><p>\u201cI would love to know more,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll give you a quick course,\u201d Mama Matisse said, her voice all business. \u201cAre we different from our roots in Africa? Yes, definitely. The religion came from Africa, mainly to Haiti, and there it began to combine with the white man\u2019s religion. But, in voodoo, we don\u2019t see a devil the way that the Catholic religion sees a devil. We have a spirit, Kalfu, who controls the malevolent spirits of the night. It\u2019s not a black-and-white world where there is evil and good. Voodoo is a path that teaches us what we need to know, and when one worships correctly, it\u2019s a beautiful path that leads us to be better in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Angela told her. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve learned about the world, most religions teach us to be decent to our fellow man. But people have and do practice black magic.\u201d</p> <p>Mama Matisse waved a hand in the air. \u201cLike all religions, voodoo can be and has been used by men and women of tremendous evil purpose. Papa Doc, the Haitian dictator who ruled with an iron hand, and his Tonton Macoutes or \u2018bogeymen,\u2019 was a cruel voodooist twisting the religion to keep his absolute control of the country. Under Papa Doc, every man with him became a zombie. The toxin of the puffer fish is used when those who practice black magic wish to \u2018kill\u2019 a man and bring him back to life. This is not voodoo. Voodoo is filled with the great God and spirits like saints who come to us and help us through all problems in life and society, and those who practice the voodoo we teach and are looking for what is positive in life and nature. But, remember, like a cult arisen from a Christian religion, people twist what they believe for their own ends, and they will try to use black magic. You have the Bokor, and they are those who take voodoo, tempt evil and twist others. Remember, too, voodoo in Hollywood has brought about ragged creatures that burst forth and rise from the dead, rotten and decaying, and voodoo in Hollywood gave rise to the little dolls that we prick with pins to cause affliction. Yes, I sell voodoo dolls, but you\u2019ll note that mine are to find answers and peace, not to rip at a man\u2019s leg and cause him to break it or lose it in an industrial accident or the like. If someone uses black magic with a ten-or twenty-or even hundred-dollar voodoo doll and it does something to someone, it\u2019s because that person has managed to slip into the mind of the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve thought about that. A prophecy can be self-fulfilling?\u201d Angela asked her.</p><p>Mama Matisse nodded gravely.</p><p>\u201cSo Regina Holloway had a banishing spell done at the house, by you, and yet she was buying voodoo paraphernalia elsewhere as well, that\u2019s odd, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse hesitated, and then said slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Regina Holloway didn\u2019t come to me for any kind of potions, spells or purifications.\u201d She was quiet again, but Angela didn\u2019t speak, certain that there was more she had to say. And finally, Mama Matisse added, \u201cShe did come to me at the shop once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came to you?\u201d Angela asked softly.</p><p>Mama Matisse seemed to be looking into the distance, and envisioning the time she spoke about. \u201cShe was bereft, the poor woman. She loved her son so much. Everyone knew that a piece of her died with that boy. So...so she came here one day. She was heartsick. She had been everywhere. She had been to her priest, but she was willing to try anything. She wanted me to intercede for her, to speak to a saint or a loa, and beg to know that her boy rested with the angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you spoke to her, and said something that disturbed her?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Mama Matisse nodded without looking at her. She was seeing the past. \u201cRegina sat before me, here in the office, and I told her that certainly, everyone knew, whatever they believed, that the goodly on earth rested in the Heaven of their choice. She was upset, and she said that if she just knew, she could be a wife again. She believed herself to be a very bad wife. I said that she was just a hurt wife, and she said that she was pushing her husband away, and she wasn\u2019t giving him comfort\u2014he, too, had lost a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was suffering so badly,\u201d Angela murmured.</p><p>Mama Matisse seemed to be hesitating again. Angela fell silent, letting Whitney speak.</p><p>\u201cGran-Mama, please, if there is anything you can say that will help us, you must tell us what you know,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI know nothing,\u201d Mama Matisse said. Once again, Angela held her breath, waiting.</p><p>This time, Whitney wasn\u2019t subtle or delicate. She sat back, laughing. \u201cGran-Mama, spit it out, please, will you? We won\u2019t repeat anything you say, if you don\u2019t want us to\u2014not even to our colleagues. God knows, we\u2019re careful enough about what we do. Please, tell us what you think, or what you believe, or what your intuition told you.\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse said, \u201cWell, perhaps I am biased. I just didn\u2019t feel that the marriage was as wonderful as everyone said. You see, Senator Holloway came here to get her\u2014with his trio of bulldogs. The chauffeur, that fellow named Grable, he was pleasant, looking at all our books and talking with Sandra. The bodyguard, he just stood with his arms over his chest. The third fellow, Martin DuPre, he was anxious. The senator was on a phone call, and Martin kept watching him, and me\u2014this is when Regina Holloway and I came out of the office and back to the front. I think that DuPre thought that the senator was talking to someone he shouldn\u2019t have been talking to while waiting for his wife. And I think that DuPre is more suspicious or superstitious than he\u2019d like to be. He seemed to be afraid that I had told Regina Holloway something that she shouldn\u2019t have known.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angela frowned. \u201cYou think that Senator Holloway was having an affair?\u201d she asked incredulously.</p><p>Mama Matisse shrugged then. \u201cHis wife is a lost soul, and he\u2019s a man in power. Perhaps not an affair. Perhaps he just saw another woman. Perhaps I am wrong. But I liked the senator less that day. He hung up, and came to his wife, and he was caring, but I think that he just wanted her out of the place. He wouldn\u2019t want people saying that his wife was trying to commune with the dead through a voodoo priestess. He came to her and held her, and he was dismissive. He barely glanced at me. He said, \u2018Pay the woman, Regina, and let\u2019s go, please.\u2019 You could see that he was contemptuous of the shop, and of voodoo.\u201d</p><p>Angela tried to reconcile everything she had heard about the senator with this new information. It was possible that a good man could do bad things. His wife had been beyond consolation, and he had been trying to hold to himself, to his career and a semblance of life.</p> <p>He was human. No man was perfect; no politician could keep every promise, be it to his family or to his constituency.</p><p>She started to rise.</p><p>Mama Matisse stopped her. \u201cMay I have your hand, child?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Angela settled in the chair again and reached across the table. She held Angela\u2019s hand for a long moment, hers so lean and brown, showing the signs of her age, Angela\u2019s like snow against it. Mama Matisse closed her eyes for a moment, and then opened them. \u201cYou are strong,\u201d she said, \u201cand you are smart, but you\u2019ve suffered tragic losses in your life, and they have left you open to many things. Good things, and bad things, if you don\u2019t learn to buffer your heart. You have great power within you because you have a great heart, and you see the suffering of others. Spirits guide us...they may be mischievous, and they have messages. You may listen to the messages, but you must never cross the line.</p><p>\u201cThe world is filled with ghosts, ghosts of times that have gone by, and the images in time and space of those events that were cataclysmic, tragic and even joyous. And spirits remain in the in-between world because they cannot or will not leave, because of what they know, or what they, in their wisdom, hope to prevent.\u201d She paused for a moment, looking at Angela. And Angela felt that the woman was reading everything in her soul. Mama Matisse knew. She knew that Angela saw things, or dreamed them, but even in dreams, saw them clearly as when they had happened. For a moment, Angela felt a chill. And then, it seemed that warmth and power came into her hand, the hand that Mama Matisse held, and began to travel all the way through her. \u201cYou must be strong, and you must also trust in others,\u201d Mama Matisse told her, \u201cbecause no man\u2014or woman\u2014can take on the burdens and the tragedies of the past without the strength and vitality of life around them.\u201d</p> <p>Mama Matisse released Angela\u2019s hand. She had finished; she had said all that she had to say. She arose, arrow straight and thin and with incredible dignity. \u201cNow, if you ever need me, you come back. With or without Whitney, and bring any of your friends. Don\u2019t worry if you believe in voodoo or do not believe in voodoo. It is a religion, as many others. We all see our paths in different ways. A spirit may go by many names.\u201d</p><p>Angela and Whitney stood with her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mama Matisse,\u201d Angela said gravely. \u201cI will come back.\u201d</p><p>Mama Matisse flashed her a quick smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad, and I believe you will. Now, Whitney, child, give your Gran-Mama a hug, and be on your way.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they were out of the shop and on the street. \u201cWell?\u201d Whitney asked Angela. \u201cDo you think that maybe he was having an affair\u2014and that maybe Regina found out about it, and that was the last straw, and so she killed herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhitney, we looked at the balcony, and we studied pictures of Regina\u2019s body in situ, and it would have been impossible for her to propel herself so far\u2014backwards! No. She didn\u2019t commit suicide. It was murder,\u201d Angela said.</p> <p>\u201cBut Jackson isn\u2019t pulling the police in to point that out yet,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Angela shrugged.</p><p>Whitney studied her for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen something in that room,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSadly, I\u2019m not seeing anything that will help us\u2014not yet,\u201d Angela told her.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve seen something,\u201d Whitney said, her tone matter-of-fact. \u201cLet\u2019s go and get in somewhere off the street. My friend owns a place just down a few blocks. Nice quiet courtyard at this time of day, and best pecan coffee you\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p><p>Whitney did know the little nooks of the city, certainly better than Angela did. In a matter of minutes, they were sipping really delicious coffee and dining on her friend\u2019s shrimp po\u2019boys, definitely some of the best Angela had ever tasted.</p><p>\u201cGran-Mama was really impressed with you,\u201d Whitney told her. \u201cAnd the way she held your hand...Gran-Mama can read people. She knows that you have what is called \u2018the sight.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not really,\u201d Angela began to protest.</p> <p>But Whitney laughed. \u201cWhy would you deny something like that? Mine is so limited. That\u2019s why I became so fascinated with all the things you can find with film and sound equipment. Oh, I have a sense of things. To most people, I\u2019d be impressive. But I have a feeling that your sixth sense is way superior to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d never say that,\u201d Angela told her, shrugging and smiling. \u201cWe\u2019re brought up to deny the unusual, and we get to be very good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think it\u2019s obvious? Adam brought us together so that we would support one another. Adam sees ghosts, you know. Well, he sees one ghost. His son, Josh. He couldn\u2019t see his son for years, and then, finally, he did. And it\u2019s the greatest comfort in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sees him?\u201d</p><p>Whitney grinned. \u201cYes, which of course, is strange to people who don\u2019t know what he does\u2014Adam didn\u2019t have a real gift. Josh did. Josh was killed in an accident, but he handed on something very special to the friend who was with him. She was the first person Adam worked with, I\u2019m pretty sure. And that was several years ago now. Anyway, at first, Adam began really discreet investigations. He kept a very low profile. But people in power began to know about him, and he knew about people here and there and he called on them when he needed them. I guess he decided to try putting together an actual team, a unit to stick together, and go about on some of these unusual investigations.\u201d</p><p>Whitney spoke in a straightforward manner\u2014as if Adam Harrison had been a contractor who had been doing piecemeal jobs, and then had decided to open his own company. Even working with police who knew a great deal about her, she was still certain that they looked at her as an anomaly fairly frequently. Even when she went through the academy, she was teased, some of the recruits tried to pick on her, but some friends also let the too-obnoxious know that she had suffered a loss, and she was tough and they might not win a fight with her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so sure about that; she was tough. She worked hard, and she maintained her strength with cardio equipment. But she didn\u2019t know how many of the really huge guys she\u2019d ever take down through sheer brute strength.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is an unusual situation,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Whitney was relentless. \u201cSo, what are you seeing in the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like a vision in a crystal.\u201d</p><p>Whitney waved a hand in the air. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting one. What are you seeing?\u201d</p><p>Angela sighed. \u201cChildren\u2014a little girl, Annabelle, and her older brother, Percy. They were among the first victims of Madden C. Newton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour face turned green,\u201d Whitney told her.</p><p>\u201cGreen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, an ashen green. So\u2014I imagine you\u2019re seeing them dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse\u2014I see them getting dead,\u201d Angela told her.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Whitney said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children aren\u2019t evil spirits, and they should be resting in some form of gentle afterlife. Of course, you\u2019re seeing a \u2018residual\u2019 haunting\u2014something that must happen over and over again. If the children are active\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children are active,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPercy has stood over my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s interesting. I wonder if Regina Holloway saw the children,\u201d Whitney mused. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she was gifted. Or not. Maybe she was susceptible,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cTo the suggestions of others?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who would suggest she hurl herself off a balcony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone human,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cOr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe strongest ghost who ever existed.\u201d</p><p>Angela laughed suddenly. \u201cOkay, so, we both agree that your great-grandmother is an exceptional woman, and she said that a banishing spell done correctly would allow for ghosts to move on. Which is it? Ghosts exist, but they don\u2019t believe in banishing spells, or they don\u2019t really exist, but someone suggested to Regina that there was a ghost in her bedroom, and so she saw the ghost of a little boy, and he was so strong he hurled her over the balcony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to find out,\u201d Whitney leaned across the table. \u201cSo, how did you really find the skeleton in the basement?\u201d</p><p>Angela looked back at her new friend and sighed at last. \u201cI thought about the killer, and I thought about the victim, and I imagined a scene between the two of them. My skeleton would have been Newton\u2019s first victim\u2014in New Orleans, at least\u2014and he would have been testing his skills along with the logistics of committing murder. Easy. Have the man in the kitchen, get him ahead of him on the stairs and bash his head in with a prestashed spade or the like. Get him down\u2014and finish the job. The sound couldn\u2019t possibly have carried, and since the basement is part of the foundation, he had plenty of dirt down there, and he could also hide the stench down there. Fill the place with some kind of herbs while the soft tissue rotted and then the skin mummified around the bones until it became earth to earth as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe basement may give us more than any other room,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cHey, by the way, did you pick up anything unusual on your cameras, or on tape?\u201d Angela asked her.</p><p>Whitney smiled, just like the Cheshire cat. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cWill and I will show the film tonight. And roll our recordings. Oh, yes, we\u2019ve begun.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>The Church of Christ Arisen was an impressive building, mid-1800s, handsomely whitewashed and gleaming in the sun. It was on St. Charles, set back about forty feet from the road, and commanding half a block.</p><p>Jackson was driving Jake\u2019s car, and he pulled to the side of the road to stare at the building. Jake, at his side, was reading from the most recent file Jackson had acquired from Detective Andy Devereaux. \u201cThe main body of the church dates back to 1840 and was originally constructed by the Baptists,\u201d Jake said. He looked up from the paper and pointed. \u201cMain building there, and the add-ons, either side, were built in the 1900s. The Baptist congregation moved into a new location, and in the 1970s, the place was a trendy nightclub. The nightclub was purchased by the Church of Christ Arisen in the mid-1990s. They\u2019ve owned it since. The church has a bishop, currently Richard Gull, and he deals with all tenets, all legal matters and everything having to do with the church along with a council of five members, but their identities are known only to members of the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>Jake looked at him. \u201cWhy? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m reading from a file!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, sorry. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bishop lives in the building to the left. The building to the right houses members of the church who are downtrodden or need a place to stay,\u201d Jake read. \u201cHey, and Detective Andy scratched in some notes on the side. Says here, \u2018Downtrodden seem to be female. Nothing to prove. No one talks.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jackson had seen his share of cults, and they tended to have one strong central figure. Jim Jones. David Koresh. A host of others. Charismatic men who preyed upon the weak and needy, and promised them something far better than the struggles and misery they faced in their lives. They must have spent half their time laughing in their sleeves, since they brought women into the flock to have their choice of wives or lovers, and get away with multiple relationships in the name of God.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so Richard Gull is over here\u2014and his little harem is over there. And the main body of the church separates the two. Interesting.\u201d Jackson opened his door.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey, what are you doing? I thought we were just going to ride by and see the place,\u201d Jake told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see it closer,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, wait. Stay here. I\u2019ll take a closer look. Come on, Jackson. You look like the wrath of God, come to take them all down. I\u2019m just a young man in need of spiritual guidance.\u201d</p><p>Jackson weighed Jake\u2019s words; he was right. He was wearing a tailored shirt under his jacket, even if it was a casual leather jacket. Jake was wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the New Orleans Saints logo.</p><p>\u201cJust get whatever information they give out and get back here,\u201d Jackson told him.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Jake agreed.</p><p>He watched the traffic and then sauntered across the street to the brick path that led the way to the church. It was ironic; an old Jewish cemetery sat on the corner of the street, nearly blocked out by a large sign that advertised:</p><p>The Church of Christ Arisen\u2014we are the way. Respect life, all life, respect your fellow man, and our God will show you the way. Bishop Richard Gull, Sunday sermon. If you would believe, you are welcome here.</p><p>The church door opened before Jake reached it. From his position in the car across the street and slightly down, Jackson saw Jake offer the young woman who opened the door one of his devilishly charming smiles. She looked uncertain for a moment, but she opened the door wider, and Jake walked on in.</p><p>A few minutes later, he left the church and returned. Jackson reached across the car to open the door for him. \u201cI was about to sound the cavalry horn,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jake laughed. \u201cI was gone ten minutes, total.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you discover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some leaflets,\u201d he said, pulling printed material in sleek leaflet form from his jacket pocket, \u201cand, drumroll, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d Jackson said flatly.</p><p>\u201cThere were three young women in there, cleaning. It\u2019s modern inside, lots of hard, stern benches, an altar, a big cross hanging above it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the drumroll?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Jake laughed. \u201cNo, no. There was something interesting about the young girls who were doing the cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll three are pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain about that. One might be fifteen or sixteen. I think I could guess the baby\u2019s daddy on the three. On the side of the altar, almost as big as the cross, is a portrait. In big letters on a brass plaque below, it has the name Richard Gull. He has a good face. Graying hair\u2014and I can see how he might have an allure. He has something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>\u201cCharles Manson eyes,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThe church is a cult massacre waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>Jenna had found a stash of floor pillows in one of the closets, and she had arranged them before the screens in the ballroom. She had also taken the dust sheets off the furniture, and somehow, with the camera equipment, their jackets hung on the pegs on the rack just inside the front door, the cushions and the now-uncovered furniture, the house seemed comfortable.</p><p>Almost like being at home\u2014someone\u2019s home, anyway.</p><p>Coming back in with Whitney, Angela was glad to be greeted by Jenna and Will, who had been industriously moving about the house\u2014and keeping an eye on the cameras and the equipment, and going through the digital film from the night before.</p><p>\u201cThis is super creepy,\u201d Jenna said with enthusiasm. \u201cLemonade, guys? Iced tea? I made popcorn. I\u2019ll just go get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made popcorn?\u201d Angela asked her incredulously.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s kind of like sitting around at a friend\u2019s house to watch a DVD,\u201d Jenna defended herself.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Angela assured her.</p><p>Will asked Angela about her trip to the voodoo shop, and Angela told him that she felt she\u2019d learned a great deal. When Jenna returned with a tray filled with popcorn bowls, glasses and pitchers of iced tea and lemonade, Angela was telling Will that Mama Matisse was not madly in love with the senator.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI think she considers him...not quite as honest and straightforward as he seems.\u201d</p><p>Will laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s just being a politician!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think anymore,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWhen I spoke with Senator Holloway, I believed that he was truly bereft over the loss of his wife. It really seemed that he had loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy great-grandmother thinks that Holloway was guilty of something. Perhaps having an affair\u2014or not an affair, but that he\u2019d at least gone out and had a one-nighter somewhere,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cThat would make him an adulterer, not necessarily a murderer,\u201d Jenna pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Angela agreed. \u201cBut we can all figure that out when Jackson and Jake get back. Right now, we\u2019ve got the popcorn, we\u2019ve got the refreshments, let\u2019s see some movies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, roll \u2019em!\u201d Will said. He pointed to the screens. \u201cJenna and I went through them individually, but it\u2019s kind of cool to watch them all at once, because mostly, nothing is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I turn out the lights?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s daytime. You can\u2019t turn off daytime,\u201d Will told her.</p><p>\u201cI can pull the drapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Just roll it, please,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>The four of them folded themselves in various positions on the cushions, cool glasses of tea and lemonade in their hands, and the popcorn set on the floor before them.</p><p>Will explained that they were watching time elapse at a high speed.</p><p>He hit the control to slow it down at one point. Up in the left-hand screen, she saw Jackson come bursting out of his room and to her doorway. His dark hair was tousled; the light in the hall reflected off his deeply bronzed and well-muscled chest, and his expression bore a look of confusion and concern.</p><p>Will looked at her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Angela felt that her few years of maturity on the others faded; she was blushing, she was certain.</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s none of our business!\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no! Nothing like that,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Whitney asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI had a nightmare, and I woke up screaming,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, when the sound is up, you can hear the scream,\u201d Will said sympathetically.</p><p>Angela glared at him, and then at Whitney and Jenna. \u201cWell, then, you all know that Jackson came rushing to my defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if he\u2019d look quite like that if he came rushing to my defense!\u201d Whitney said lightly.</p><p>\u201cThe big chief looks really good shirtless,\u201d Jenna teased.</p><p>\u201cCharming to watch the pretty people do weird things in the night!\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, please\u2014children!\u201d Angela said firmly.</p><p>\u201cDid you change rooms?\u201d Jenna asked, no longer teasing, but looking at her with concern.</p><p>She shook her head. She hesitated, but after her conversation with Whitney that morning, she was certain that they\u2019d all had some kind of brush with the paranormal.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think that I need to be in that room. But the dream was horrendously grisly, and it did shake me up. We discovered that there\u2019s a door that connects the two rooms, so we opened it. It was the only way not to have Jackson take charge as head of the team and tell me it was too dangerous for me to be sleeping in there,\u201d Angela explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDangerous?

What I\u2014what I see is a pair of children, victims of Madden C. Newton,\u201d Angela said. She frowned suddenly. \u201cAnd\u2014and Newton himself. Newton attacking the children. Annabelle and Percy. The nightmare had Newton in it. It was horrible. The terror those poor children felt was just beyond imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd beyond the grave,\u201d Jenna said, still watching her, troubled.</p> <p>Will was thoughtful. \u201cThose murders happened. We know that they were real. And you have the ability to see them, but...from what I understand, the Holloways claimed they didn\u2019t believe in ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was an article in the paper\u2014way back, when they first bought the place. Senator Holloway said it was a beautiful place and should be brought to life again,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t mean like this,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Will shrugged, drawing his knees to his chest. \u201cActually, Angela, you\u2019re seeing things because you have an extraordinary sixth sense. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s not something that maybe everyone can tap into\u2014we just don\u2019t know yet. I wonder what Regina saw. I mean, was there someone in there? Was she tricked into believing that someone was in there? Other than the fact that her neck was broken and her skull was crushed, Regina wasn\u2019t torn up. I mean, she didn\u2019t struggle with anyone. How did she wind up out on the balcony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have been that someone was there that she trusted,\u201d Jenna suggested.</p> <p>\u201cAnd she might have had that illusion,\u201d Will said. He reached behind Whitney\u2019s ear and produced a dollar bill. \u201cIllusion can be everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was just a silly parlor trick,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cAll illusions carried out by magicians are parlor tricks. That\u2019s the point\u2014illusions can be very real,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cBut an illusion didn\u2019t push Regina Holloway over the balcony,\u201d Angela said. \u201cStill, I do believe that what we have in the mind can be just as powerful as something hard and tangible. Maybe we\u2019re looking for...I don\u2019t know. Illusion, ghosts\u2014and a live person somehow pulling strings somewhere.\u201d The film had continued running as they talked. She gasped suddenly, and pointed at the bottom middle screen to images from the basement.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s what we wanted you to see!\u201d Will said, pleased.</p> <p>They all stared at the screen. Will stopped and started the film, bringing the image back to the beginning of movement.</p><p>There was nothing. It might have been still footage. It was just a picture of the basement at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>Then, subtly, it seemed that a shadow grew. Small, barely discernible, and then growing darker and larger.</p><p>It appeared as if some great, hulking beast in a cape might be there.</p><p>And then, the shadow dissipated. And they were just staring at the basement once again.</p><p>Angela\u2019s call came while they drove from the Church of Christ Arisen to the CBD.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a new spin for you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I went out. Mama Matisse was willing to spend the time talking to us. She is the first person I\u2019ve met who isn\u2019t so fond of the senator. She believed that he was having an affair,\u201d Angela told him.</p><p>\u201cReally? That is a new spin,\u201d he said, glancing over at Jake. \u201cWe have our first suggestion that Senator Holloway was involved with another woman,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat made her think so? And is that why she doesn\u2019t like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She didn\u2019t think that he put enough hands-on work into it all when the city was in trouble. You know how some politicians hand-wash oil-laden birds when the cameras are rolling, and disappear right after? Well, that\u2019s what she thinks of him. I don\u2019t know\u2014it seems to me that his grief for his wife is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why does she expect an affair?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, Regina had been to see her, and the senator had picked her up. And he was dismissive of the shop, of voodoo, of Mama Matisse, and he was on the phone with someone while waiting for her, and got off quickly when he saw her. Not much evidence, I agree. But an interesting angle. We have all believed that the senator was as pure as snow, a man to be pitied. He might just be an extremely fine actor, which does go hand in hand with politics,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks. I\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Jackson assured her. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way to his offices now. I\u2019m hoping to have some conversations with his crew\u2014while they\u2019re split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, by the way. There\u2019s something else you\u2019ve got to see,\u201d Angela told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shadow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really strange. It\u2019s a shadow we caught on film in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it\u2014do anything?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it appears, and it disappears. But it\u2019s really quite amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ghost? Something\u2019s got to be down there to cast a shadow.\u201d Jackson knew that there was skepticism in his voice, and he never quite understood why he would mock anyone. He did believe in the possibilities; he\u2019d also seen way too much done by shysters. It all came back to two basic concepts\u2014energy didn\u2019t die, and the human spirit\u2019s need to believe there was something beyond the rigors and pains of life on earth. He\u2019d seen too many organizations\u2014such as the Church of Christ Arisen\u2014that could take beautiful tenets and twist them into something that was mind controlling, greedy and cruel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Angela answered slowly. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to see it yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. And you all be careful,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. He heard her click off the connection and he slipped his phone back into his front shirt pocket.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the building,\u201d Jake said, and Jackson, driving, nodded, and started looking for a parking space on the street. The building had a garage, but he preferred being on the street. Somewhere, not far, the sedan that was driven by Grable Haines had to be parked, awaiting the senator\u2019s whim.</p><p>He found parking and they both exited the car. \u201cWell, boss?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cFind the chauffeur,\u201d Jackson told him.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d Jake said. Hands in his pockets, whistling softly, he started off.</p><p>In the building, Jackson discovered that the senator\u2019s offices occupied a suite on the fifth floor; he went up the elevator. He thought the building was probably built around 1900; it wasn\u2019t ornate, nor was it ill-kept. It was an everyman\u2019s building if he had ever seen one.</p><p>He entered the suite door, and found himself in a vestibule. At a chair in front of a bank of computer screens on a plain wooden desk was Blake Conroy. He smiled as Jackson entered.</p><p>\u201cHey, there. So you\u2019ve come to see the senator\u2019s New Orleans offices,\u201d he said. He\u2019d been well aware, apparently, that Jackson had been on his way up.</p><p>\u201cYes, I thought I\u2019d have a word with him here, get an idea of his situation when he was in town. I can see that no one could sneak up on him here, not with you on guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Blake said, pleased. His bald head shone. He was dressed in his customary nondescript suit, but his tie was loosened.</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t here the day that Mrs. Holloway died,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Blake flushed. \u201cThe senator wasn\u2019t taking any appointments that day. We all thought that he was perfectly safe. He came in, and locked up. And Lisa Drummond was here, of course, and she could press an alarm button at any time. The senator is no slouch himself\u2014he has a Glock in his office desk, and he knows how to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. But he still needs a bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, out in public. He\u2019d never want to be seen carrying a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose that would be good for his public image,\u201d Jackson agreed.</p><p>Blake shrugged. \u201cIt is Louisiana, but...no, he doesn\u2019t want to be seen carrying a gun. And in public, with those crazies out there, you never really know what might happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your usual position, though, huh?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe senator wants to be a man of the people\u2014but not a stupid man. And Lisa is a real secretary, you know? She\u2019s not a judo expert or anything of the like. So she wouldn\u2019t be much help if someone did try to get in to hurt the senator. Unless they\u2019re just going to lock up and work on paper\u2014bills, committee work\u2014I\u2019m out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often are you off?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot often,\u201d Blake told him. \u201cMaybe a few days in a few months, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you happened to be off that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the senator had cleaned his slate so that he could work on a few speeches and read over some committee bills he and others were working on,\u201d Blake told him.</p><p>\u201cSo, shouldn\u2019t his aide have been with him?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cNaw, the senator needed time alone to think. Sometimes, having an entourage can get old, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his secretary?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to meet her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Blake asked in return.</p><p>\u201cWas she working with him then?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Blake frowned. He might have gotten punched one too many times as a fighter. He was truly puzzled.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019ll have to ask about that. I\u2019m not even sure. I didn\u2019t work at all that day\u2014I didn\u2019t see the senator until they called me. Just ask her\u2014she keeps a regular schedule of everything. I mean, if she can\u2019t remember, she can just look at her schedule. Although, to be honest, I can\u2019t imagine anyone forgetting what they\u2019d been doing that day. It was a horrible day,\u201d Blake said sadly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks. And, hey, it\u2019s really great, you know. The way you all get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all?\u201d Blake asked.</p><p>\u201cYou, Martin DuPre and Grable Haines.\u201d</p> <p>Blake shrugged uncomfortably. He might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we get along all right.\u201d</p><p>Jackson laughed. \u201cThat didn\u2019t sound convincing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all really love the senator. Grable, he\u2019s a cool guy, but he\u2019s had his problems. He likes to gamble, and he\u2019s definitely a ladies\u2019 man. Girls just like him. All he has to do is grin. Maybe I am a little jealous, but, hey, he\u2019s fine. We have to kill time together sometimes, and it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Martin DuPre?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s an aspiring politician himself, you know?\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take my orders from the senator. I don\u2019t like Martin DuPre thinking he can snap his fingers at me. I tell him that. And I\u2019ve told the senator that. Otherwise, well...I guess he\u2019s a little too Goody Two-shoes. He\u2019s with the senator, or he\u2019s at home on some online course about how to speak with proper diction, how to market, how to win the love of a crowd. He\u2019s a bit much for me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent personalities,\u201d Jackson sympathized.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. And you\u2019re going to dig into all our pasts, right? Because Senator Holloway is so torn up about Regina. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, you will, so I\u2019ll just give you the scoop on me. I did three years in juvenile for manslaughter. I killed a guy in a fight. It really wasn\u2019t my fault\u2014other than I let the fight happen. Knocked him flat, and he came at me with a knife, and I didn\u2019t let him kill me. So, you can look into me all you want, and you won\u2019t find anything more. I paid for my sins, that\u2019s for sure. But I\u2019m not worried about you or anybody else, because I found my peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found God. I\u2019m a born-again Christian, sir, and I let anyone know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Blake, it\u2019s a very good thing for a man to find his own peace. So, tell me, though, seeing as how you have found your own inner peace, how do you feel about the Church of Christ Arisen?\u201d</p><p>Blake stared at him, shaking his head. \u201cThose people are listening to demons, that\u2019s all I can tell you. Christ loves every man, and he comes to every man in a different way, and he doesn\u2019t hate those who are confused or haven\u2019t found their way. And Christ does not say that a man should sleep with children, and he sure doesn\u2019t say that a man should do injury to any other. Those people are just wacko, and they hate everyone. My God teaches love\u2014theirs teaches something I don\u2019t begin to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never had any trouble with Regina or David Holloway over religion, I take it?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>Blake grinned. \u201cRegina and me, we loved to argue! She was a good Roman Catholic, and I used to tease her about getting guidance from mediums and tarot card readers. She told me her beliefs, and I told her mine, and we\u2019d have a good time arguing now and then. David Holloway is a moderate himself, and he\u2019d always just shake his head. The senator, he always said that debate was good for a man, as long as a man remembered that we were in the U.S. of A., where every man and woman was entitled to his own beliefs\u2014as long as those beliefs did no harm to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t believe that the Church of Christ Arisen means no harm to others?\u201d Jackson asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t been caught on anything yet, but if you call brainwashing children harm, well, then, I think they cause a lot of harm. You might want to look into them,\u201d Blake said. He cut himself off abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWas there any trouble between them and the senator that we might not know about?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>He looked uncomfortable. \u201cNo. Nothing I know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Aryans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d Blake said gravely. \u201cAnd I mean that in every Christian way possible.\u201d</p><p>Jackson grinned, but he didn\u2019t leave. \u201cThere is something that you\u2019re not telling me,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on\u2014no man can lead a perfect life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the senator tried,\u201d Blake said. \u201cI think he tried. I really can\u2019t say anything else except that I heard him talking to DuPre one day, and it sounded...financial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuPre needed money?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was for DuPre,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cAre you talking blackmail?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking anything,\u201d Blake said firmly. \u201cAnything I have is a vague notion, and could be entirely wrong. You got questions\u2014ask the senator.\u201d</p><p>He indicated the door beyond the vestibule.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sir, go right on in. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll warn Lisa. I think you should meet Miss Drummond all on your own,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>Jackson arched a brow.</p><p>But Blake wasn\u2019t going to tell him anything more; if there was something going on between Senator Holloway and his secretary, Blake was going to flatly give him away. He did apparently love David Holloway. He might throw out a few hints, but...</p><p>\u201cYou said that you wanted to know all of us who were close to the Holloways,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cThat I did. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jackson opened the second door, and walked in.</p><p>There was a woman at a large desk, offering the usual: computer, medium-size screen, a picture frame, intercom and an appointment book by the side. The desk spoke of hard work.</p><p>The woman, Lisa Drummond, he assumed, wasn\u2019t what he had expected. She wasn\u2019t in her twenties, or even in her early thirties. She was attractive, but nearing forty, thin, with a short businesslike haircut to her light blond hair and an attractive, if not beautiful, face. From the pictures he had seen of Regina Holloway\u2014in life, not once her skull had been shattered and her neck broken\u2014she had been far more attractive than the secretary.</p><p>\u201cHello, what can I do for you?\u201d she asked Jackson, smiling, but studying him carefully. Senator Holloway might have a bodyguard, but this woman was looking out for him as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lisa Drummond?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, offering her his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jackson Crow. I\u2019m working on discovering the truth behind Mrs. Holloway\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course! How do you do?\u201d she said. She seemed pleased to meet him, and slightly nervous at the same time.</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks,\u201d he told her. \u201cI was wondering if I could get a minute or two of the senator\u2019s time,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI thought he went out to see you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did, and we were grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just hates that house, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Jackson said. He waited politely. She kept staring at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible for me to see him again now?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, let me just ask,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t use the intercom. She leaped to her feet. She was slim with the right combination of business and femininity in a two-piece suit and white blouse. She wore heels, and her legs were nicely formed. Of course, the idea that the senator might have had an affair was definitely making him take note, even though an affair didn\u2019t have to be with a man\u2019s secretary.</p><p>She disappeared into the office. Jackson heard the two of them talking. Lisa had an edge of fear to her voice. The senator\u2019s replies were low\u2014so low Jackson only knew that he was replying because of her responses. He couldn\u2019t make out Lisa\u2019s words.</p><p>The door to the inner office opened. Lisa looked at him nervously, patting her short hair. \u201cCome on in, Mr. Crow, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jackson walked on in.</p><p>\u201cJackson,\u201d the senator said, standing. He offered his hand. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve come to see my New Orleans offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I just wanted to ask you a few more questions, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve brought you here,\u201d the Senator said. \u201cI pestered the right people to get Adam Harrison to find someone to do something about this situation. I\u2019m here to serve you in any way. Please, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Jackson sat across the desk from the senator. Lisa Drummond hovered nervously by the edge of his desk.</p><p>\u201cCan we get you anything, Jackson? Coffee, iced tea? Something stronger?\u201d the senator asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lisa,\u201d Holloway said. His tone was gentle. His words were dismissive.</p><p>With no other choice, Lisa smiled and walked slowly out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I help you with, Mr. Crow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that Regina went to see a voodoo priestess,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>He saw the man\u2019s expression change, his easy composure vanish and his muscles harden. Holloway waved a hand in the air. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly explain to you how deeply my wife felt the loss of our child. She was inconsolable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the idea of her consulting outside religions?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cReligions? You mean voodoo?\u201d Holloway asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is a religion.\u201d</p><p>Holloway sniffed. \u201cYes, and that heinous Church of Christ Arisen is supposedly a recognized religion, too. You know, you can register online and become a minister of something or other overnight. I believe in our great Constitution, friend, but, sometimes...\u201d He paused. \u201cI should be politically correct. But right now, here\u2019s the truth. I think that so-called voodoo might have finally warped Regina\u2019s mind. That\u2019s what I want to know. Ghosts, voodoo, belief in hokum. Belief that ghosts exist, maybe. She was a sensible, intelligent woman once. And now...well, that\u2019s why you\u2019re here. You tell me, where do we draw the line on our freedoms\u2014and insanity?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn New Orleans, and in most of the United States, the real practitioners of any religion abide by the laws of the nation.

I have one other question for you, for the moment,\u201d Jackson said gravely.</p> <p>\u201cYes, fire away,\u201d Holloway said.</p><p>\u201cWere you being blackmailed by anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmailed?\u201d Holloway repeated, staring at Jackson. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cOkay, then were you cheating on your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous if we all go down there,\u201d Whitney said. They were watching the screen, and watching nothing at all. They were back to real time, and they might as well have been looking at still pictures.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Will asked her. \u201cThere\u2019s safety in numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a shadow. Just a shadow,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cIt actually takes a solid object to cast a shadow,\u201d Will pointed out.</p><p>\u201cRight, so a shadow might have been a ghost,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a solid object that could have created the shadow so...yeah, why not? It could have been a ghost,\u201d Will agreed.</p><p>\u201cI know what she\u2019s saying,\u201d Angela said, interrupting the argument at last.</p> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Will asked, surprised.</p><p>Angela grinned, nodding her head. \u201cA lot of people are shy. If you were shy in life, and\u2014if ghosts do indeed exist\u2014might they not be shy in death, too? If we all bombard the place, nothing will happen. That\u2019s what Whitney is saying. One of us should go down, and someone else could linger in the kitchen, and someone else keep watch on the screens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cAnd we should do it before Jackson comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, he\u2019s on this team, head of this team!\u201d Jenna said. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously sympathetic to what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we know how he feels about people playing games, and pretending that they see things they really don\u2019t,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Angela glanced at her, bemused by the young woman\u2019s perception.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s worried about our safety,\u201d Will said.</p><p>Angela uncurled her legs and rose. \u201cI\u2019m going down. Will\u2014you wait up in the kitchen, and that way, you\u2019re not even a few seconds away. Jenna, Whitney, you two man the screens. Or \u2018woman\u2019 the screens, you know what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Will said, rising. \u201cI know about illusion, but trust me, that shadow on the screen was no trick, right, Whitney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear we didn\u2019t alter the film. We didn\u2019t play with it. It wasn\u2019t a trick,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe our fearless leader is right,\u201d Jenna said nervously. \u201cMaybe safety comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to investigate. We have to investigate,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Jenna said, still sounding unhappy, her voice trailing.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Angela asked her.</p><p>\u201cYou found the body down there. Or the skeletal remains. You might be susceptible,\u201d Jenna reminded her.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason I should go,\u201d Angela said. \u201cCome on, Will, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Will rose and walked with her through the hallway to the kitchen. He paused, waiting by the top of the stairs. She met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m right here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cA ghost isn\u2019t going to hurt me,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>She walked down the stairs to the basement level. The ground she had dug up\u2014with assistance from Jackson at the end\u2014remained disturbed. There were still pegs in the ground with tape wound around them to preserve the area in which they had been digging.</p><p>She decided to sit cross-legged on the floor near the location. She closed her eyes.</p><p>Her ghosts came to her in dreams; she was learning that. Dreams that could come when she let them, whether she was sleeping or awake.</p><p>She had to let go of reality, and remember the past.</p><p>She sat still, just breathing, thinking about some of the yoga mantras she knew.</p><p>This was not, however, she told herself dryly, a state of Zen.</p><p>She opened her eyes, and she nearly froze.</p><p>A single, naked bulb allowed for light in this area of the basement. It cast shadows into the corners and over the relics of life gone past, the everyday things that were part of the humdrum\u2014tools and mops and sweepers, cleaners, more.</p><p>Shadows were creations of light. Light was energy. Life was energy. Death somehow changed energy.</p><p>She saw him at last. A man dressed in a waistcoat, frock coat and stovepipe hat, looking nervously at her from the shadows cast beneath the stairs. He looked at her, as if he was afraid of her reaction to him.</p><p>Tentatively, he stepped out.</p><p>It\u2019s all right, she said silently. It\u2019s all right.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she was trying to assure him, or her self.</p><p>Her eyes were open, she realized. She was staring at him, really seeing him.</p><p>And then...</p><p>She realized that she was surrounded. Men and women in Victorian attire were all around her, looking down at her. And there were more people, she realized. A man who might have been in Edwardian attire. A youth in a T-shirt, a fellow with shaggy hair, who looked as if he might have just walked in from the street...except that he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She was certain a woman touched her cheek.</p><p>These are his victims, she thought. These are the victims of Madden C. Newton. He killed them all, some here, some elsewhere, but he buried them down here, and most had their bodies discovered, but some did not, and perhaps they have lingered, trying to help those who had not escaped the heinous man\u2019s hold in death.</p><p>The light, the one bulb in the room, suddenly burned with a brilliant explosion. The entire room was suddenly aglow; dust motes danced like silver in the bursting-nova gold that seemed to glow.</p><p>\u201cAngela! Angela! Angela!\u201d</p><p>She heard the cry; for a moment, she didn\u2019t realize that it was coming from the great ballroom. Whitney and Jenna were shouting to her.</p><p>\u201cAngela! Get the hell out of there!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Senator David Holloway lowered his head and looked to the left.</p><p>That was usually a sign that someone was going to lie.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and the sound of his voice was a rasp. \u201cI wasn\u2019t having an affair. I loved Regina.\u201d</p><p>Jackson sat still for a minute. He leaned forward then, keeping his voice low and evenly modulated. \u201cSir, a man can love his wife and find a time when he needs the solace of another woman.\u201d</p><p>Holloway looked up at him. Jackson noticed that he had a pencil in his hand and that the pencil was about to snap.</p><p>The senator stared at Jackson and spoke with a harsh voice of authority. \u201cMr. Crow, I did not have an affair. I was there for my wife every second that she needed me. My God! I lost my son, too, that day. But I understood. I understood a mother\u2019s love. I had my constituents. I had a world in which to immerse myself. My wife had always been that, an amazing and brilliant aid to a politician, and a wonderful mother to our son. She was lost but, I\u2019m telling you\u2014I was there for her. And I want you to find out what happened, and I guarantee you, it had nothing to do with me having an affair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Senator Holloway. I\u2019m sorry. I apologize. I needed that from you. You asked for a thorough investigation, after all. Had she started to believe in ghosts? Did someone get into the house and kill her? Or did she kill herself because she could no longer bear the pain of her life?\u201d</p><p>Holloway stood. The pencil snapped. \u201cShe didn\u2019t kill herself because of me! She didn\u2019t kill herself. She might have been...scared to death, and if so, it\u2019s because that damned house is tainted. Something is there. You need to find it.\u201d</p><p>Shakespeare rattled through Jackson\u2019s mind. The lady doth protest too much, methinks\u2014except that it was no lady speaking, it was Senator David Holloway.</p><p>He kept emphasizing the word affair. Jackson was pretty sure that meant that he hadn\u2019t engaged in any sexual activity that had meant anything to him at all.</p><p>He wondered how Lisa Drummond would feel about the denial, if, in fact, she was the woman with whom he had had an affair.</p><p>Jackson stood. \u201cThank you for your time, Senator Holloway. Please understand, I wouldn\u2019t be asking you these questions unless we needed to find the tiniest detail, and when we talk, little things may come out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But if you think that I\u2019d have harmed my wife in any way because of an affair with another woman\u2014it\u2019s ludicrous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But, Senator Holloway, did it ever occur to you that someone else might have wanted to keep your wife from ever letting the world know it\u2014if she had believed that you had engaged in an affair?\u201d Jackson asked him. He didn\u2019t expect an answer. He just reached out and shook Holloway\u2019s hand. \u201cAgain, thank you for your time.\u201d</p><p>He headed out of the office, waving a cheerful goodbye to Lisa Drummond, who stared back at him, pasty white and unresponsive. He paused outside with Blake Conroy.</p><p>\u201cWhere would I find Martin DuPre?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOut, somewhere. He was running errands for the senator,\u201d Blake told him, grinning as he studied Jackson\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAh. So, would Grable Haines take him around town when he\u2019s out doing errands?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Blake told him. \u201cNot always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery helpful. Thank you, Blake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t trying to be evasive,\u201d Blake protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t being sarcastic. Thank you. See you,\u201d Jackson said. He ignored the elevator and headed down the stairway. Faster than waiting, he thought.</p><p>Outside, he noticed a flyer taped to a street lamp. It drew his attention. Fight for Our America! the headline read. It went on, \u201cWe work against affirmative action, and for the people of this country. Join us tonight as we rally. Aryans for America.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped closer to read the address.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m over here, boss!\u201d</p><p>Across the street, he saw Jake lounging against his car.</p><p>He walked over to him. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, driver boy is in a car just around the corner,\u201d Jake told him. \u201cWant me to show you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m assuming you already had a chat, and that you made it sound like you were both just gofers, waiting to do as you were told.\u201d</p><p>Jake grinned. \u201cYou bet. Couldn\u2019t think of a better angle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I did,\u201d Jake told him. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGambling debts,\u201d Jake told him.</p><p>Jackson angled his head to the side, arching a brow. \u201cAnd he just told you all about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got to talking. The day Regina was killed, he was at the casino. He was sure that he was in the right poker game. He wasn\u2019t. He had thought that he could dig himself out. The senator was a good guy, he said, and would have loaned him the money he needed\u2014but he wasn\u2019t going to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina Holloway,\u201d Jake said. \u201cRegina liked him fine. He swears that she really liked him. But she wanted him to grow up, work hard and pay his debts, instead of falling back on the senator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the situation now?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Holloway gave him the money, and he\u2019s supposed to work it off, hanging in extra hours, driving some other people around for the senator, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Senator Holloway paid the debt for him after his wife died?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Grable said that he didn\u2019t even ask again. After Regina died, he just called him into the office, told him he\u2019d pay the debt once and only once, and after that, God help him, because he wouldn\u2019t do so again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s all in knowing how to play it. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSo, the kid had motive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. What did you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see\u2014I think that the senator did sleep with another woman, and I think that the other woman was his secretary, Lisa Drummond. She\u2019s not a femme fatale of any kind, but she was there, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. And she cares about the senator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. A man with a secret, and it seems that it was actually a secret. But the senator is the one who brought us all in. Even if he was sleeping with another woman, he might have loved his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a pack of motives. Turns out that our bodyguard, Blake Conroy, has a juvenile record\u2014killed another kid in a fight. But he\u2019s a born-again Christian, and he admits to lots of religious debates with Regina Holloway. Oh, and let\u2019s see. He doesn\u2019t like Martin DuPre very much, but he thinks that the chauffeur is okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the story with DuPre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t talk to him. He wasn\u2019t there. Seems like he does a lot of running around. Errands, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s got a busy life. That\u2019s one of the things that makes Grable Haines very unhappy. He gets to chauffeur Martin DuPre around town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the chauffeur is here now, and DuPre isn\u2019t,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know where DuPre is now. Grable has got his paper. He\u2019s just sitting in the car. Tonight, he has to take DuPre around town. He said that he was taking some folks to a restaurant on Chartres tonight. One of the big new tourist places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrable didn\u2019t say\u2014I don\u2019t think he knows. He says that when he\u2019s out with DuPre, the man lords it over him. He says that Senator Holloway never acts that way\u2014like they\u2019re all just servants. But Martin DuPre loves to play the big man, and that he wants to be Senator Holloway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it jealousy? Sour grapes?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cCould be. Could be that the guy is an ass, and that\u2019s why everyone dislikes him.\u201d</p><p>Jackson laughed. \u201cGot it. I don\u2019t dislike you because you\u2019re male, female, black, pink, Christian, Jewish\u2014I dislike you because you\u2019re a total jerk. Hmm. Then why does the senator keep the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s good at errands,\u201d Jake suggested.</p><p>\u201cAny errands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever those errands may be,\u201d Jake agreed.</p><p>Jake\u2019s phone rang. When he excused himself, flipped it open and answered, he frowned. He glanced quickly at Jackson, and tried to look away\u2014a sure sign that the conversation had something to do with him. \u201cIt\u2019s all right... We\u2019re on our way. And I won\u2019t say that you called.\u201d</p><p>Jake turned. \u201cThere\u2019s been an incident at the house. Apparently, they got some ghosts in the basement on tape. They manifested for Angela.\u201d</p><p>Angela had felt it; against the brilliance of the light that had come into the room, there had been a ray of darkness. A ray of something that had nothing to do with light, and everything to do with an aura of darkness and evil. The light had been something with an incredible strength; something that seemed more powerful than anything else. But the light had hurt the darkness, and that which had remained shadow and issued a silent scream of rage, trying to grow, to fight against the dazzling brilliance.</p><p>She had felt it just as she had heard the others screaming.</p><p>But nothing had happened. The door at the top of the short flight of stairs had burst open, and Will had come rushing down, screaming loudly. She had run to him, and together, they\u2019d vacated the basement, running back up to the kitchen. There, daylight streamed through the windows and French doors to the courtyard. Whitney and Jenna had come rushing in, and they had all just stared at one another.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jenna demanded.</p><p>Angela, surprised, looked at her. \u201cWhat do you mean, what happened? You all screamed at me to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was light\u2014so much light. Something like moving shadows at first, and then a burst of light so hot the film almost seemed to burn, and then we could see you, and there was like a\u2014a black thing coming right at you!\u201d Whitney told her. \u201cYou were all alone down here\u2014and there was a giant black shadow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe light suddenly burned brilliantly\u2014and then...\u201d Angela paused. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what you\u2019ve got on film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Will said, staring at Angela. \u201cI\u2019ve been here\u2014I haven\u2019t seen anything yet, either. So, first, you tell us\u2014what did you see?\u201d</p><p>She was shaking inwardly; she had felt the malevolence, and she remembered coming home after dinner with Jackson, looking at the house, and thinking that, somehow, evil still managed to dwell within.</p><p>She had felt it again. Just then. Down in the basement. Evil had been the darkness against the light. Something that hadn\u2019t been able to bear the fact that\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, no, what did you two see?\u201d Angela asked Jenna and Whitney. \u201cWhat did you see that made you start screaming to tell me to get out of there?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The two women looked at each other before looking at her again.</p><p>\u201cA...giant shadow, I guess,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cAnd we were all up here. All of us. Except for you, and you weren\u2019t the one suddenly causing the light and shadow. Angela, we saw it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike there was someone there, and someone who cast some kind of massive\u2014 I don\u2019t know\u2014it was like black, rising against all that light,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cComing toward you,\u201d Jenna said gravely.</p><p>Angela looked at Will, frowning.</p><p>Will said, \u201cHey, when they screamed, I went flying down the stairs to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see then?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014all I did was reach for you,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Angela said, looking at Whitney and Jenna again. \u201cComing toward me, and doing what?\u201d</p><p>Once again, the two looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2014bad,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cBad?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid that...it was going to try to envelop you in some kind of darkness,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cAt first, it seemed that everything was so beautiful!\u201d Jenna spoke over her. \u201cAnd then that darkness started rising against the light. I was just terrified for you. I didn\u2019t see burning red eyes or a horned devil or anything...just darkness. Malignant darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you see?\u201d Will persisted.</p><p>Angela hesitated a minute. \u201cAll right, but then we see what\u2019s on the film. I\u2019m going to tell you what I saw and felt, but...you repeat this to anyone\u2014anyone! Including Jackson and Jake\u2014I\u2019ll...well, I\u2019ll just call you all liars,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI can easily say what I saw and felt around you because you\u2014you all know that there are things that we can\u2019t really explain. But with Jackson in particular, I like to say what was\u2014the facts\u2014and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Whitney begged. \u201cWe won\u2019t repeat what you don\u2019t want us to repeat, but please just tell us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw...people. I think I saw the fellow who was killed here. The man who had owned the house, and sold it to Madden C. Newton\u2014Nathaniel Petti. I believe that we dug Nathaniel\u2019s bones out of the ground the day I came. He was standing beneath the stairs, and he seemed\u2014shy. Then...I felt as if there were others, and I saw a host of people. There were women in long, Victorian skirts. Men in waistcoats, vests...bleached-cotton shirts. They appeared to be milling around me, but they weren\u2019t frightening. They seemed kind and oddly grateful and resigned, and even hopeful, if that makes sense. Then the lightbulb flared. And then, at the exact time you started screaming...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Whitney nearly shouted.</p><p>\u201cI felt the same thing you did,\u201d Angela said, and sighed softly. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe it. It was as if someone was absolutely hateful. I was afraid. I admit I was afraid. But then Will rushed down, and...nothing. Now, let\u2019s go and see the film.\u201d</p><p>The other three nodded gravely. They walked back into the ballroom and Whitney picked up one of the controls, running back the film to the point where Angela had come down into the basement.</p> <p>She saw herself walking down the stairs. And then...</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>She was just standing there.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cWait for it,\u201d Whitney told her.</p> <p>There was a subtle darkening in the room. It didn\u2019t become gray at first, but rather silver.</p><p>Then, coming, there was a brilliant flash of light; she could see the lightbulb, and it was evident that the illumination came from the bulb, but if so, it was part of the biggest power surge known to man.</p><p>Once again, the film had caught what seemed like dust motes, crystallized and beautiful, floating within the light. And then...</p><p>Slowly, subtly, but then evident; a shadow seemed to loom up from the ground, twisting into the brilliance of the light, just behind Angela. The shadow seemed to have tentacles or bony fingers that reached out...</p><p>Reaching toward her.</p><p>The front door burst open and a fresh breeze of cold air swept through the room. Then, they all screamed and spun around to see that Jackson and Jake had returned.</p> <p>Will let out a hoarse laugh at himself while the others quickly rose. Jackson, sliding out of his jacket, stared at them all, not as if they had lost their minds, but with a tense expression of concern and displeasure on his strong, bronzed features.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe caught some kind of phenomena on camera. In the basement,\u201d Whitney explained quickly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t call me?\u201d he queried.</p><p>Whitney flushed. \u201cI called Jake. I didn\u2019t want to alarm anyone or make them rush through anything they were doing, but I thought someone should be aware of what was happening here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou should have called me directly,\u201d Jackson told her.</p><p>Whitney looked away uncomfortably. \u201cI thought Jake might have been a bit more discreet. As I said, I didn\u2019t want you all dropping everything to run back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got,\u201d Jackson said brusquely.</p> <p>Will picked up the remote. They all stood, watching the film unfold again.</p><p>Angela looked at Jackson, trying to read his expression.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cInteresting?\u201d Jake exploded.</p><p>Jackson looked at them all, one by one, as even and nonplussed as ever. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that a scientist would come in and say that the light was caused by a power surge and that the shadows might have been caused by any number of things. Something in the room falling or adjusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing fell,\u201d Angela said flatly.</p><p>\u201cShe was alone!\u201d Whitney protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd there was no breeze in the basement,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old house, on an old foundation, and the basement is foundation,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cOld houses shift. Gravity and physics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014so you don\u2019t believe we caught anything?\u201d Whitney said incredulously.</p><p>Jackson smiled at last. \u201cI never said that. I\u2019m telling you what a scientific mind might do with that film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d Will began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that no one goes to the basement alone. I\u2019m saying that there may be some kind of\u2014some kind of something in this house. I think that Angela is our catalyst, and that we need to watch out for her.\u201d He stared at Angela. \u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d</p><p>She looked straight at him. \u201cLight and darkness. Shadows moving. Maybe my mind was playing tricks. They seemed to take the form of people. Something happened, but in truth? I don\u2019t know exactly what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re all right?\u201d he pursued.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Jenna asked him.</p><p>\u201cI think that we may well find strange phenomena in this house,\u201d Angela said, looking at him earnestly. \u201cThere\u2019s history here. History leads to many things\u2014like skeletons in the ground in the basement. As many times as this house has been redone, I wouldn\u2019t doubt that a psychotic killer like Madden C. Newton might have found a few other hiding places for his victims. There could be more skeletons to be found. Do unusual and unexplainable things happen? Yes. Did a ghost kill Regina Holloway? No. In my experience, spirits remain behind to help the living\u2014not murder them. I think someone human had something to do with that. Does it all combine with the house? Perhaps. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re investigating. Any other questions?\u201d</p><p>They were all staring at him. It wasn\u2019t with malice. They were eagerly awaiting his answer to Angela\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cNo questions. We\u2019ve barely brushed the surface here, but we have a great deal more to go on than we did when we got here. First, Senator Holloway, despite his squeaky-clean image and the fact that we believe he did love his wife, was most probably having an affair\u2014one that was well covered up by his staff, if they were aware. A complete cover-up.\u201d</p><p>Angela stared back at him, surprised. It seemed he had almost forgotten what had gone on in the house, and what they had caught on film. His sudden turnabout was a little disconcerting.</p><p>\u201cThe affair was most probably with his secretary,\u201d Jackson continued. \u201cWe know that everyone pretty much hates Martin DuPre, and that Regina Holloway was standing between the chauffeur, Grable Haines, and a loan from the senator to pay his gambling debts\u2014a loan that he has now received. And we know that the bodyguard, Blake Conroy, killed a man when he was young and has a sealed juvenile record. Oh, and it also looks as if the Church of Christ Arisen is one man\u2019s method of acquiring young women as sex slaves. Was that person really Martin DuPre\u2014or was the senator using Martin DuPre to get to young women? One way or another, the people around the senator are involved in the organizations he supposedly hates, and we need to find out how and why\u2014if the senator is aware, or if he isn\u2019t. Personally, I think the Church of Christ Arisen is a slimy cult created for a few men\u2019s benefit, but how it could fit into a murder at this house is something I\u2019m not beginning to see yet, nor do I see the Aryans finding a way to sneak into the house\u2014or for having a motive for murder, but we won\u2019t let them out of it yet, since those are the two main groups against the senator. There we stand. Putting it all together is what we\u2019re here to do. And along that line\u2014\u201d he turned and stared at Angela \u201c\u2014you and I are going to dinner,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the rest of us. We\u2019ll just eat sandwiches,\u201d Jenna said lightly. Jackson ignored her. He was still looking at Angela. He had been so matter-of-fact about the real and factual information he had acquired that day.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t denied them all, but neither had he seemed to take their findings as much that was important. They had something on film. They really had something on film, and she believed that even the most skeptical scientist of all time would have difficulty explaining it all away.</p><p>\u201cSomething did happen, Jackson,\u201d she said.</p><p>He just nodded.</p><p>He knew there was more, she thought. He knew.</p><p>He intended to interrogate her, she was certain.</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cGood, we\u2019ll head out fifteen minutes, say? I want to take a run by the museum on Royal Street, too\u2014and see if they have anything on the house. And you,\u201d he said, and turned at last to Jenna. \u201cI think you might want to go out. You and Jake are just about as white as the newly driven snow. I noticed a billboard while we were out today. The Aryans are having a meeting in a rental hall over on Carondelet Street tonight. I think you two should attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Not me?\u201d Whitney teased.</p><p>\u201cApparently, he\u2019s not sending me, either,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, your assignment will be really exciting,\u201d Jackson teased in return.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Will said, sounding dubious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go and watch the comings and goings at the Church of Christ Arisen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that almost like sending us to the Aryans meeting? Can\u2019t wait,\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>Jackson grinned. \u201cAlmost, but not quite.\u201d He turned away, obviously intending to head upstairs to his bedroom. He started down the hall to take the middle staircase, but came back. \u201cKeep the cameras running. And remember, no one in the basement alone. And, for that matter, no one in the house alone. All right? Everyone with me?\u201d</p><p>They all nodded, and he started back down the hall, whistling.</p><p>When he was gone, Whitney said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what living people might have been involved, there is something in this house.\u201d</p><p>Jenna spoke up suddenly. \u201cI know what you saw, Angela. I\u2019ve seen it before. I\u2019ve seen it in the hospital. I\u2019ve seen the light. Somehow, you released a lot of those people. They\u2019ve moved on. That\u2019s what the light was. They\u2019ve moved on to heaven or whatever one might call the phase we reach after we\u2019ve died in this physical life.\u201d She stopped, looking as if she was hesitant about seeing more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a drink,\u201d Will said. \u201cAnyone with me?\u201d</p><p>They headed to the kitchen, Jake joining them. For a minute, they were all silent, except for Will, who was delving into the refrigerator and sorting out who wanted what. Angela was going to ask for iced tea, but she was uneasy about what had happened, and uneasy about going to dinner with Jackson. She opted for a beer, as did the others. She tried to sip it, and drained half the bottle in a single swallow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake was looking at her sympathetically. \u201cDon\u2019t look like that\u2014kid,\u201d he teased. \u201cHe\u2019s really not out to put you through the nth degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s following Martin DuPre,\u201d Jake explained. \u201cDuPre\u2019s got some fancy dinner tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Well, that\u2019s good,\u201d she said.</p><p>The five of them wound up gathering around the table; it was a nice moment\u2014a strange moment of bonding. \u201cJenna, go on,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>She took a long swallow of her beer. \u201cI had a patient one time, a really nice old man named Jeter Miller. He had cancer, and he was dying, but one day, he went into cardiac arrest. The doctors worked on him, but he died. I had been his nurse. He\u2019d been such a nice old fellow and he might have had six months, maybe a year, to go\u2014I was sorry. Well, I wound up in the hospital morgue with some paperwork the night of the day when he had died, and I happened to be alone in the fridge\u2014that\u2019s what we called the body storage\u2014when he gripped my hand. I can tell you, I was so terrified that my scream came out as a squeak.\u201d She paused, taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t really dead?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. He was dead. And don\u2019t stare at me like that. I don\u2019t share this story often,\u201d Jenna said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Will said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to stare at you in any way that wasn\u2019t full of trust and sympathy, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d Angela prompted her.</p><p>\u201cHe just wanted to talk to me. He said that his business partner had messed with his IV, bringing on the heart attack. The man had killed him to keep Jeter from telling his son\u2014from whom he\u2019d been estranged until recently\u2014about the will that left his half of the business to him. To make a long story short, there wouldn\u2019t have been an autopsy because he was a stage-4 cancer patient and he had died in the hospital. I started making a squawk about the situation, there was an autopsy, and it was proven that the partner had poisoned the IV. I went back down to the morgue, thinking that I\u2019d been crazy the first time, but that I was going to tell the corpse that everything was okay, and he thanked me with tears in his eyes, and told me that he\u2019d just been waiting to thank me, and then...well, I saw light. I saw light the way that we saw it today. So, Angela, maybe by freeing Mr. Petti when you found his skeleton beneath the floor, you let them all go where they needed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Angela said. She reached across the table and squeezed Jenna\u2019s hand.</p><p>Jenna took another very long swallow of beer. \u201cAnd now, you all think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us, honey!\u201d Whitney said, lifting her beer. \u201cTo us,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThe ghost-files team. The Krewe of Hunters. Or, whatever they want to call us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Krewe of Hunters? I like it,\u201d Will grinned, lifting his beer bottle as well. \u201cIndeed, to us. And a sworn promise. None of us will ever think the others are crazy, and we won\u2019t be afraid that the others think we\u2019re crazy. We all know that we\u2019re delightfully different, and that\u2019s that!\u201d</p><p>They clinked bottles.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we think about Jackson?\u201d Jake asked. \u201cWhat do we think he thinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s boss,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cHe is the boss,\u201d Jake punctuated his remark with a chug.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, Adam Harrison is the boss,\u201d Angela corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, he\u2019s in charge of the team,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Will said. \u201cAnd we shouldn\u2019t be lying or hiding things from him. He isn\u2019t saying that it can\u2019t be\u2014he\u2019s just saying, prove it.\u201d</p> <p>Angela stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to get ready for dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cHave fun storming the castle, everyone.\u201d</p><p>She turned and started out of the room. Whitney tossed a cardboard coaster at her. \u201cIf it\u2019s a really fancy place, bring us all doggie bags!\u201d</p><p>Angela turned back to her, laughing. \u201cOkay, maybe I came out ahead tonight. Maybe not... Time will tell,\u201d she said.</p><p>She left them sitting in the kitchen, grateful for the friendships she seemed to be forging with them.</p><p>Up in her room, she paused. The door that separated her room from Jackson\u2019s was not closed tight, but it was closed. He evidently wanted his privacy.</p><p>Prime time, Angela thought.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Dusk descending again, and it was that time that Regina had died, and a time when it seemed that the past liked to replay, almost like a play, but sometimes, the characters changed the lines. She had to be crazy, she decided. She had been terrified in the basement that afternoon\u2014it had just been for split seconds really. Then Will had come down, and the world had begun spinning back to normal again.</p><p>What would have happened if she hadn\u2019t left the basement?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know. She hadn\u2019t been afraid of the manifestation she had seen that had appeared as the strange light in the film. Not at all. But she had felt that there had been something behind her. Something evil. Something ready to pounce on her.</p><p>Ghosts didn\u2019t pounce. They didn\u2019t have much physical power. Ghosts did exist in this house. Maybe Jackson knew it, and maybe he was right that a real, living, flesh-and-blood human with strength had to be involved as well.</p><p>She sat on the bed, half closing her eyes. \u201cAnnabelle? Percy?\u201d she called softly.</p><p>For a moment, there was nothing.</p><p>Then, in her mind\u2019s eye or in real life, the little boy appeared. A moment later, she saw his sister peeping out from behind him.</p><p>They weren\u2019t real. They weren\u2019t solid. She could see the wall behind them.</p><p>But they were there.</p><p>\u201cPlease, miss, he\u2019s a very bad man,\u201d Percy said to her.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Mr. Newton? Madden C. Newton. He was terribly cruel to you,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Percy winced. He lowered his head, and then nodded. Then he looked up at her again. \u201cBut they keep coming. They come to this house, and something happens, because he gets into their minds, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very bad man,\u201d Annabelle said, still clinging to her brother.</p><p>\u201cHe was a bad man,\u201d Angela said. \u201cBut you were very good children. There is a better place for you, where you can find your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Percy said, looking at her gravely. \u201cI have to stay. I tried to help the lady. But she didn\u2019t see me, and she saw what they wanted her to see. She couldn\u2019t hear me, but the bad man made pictures with the light, and she saw what he wanted her to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPercy, I don\u2019t understand. What bad man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows the house. He has come to the house. He came when the nice lady lived here. I wanted to help her. I tried to help her. She couldn\u2019t see me. She saw what he wanted her to see,\u201d Percy said.</p><p>\u201cAngela!\u201d There was a tap on the dividing door. It opened, and Jackson was standing there, impossibly tall and lean and solid and alive.</p><p>She looked at Percy and Annabelle, who faded away.</p><p>She turned back to Jackson, worried that he would have heard her conversation and become certain that she talked to herself.</p><p>But Jackson\u2019s keen, dark blue eyes were riveted on the spot where the children had been standing.</p><p>He had seen them, she thought. He had seen the children!</p><p>But he looked at her then and said casually, \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need a minute to change my clothes,\u201d she said, and closed the door between them.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Angela walked along beside Jackson in silence, wondering just how they appeared to others, she so blond, and he so dark.</p><p>It was a beautiful season to walk in the city of New Orleans. A night with a soft breeze and enough warmth to make that breeze like the soft, comfortable touch of a warm and gentle hand.</p><p>But one of her favorite things about the city was the variety of people and colors to be found there, nationalities and backgrounds all mixed up to produce the most interesting and handsome human beings.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask Jackson if he had seen the children in the room. If and when he wanted to say something to her, he would.</p><p>He seemed distracted as they walked, and still, he looked at her now and then, as if he remembered she had been in a dangerous position, and the fact didn\u2019t please him.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had strange experiences. I know you have. Anyone that Adam brought into this has had some kind of\u2014strange experience.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her. She thought that he would instantly deny her. But he didn\u2019t. \u201cDreams,\u201d he said. \u201cBut dreams may simply be projections of our minds, utilizing what we know and making sense out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. So...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014I\u2019ll tell you this.\u201d He looked pained for a minute. \u201cI thought I saw one of my coworkers, Sally. She came to me in a dream and told me where the murderer was holed up. I made it there in time to save two lives, but found...well, that Sally had died. It shook me up pretty badly, but I know how Adam Harrison knew about it. He likely wondered how I\u2019d gotten there, either through a brilliant burst of insight, or something that was paranormal. And I don\u2019t know which myself at times, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a skeptic.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI believe in God, or a supreme being, and I believe our role in life is to live with kindness to others, and I believe monsters should be brought down. Maybe I do believe in something beyond, but I\u2019ve also seen enough fakers, quacks, and criminals to remain a skeptic. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and smiled. It was actually quite a lot from him.</p><p>\u201cIt was lovely of you to think of adding a trip to the museum on to dinner like this,\u201d she said, her tone light.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</p><p>They walked down Royal Street toward Canal until they reached the museum. Jackson swore softly. The museum would be closing in fifteen minutes, per a sign on the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can come back,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what we can see in fifteen minutes. At least, I\u2019ll get an idea of what we might be looking for when someone can get back here. There\u2019s a library of archives here somewhere that might give us something.\u201d</p><p>A pleasant woman in her mid-sixties with elegant silver hair and a sweet manner refused to take Jackson\u2019s money for entrance. \u201cYou haven\u2019t time to see much,\u201d she said. She brightened. \u201cBut, hopefully we\u2019ll whet your appetite. Oh, and the new exhibit is opening tomorrow, so I know you\u2019ll want to come back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t open until tomorrow?\u201d Jackson asked her.</p><p>The woman pointed to curtains in the back. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, we still have it all under wraps.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot on Madden C. Newton, the murderer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that house.\u201d The woman shivered dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s downright scary. Creepy. And, in the news again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there is a lot on the house?\u201d Jackson asked.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Madden C. Newton. We have his death warrant in the display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t peek tonight?\u201d Jackson asked, giving her a charming smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2014they\u2019re still finishing up, and they\u2019ll be doing so tonight. But if you take a quick walk-through of the rest of the museum, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve arranged a chronological history of the city. The new exhibit will focus more on the past scandal, murderers and mayhem.\u201d</p><p>Jackson thanked her. There was only time to get the layout of the place, really. Angela appreciated all that she saw\u2014the stories were told with various tableaux featuring historical characters, while there was reading material on the walls between each episode of history.</p><p>Angela tried to pull back; she wanted to at least take a look at all of the tableaux. She felt as if she sped through history\u2014nearly three hundred years in three hundred seconds.</p><p>And while she was there, she had a feeling that she would find something important in the museum. That she would find something that would give her a clue in the mystery of the house.</p> <p>Jackson dragged her back to where heavy canvas draperies enclosed a large section of the back. A banner over the drapery announced, \u201cIt\u2019s here! Meet the real monsters who called the city their home throughout history, and learn how history dealt with real monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Jackson said glumly.</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re on a mission tonight, remember?\u201d Angela said.</p><p>An announcement over the loudspeaker reminded guests the museum was closing.</p><p>\u201cHey, I really love it. I\u2019ll come back here.\u201d</p><p>Jackson ignored her for a moment, looked around, and stepped up to the heavy drapery. He pulled it back to take a peek inside.</p><p>There were display cases at odd angles and a worker in a lab coat was still busy washing the floor. He looked up at them.</p><p>\u201cMuseum is closed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jackson said. He nodded and gave up. \u201cAll right, Angela, I guess we are on to the next part of our mission tonight. Let\u2019s go\u2014it is getting late. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. And when work combines with a good restaurant, it\u2019s better than work combining with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBones in a basement?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cSure. So, we\u2019re...trying to see what Martin DuPre might be up to?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her. \u201cNeither Blake nor Grable like the man\u2014while they don\u2019t seem to have a problem with one another.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a minute, and then said, \u201cI\u2019m just not sure what we\u2019re actually supposed to interpret. The senator apparently had an affair with his secretary. Maybe he\u2019s still seeing her\u2014now that his wife is dead. However, he is definitely grieving his wife\u2014no man could be that good an actor, not even a politician. The Aryans and the people belonging to the Church of Christ Arisen are apparently really, really messed up, but it\u2019s not against the law to be messed up. No one likes Martin DuPre, even if they pretend to around the senator. So, where do you think that leaves us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCloser than we were yesterday,\u201d he said.</p><p>They neared the restaurant. To Angela\u2019s surprise, he suddenly steered her around the block in another direction.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what are we doing now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAvoiding Grable Haines\u2014he\u2019s hanging out by the senator\u2019s sedan just down from the entrance. We\u2019re going to go around the block.\u201d</p><p>They reached the restaurant, coming in from the far side of the car.</p><p>\u201cSlip in, quick!\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI can see DuPre. They must have stopped for a drink or something, because they\u2019re just coming now, from where they parked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yet she quickly stepped inside.</p><p>The restaurant was situated in a building well over a century and a half old despite its modern decor. The place was jumping, an obvious indication that the food was very good\u2014or that it had somehow become the trendy place to be. She waited in a group while Jackson spoke with the pretty girl at the front podium.</p><p>While they waited for a hostess to bring them to their table\u2014on the far side of an elevator shaft that brought diners to an upper level\u2014Martin DuPre arrived with three other men. At first, they didn\u2019t see Jackson and Angela, and they were close enough in the milling group that awaited tables for Jackson and Angela to hear their conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhy, DuPre!\u201d a squat and rotund man said to Martin DuPre, \u201cthis does seem to be the happening place for an evening meal. I hope you have the rest of the evening planned out as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d DuPre said. \u201cGentlemen, this is my city. I know my way around. When we\u2019ve finished eating, we\u2019re headed to Bourbon Street. And I\u2019ve made reservations there, too, just to make sure that you are entertained this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d a taller man said. \u201cSo, you know the best on Bourbon Street? Isn\u2019t that strip clubs for college kids and the like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you know where to go,\u201d DuPre told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game for anything,\u201d said the last of DuPre\u2019s trio of guests. \u201cAll business, you know, and a man gets a little crazy. With a new baby in the house, I don\u2019t get out that much anymore. Nothing like a good business meeting\u2014on Bourbon Street.\u201d</p><p>The conversation made Angela acutely uncomfortable\u2013a group of middle-aged lechers.</p><p>\u201cSad, huh?\u201d Jackson whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cI guess...I guess some people have to pay. Or want to pay. Anyway, yuck. So much for a really nice dinner,\u201d Angela said lightly. \u201cBut they\u2019ll notice us soon enough. Won\u2019t that make DuPre get as far from us as possible?\u201d</p><p>He brought his fingers to his lips and whispered, \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to him. She meant to just whisper right away, but she found herself hesitating for a beat. His tailored shirt was crisp and clean. He smelled of shampoo and woodsy soap or aftershave, delicious. She found herself fascinated again by the bronze tone and texture of his skin, the sleek darkness of his hair and the brilliance in the back of his dark blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do? Pay the hostess to get the table next to his?\u201d Angela whispered to Jackson.</p><p>He grinned and whispered back, \u201cNot the table next to theirs. I want to be behind, out of sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how will you manage that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He had definitely done something right. DuPre and his party were seated first; they wound up at a table around the elevator shaft from DuPre and the other three men, out of sight, and yet, in a position where it seemed that anything said at DuPre\u2019s table was amplified.</p><p>Angela leaned toward Jackson. \u201cCan they hear us so loudly, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to bump into him over there to find out,\u201d he said.</p><p>He opened his menu. Angela heard the men talking about oil interests. There was something that had to do with an inspection, and DuPre assured the men that he would see that everything was fine. She picked up her own menu, listening. The squat fellow had a booming voice. He could be overheard the best.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad that Holloway has sent you out with us tonight, DuPre. David is a good fellow, but he\u2019s been in the midst of too much tragedy lately. Not that I don\u2019t sympathize with him, but...the man has forgotten what a good time could be,\u201d he said.</p><p>Angela was pretty sure that it was the tall thin fellow who spoke next, his voice lower. \u201cHey, I understand the man. He\u2019s a politician, so when Regina was alive, he felt right in doing whatever he needed to do to get people moving in his direction. But now she\u2019s gone. He needs his time of mourning. Then he\u2019ll be all right again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe scares me,\u201d DuPre said, speaking low, and yet the near whisper carrying. \u201cHe\u2019s brought in a team to investigate the house, he\u2019s so convinced that Regina didn\u2019t kill herself. Supposedly, they\u2019re from the government. I think they\u2019re just a bunch of charlatans, ghost hunters. I think he wants them to prove that there\u2019s some kind of presence in the house that killed his wife. Or maybe he\u2019s just trying to appease the constituency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now,\u201d the taller man boomed. \u201cThat\u2019s understandable, too. He can\u2019t take the guilt that something he might have done caused her to take the header, you know? Frankly, I think Regina was a little off from the get-go. Might have been the death of their boy. That can do it to you. But I heard she had some kind of voodoo priestess in there\u2014and a Catholic priest,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the voodoo worked too well,\u201d the squat fellow said, laughing at what he thought was his own great joke.</p><p>Their waitress appeared, smiling, and suggested the grouper almondine. They both agreed on the fish. Angela found herself noting that Jackson did have a knack for following and listening to people without being in the least obvious. He was pleasant with their server, not hurrying her along, but speaking easily in a manner to get their order in quickly\u2014and the waitress on her way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angela leaned toward him. \u201cSo, despite his public image, you think that Holloway used to take guys like these out to a place he knew on Bourbon Street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he got in on the action,\u201d Jackson said softly.</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>He caught her fingers across the table. \u201cLet\u2019s face it\u2014being a politician usually means making a few compromises. I\u2019ve seen it with the best of men\u2014and women. That\u2019s why it\u2019s way more fun to be an investigator.\u201d</p><p>She liked the feel of his fingers touching hers. They somehow seemed incredibly intimate in the crowded restaurant.</p><p>But he eased back. They were listening.</p><p>Angela didn\u2019t really understand much of the conversation. It continued along the lines of oil, oil equipment, and the inspections that were needed for a rig. They were seeking some kind of permit, and it would need an inspection, and Martin DuPre was assuring them that they would pass their inspection and get the permit they wanted.</p><p>She watched Jackson as he listened. And then, they might have heard the key words in what Jackson seemed to be searching for that night.</p> <p>It was the squat fellow with the booming voice who spoke. They could hear him slap DuPre on the shoulder. \u201cI say there, young fellow. When your boss gets tired of all the kissing baby butts and stuff that goes on, you\u2019re going to take his place just fine! You know how to get things done.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at Jackson. He returned her look with a grim smile, and lifted his wineglass to her. She returned it, set her glass down and leaned closer to him. \u201cSo, he\u2019s a butt-kissing, lying-ass, deceptive little goon. But does that make him a murderer?\u201d</p><p>Jackson leaned closer to her.</p><p>\u201cNo, it makes him a butt-kissing, lying-ass, deceptive little goon. But it\u2019s good to get a true picture of those around the senator, and have a feel for what they would and wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the little rat would do about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>Martin DuPre said, \u201cGentlemen, shall we move on?\u201d</p><p>Angela whispered again, \u201cAre we going to Bourbon Street?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAre you game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to a strip club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d</p><p>He motioned to their waitress and quickly paid the tab. They waited until they saw the men exit, and then they followed behind.</p><p>\u201cThank God for the foulmouthed fat man,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe can follow them easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel!\u201d she said.</p> <p>Jackson shrugged. \u201cHis weight is fine. His attitude is enough to make your skin crawl.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply. She thought that she was coming to like him so very much because his words were true\u2014and simply him. Nothing mattered to him about a person other than what was inside them. He had no patience for the manner of big-money oilmen Martin DuPre was entertaining.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cOil.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her, grinning. \u201cAh, well, it\u2019s apparent, my dear, that you\u2019re not from this area. Oil is half the livelihood. And there are good men working in it\u2014good men who aren\u2019t graft-laden and trying to go the wrong way. We need solutions in the future, yes. But oil money isn\u2019t necessarily evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I sound like that? I guess I did. I don\u2019t know enough,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all have to find solutions in the future, but it\u2019s careless overseeing and major problems in regulation that cause the problems\u2014as with everything.\u201d He stopped, distracted, staring ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone else following Martin DuPre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to a young woman who was about half a block ahead of them and half a block behind DuPre and his crew. She was young\u2014maybe eighteen or nineteen\u2014and had a small pudge, apparent because she was otherwise slim with long blond hair and a delicate face. She had paused for a moment to look in a window as DuPre and the men stopped at a corner for a car to go by; when they moved, she moved.</p><p>Jackson whistled softly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do\u2014and I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a member of the Church of Christ Arisen. She opened the door for Jake to go in and pay them a visit today.\u201d</p><p>Jake was glad to see that the meeting to recruit new Aryans was not going to be a huge success.</p><p>There were not quite fifty people in attendance. He stood by Jenna, responding with applause and enthusiasm to all the speeches given about maintaining the country for the \u201crightful\u201d owners, and keeping a pure race.</p><p>He thought that Jenna was going to explode. Her fair skin was darkening to blood-red hue, and she held his arm, her nails digging into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard anything so insane?\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cThe rightful owners! Is he forgetting the Native Americans\u2014those people the white settlers basically stole all the land from? My God, I don\u2019t think I can sit through this. What is the matter with them? Don\u2019t they know that the days of slavery are long gone, and that we have laws guaranteeing equality?\u201d</p><p>She was growing louder. He pinched her.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get us thrown out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I want to be thrown out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to observe.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her lips and held silent. He smiled, feeling her beside him. Another outburst couldn\u2019t be too far behind.</p><p>And once again, it wasn\u2019t. \u201cOh, please! How can they do this here? New Orleans has come a long, long way and it\u2019s the most amazing city in the world for people from everywhere, of every color and sex and even sexual orientation, and there\u2019s still French spoken, and Spanish, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, please!\u201d Jake pleaded.</p><p>She fell silent again. He was glad that the people who had come out were excited about the speakers\u2014who were actually good at spouting rhetoric\u2014because they didn\u2019t seem to notice Jenna\u2019s outrage. A young fellow was up at the microphone then saying that the world was what it was\u2014a mess\u2014and that there were all kinds of people in the world, and everyone had a right to be in the world, and they, too, had the right to seek the pureness of the Aryan race. They asked nothing of anyone else, they sought to hurt no one\u2014they wanted their right to assemble and seek the life\u2014the pursuit of happiness they had in mind for themselves.</p><p>To that end, they had to be very selective in voting for their representatives.</p><p>He began to preach a rabidly conservative doctrine\u2014one that would leave even a staunch Bible Belt Republican squirming in horror, much less a moderate of any party.</p><p>Jake turned around to take a look at the others in the room, and he nearly jerked Jenna\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped, but she followed his gaze.</p><p>There, seated in the far back of the room, was the bodyguard. Blake Conroy.</p><p>The pretty little pregnant girl followed Martin DuPre and his group.</p><p>Jackson and Angela followed the pretty little pregnant girl.</p><p>They made the turn off Chartres to head up to Bourbon, all keeping their respective distance. At Bourbon, the blonde girl paused. She seemed infinitely sad.</p><p>\u201cGo talk to her,\u201d Jackson told Angela.</p><p>\u201cTalk to her? What do I say?\u201d Angela asked him.</p><p>\u201cSee if she\u2019s lost, or if she needs help. I\u2019m going at DuPre and his group. I\u2019ll wait for you in front of the cowboy bar with the mechanical bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that DuPre and his friends are going to go ride the bull?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s next to a club that\u2019s behind a courtyard there, and supposedly offers the best and most expensive dancers in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little shove. Angela glared at him, and went over to the girl. Bourbon was already growing busy and loud. Rock ballads streamed out into the street from a variety of clubs, all trying to be louder than the next. Hawkers were handing out flyers, urging patrons to come in and enjoy their entertainment and their most incredible cheap drinks.</p><p>The girl stood near a hot-dog cart, staring after the group that had joined in the throng walking in the street, blocked off for pedestrians only.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Angela said. \u201cYou look lost. Can I help you? Are you looking for a certain place?\u201d</p><p>The girl stared blankly at her for a moment. Then she flushed. \u201cI\u2014no, I\u2019m not lost. I live in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to pester you. It just looks as if you\u2019re a bit tired and disconcerted, and...pregnant,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>The girl\u2019s flush became brighter.</p><p>Angela offered her a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Angela Hawkins. Are you sure you don\u2019t need any help?\u201d</p><p>The girl shook her head. \u201cNo, no, I just have to head back uptown. I shouldn\u2019t have been down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you a ride? Get you into a taxi? Where do you need to go?\u201d</p><p>The girl looked down Bourbon Street, and then suddenly sagged against Angela. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t feel very well.\u201d</p><p>Angela looked down the street. There was a restaurant on the corner one block down, on Royal. It had a bar, but it was a far quieter place, more for dining than drinking.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you some water.\u201d</p><p>She led the girl, who leaned on her heavily, to the restaurant. The seating was open, and she led the girl to a secluded table near the rear. She ordered water from the waiter, and suggested the girl might like soup or gumbo or something with substance.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d the girl said.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Angela insisted.</p><p>In a few minutes, the waiter had them supplied with water, and the girl had a salad and soup coming.</p><p>She stared at Angela then with huge brown eyes. \u201cThank you!\u201d she said. And she flushed. \u201cI\u2019m Gabby Taylor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Angela said pleasantly. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t come to this area often,\u201d she added. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl shook her head. \u201cWell, I did.

We...we try to serve, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServe who?\u201d</p><p>She was shocked. \u201cWhy\u2014God, of course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you serving him?\u201d Angela asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell, by...not drinking or dancing and serving\u2014\u201d The girl shifted in her seat.</p><p>\u201cServing who?\u201d</p><p>Gabby looked down at her folded hands.</p><p>\u201cAre your parents here, in the city?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see them anymore,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? They must be thrilled about the baby.\u201d</p> <p>Gabby winced, fixing her gaze on her hands once again. \u201cThey don\u2019t know about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost grandparents would love news of a baby. Did\u2014did they throw you out of the house, or...or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no\u2014I belong to the church,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cAnd the church doesn\u2019t want you to see your parents? Oh, Gabby! That doesn\u2019t sound very good.\u201d</p><p>Gabby looked at Angela and there were suddenly huge tears in her eyes. \u201cI believed...I believed that they were right. I believed in...serving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServing how?\u201d Angela couldn\u2019t quite prevent the sharpness that came into the question. \u201cEvery church, temple and so on that I\u2019ve ever heard about preaches love\u2014love between parents and children as well as God!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the tears began to drip down Gabby\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI thought...I don\u2019t know, it all seemed to be all right, but I can\u2019t just give...we were all supposed to love one another, but it doesn\u2019t feel right. Tonight, I had to see...I had to see what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe? The baby\u2019s father? Is he the head of the church?\u201d</p> <p>Gabby shook her head. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my opinion that you should go home. To your parents. Do they know that you\u2019re still in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tried to get me away from the church,\u201d Gabby admitted. \u201cBut it was against the law for them to harass me or the church. I am eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen, pregnant and learning that the promised land was not so ideal, and that she had human emotions and needs that went beyond promises of redemption for her devoted duty to\u2014to whoever was pulling the strings.</p><p>The soup came. Gabby wiped her cheeks and started to sip it. She was starving, or so it seemed. Angela tried to be patient, letting her get down a good portion of food before talking to her again.</p><p>\u201cGabby, are you married to the child\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes! Well, not in the eyes of the corrupt law\u2014but in the eyes of the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Does the baby\u2019s father have other wives?\u201d</p><p>Gabby\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cHe does. And you\u2019ve realized that when you love someone, you don\u2019t want to share. And, tonight, you\u2019ve also realized that the man you thought you loved is someone different entirely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to\u2014he has to keep the job he has. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s just part of his\u2014job,\u201d Gabby said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a crock!\u201d Angela said flatly. It was confusing. His job was part of his job? He worked for the senator\u2014and for the church. But his work for one or the other was felonious. If the senator had asked him to get involved with the church, the man had certainly taken the task to heart! But...</p><p>What if the church was his real passion and his work for the senator something he was doing because of the church, as Gabby suggested?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to speak so quickly, or so coldly, but it turned out to be the right thing. The girl sat back, folding her hands in her lap. \u201cIt is a crock, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGabby, any organization that wants to cut you off from people who love you can\u2019t be offering you the best that is out there. I know how easy it is to get caught up in wanting to belong, to feel important, to be a part of something. But it sounds as if this hasn\u2019t been a great experience. Tell me, do you love your parents? Did you love them before all this came about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they wanted me home, they didn\u2019t want me out with some of the people I was hanging with...I guess I was smoking a lot of pot...a few other things,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cSo, at first...well, I did quit the pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re pregnant, that\u2019s a very good thing. Tell me, do you want the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! I\u2014I\u2014I, yes. I do want the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabby, go home. Go to your parents. They are probably praying every single day that you will come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014just go home?\u201d Gabby whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust go home. Do you want me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>Gabby smiled suddenly. \u201cNo, I can do it.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cDo you really think that they\u2019ll take me back now I\u2019m coming back with nothing but...a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll love you, and they\u2019ll love the baby,\u201d Angela assured her, hoping she was telling the girl the absolute truth. But Gabby hadn\u2019t left home because of abuse. She had done so because she had been young and impressionable. Her parents had come for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do it,\u201d Gabby said. \u201cAfter tonight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabby, is Martin DuPre the father of your baby?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Gabby stared at her and gasped. But then she shook her head. \u201cNo, no, no. I really can\u2019t tell you the father of the baby. I really can\u2019t. Please. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Gabby was growing agitated. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. There were a lot of maybes.\u201d</p><p>She was lying, but she was terrified to admit that the father was Martin DuPre.</p><p>It came back again to one question. Did Senator Holloway know that his aide was associated with the Church of Christ Arisen? Not just associated\u2014heavily involved? And if so, how involved was he?</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, Gabby. It\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so afraid, but if you\u2019re going home, that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>The girl stared at her a long time, and then smiled. \u201cAngela Hawkins. I know your name. You\u2019re investigating the Madden C. Newton house. The senator\u2019s house. Are you a ghost hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d Angela asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt was in the newspaper\u2014you dug a skeleton out of the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Of course,\u201d Angela murmured.</p><p>Gabby suddenly looked frightened again. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that you met me\u2014please, you can\u2019t say that you met me!\u201d She looked as if she was going to rise and run out of the restaurant.</p><p>And right back to the church.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t say anything about meeting you, honestly. I\u2019m going to put you in a cab right now, and send you home, and we\u2019ll never say that we met at all, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI should call them.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have a phone anymore. They don\u2019t believe we should have phones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked. It\u2019s only a few miles.\u201d</p><p>Angela reached in her bag for her cell phone. She handed it to Gabby. \u201cCall them,\u201d she suggested softly.</p><p>What followed tore at her heart. She could vaguely hear the answer at the other end of the line. When the young woman first heard her mother\u2019s voice, tears sprang into her eyes again. \u201cMommy?\u201d she asked after a moment.</p><p>The woman\u2019s joy at the sound of her daughter\u2019s voice was now more than audible, even across the table. Then Gabby talked and cried, her words disrupted, but her emotion totally comprehensible. \u201cI\u2019m coming home, Mommy. I\u2019m coming home. Now.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, wiping her face again, she handed the phone back to Angela. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money. But I\u2019ll get a real job, and get it back to you, if you lend me the money for the cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pay this bill and take you outside and put you in a cab,\u201d Angela said firmly. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s going to be a wonderful night for you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to get the young woman into a cab for home before Gabby could change her mind. She threw money down on the table for the food, and hurried out with her, holding the girl\u2019s hand all the while. She saw an empty cab headed down Royal and quickly hailed it.</p><p>Gabby clutched her hand suddenly. \u201cWhy are you doing this for me?\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re so kind! I\u2019m just a stranger, I just...you must have really, really nice parents!\u201d</p><p>Something seemed to catch in Angela\u2019s throat. \u201cI did,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey died. Now, please, go home, and appreciate yours. Give me the address and get in.\u201d</p><p>She wanted the address. She didn\u2019t intend to betray Gabby, but she knew she needed the address. The girl\u2019s home was in Metairie. She gave the driver a ten-dollar tip to make sure that he got her there safely.</p><p>She watched as the cab went slowly down Royal.</p><p>Then she turned back toward Bourbon Street.</p><p>She didn\u2019t find Jackson in front of the cowboy bar, though she did wind up in a friendly crush of drunks coming and going. She saw the courtyard he had been talking about, and wandered to the gate. There were tarot readers set up in the courtyard area, and beyond, she saw a small walk-by bar that advertised quick, cheapie, frozen drinks, and beyond that, in oddly subdued neon lettering, a sign that advertised: Discreet! The Finest Dancers in All New Orleans. Men And Women Welcome.</p><p>She had a number of friends who would walk into any strip club, totally intrigued, amused and unashamed.</p><p>Sadly, she wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>But then, it was worse just standing there on Bourbon Street with the crowds sweeping around her. People were mostly young and fun, but smiling back and laughing casually at the \u201cOh, baby, baby!\u201d calls that were coming her way was getting to be a bit much for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slipped past the tarot readers headed for the strip club in back. Luckily, as she did so, her phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID. It was Jackson.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Jackson asked without greeting her. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be a few minutes\u2014it\u2019s almost an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story. You\u2019re not going to believe what I have to tell you. But where are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWatching Lovely Lola Lolita on the pole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, he emerged out of the darkened doorway. He offered her a hand. She arched a brow. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad!\u201d he called to her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait,\u201d she muttered, and went forward to take his hand.</p> <p>A hostess with enormous breasts and tassels on her nipples was in the shadowed hallway when they entered. She was wearing something like a slinky harem skirt, and she had a smile as big as her breasts. \u201cWelcome back!\u201d she said to Jackson. \u201cAnd this is your lady! Now I understand how you might want to enjoy our entertainment together!\u201d</p><p>Jackson pulled her close. \u201cOh, yes, there\u2019s just nothing like watching a good dancer together, isn\u2019t that true, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure,\u201d she managed to mutter. When the hostess turned to lead them in, she jabbed him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d Jackson was taken by surprise.</p><p>The hostess turned back.</p><p>Jackson smiled at her. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cshe likes it a little rough, you know?\u201d</p> <p>The hostess laughed. \u201cOh, honey, we see everything here. Come on back in, you two!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Angela whispered, smiling around her clenched teeth. If he wanted to play it this way, she could pitch in easily enough. With her arm slipped around him, she came up on her toes and whispered against his ear, \u201cIs there really anything we\u2019re going to gain by being here? I can leave you on your own, you know. Let you get to know some of the girls up close and personal.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help herself. She nipped his earlobe.</p><p>He glared down at her as she slid back down, looking up at him. Then he laughed. \u201cOkay, I deserved that one.\u201d</p><p>She wished that she didn\u2019t like him, and his sense of humor, his sense of being, him, quite so much. She had learned about loving and loving could be so much pain.</p><p>They were led to a table. It was in the back, and behind Martin DuPre and his group.</p><p>Jackson thanked the hostess and they took their seats at a plush, black, circular table.</p><p>Angela quickly noted that Martin DuPre and his party were closer to the stage where a scantily clad woman\u2014a very beautiful one\u2014was doing amazing calisthenics on a pole.</p> <p>\u201cWell. This is really comfortable,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cDuPre and his group have already had about twenty lap dances,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve just been sitting here?\u201d Angela inquired sweetly.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m working,\u201d he told her. He leaned toward her. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I honestly think that I did a very good deed\u2014and found out more about Martin DuPre than you did,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She quickly gave him a version of her time with Gabby.</p><p>He listened with grave intent.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said when she had told him about her time with Gabby. \u201cSo...Martin DuPre, aide to the senator, is a member of the Church of Christ Arisen. There\u2019s an oxymoron for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson, I really think that he\u2019s the father of her baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want him to provide child support?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, he\u2019s going to owe child support,\u201d Angela said indignantly. \u201cBut she may not want it. Once Gabby is away from the Church of Christ Arisen, she may discover that she never wants to see anyone who had anything to do with it ever again\u2014even the father of her child. And, after tonight, I think he\u2019s...I think he\u2019s slimy enough to have done anything,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to notice the woman on the pole. He was deep in thought. \u201cHe\u2019s a slimy bastard. But did he kill Regina Holloway? And if so, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both looked at those crime scene photos,\u201d Angela told him heatedly. \u201cShe was thrown. Or pushed. There was weight and impetus behind whatever happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honestly not sure if the senator suspects that DuPre is part of the church that is always spouting against him. And I\u2019m not sure that being a total ass makes a man a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems the best suspect to me so far,\u201d Angela told him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. A waitress came by. She was almost as scantily clad as the stripper at the pole.</p><p>They ordered drinks, and the waitress moved on.</p><p>They sat in silence for a moment.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see tonight?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>She was almost certain that he understood her question from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cA lot of lap dances,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIn my room. Or, really, in Regina\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute, and she thought that he would evade her again.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. He looked at her, blue eyes nearly as dark and compelling as a stygian mystery.</p><p>\u201cI saw them,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She felt as if her breath caught, as if her heart stopped for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou see...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see what you see, frequently,\u201d he said, and then looked toward the stage again. \u201cI see what we conjure in our minds, what remains behind\u2014what is there, what is heart, what is soul, what remains to help us, when we desperately need help.\u201d</p><p>She was almost afraid to speak again.</p><p>He had sounded so casual. And yet, he had made an admission she thought that he rarely made.</p><p>\u201cThere he goes again,\u201d Jackson said softly.</p><p>Angela saw that the dancer who had left the stage had approached the group in front of them, and Martin DuPre had his money out. The beautiful stripper walked toward him and took the offered bill. She crawled over his lap. She twisted and shimmied. He didn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>\u201cYou do know that this is a really weird situation for me?\u201d Angela said to Jackson.</p><p>He squeezed her hand across the table.</p><p>\u201cSorry, we can go. I have what I need to know,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard is living a double life. He\u2019s a member of the Church of Christ Arisen, while pretending to be the senator\u2019s staunchest supporter. He\u2019s planning his own political career on the senator\u2019s back. He\u2019s a lecher\u2014a man who wants continual entertainment and stimulation. He\u2019ll leave here\u2014and go seduce another innocent. All in the name of God, of course. How has the senator been so stupid and blind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut...I believe the death of his son certainly contributed to the fact that he leaned on others\u2014and never became suspicious of certain behaviors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s disgustingly creepy!\u201d Angela said, indicating Martin DuPre, who now had his face buried between the stripper\u2019s breasts.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than a boy being a boy,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHow the hell has Martin DuPre gotten away with leading such a double life? Convincing the senator that he\u2019s his most loyal proponent, cutting side deals and being a biggie in a church\u2014and I use that term loosely\u2014that considers the senator\u2019s entire platform to be blasphemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson, Gabby is afraid of him,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cShe was following him\u2014but you think that she\u2019s afraid of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t tell me who the father was, but, in that conversation, it was apparent. She was afraid. We really have to find out more about that place. And we have to let the senator know that we know all about Martin DuPre,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jackson told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not yet?\u201d Angela asked indignantly.</p><p>\u201cWe have to figure out what the senator knows, what he doesn\u2019t know and if he has been involved in all of this in any way,\u201d Jackson told her.</p><p>\u201cI am so confused\u2014how could the senator be involved in a church that protests and pickets his platform?\u201d Angela asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s involved in the church. And I think DuPre will be out when the senator finds out that he is. But DuPre is dirty to the core. And whether or not the senator makes use of that, I don\u2019t know. Maybe he managed his gleaming image for so long because he\u2019s had DuPre doing what he can\u2019t be seen doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike killing his wife?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Jackson shrugged. \u201cWe know someone was in with her. Someone who had access to the house. Someone who came and went without setting off any kind of alarm,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>She saw him change subtly. There was a slight tensing in his features. \u201cCome closer, hold my hands\u2014whisper to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned, and then saw what he had seen.</p><p>They had been noted.</p><p>She was grateful for the shadows. She inched closer to Jackson, lowered her head and kept her eyelashes low. Martin DuPre had looked back and seen them.</p><p>He forgot about his lap dancer, pushing the stripper away. He rose, thought to excuse himself to his buddies and headed toward them.</p><p>\u201cCloser,\u201d Jackson said, his right arm coming tightly around her as he cupped her chin with his left hand, bringing his face just inches from hers. \u201cHe\u2019s coming, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiggle.\u201d</p><p>She let out a small string of husky laughter.</p><p>DuPre actually stopped for a moment. She knew that he was staring at them, even while she murmured something else unintelligible to Jackson. Jackson seemed to sense that DuPre was close behind them, but in the shadows, apparently determining whether to accost them or not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think we need to take this back to some privacy now,\u201d Jackson said, his voice rising just slightly, a sensual burr as thick as molasses in his tone.</p><p>\u201cYes, now. Now,\u201d she replied, keeping her voice low, breathy and urgent.</p><p>DuPre backed away farther. Jackson rose, catching her hand and drawing her up against him. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing now?\u201d he whispered, nuzzling his forehead against hers while they stood in the body crunch.</p> <p>\u201cStill staring,\u201d Angela whispered.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would love this place. Beauty is beauty, and movement, well...\u201d Jackson purred. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m burning up,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>She kept her voice low, and very dry. \u201cYep. I\u2019m just a hunk, a hunk of burning love.\u201d</p><p>His smile then was real, even as he asked again, \u201cHe\u2019s still watching?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her impossibly close, and kissed her. It wasn\u2019t a stage kiss. It was a full, passionate, filled-with-tongue kiss, and despite herself, she was swept away by it, forgetting their real mission, and simply luxuriating in the rampant wall of heat provided by the muscled hardness of his chest and the lava-flow sweetness of his kiss. She closed her eyes, stunned and seduced in one, and feeling a tidal wave of arousal sweep over her, something that the eroticism of the most accomplished dancer couldn\u2019t begin to create.</p><p>He broke the kiss, his lips a bare half inch away.</p><p>\u201cIs he still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuPre.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d She almost jerked away, but she held her ground. She brushed her lips against his teasingly, whispering all the while. \u201cNo. He\u2019s gone back to his chair. I think he\u2019s still looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. I think we\u2019ll notice him.\u201d</p><p>He pulled around to his side; they were ready to leave. But as he did so, he looked out to the tables closer to the stage.</p><p>\u201cDuPre,\u201d he said, not loudly. He lifted a hand to wave.</p><p>DuPre lifted a hand as well. He stood, walking away from the group to join them. Onstage, a new girl\u2014Angela was pretty sure she had been announced as Cherry Candy\u2014was winding lithely around the pole.</p><p>Martin DuPre looked at the two of them as if seeing them for the first time. He grinned wryly. \u201cWow. Imagine the two of you here. I didn\u2019t even know you were a couple.\u201d</p><p>Jackson laughed, pulling her close. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing against fraternizing on our team, we\u2019re really kind of a special unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, ghost busters,\u201d DuPre snorted.</p> <p>\u201cImagine you here,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cPart of the job, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid Holloway is kind of a loner, a family man, but to most people, this is good clean fun. Oil guys,\u201d he said, indicating the three men at his table. \u201cThey don\u2019t get out that much... They\u2019re just having fun.\u201d He looked at the two of them, with another smile. He was convinced his story was totally plausible, but then he seemed to think that theirs was, too.</p><p>\u201cSorry, still can\u2019t imagine the two of you here,\u201d DuPre said.</p><p>Jackson pulled her closer. \u201cWell, this one, she\u2019s a wicked little hellion when she wants to be. It just increases all the good stuff when you get home, huh, honey?\u201d</p><p>She kept her smile in place, staring at DuPre, and feeling like a fool.</p><p>\u201cIt helps Jackson along a lot, you know\u2014keeping things going, and sometimes, you know, a working guy can be just a little worn-out,\u201d she said sweetly. She felt Jackson tense, though there wasn\u2019t a single change in his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe\u2019s insatiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d DuPre said, looking at her. Her arm was around Jackson\u2019s waist, his was around her shoulder. She gave his midriff a solid pinch. He flinched, but again gave no sign.</p><p>\u201cI have to take her to the S and M clubs sometimes, you know?\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d DuPre repeated, looking at her with new appreciation.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve just got to get home now\u2014honey,\u201d she said to Jackson.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Jackson agreed. \u201cSeize the moment,\u201d he told DuPre.</p><p>\u201cWell, good to see you two out and about and enjoying the city. Good night,\u201d DuPre said.</p><p>\u201cGood night!\u201d Angela said cheerfully. Jackson waved.</p><p>And finally, they were out, and back on Bourbon Street where the bars remained crowded, the music was cacophony and life seemed to scream out loud.</p><p>Angela pulled away from Jackson and glared at him. \u201cAn S and M club?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHey! You implied that I was impotent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me out to be an animal,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, we\u2019re all animals,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She stared at him with aggravation and started walking. \u201cHey, I think it\u2019s better to be a wildcat than a limp rag!\u201d he said, humor in his voice as he walked after her.</p><p>She turned back, not sure what she was going to say, but it was going to be fierce. But she saw the amusement in his eyes. He lifted his hands. \u201cHey, it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>She burst out laughing. His smile deepened; she waited and he stepped forward to start walking with her again.</p><p>\u201cAnd quite a day\u2019s work,\u201d Angela said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m worried. There has to be a reason that Gabby was so terrified of me saying anything to anyone. She didn\u2019t want me to tell anyone at all that I met her. But she\u2019s going home. What if she is in danger? I doubt if her parents are prepared to protect her if someone really lethal is out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have her full name and address?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I made sure I gave the cabdriver the money and her address,\u201d Angela assured him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the house. I\u2019ll put a call through to Andy Devereaux and see if he can, at the very least, make sure that a patrol car keeps a close watch on the place.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. They kept walking. Close. When a staggering group would walk by, Jackson either caught her by the shoulders or slipped an arm around her, drawing her close\u2014and away from a potential human gridlock.</p><p>When they reached the house, Whitney was there to open the front door. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe what happened tonight!\u201d she said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jackson asked tersely. \u201cWas there something that happened at the Church of Christ Arisen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cNot unless you count Whitney singing every Beatles song known to man as something happening,\u201d Will said, coming up behind her. \u201cNothing. Door didn\u2019t open or close for three hours. We came on back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Jake and Jenna had been seated in front of the screens, all rolling real time in the house. They were twisted around now, watching the others at the door.</p><p>\u201cGuess who was at the Aryans meeting?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cBlake Conroy,\u201d Jackson replied.</p><p>\u201cWow, how did he know that?\u201d Jake asked, staring at Jenna.</p><p>\u201cProcess of elimination,\u201d Jackson said dryly. \u201cWe were watching Martin DuPre. I saw Grable Haines lounging by the car about a block down from the restaurant. He didn\u2019t look like a happy camper, but bored as he might have been, I don\u2019t think he went anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the car still there when we left?\u201d Angela asked him. She felt absurdly guilty; she hadn\u2019t even looked.</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cI\u2019m imagining that Haines had orders to stay put until Martin DuPre called him. So, our friend Blake Conroy was at the Aryans meeting. Interesting. Did he see you? Did you speak with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cJenna nearly caused us to be lynched first,\u201d Jake supplied.</p><p>\u201cI did not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf comments like \u2018these are the most racist assholes I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 aren\u2019t inflammatory at such a gathering, I\u2019m not sure what would be,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cNo one heard me but you,\u201d Jenna dismissed his remark with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cSo what did Blake Conroy have to say for himself?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said that he had come to see what was going on so that he could warn the senator,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you think about that?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was hard to tell if he was lying or not,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cCome on\u2014you can read people. What did you feel?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cHe walked right up to us, and it looked as if he was feeling the same way. As if he\u2019d read my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that you think he has some kind of telepathic ability?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say he can really read people, and because of it, he\u2019s probably really good at manipulating them,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cExcuse me, I have to make a call to Andy Devereaux. Angela, why don\u2019t you fill them in on our evening. I think we have the trump card tonight,\u201d he said casually, and left them, pulling his phone out as he bounded up the stairs.</p><p>They all stared at Angela, waiting. \u201cWell, it was...interesting,\u201d she said. And she told them about Martin DuPre and his group at dinner, and how she went after Gabby Taylor, what she learned from the girl, and that Martin DuPre had taken his business pals down to the strip club for lap dances. Both Jenna and Whitney found the latter amusing, and wanted to know if she had enjoyed a lap dance, too.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey. Business here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Gabby, but Jackson is calling Andy now to see to it that a patrol car drives around her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014shouldn\u2019t someone let the senator know right away that his right-hand man is practically a pedophile?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cJackson wants to lie low for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause none of them are what they seem\u2014and they all have the wool totally pulled over the eye of the public\u2014the voters!\u201d Jake said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMinus my great-grandmother,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWell, the thing is, the senator might want to just turn his head while Martin DuPre handles situations that could look a little on the sleazy side,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s not illegal for adults to enjoy adult entertainment. If DuPre is taking some kind of kickback for getting business situations solved without the proper safety precautions, then he is engaging in a criminal offense. But we don\u2019t really know that. And, to say that David Holloway was having an affair\u2014it\u2019s not like such a thing hasn\u2019t happened before. Especially not in politics. Not only that, but suppose we prove that Martin DuPre is a horrible person\u2014he still hasn\u2019t done anything illegal. Gabby Taylor fingered him as the father, but I\u2019m not sure what that means yet. It\u2019s slimy and horrible, but other men have impregnated women, and they\u2019ve been wretched about it, but I don\u2019t think people go to jail for it anymore. She is eighteen, and she joined the \u2018church\u2019 of her own accord. She slept with him\u2014and, apparently, she did so by choice. I\u2019m pretty sure she had to be major league brainwashed in one way or another, and it\u2019s as sleazy, slimy, contemptible as possible, but I\u2019m not sure anything he did was illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless there are underage girls in that place,\u201d Jake said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that would be illegal,\u201d Angela agreed. \u201cBut the point I\u2019m making is that it won\u2019t get us any closer to the truth about what happened here, so...we\u2019ll try to dig further. DuPre saw us at the strip club tonight, so he knows that we saw him there. He doesn\u2019t know that Jackson recognized Gabby Taylor from when she let you into the church, Jake, and that I followed her, and that she talked to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd none of this has anything to do with a haunted house,\u201d Jenna said quietly. \u201cAnd yet, somehow, it must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe none of it has anything to do with anything,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnyway, kiddies, I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019m up to bed. See you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>They bid her good-night and she walked up the main stairway to traverse the middle wing and head to the back of the house.</p><p>She paused halfway down the hall, trying to see if she felt anything. The hallway was shadowed, and for a moment, the house felt oppressive. None of it made sense. The children were trying so hard to warn her about something, but she didn\u2019t think that the danger was in the house. Nor was she really afraid, though, after the experience in the basement, she didn\u2019t particularly want to be there alone. It was a good thing that Jackson had suggested that none of them do it.</p> <p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>She jumped at the sound of Jake\u2019s voice, and then realized that it was coming from the camera and microphone set up in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cSorry! Yes, I\u2019m fine. Good night,\u201d Angela said, laughing at herself.</p><p>She walked around the ell to the room she had chosen. Regina\u2019s room.</p><p>She stepped in and turned on the light. The room was a room. Walking over to the connecting doors, she saw that hers was closed over, but not shut. Jackson was on the phone; the low tone of his voice was audible. His door was ajar as well.</p><p>It was a surprise to realize that she wanted the door open a bit more before she indulged in a long hot shower before bed. That night, she didn\u2019t know why, she was feeling nervous.</p> <p>Opening her door a bit more, Angela turned and walked to the bathroom, and then happily slipped into the shower and turned on the spray. The bathroom had been redone using elements of the past; there was a beautiful claw-foot tub along with a shower stall. There were dual sinks set into marble, a door that closed off the toilet and a beautiful wooden cabinet that stretched over the sinks and had a large oval mirror in the center. She set about brushing her teeth and washing her face, and then stepped beneath a deliciously hot and strong spray of water.</p><p>Moments later, feeling warm and fresh, she stepped out. While drying off, she suddenly felt as if she was being watched. She froze, looking around the bathroom, but there was nothing there.</p><p>Then, as she turned, she saw there was something in the mirror. She thought it was her own face at first. And then she realized that there, in the steam, was another face. It was that of a young woman, one with haunted, red-rimmed eyes.</p><p>The lips opened, as if they would issue a scream. But no sound came; the face began to decay as Angela watched, frozen in fear. It rotted dark and black, and the soft tissue of the eyes disappeared, and the black sockets seemed to stare back at her.</p><p>A choked-out cry escaped her as slowly. Even the skeleton disappeared, and all that was left was the steam-filled mirror.</p><p>\u201cAngela!\u201d</p><p>She was barely in a towel, but Jackson burst through the bathroom door and stared at her. He was wearing pajama bottoms and nothing more\u2014and carried a big gun, his Glock 22.</p><p>He looked around the bathroom and quickly lowered the gun.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She swallowed hard, thinking that, even if he did see things at times, he might think that she was definitely a loose cannon now. She held the towel to her and figured there was still nothing to say but the truth.</p><p>\u201cThere was a face in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>That was the truth, but probably not the best way to express it. His expression was somewhat open for a change, and seemed to say, Of course there\u2019s a face when you look in a mirror\u2014your own.</p><p>\u201cIt was a young woman,\u201d she said. That still didn\u2019t seem to help. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, Jackson. There was a face in the mirror, staring at me. Not my face. Another young woman. Please, stop looking at me like that. You admitted that you saw the children. There are spirits in this house, ghosts, souls\u2014energy!\u2014whatever. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re all right?\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, wincing. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, sometimes these things still startle me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and said huskily, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll open both doors all the way so that you can get some sleep. And you\u2019re welcome to scream anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not a....\u201d She paused. She didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not a damsel in distress in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were. If something happened to me, I\u2019d like to think you\u2019d be there,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou like it rough, remember?\u201d he teased her.</p><p>They stood there for a minute, she in her towel, and he in his pajama bottoms and Glock. The night seemed to have gone still. She waited, thinking that the time was right. He was going to take a step and come to her. She could still remember the way it had felt when his lips had come down on hers in the club, when they had played the couple looking for a little titillation before heading home...</p><p>\u201cScream anytime,\u201d he said again.</p><p>She nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</p><p>He turned and walked away, and she was astounded by the disappointment that flooded through her.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d</p><p>He turned back. She walked out, just holding the towel against her. \u201cWho do you think it might have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the mirror. Who do you think it might have been?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You have the book on Madden C. Newton. Read through, and find out about his victims. It wasn\u2019t Regina Holloway, was it? That would be nice\u2014if you could just have a conversation going with her, she could tell us what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep wishing we would see Regina. If she was murdered, she might well\u2014linger,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cIf this group is really able to communicate with those who have gone, you\u2019d think someone would have seen her,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about that, too,\u201d Angela said. \u201cShe might be here\u2014unless she did commit suicide and doesn\u2019t feel wronged anymore. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it\u2014with Regina, I think that maybe she knew her son was in the world she had entered. She wanted to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jackson said quietly. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway it wasn\u2019t Regina,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was someone much younger. A girl\u2014a girl about Gabby Taylor\u2019s age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen see what you can find in the book,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>He turned away again.</p><p>\u201cJackson,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stopped. She walked straight to him and set a hand on his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t like it rough. Oh, I\u2019m into energy and passion, but not pain. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly strange, but I do like to think that I\u2019m exciting.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, and after a moment, smiled slowly. He tossed the Glock 22 on the bed and slipped his arms around her, tearing away the towel between them. He lifted her chin and kissed her lips long and with a lingering pleasure. Then he broke away. \u201cWell, you know, you did take me to that club because you needed to get me riled up. So impotent, you know. But guess what? You\u2019re far more tempting in a towel than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen on a pole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this allowed?\u201d she asked, wondering that it could be so easy to stand here with him, wanting him, when it had seemed that desire had died along with the man she had once loved. He was nothing like Griffin. He was himself. But he might have in every quality something of what made him what he was that was something she subconsciously searched for in a man. Something in his inner strength, and more, his ability to deal with all that was horrible and cruel in the world, and to maintain honor, compassion and humanity.</p><p>And it might have been the way he wore his pajama bottoms. Or his naked chest. She wasn\u2019t sure right now. It certainly had to do with the way she felt, crushed against him.</p><p>\u201cNot this room,\u201d he said softly. He released her to retrieve his gun. Catching her hand, he led her through to his room. The towel remained behind on the floor.</p><p>He slid the Glock into the drawer of the bedside table and turned back to her.</p><p>There was a moment when he looked at her, and Jackson looking at her was more seductive than the touch of any other. He seemed to drink her in, and as he did, she came alive before ever stepping back into his embrace and savoring the power of his arms as they came around her. Their lips locked passionately again, and she became instantly and desperately immersed in him, in every sensation that his touch brought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was never sure how they stumbled down upon the bed, but once there, they became a tangle of limbs, arms and legs, so eager to brush and touch one another that they seemed a stream of fluid motion. He was a practiced and courteous lover, natural and easy in all his movements, and with every caress. His fingers moved eloquently along her spine, cradling her buttocks to bring them flush to one another, and he was unhurried, careless of his own arousal as he kissed her shoulders, explored the line of her back and cupped, cradled, teased her breasts, bathing them with the wash of his tongue, edge of his teeth, and searing liquid caress. She moved against him as well, in wonder at the wall of his chest, at the feel of him, so responsive to the lightest pressure of her fingers, to a subtle kiss pressed here, there and everywhere upon him. Eventually she curled back into his arms, and he was inside her, and for moments then, she just felt riveted by the pleasure of him a part of her, so intimate and sexual. Such sweetness could not last too long, for the urge to move was strong, the urge to increase the friction and the madness rising within her.</p><p>And he knew how to move.</p><p>If there were ghosts in the house then, they were silent and discreet.</p> <p>If there was a world beyond the bed, Angela didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>For infinitely miraculous minutes, there was nothing in the world but being with him, feeling the sleek slide of his body against hers, the remarkable intensity of his sex and the very simple wonder of being so excruciatingly intimate together. Rising and falling, arcing and writhing, rolling and even laughing breathlessly, and finding the rhythm again. He held her above him, and his eyes caught hers, and his hands slid along her breasts and torso, and then they moved again, and she lay beneath him, and everything seemed to spin and turn in the sweetness of the shadows of the night. He caught her to him in a wild deep thrust and the shadows were illuminated in a burst of light as she climaxed, and felt the shuddering spasms of his body against hers before they collapsed together on the sheets, sleek with sweat, desperate for air, their hearts pounding a staccato beat in the night.</p><p>She lay against him then, feeling the air cool.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is...well, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s good business,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He rose on an elbow, amused as he looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t business,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed softly, amazed by the deep, deep blue of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the strip club every night, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was worth it. But the team\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my team. It\u2019s a new kind of team. We report to Adam before anyone else. Adam didn\u2019t give me any rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but in other units\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t another unit. It\u2019s my team. And I say it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. His fingers stroked her cheek in a long and hypnotic movement.</p><p>He kissed her lips and drew her against him. \u201cHave to prove myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re up to it, wildcat.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been, the way that he could touch and kiss, he would have easily persuaded her.</p><p>Angela was still sleeping when Jackson woke. He eased out of bed, looking down at her, and it seemed impossible that the passionate creature who had ruled his senses, his libido, and the entire night could appear so pure and innocent by the light of day. With sun shining in on her, the line of her back against the cool beige of the sheets curved like alabaster, the kind of beauty sculptors longed to capture.</p><p>He headed into the bathroom, closing the door quietly. While he shaved, showered and dressed, he came to terms with a number of things in his mind. He had seen the children; he had seen the little boy and the little girl in the room just as they had lost their ghostly nerve and faded into dust motes. He knew that Angela had something that was far more acute than whatever power he possessed himself, and he worried about her.</p><p>Now, by the light of a brand-new day, there was the earthly\u2014and the unearthly\u2014that must be tackled and solved. Odd. Now he had to question himself. He still wanted to fight the belief that ghosts existed\u2014and that they could manipulate the living.</p><p>Somehow, he thought, the key now was to get to know the girl Angela had befriended last night, Gabby Taylor.</p> <p>She was still sleeping when he emerged, and he decided not to wake her yet.</p><p>He called Andy Devereaux as he headed out of the room and down the stairs to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDevereaux. That you, Crow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, morning, Andy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning. I\u2019ve had a car keeping an eye on the girl\u2019s house through the night. You want to come down to the station and I\u2019ll give you anything I can. I\u2019ll tell you, we have the United States Constitution, and the Church of Christ Arisen has a lawyer who seems to have memorized the thing and every damn law that has to do with the country, religious freedoms, personal freedoms, you name it. If we ever get what we need to shut the place down, it\u2019s got to be legal. In other words, I can\u2019t break into that church and arrest anyone without a warrant and a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Andy,\u201d Jackson assured him. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll come down to the station. But the girl and her family are all right\u2014no one bothered them during the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened at all,\u201d Andy assured him.</p><p>\u201cAnd your officers were careful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, thanks, Andy. I\u2019ll be there in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>In the kitchen, Jackson discovered that Jenna was awake and sipping coffee while reading the daily paper.</p><p>\u201cAre we getting that delivered?\u201d he asked casually.</p><p>\u201cJake said that you mentioned we should get the paper to keep abreast of things happening in the city.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and joined her. She set the paper down and looked at him. \u201cJackson, what do you think can possibly make people\u2014so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not all bad, Jenna. Most people are basically good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut some are purely evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was watching those people speak at that Aryans thing last night, and I was just horrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have freedom of speech, Jenna. Freedom to think whatever they want, and to try to persuade others to their way of thinking. Yes, for most of us, it\u2019s hard to fathom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, while I do believe in the basic goodness of humanity, there are, and always have been, those among us who might be described as evil,\u201d Jackson agreed. She was thoughtful and, apparently, still distraught over the meeting.</p><p>\u201cMartin DuPre doesn\u2019t look it at first. He just looks like a man. But he\u2019s evil,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cEvil, good, godly\u2014that\u2019s for another world to judge, so it seems,\u201d Jackson told her. \u201cIn this world, we have to catch what is illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cJackson, all of us know that there is something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, looking at her gravely.</p><p>\u201cWell, it scares me. I think that we are in our spirit form\u2014our souls, or whatever\u2014what we were in life. Good or evil. Okay, yes, there are shades of gray. But there is also evil that\u2019s almost pure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething evil is in this house,\u201d she told him. \u201cWell, we all saw the massive shadow thing in the basement. It scared the hell out of me, seeing how close it was coming to Angela. I don\u2019t know what to think about the whole thing. But it worries me.\u201d</p><p>He stood and walked over to her, patting her shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s why we stick together in one way or another, always, Jenna. No one in this house alone. I\u2019m heading down to the police station. Call me if anyone needs anything before I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo all we all stick here for now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFor now. I\u2019ll have our next plan of action when I get back,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>At the kitchen door, he hesitated. \u201cWhen Angela wakes up, ask her to start reading her book again, see what she can find in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, boss,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you the only one up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Whitney went for a jog. She\u2019ll be right back. And Will is on his way down to cook breakfast. Sure you don\u2019t want to wait for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave me something.\u201d He hesitated again.</p><p>Jenna looked at him and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll watch out for Angela,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s the most perceptive of us all, so don\u2019t you be worrying. I\u2019ll look out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yourself,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOf course. But I\u2019m doing all right here, though I do feel that we need to be together, as a team. Angela has a real gift, Jake is amazing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all have something special,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you bring out the best in all of us, Jackson. I believe you have far greater talents than you want to let us know about, but one that you have that is especially great is your ability to create a team. I feel like part of a team. Anyway, get going!\u201d</p><p>He smiled, walked over to her and planted a fatherly kiss on the top of her head. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and left her, heading out. He hesitated at the door, and then took the keys to Jake\u2019s car. Out back, he used the remote to open the gate, and brought Jake\u2019s little Honda out to drive to the station.</p><p>Where Andy Devereaux waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know how busy you are,\u201d Jackson told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, it is New Orleans, but you might inadvertently be doing me a big favor. The two main groups that seem to be against the senator are the Aryans and the Church of Christ Arisen, and both of these organizations are bones in our throats, you know?\u201d Andy said to him.</p><p>\u201cI sent Jake and Jenna to a meeting of the Aryans last night,\u201d Jackson told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Jackson grinned. \u201cAccording to Jake, our Irish girl almost got them lynched\u2014but what\u2019s interesting is that Blake Conroy was there as well. He came up to them after the speeches, and said that he was there to look after the interests of the senator. Know what was going on, I guess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Devereaux looked at him a moment and shrugged. \u201cThere are folks out there who are politically correct sometimes because it\u2019s what the world expects them to be\u2014doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have deep prejudice inside. And then, maybe he was telling the truth. Who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, I agree. Here\u2019s what\u2019s more serious,\u201d Jackson said, and he described what had gone on when Angela and he had followed Martin DuPre.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all crazy,\u201d Devereaux said. \u201cHow could DuPre work for the senator, and be part of the group ripping him to ribbons?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEither he\u2019s in the Church of Christ Arisen to spy for the senator, or he spies on the senator for the Church of Christ Arisen. I couldn\u2019t hear everything last night, but it sounded like he was making some under-the-table compromises with the oilmen,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSo\u2014there\u2019s that. And then there\u2019s the girl. She was terrified\u2014of something or someone\u2014according to Angela. And Angela wouldn\u2019t have said that if it weren\u2019t entirely true. And that concerns me. Have you heard about anything\u2014anything at all\u2014that had to do with suspicious disappearances and the Church of Christ Arisen?\u201d</p><p>Andy groaned. \u201cI know your girl\u2014Gabby\u2019s\u2014folks. They came to us. We had a car escort them to the place, but here\u2019s the thing. Constitution. That place has all the right paperwork. And the girl, Gabby, is eighteen. So when she said that she wanted to stay with the church and be left alone\u2014she had given herself to God, and DuPre, apparently\u2014there was nothing that we could do for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can do if the girl talks about the church\u2014and DuPre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can get a search warrant. But, come on, Jackson, you\u2019ve been in the law-enforcement game long enough, and on a federal level. What can I arrest one of those elders or priests or ministers or whatever for? Having consensual sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s statutory rape if the girls aren\u2019t old enough,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but you know that we can\u2019t just burst in and demand to know the ages of everyone living at the church or working there,\u201d Andy said.</p><p>\u201cIf I get the girl to talk\u2014that should allow for a warrant,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cYes, possibly, but it\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re saying that, since you don\u2019t even want the girl to know that we\u2019re trying to watch over her and her family,\u201d Andy reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously, since she\u2019s terrified, we\u2019re going to have to take it slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to warn the senator about the bastard right away?\u201d Devereaux demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and hesitated. Everyone\u2014except for Whitney\u2019s great-grandmother\u2014seemed to think that David Holloway walked on water. Now, Jackson wasn\u2019t so sure. But he didn\u2019t know how Devereaux would feel if he cast aspersions on Holloway.</p> <p>\u201cI want to explore a few possibilities before we report anything to Holloway.\u201d</p><p>Andy studied his face and nodded. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll play this your way. But this is my city. I\u2019ll bend over backward for you, Crow, but don\u2019t mess with me. This is my city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance I\u2019d mess with you Andy\u2014I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know if anything bad ever happened to any of the young women there. Have you had a chance to put together that list of missing women I asked you for? I\u2019d like to see it and learn the particulars. I need to know why Gabby Taylor is so terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a clerk on it right away. We\u2019ll find plenty of missing women, you know. Notifications about missing women from across the country come just like popcorn. Filtering them is going to be the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re looking for young women between the ages of thirteen and twenty-five, maybe as old as thirty, but I\u2019d say younger,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cOften, the younger, the more easily influenced, maybe unhappy with some aspect of their home life. Cult leaders can usually speak extremely well and they can sway those who are unhappy with themselves for one reason or another. A girl who feels she\u2019s been rejected, that her family doesn\u2019t understand her, or, perhaps, someone who has been floundering\u2014maybe failed out of school, that type of thing. Do some cross-referencing\u2014and see if you can find cases in particular where the parents felt they were losing the children; if they felt their daughters were girls who might have felt lost, alone, misunderstood. They might have been on drugs, though I don\u2019t think the victims targeted would have been thieves or dealers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll get the word out to all our precincts. This is different, I usually have a crime to solve. Now, I\u2019m looking for a crime that might have happened and a phantom girl out there somewhere. Hell, Jackson, you don\u2019t think we don\u2019t have enough crime in NOLA, we have to go looking for it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Andy. I\u2019ll get on the federal info systems as well, but I\u2019m looking for just about anything, and just about anything won\u2019t show up on the ViCAP system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they murdered someone at that church?\u201d Andy asked him. \u201cAren\u2019t we stretching it a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else, except the fear of a brutal death, would make a young woman so terrified in life? One more thing, Andy. Did anyone ever corroborate the whereabouts of Senator Holloway and his staff at the time of Regina\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the paperwork. They didn\u2019t need alibis. The coroner\u2019s office couldn\u2019t find the least sign of a struggle,\u201d Andy said. \u201cRegina Holloway was dead and buried when Senator Holloway started raising his questions. And he didn\u2019t bring in the police again. He called someone he knew up in Washington, you all came in, and the chief asked me to make sure you were given full cooperation. Maybe Senator Holloway will be able to accept his wife\u2019s death if someone will just say that a ghost caused her to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Andy. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go after their alibis now?\u201d Andy asked him.</p><p>Jackson said, \u201cI\u2019ll get my guys on it in a subtle manner first. If we hit any stone walls, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get anything on the Church of Christ Arisen, I\u2019ll be anxious to get a call, too.\u201d</p><p>Jackson thanked him and headed back to the house.</p><p>It was just after nine.</p><p>Angela hadn\u2019t been certain just how she was going to feel about the night when she woke up in the morning. She hadn\u2019t slept with another man since Griffin had died; she had never fallen into an intimate relationship easily. It was too...intimate.</p><p>And there was the fact that they were working together. She\u2019d never considered sleeping with a colleague before. But this had seemed...right. It had been what she had wanted.</p><p>And waking up, it seemed like something she wanted all the more. She wasn\u2019t sure where it would lead. And she wasn\u2019t even sure that their team would prove to be something that was viable and useful. That it would be continued after this assignment.</p><p>She lay awake for a while, aware that Jackson was gone. What next? She had become obsessed with law enforcement after Griffin had died; she couldn\u2019t fight disease, but it was possible to fight criminals. Sadly, though, talking with ghosts wasn\u2019t as easy.</p><p>But now...</p><p>That seemed all right. Taking the logical path and hoping that illogic would hop in to help was the right way to go.</p><p>She closed her eyes. The children in the room made sense.</p><p>Who the hell was the girl in the mirror?</p><p>She rose and headed back to her own bathroom. She showered there, creating whirls of steam, but the girl did not reappear in the mirror.</p><p>Had she imagined her? Maybe she was susceptible to imagination, too, just the same as anyone else.</p><p>Jackson had suggested she start reading the book on Madden C. Newton again.</p><p>Showered and changed, she headed back downstairs. She\u2019d left the book in one of the kitchen drawers.</p><p>Will was in the kitchen cooking breakfast with help from Jenna, who was slicing and dicing for him, while Jake set out glasses on the table. Just as Angela reached the kitchen, they heard a screech from the grand ballroom entry.</p><p>\u201cWhitney! What the hell?\u201d Jake said, hurrying out. Angela followed him, while Jenna and Will came running after her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d Jake demanded.</p><p>Whitney had just brought out a cushioned rocking chair to set before her bank of screens. She pointed to one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s in the basement again. It\u2019s in the basement!\u201d</p><p>They all stared at the screen. Something large and dark that filled the basement like a giant wave reaching over had appeared. It undulated and writhed, and seemed to darken.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s all get down there,\u201d Jenna suggested.</p><p>\u201cYep, great, let the big bad black thing eat us all up together!\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find out what it is,\u201d Whitney told him.</p><p>As she spoke, they all spun around, hearing the key twist in the lock. Jackson was back.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Whitney told him.</p><p>Jackson walked over to the screen. They turned back to it.</p><p>The black cresting shadow-wave was gone.</p><p>\u201cIt was there! We all saw it,\u201d Whitney said, irritated.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cMy old shadowy friend from before,\u201d said Angela.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Jake, come with me. Jenna, stay with Whitney on the screens...\u201d He paused. Then said, \u201cWhat the hell is that burning smell? Handle that, Will. And Angela...\u201d</p><p>His eyes touched hers, and she saw that he was hesitant about her.</p><p>Sleeping with the boss maybe wasn\u2019t such a great idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAngela, I\u2019m not sure we should bring you. If there is something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need to be with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold your hand.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a moment then, and despite the fact that not a flicker of emotion registered on his features at her quip, she almost smiled. He was weighing his feelings for her against the fact that it was important that they do what they had come to do. Yes, she was most vulnerable and susceptible. And, yes, that was both good and bad. He\u2019d been a good field commander, always, she thought. But he\u2019d also seen his coworkers dead in the field, and one way or another, the decisions he made were going to be hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she was right this time, and he knew.</p><p>\u201cOkay, young lady, give me your hand when we head down,\u201d he replied lightly.</p><p>None of it meant anything then. She, Jackson and Jake went down to the basement. But nothing seemed to be there, and though they waited, walking the perimeter, exploring various objects that had been stashed there, nothing happened. Calls to the crew at the screens to ask if there was anything on them brought disappointed and negative replies, and eventually they came back up.</p> <p>Despite Will\u2019s lament that his breakfast had been ruined, everything he had cooked tasted delicious, and when they complimented him, Jenna wanted them all to know that it had been her swift chopping and dicing at his commands that had made the omelets what they were.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the agenda?\u201d Jake asked Jackson.</p><p>\u201cGambling,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cCool. On Uncle Sam\u2019s dime?\u201d Whitney asked, pleased.</p><p>\u201cNo. On your own,\u201d Jackson said, laughing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll last about two minutes,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cThree of us will go. We need to chat up a few of the waitresses\u2014and the croupiers. I need to know if Grable Haines was really gambling all day when Regina died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at talking to the crowd at a craps table,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would be,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake laughed. \u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to people is a strong point. I meant what I said. Actually, though, I\u2019m going to take Jenna and Will to the casino. Jake, you\u2019re going to head back to the Church of Christ Arisen and appear to be really interested. Angela and Whitney, go back to the museum on Royal Street, and go through the new exhibit. It will have opened. See what else you can find out about the house and anything else that we don\u2019t know already about Madden C. Newton\u2019s reign of terror here.\u201d He hesitated, and then said, \u201cAngela, study all the pictures you see of any of the characters involved in Newton\u2019s day, all right? Oh, and no one comes home alone\u2014we\u2019ll meet at Caf\u00e9 du Monde at, say, 3:00 p.m.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all on it,\u201d Angela told him. \u201cWhitney, make sure that your cameras are set for while we\u2019re gone. I\u2019ll get everything cleaned up and we\u2019ll be out of here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t really have to handle it alone; they all hopped up to put the salt and pepper, hot sauce, ketchup, butter and jelly away. The dishes arrived scraped at the sink, and Angela quickly rinsed them for the dishwasher and scrubbed the few pans Will had used.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to see Jackson to know that he was near. He slipped an arm around her. \u201cAre you good?\u201d</p><p>She turned; they were alone in the kitchen. She had to grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m imagining that should be for you to judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold all I have to say on just how good for later. I mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regrets,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cBut besides that,\u201d he asked, dark blue eyes intently on her then, \u201clast night...whatever you saw in the mirror...anything else?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, and I actually tried this morning. I\u2019m sure you would have told me if there had been any kind of problem, but Gabby and her family are fine, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went and talked to Andy at the station this morning,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. But I\u2019m going to trust Andy Devereaux and the police to keep an eye on her. There\u2019s not much else I can do at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave the bastard arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. When we dig deep enough. But if murder is going to be among those charges, we have to play it all by the book.\u201d</p><p>The casino wasn\u2019t rampantly busy, but even at noon, the play for the day was heating up.</p><p>Jackson left Will and Jenna to walk around together and headed straight for the craps tables; Will would get into a poker game in the next few minutes, while Jenna would sit in for a few rounds of roulette and peruse the slots.</p><p>He found that there were three active craps tables, and he decided to play each of them. At the first, he struck up a conversation with one of the croupiers, and he talked about how much he loved the game, but remained a conservative player. He mentioned that he knew people who had gotten into trouble at craps. One of his was a local friend, who bet with bookies, but sure loved casinos as well. He described Grable Haines. He played that table for a while, hoping for a response, but none was forthcoming.</p><p>He bought a hot dog, and tried to engage the vendor in conversation to see if he knew anything, but the man behind the machine just looked at him blankly when he mentioned the senator\u2019s and Grable\u2019s names.</p><p>Before going to the second table, he worked a few slots and struck up conversations with a few of the cocktail waitresses. He tipped well, and they were happily chatty, and he finally found a girl who knew Grable, liked him a lot and was pretty sure she remembered the day that Regina Holloway had died; it had instantly been on the news.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think Grable was here. You might check at the craps table over there,\u201d the girl told him.</p><p>He started at the second table by playing it wild. Luckily, his ridiculous bets on playing the eleven all came in, so he was flush enough to keep up his chatter. And at that table, he struck gold again.</p><p>Though the croupiers were working, and certainly knew that their pit boss was near, they were fine with casual conversation. Necessary to keep up the camaraderie that kept folks gambling.</p><p>\u201cGrable?\u201d the croupier to his left said at his inquiry. \u201cYeah, hope he\u2019s doing okay. I haven\u2019t seen him in here since the day Senator Holloway\u2019s wife died. Nice guy, Grable. He was in here that day, all day, which I think really disturbed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean later, because he was playing and having a good time while the senator\u2019s wife was dying?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, poor fellow. He had been winning, too, I think,\u201d another one of the dealers added.</p><p>\u201cSad day, sad thing,\u201d Jackson agreed.</p><p>It was Jackson\u2019s turn for the dice; he played out a winning streak, and left the table. He saw Will sitting at a poker table, and nodded to him. Will finished out his game.</p><p>\u201cSo Grable\u2019s game is craps?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, and he was here just like he told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think he\u2019s clean?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cI do. Someone had to have had the time to get into the house and out of it. Regina died right at dusk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the coroner\u2019s report,\u201d Will said. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jackson agreed.</p><p>\u201cProbably no more than thirty minutes before Senator Holloway found her body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr...\u201d Jackson said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenator Holloway didn\u2019t find her body. He knew exactly where it was because he caused it to be there.\u201d</p><p>Angela was glad that she and Whitney had been chosen to go back and view the new exhibit at the museum\u2014not that they\u2019d had a chance to see any of the old exhibits, yet, really. It was an easy walk through the Vieux Carr\u00e9, and they window-shopped as they strolled to it, stopping at Community Coffee for a pecan-flavored roast of the day, and admiring some of the clothing and hats in boutiques, and the Blue Dog art by Rodrique as they passed the studio shop.</p><p>She had always loved walking in the city; the air of fading and decaying elegance was poignant and beautiful, and still a part of day-to-day life. Someone was always repairing something, and someone else was planting something beautiful to flow over a railing, flowering vines or other such visual treats.</p><p>They reached the museum and paid their entry. The silver-haired woman was there, and she was delighted to see Angela back. Angela and Whitney exchanged a few casual words with her while she extolled the virtues of the excellent if small museum.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see most of the museum already?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014it was like being in a film that was sped up ridiculously. Mostly, Jackson stared at the sign that said the new exhibit would open tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then we\u2019ll be real tourists,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>The first part of the exhibit was a display on the city when the French first arrived, and brought them through the great fire that raged through the city and brought down a huge percentage of the original architecture, a second fire that had been another kiss of death, and into the Spanish period, when most of the buildings still standing had been built. Crime had been high on the busy waterfront, with beggars, murderers and thieves haranguing those on ships as well as the wealthy landowners. The exhibit touched on the cruelties of the slave trade. One area focused on the legend of Madame and Dr. Lalaurie, who, according to oral tradition, had brutally operated on and tortured slaves, detaching and reattaching limbs, and leaving behind slaves incarcerated in a basement, whose screams for help created ghost legends. Those poor souls were only discovered after death. The exhibit had a disclaimer, reminding everyone that the story was oral legend.</p><p>Sex and scandal were not overlooked, even before they reached the new exhibit.</p><p>Models had been made of Gallatin Street, and Storyville. Long before the days of Storyville, Gallatin Street provided base, cheap pleasures for river men, sailors, and whoever dared wander there. But in 1897, Sidney Story, councilman and respected individual, became horrified by the amount of prostitution in the French Quarter and introduced a Control Measure. It didn\u2019t actually make a decent thing of prostitution, but it sent one of the world\u2019s oldest professions down to one section of the city. Prostitutes were banished to an area that was bordered by Basin, Iberville, St. Louis, and North Robertson streets. There, a new era of raunchy entertainment began. Small houses, or \u201ccribs,\u201d allowed for even cheaper entertainment. Larger houses and mansions allowed for a higher class of debauchery, and there, music began to play. The bordellos contributed to the development of Dixieland jazz. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poor Sidney Story must have been mortified when it became known as Storyville, which reigned supreme in sexual entertainment for twenty years, until the federal government decided that it was far too well-known\u2014and that it corrupted the soldiers and sailors based there. Storyville was closed, and now existed no more.</p><p>Moving on, Angela discovered that Abraham Lincoln, as a young man, had seen the slave markets in New Orleans, and some of what he had seen had cemented his determination that slaves must be freed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, he\u2019s known as our most psychic president,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cHe believed in destiny, and foretold his own death in a dream.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo we ever really foretell anything?\u201d Angela asked her. \u201cOr do we create our world ourselves with the way we view it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he created John Wilkes Booth in Ford\u2019s Theatre!\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Angela told her.</p><p>They entered the new exhibit, and the very first display there was on the Madden C. Newton house. They walked straight to the model of the home, as it had been when Madden C. Newton had carried out his reign of terror.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014the one ell is still divided here,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cWhen the house was built, that was actually a separate building.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the reasons all those people are shown marching on the house is that he didn\u2019t get rid of a corpse fast enough\u2014people smelled it, they figured out that he was responsible for the disappearances, and the police burst in on him,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord. It is amazing, how very, very bad human beings can be.\u201d</p><p>Angela walked over to read the page on the exhibit. There were drawings, and one photograph of Madden C. Newton in court. She had seen him in her dreams; of course, there had been a picture of him in the book she owned, so she might have sent the image to her imagination.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like any man,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cNot really. Look at his eyes. The bastard was demented,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>They both fell silent, reading, and then wandered apart in slightly different directions.</p> <p>\u201cHey! Come over here,\u201d Whitney said after a minute.</p><p>Angela walked over to her. The man\u2019s death warrant was on display, along with a newspaper sketch of his public execution\u2014a hanging.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cThe body was left to hang there for three days. No one knows exactly when he was cut down. There had been orders for the disposal in \u2018an unmarked grave purchased by the city,\u2019 but no one seems to have recorded the plot number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Angela agreed, walking over to read along with Whitney. \u201cYou would have thought that they might have burned the bastard alive and thrown his ashes to the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo medieval!\u201d Whitney said, laughing.</p><p>Angela walked back over to look at the model of the house, noting the difference in the architecture now, with the entire structure pulled together as one.</p><p>She went through the entire exhibit again, but it didn\u2019t give her anything new on Madden C. Newton. She saw pictures of many of his victims\u2014Matthew Brady and other photographers at work during the Civil War had made portraits common and possible by then. She was most touched by one certain portrait; it was that of a family, husband, wife, son and daughter.</p><p>She knew the children. They remained in her room.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s them, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Whitney was quiet for a minute. \u201cJenna is certain that you\u2014that you managed to release people from the basement when you found the skeleton of Nathaniel Petti under the floor. I wonder why the children can\u2019t move on. Their bodies were discovered long ago\u2014they were buried with their parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think they\u2019re trying to tell me what happened. But I\u2019m not sure if they mix up what happened to them with what happened to Regina. They want me to know something, and they just haven\u2019t managed to do it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so perplexed?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p><p>Angela turned to Whitney. She grimaced and decided that they had agreed just to say whatever they were thinking\u2014if one of them was slightly unhinged, certainly, they all were.</p><p>\u201cI saw another face in the room. When I was drying off after my shower, I looked in the mirror\u2014and there it was. A woman\u2019s face. I was hoping that maybe I\u2019d see who she might be while we were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, was she scary?\u201d Whitney asked. \u201cI\u2019d love to really see the way you do. There\u2019s something special about you\u2014it seems that specters want to be seen by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s endless fun. They tap on the shoulder, scare me to death and disappear!\u201d Angela said. She looked at the model of the house again, and then down the aisle at the extension of the exhibit. She felt that she should be seeing something here and now, but she didn\u2019t. She glanced at her watch. \u201cTime to meet up to head back, so it seems. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, starting ahead. Then she stopped suddenly, looking at the last bit of the exhibit, around the corner before the exit. \u201cOh!\u201d she said.</p><p>Angela walked around to join her.</p><p>On the wall, a black silhouette against white, was a simple scene of a hanging. Because of sound systems throughout, they could hear the sound of a rope scraping against a scaffold. The man at the end of the rope was Madden C. Newton; it was a giant cutout from a sketch they had seen earlier.</p><p>A sign above read: The Wages of Sin And Wicked Evil!</p><p>Madden C. Newton had deserved his death; in Angela\u2019s mind, he had deserved far worse.</p><p>But there was something about the silhouette on the wall and the sound piping through that was unnerving. As she stared at the wall, she almost expected the image to turn to her; she thought that she would see his eyes, the terrible eyes that she had seen in her dream.</p><p>In her mind, she could almost hear the children screaming again....</p><p>The children had found a certain justice; their killer had been caught, tried and executed. Yet they remained behind.</p><p>And the other woman, the one who had stared at her in the mirror...</p><p>She had looked through all the pictures. There was no image of that woman here.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d she said, and she left Whitney still staring at the wall, and hurried to the exit.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>When Jackson arrived with Will and Jenna at Caf\u00e9 du Monde, Jake Mallory was already at one of the outside tables, his long legs stretched before him. It wasn\u2019t busy, but there were people coming and going. A musician played out on the street, doing a decent rendition of a Billy Joel tune. Tourists walked by him, some dropping money in his open guitar case. Across the street, in front of Jackson Square, a girl painted in silver portrayed a statue, much to the amusement of a number of children gathered before her.</p><p>Cars moved along on Decatur Street, occasionally horns sounded with impatience.</p><p>Jake stood and waved, seeing Jackson. They came over to join him around the small circular table. Jake dragged another chair over so they would have room when Angela and Whitney arrived, and then plopped down again. A waiter was quickly there, and they ordered their cups of caf\u00e9 au lait or iced tea or coffee, along with two orders of beignets.</p><p>\u201cWell, this will be my third. I\u2019m imagining that I\u2019ll be a bit wired tonight,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go? You were back quickly,\u201d Jackson said. The weather was still pleasant. It would hold another month, maybe, and then the dead heat of summer would set in.</p><p>\u201cBadly,\u201d Jake said. \u201cSomeone there was onto me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI knocked at the church door, just like yesterday. A young woman answered\u2014another young one. I don\u2019t know how young. Too bad she wasn\u2019t obviously underage and pregnant; I could have called the cops. I started out saying that I\u2019d been in the day before, and that I was interested in the church. And before I knew it, a fellow in something like a friar\u2019s cape came out and told me that he knew my kind, I had Satan in my soul, and I wasn\u2019t for his church. I tried to argue with him, but I had the feeling he was armed beneath his cape\u2014and I wasn\u2019t. So I got out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting development,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThey may not have \u2018made\u2019 Jake,\u201d Jenna suggested. \u201cIt might all be over the fact that Gabby Taylor disappeared. I mean, they may not know anything about who he is\u2014but they may be suspicious of him because soon after he showed up, she disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jackson said. He slid his sunglasses down his nose; he could see that Angela and Whitney were walking down St. Ann Street toward Decatur; they would be with them any minute. He smiled, watching the two. So striking in their different ways, Angela a snow princess, and Whitney exotic with her honey skin and dark hair. They paused at the light, talking to one another, and he was pleased to see that they might have been friends since childhood, they seemed so comfortable together.</p><p>They were a team. A good team, he decided. For a minute, he felt an edge of fear. It was impossible not to remember his last team. Good people, also. Three of them dead.</p><p>They had to be vigilant at all times. They had to have one another\u2019s backs at all times, and they had to learn to trust one another, and no one else. Of course, no one came into this without knowing the risks. And still, he knew that he was responsible, and he wouldn\u2019t relive the past.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d</p><p>He started and looked at Will.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we ever going to get closer to Blake Conroy? Or, for that matter, what can we do about Martin DuPre and the Church of Christ Arisen?\u201d Will asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing in the world to do nothing. We could at least confront the senator with what we know and get the slimy bastard out of politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will, we will, all in good time,\u201d Jackson assured them.</p><p>He stood as the two women arrived, and they weaved their way through the other chairs and tables to reach them. As they sat, Whitney said, \u201cOh, that feels good. We\u2019ve been walking for hours now!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow was the exhibit?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>The waiter reappeared with their beignets and drinks, and took drinks orders from Angela and Whitney.</p> <p>\u201cDid you gain anything from the museum this time\u2014anything we hadn\u2019t known?\u201d Jenna asked, blowing at some of the sweet powdery sugar from the beignet that had fallen on her skirt.</p><p>\u201cWell, we gained a really creepy look at a picture of Newton\u2019s hanging,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we learned that no one knows what happened to his body,\u201d Angela said. \u201cIt was left hanging for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much like the pirate days. Hang the fellow, and gibbet him!\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s outlawed,\u201d Whitney said emphatically.</p> <p>Angela seemed thoughtful and pensive. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThey have an interesting model of the house as it was in the 1860s. And some photographs from the time or newspaper reprints of the photographs,\u201d Angela said. He looked at her, hoping there was more. \u201cI think it will help us, when we\u2019re working in the house in the future. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProductive,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe have an alibi for the chauffeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we really have an alibi for anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he was in on it with the senator, and the senator did throw his wife over the balcony,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why David Holloway would call us in to investigate what happened if he had been guilty in any way,\u201d Jenna said. She dusted her skirt again. \u201cMy Lord, these things are delicious, but that sugar is everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlow on it,\u201d Will teased. \u201cIt\u2019s just an illusion. It will vanish in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar doesn\u2019t really vanish,\u201d Jenna argued.</p><p>\u201cAnd dust motes are in the air whether we see them or not,\u201d Will told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, good God, you\u2019re not going to pull a rabbit out of my ear now or anything, are you?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no rabbit. I can produce a few other things if you like,\u201d Will told her. \u201cI\u2019ve worked many a horrible magic show with lights and projectors. It\u2019s far easier than you might imagine to create the illusion of magic.\u201d To prove his point, he reached into the air, and suddenly, there was a handkerchief in his hands.</p><p>He was good, Jackson thought.</p><p>Angela jerked forward suddenly in her chair, staring at Will.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a handkerchief. Clean, even,\u201d Will said.</p> <p>She grimaced, shaking her head. \u201cWhat if...what if Regina Holloway didn\u2019t commit suicide\u2014exactly. What if she saw something that got into her mind, that made her run out on the balcony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that the ghosts did kill her?\u201d Whitney asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cNo...I\u2019m saying, what if...well, we\u2019ve been talking about the Church of Christ Arisen. They use brainwashing techniques, really. So...oh, God, I\u2019m not even really sure of what I\u2019m saying. What if she was told over and over again about the ghosts, made to think that they weren\u2019t only real, but that they were vindictive. And what if some kind of illusion was used on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good theory, but she didn\u2019t go over that balcony of her own accord\u2014unless she managed to hurtle her own weight backwards,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jake suggested, \u201cshe was lured out to the balcony by that kind of trickery, except she was starting to catch on, or she saw something...and then she had to be helped.\u201d</p><p>The waiter arrived with the two cups of caf\u00e9 au lait for Angela and Whitney.</p><p>They all fell silent until Jackson had paid, and the waiter went away.</p><p>\u201cThat adds another element of the possible to the scenario,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people do amazing things to others by the power of suggestion. Let\u2019s face it, the house is big and old, and has an unbelievable history, and...maybe Regina even had a touch of the sixth sense herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ghosts in the bedroom never harmed Regina,\u201d she said with absolute certainty.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Jackson assured her. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, though. Perhaps she was inundated with tales about the house\u2014true tales, actually. It would take a staunch soul not to be a little afraid that there might be ghosts lurking there. And someone would know about the children who were murdered, and that Regina had just lost a child. It would have been easy to prey on her mind with subtle suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then something was done to convince her that there was the ghost of a child in the room. And that ghost lured her to the balcony,\u201d Angela said. \u201cBut how could someone have created an entire image in her mind that would do what they wanted it to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIllusion,\u201d Will said. \u201cSmoke and mirrors\u2014and projectors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing in the house. The police haven\u2019t found anything, and we haven\u2019t found anything at all,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve actually found a lot in the house,\u201d Whitney corrected.</p><p>Jake stared at her. \u201cThere\u2019s something else in the basement,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it. We\u2019ve all seen it on the screens. And it\u2019s real. It\u2019s something,\u201d she said with determination.</p><p>\u201cBack to the basement then,\u201d Jackson said, rising. \u201cEveryone finished?\u201d</p><p>Three hours later, filthy and exhausted, they stood together in the basement. They\u2019d tried digging.</p><p>They\u2019d all expected Angela to be some kind of a divining rod, but she just didn\u2019t have a sense of where another body could be. They had found nothing, though they had broken up a great deal of concrete.</p><p>The basement wasn\u2019t giving away any of its secrets.</p><p>Now resting on shovels or picks, they continued to watch her movements. Except for Jackson, who was sitting on the stairs at a slight remove.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cAngela, nothing?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>She had to laugh. \u201cWhitney, I wouldn\u2019t stand here as everyone dug and destroyed the flooring if I had something to say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that there is something down here!\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>No one argued with her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we need to give it a rest,\u201d Jake said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be going to bed with Bengay on our shoulders and backs if we don\u2019t quit for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Whitney said, defeated for the time. \u201cAll right, well, I\u2019m going to take a shower and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a remarkable plan,\u201d Will agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in on that one,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll dream up a solution.\u201d She smiled at Angela. \u201cOr maybe you will.\u201d</p><p>Angela lifted her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll try, guys. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Will said softly, putting a hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, the answers will come.\u201d</p><p>Jackson stood suddenly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for the shower, a night\u2019s sleep, and then I think I\u2019ll try a different angle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jenna asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe attic,\u201d he told her. \u201cJake, I\u2019m going to put you on the computer, following links for me. There\u2019s something fishy about Gabby Taylor, the Church of Christ Arisen and, of course, Martin DuPre. Check out social networking sites, too\u2014they probably have some social networking going, particularly since they\u2019re targeting kids\u2014Twitter or Facebook, or something. Andy Devereaux should have sent me some info by now, and following it up on a few of the federal sites can give us some more information that might be pertinent. For tonight, let\u2019s call it quits.\u201d</p><p>He started up the stairs for the kitchen. The others began to follow him, but Angela suddenly found herself unwilling to go. \u201cWait!\u201d she said.</p><p>They all looked back. \u201cI think\u2014I think that Whitney is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThe shadow...the shadow that everyone sees...it\u2019s not like...well, it\u2019s not like a ghost or an image or remnant, revenant...that we usually see or feel. It is something evil,\u201d Angela said. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve all said that it\u2019s different, but I mean really evil!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAgreed. I saw the film and I trust you all. But where does that lead us right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re looking for Madden C. Newton,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut he was hanged,\u201d Will said. \u201cI thought we were looking for more victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanged, but no one knows what happened to his body,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI think that his body is here. It makes sense. When did we see it coming after me? When it appeared that other souls were finally able to leave. The victims might have been waiting for one another, and Newton tried to keep them here, but the power of that kind of light is too strong. He couldn\u2019t. But maybe he\u2019s still trapped here, and that\u2019s the shadow of evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve been digging for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, frustrated.</p><p>Jackson walked back down the stairs and came over to her. He smiled, setting his hands on her shoulders, then wiping at a smudge on her cheek. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sleep on it and get back to it tomorrow. Right now, I think we should just all clean up and order pizza. We\u2019ll see what we can find in the meantime on the film.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Frustration filled her; she felt as if they were so close. But when she looked into his eyes, she knew that he was right. And she also knew that she wouldn\u2019t go through the night alone, worrying about that shadow of evil. She would be with him.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>He took her hand and they headed up the stairs to the kitchen. The others followed. \u201cShower,\u201d Will said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShower,\u201d Jenna agreed.</p><p>\u201cLong bath,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Long, long bath,\u201d Jake said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the pizza place down the street and order three pies, a meat, a veggie and a cheese?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask for delivery in an hour?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSay, an hour and a half,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>They parted to head to their respective rooms.</p> <p>\u201cAn hour and a half for delivery?\u201d Angela said to Jackson.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know me. I don\u2019t last that long,\u201d he teased.</p><p>They made it through the doorway into his chosen room before they started taking one another\u2019s clothing off, with little concern for subtlety. Jackson kissed Angela\u2019s lips while they were half in and half out of their shirts, and then pressed his lips against her collarbone.</p><p>She pressed her mouth against his shoulder. \u201cOh, ick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIck!\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cSpiderweb. I think I ate it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, come on, a little web won\u2019t kill you,\u201d he murmured in return, sliding his feet out of his shoes. He wrenched his way out of his tailored shirt, finding her mouth and heading in toward the bathroom as he did so. His dirty shirt fell to the floor along with hers. Their lips were still locked as he angled her toward the bathroom door, and into the handsomely restored room. He opened the large shower-stall door while she wiggled out of her sandals and sent her shirt and jeans down to the tile, grabbed him by the waistband and slid her fingers beneath his belt line, rubbing her fingertips along his abdomen as she worked his belt buckle. He shoved off his jeans, drew her to him and kissed her again, feeling the length of her body naked against him, and relishing the feeling while his sex rose swiftly to the arousal of her touch. The water steamed down, and they drew one another in and beneath it. The hot thunder of the pulsing water was deliciously sweet, and he just held her beneath it, his erection growing against her lower belly. They both reached for the soap. It fell to the floor, and they laughed breathlessly as they both reached to retrieve it, only to rise in one body locked once again. He came up the master, and stood her still while he lathered her, her skin becoming flush and slick beneath his ministrations. He pressed his lips to her breast, followed with the soap down her torso, and carefully knelt beneath the rampant spray, soaping her midriff, abdomen, navel, and down to her sex and between her legs, following the trail of the soap with his lips and the caress of his tongue. She gripped hard onto his shoulders, saying words incoherently against the force of the spray and nearly collapsing against him.</p><p>He rose slowly against her then, and her arms cradled his neck, and she tried to retrieve the soap from him. Her fingers slick and filled with friction, she began to bathe him in return, capturing his erection in her hands, and caressing it hard with the satiny fluid of the suds to create an urgently sensual tug and pull, meeting his mouth as she did so, then falling low against him as well and taking him into her mouth. Hunger shot through him like elemental electricity and he drew her up to him; they staggered together in the water for a moment, and he hiked her up against him, nearly slamming her against the tile wall, and as the heat and beat continued to rain down upon them, he raised her hips high around his and eased her down onto his sex, and the world seemed to take on the rampant beat of the water, swirling around them and into them like liquid fire. They moved swiftly together, and the need arising between them was equally urgent, and in a matter of minutes they were both clinging to one another as they climaxed violently, staggering against the tile then, and then laughing again as they tried to balance. Dirt and spiderwebs were gone, they rinsed off the sheen of the soap, and Jackson reached for the spray to stop it at last, and pull her into his arms for one last kiss with her body full against his, and still as hot as the spray of the water.</p><p>\u201cWe should get out before we trip and kill ourselves,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTrue. Very true. It won\u2019t be a good thing if the headlines read, Ghost-busting Team Heads Die in Tragic Sex Accident in Haunted House,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>They emerged, reaching for towels, and finding that they drew together again then, enveloped in the towels, drying one another.</p><p>\u201cWow. You were right, we could have had the pizza in ten minutes,\u201d he said, holding her close.</p><p>\u201cWell, speed does seem of the essence when you are facing death by slippery shower,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>She laughed at her own remark, and left her towel to fall behind as she headed out of the bathroom and toward the bed. She turned around to look at him, and she was natural, fluid in her movement, and so sensually easy with him. \u201cWant to risk death by four-poster?\u201d she teased.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always lived an at-risk life,\u201d he said, and followed her out, catching her up at the end of the bed and crashing down on it with her, swiftly stoking her arousal once more.</p><p>Later, he nudged her. \u201cPizza in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn five!\u201d she exclaimed, bolting out of bed. \u201cIt can\u2019t have gotten that late...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he protested, rising with her. \u201cI had a lot to prove after those cracks you made about me last night!\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at him, and raced through to the bathroom for a quick rinse-off, slipping by him before they could touch again.</p><p>The pizzas had arrived when Angela reached the kitchen with Jackson following behind her. Bottles of soda and a pitcher of iced tea were on the table, along with glasses, flatware, napkins, paper plates and a bowl of salad. They all slid into their seats.</p><p>\u201cWe really need to figure this out,\u201d Whitney said, dishing salad into paper bowls and passing them down. \u201cI\u2019ve been rerunning film from the basement. From the time we were down there, digging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on the film?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, us, of course. And the shadow. It seems to lurk by the far side of the twist in the ell\u2014leading to your rooms above, and somewhere here, in the kitchen area,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take a look when we\u2019re finished here,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI think that Angela has to be right. Someone must have brought the body back here to bury in the house,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cBut it makes sense,\u201d Angela said quietly. \u201cOne totally psychotic killer\u2019s body missing, and something in this house that just won\u2019t go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have brought him back here?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cThe answers might be in your book, Angela. At least, the answers to the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read the book now, over and over. It\u2019s really just gory imaginings about the murders,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI still have a log-on for Tulane, though. I can start looking back into some of the newspaper accounts from the day, and I can go back to the museum and go through their archives. Jake, hand me a piece with all the peppers and veggies on it, please.\u201d</p><p>Jake did so. For a few minutes, food traveled around the table, and was consumed, and they all commented on the fact that either the pizzas were really good, or they were really hungry.</p><p>When they finished, they quickly disposed of the boxes and paper plates, and headed down to the grand ballroom where Whitney reran the film. She sped through some, as they had been in the basement for a long time. But then she slowed the film. \u201cHere,\u201d she said.</p><p>It did appear that there was something dark rising in the room. Shadows formed along the baseboards, rising in jerking motion here and there around them, but falling again as someone spoke, raising a pick or a shovel, or moved back to one another.</p><p>\u201cHe was really a coward,\u201d Jackson said quietly. \u201cIn life, he was a coward. He had to isolate and control his victims. With an entire family, he had to separate the children from the parents, and he had to tie up the parents one by one because he couldn\u2019t control more than one person at a time.\u201d</p><p>He looked at them. \u201cThat\u2019s often the case with a serial killer. He gets his sense of power from disabling his victims. He makes sure that they\u2019re drugged or unconscious or securely tied up or shackled, and then he has the power. Life or death, except, of course, the end will bring death. That\u2019s why we saw the shadows rising over Angela when she was alone\u2014and we see them rising and falling now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean that he might have terrified Regina Holloway, and that we might be wrong about a killer in the house with her?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>Frowning, Jackson shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think that the force needed to send her over could have possibly happened because of a ghost\u2014or even fear of a ghost. We\u2019re still looking at two different situations. What we have to do is discover the link.\u201d He rose. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take turn manning the camera overnight again,\u201d Will told him.</p><p>\u201cTwo and two,\u201d Jackson said firmly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Whitney, how about you and me on the first shift. Jenna and Will can take over at first light, and then we get to sleep until noon?\u201d Jake suggested.</p><p>\u201cReverse it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you on the computer tomorrow morning,\u201d Jackson told Jake.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, boss,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWait, I should be taking a turn at this,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>But Jake came to her and set an arm around her. \u201cOh, no. You old folks need your rest. We\u2019re fine on this detail. Go to sleep. You\u2019re our divining rod, Angela, remember? And Jackson is our mighty leader. Go on. Get some sleep. We can handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, kiddies, good night,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jackson bid them good-night as well, and they headed back up the stairs together.</p><p>\u201cThey know we\u2019re sleeping together,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cProbably. I like to think that Adam didn\u2019t bring stupid people into our fold,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>She looked at him and smiled, and wondered how life could change so entirely and so quickly. But it had changed. And she knew that what she was sharing with Jackson was far more than the sexual attraction that was so strong, and seemed to be so natural and so easy. Maybe they were just a bit broken inside by the blows life had dealt them, and maybe that was just right. Maybe they were destined to heal together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that night, her sleep was disrupted by dreams. Scattered dreams and nightmares.</p><p>She saw herself walking down a long hall. There were doorways along the hall, and though she didn\u2019t want to open them, she had to.</p><p>The first doorway led to Regina Holloway\u2019s room. She saw the children, playing with their jacks on the floor.</p> <p>Young Percy looked up at her. \u201cI wanted to help the nice lady. Honestly. I wanted to help the nice lady. I knew what they did with the one before her. I saw what they did.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed shut, and she was impelled to keep walking.</p><p>She saw her hand as she turned the knob to the next room. When she opened that door, she saw Madden C. Newton. He looked at her; looked her straight in the eyes. He smiled slowly, knowing that she knew he saw her. \u201cEvil begets evil,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He turned. There was an ax in his hand. Blood dripped from the blade to the floor. \u201cCome closer, Angela. Come see what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door; she didn\u2019t want to see.</p> <p>As she walked down the hallway, knowing that she would have to open another door, she heard Will\u2019s voice repeating the words he had said when they were at Caf\u00e9 du Monde.</p><p>\u201cIllusion. Smoke and mirrors. Smoke and mirrors.\u201d</p><p>She opened the next door.</p><p>She saw Madden C. Newton again, the ax in his hand. This time, the mutilated corpses of the children lay at his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard, you\u2019re dead,\u201d she told him.</p><p>And he started to laugh, a gleeful laugh. \u201cEvil never dies,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey say that it\u2019s love, but I tell you, it\u2019s evil that never dies. It follows me, and I live while the evil lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvil can die, and it will,\u201d she told him, but she was in the hallway, and he was in the room, and somehow, she could speak bravely because he was captured in the room. It wasn\u2019t the bedroom. It wasn\u2019t the basement. It was somewhere in-between.</p><p>But even as she spoke, fear slipped into her. She had been a cop; she was an agent.</p><p>But you couldn\u2019t shoot and kill a ghost.</p><p>She froze within her dream; a scream caught in her throat. There was someone behind her. She turned quickly, thinking there was no escape from the being in the hallway because she couldn\u2019t go into the room.</p><p>But when she turned, it was the girl. The girl she had seen in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cHe lets it live,\u201d she said. \u201cHe lets it live, and the evil is alive. Help me. God help us all.\u201d</p><p>Angela jackknifed to a sitting position, forcing herself to wake, forcing the dream to fade away.</p><p>Jackson\u2019s arm swept around her instantly, pulling her to him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She was shivering, and she couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cHe\u2019s here. He\u2019s in this house, and we have to find him, we have to stop him before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore he stops us.\u201d</p><p>Jackson sat with Jake in the kitchen, following various sites regarding missing young women, and cross-referencing them with inquiries that had come into the NOLA police stations.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d Jake asked, pointing to one of the pages he had just brought up. \u201cSusanne Crimshaw, twenty-one. Last seen three months ago at her home in Grand Biloxi. She had a fight with her mom, and took off to meet up with friends in New Orleans, but the friends claim they never saw her. She withdrew a thousand dollars from her bank the day she left. There\u2019s no credit card trail on her after that, and her mother didn\u2019t report her missing until she\u2019d been gone a week, since they\u2019d argued, and Susanne left for her trip. Since she was twenty-one, and not speaking to her mom, the mother didn\u2019t realize she was missing until she didn\u2019t come home\u2014and the friends reported that they hadn\u2019t seen her, and figured that she\u2019d decided just not to come.\u201d</p><p>Jackson jotted down the case number, and they went back to work.</p><p>A Lettie Hughes had been reported missing the week before Susanne Crimshaw, but a follow-up report stated that she\u2019d been found living with a junkie in Slidell. Shelley Dumont had disappeared, but her body had been discovered near the south side of Lake Pontchartrain; she had been shot in the back of the head, and her boyfriend had admitted they\u2019d been involved in a drug deal gone bad.</p><p>They went through three more cases, and finally wrote down the names of Susanne Crimshaw and June Leven. June had now been missing four months. She had left New York City for Los Angeles to go to school out there. Due to a scandal at her college\u2014a professor she\u2019d been sleeping with had been arrested for statutory rape\u2014her name had been in the papers, she had left town a marked woman, and her mother had received one postcard from her\u2014postmarked from New Orleans\u2014saying that she was miraculously on the road to recovery, and all would be well. She told her parents not to look for her.</p><p>Jackson pulled out his phone and put a call through to Andy Devereaux, gave him the case numbers and asked him if anything else had been discovered about either girl.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both still MIA,\u201d Andy told him. \u201cWe had the pictures out on the media and in the newspaper, and received zero response. The patrol officers have all this, too, so if they saw them partying on Bourbon, we would have heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they recognized them, of course,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Want me to put out a bulletin again on these two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would deeply appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Jake looked at him. \u201cDid you see either of these girls when you were in the Church of Christ Arisen?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Jake shook his head and asked, \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>Angela came down as they were talking. She started to pour a cup of coffee, glanced over to where they were sitting, and at the picture up on the computer screen.</p><p>She dropped her cup and the coffeepot. Both shattered, but she didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>Jackson and Jake leaped up. Jake pulled her away from the shattered glass. Jackson quickly ran his eyes and then his hands over the bottoms of her jean-clad legs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even seem to notice them. She stared at the computer screen. She pointed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>Jackson looked back at the computer. The picture of Susanne Crimshaw was up on the screen. She was a pretty young woman with a generous mouth, wide green eyes and tawny hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her. That\u2019s the face in the mirror. She looks back at me, then decays and rots and becomes bone.\u201d She looked at them both. \u201cShe\u2019s here. She\u2019s here somewhere in the house.\u201d</p><p>Before either of them could reply to that comment, Jenna came running into the kitchen. \u201cCome\u2014come here quickly, all of you!\u201d</p><p>Jackson grasped Angela\u2019s arm and they ran after Jenna. She led them up the stairs and she drew them all to her window.</p><p>From that vantage point, they could see the house next door, and, by craning, the front of the house.</p><p>At first, Jackson had no idea what she was talking about. And then, by twisting his neck and leaning, he could see.</p><p>Blake Conroy had just exited a car in front of the house next door. He looked around nervously, shifting the brim of his baseball cap back and forth, and then hurried to the gate, opened it and walked up the steps to the porch. He twisted a key in the lock, looked around once again.</p><p>And went into the house.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on the front door, and the house,\u201d Jackson said briskly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, and then what?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>Jackson hurried down the stairs and to the computer. He keyed in the address of the house next door. It was owned by a business called Central Marketing. He keyed in Central Marketing and discovered that the business was a DBA of a company called H Family Associates. H Family Associates proved to be part of Genesis Urban Renewal, a parent company that had David Holloway as its CEO.</p><p>Jackson stared at the screen for several minutes. He ran up the stairs and to his room, slipped into his shoulder holster and took his service Glock from the bedside drawer. He slipped his jacket over his holster and the gun, and walked back to the hallway and called up to Jenna, Jake and Angela. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Angela appeared at the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pay a visit. Keep a lookout.\u201d</p><p>Angela nodded, and hurried back.</p><p>He exited the house, careful to lock the door behind him. And when he walked up to the neighboring house, he found that the man who had just entered had been careful enough to lock his door, too.</p><p>Jackson opted for a walk around the house.</p><p>It was a shotgun house\u2014built long, with a front door and a back door that were in one even line, a technique that allowed for ventilation in the days before air-conditioning. A second story had been built on the rear portion of the older facade.</p><p>The back door he found was locked as well. He heard a sound behind him and instinctively set his hand in his jacket for his weapon.</p><p>\u201cStop right where you are!\u201d a voice warned. \u201cHands clear from your pockets. Let me see them! Let me see them now!\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to be taken in such a manner; he drew his Glock as he turned.</p><p>He was facing Blake Conroy, who had a Smith &amp; Wesson drawn on him.</p><p>\u201cLooks like an impasse,\u201d Conroy said, eyeing him narrowly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so!\u201d came a shout.</p><p>Both men looked up. Angela had the window to the Newton house open, her service weapon trained on Conroy. Jake was at her side.</p><p>Conroy began to swear. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Crow?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cTrying to find out what you\u2019re doing in the house next door. Managed by a company that is, in actuality, David Holloway\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Conroy\u2019s big, florid face became a serious shade of red and he lowered his gun.</p><p>\u201cHolloway doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d Jackson demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not at liberty to say.\u201d</p><p>Jackson spun around as he heard the door open behind him. To his astonishment, Lisa Drummond, David Holloway\u2019s secretary, stepped out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust tell him the truth, Blake. This is getting ridiculous,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cPlease, please, please, everyone. Put the guns down.\u201d</p><p>Jackson ignored the request. \u201cWho else is in there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2014I swear,\u201d Lisa said.</p> <p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBlake, hand over the weapon. Then both of you step ahead of me, and we\u2019ll walk on over to the Newton house and have a little chat. I like the idea of everyone telling the truth, Miss Drummond. I think that will be refreshing.\u201d</p><p>Conroy started to slide his Smith &amp; Wesson into his shoulder holster.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Hand it over,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI have a permit,\u201d Blake told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care. Hand it over.\u201d</p> <p>Blake tossed the gun to the ground at Jackson\u2019s feet. Jackson reached down to retrieve it, never taking his eyes off him.</p><p>\u201cGo. Angela?\u201d he called, not looking up.</p><p>\u201cWill is at the front,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Jackson ordered.</p><p>The two of them went ahead of him to the house. Will already had the door open. He backed away so that the couple could enter in front of Jackson.</p><p>Angela was down the stairs by then, and she still had her pistol aimed and ready.</p> <p>\u201cBlake, I\u2019m sure you know your firearms. Angela carries a Smith &amp; Wesson SD9 pistol, and so you know that she has a sixteen-plus-one capacity. She may look like an angel, but that\u2019s a gun that means business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to pull anything,\u201d Blake said irritably. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, and I\u2019ve told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what the hell is going on?\u201d Jackson demanded.</p><p>Blake glanced at Lisa, who again seemed to explode with a combination of nervousness and fear.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, it\u2019s nothing underhanded. It\u2019s just...oh, Lord! We\u2019re having an affair, you idiots. It\u2019s nothing more than that. We\u2019re just keeping it secret because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a born-again Christian? Isn\u2019t that...just wrong? Premarital sex?\u201d Jackson asked Blake.</p><p>Blake looked away. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. We love each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. The rules apply when they work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe had been sleeping with the boss,\u201d Blake said. \u201cBefore she learned the truth and goodness in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom you, of course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not adultery when she\u2019s with me,\u201d Blake said quietly.</p><p>Lisa looked at Jackson and didn\u2019t seem quite as nervous. \u201cYes, and you knew I\u2019d slept with David. I could see that you knew it when you were in the office. But it ended. It ended when Regina died, but, still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t tell him,\u201d Blake said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t tell him because we didn\u2019t know how he would feel.\u201d</p><p>Angela hadn\u2019t put the gun down yet.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014so you two meet each other in a house next to this one?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lisa asked wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s where I used to meet David. He said it was best to carry on in plain sight. He said that we could be in the house on business if we were ever seen\u2014the house is up for sale. And he could keep an eye on Regina from here. Oh, God, it was wrong, I know it! But he needed someone. He needed someone desperately, because she didn\u2019t care anymore. All she had cared about was that kid. David told me that she was shattered. He said that he couldn\u2019t stay married to her, but that he couldn\u2019t leave her when she was so badly hurting. He couldn\u2019t stand the pain, but he couldn\u2019t leave her alone. He could never really be with her again. But then, she died, and suddenly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuddenly?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Lisa shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him anymore. He said that he\u2019d never come back in this house. He asked me to wait, and I didn\u2019t tell him that I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jackson asked her.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said. She looked over at Blake. \u201cBecause I was scared,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>Life really could be construed as the art of illusion by some people. Angela and the others sat around the table with Blake Conroy and Lisa Drummond, listening, and trying to make sense out of what they heard.</p><p>\u201cAll right, when did you start to see David Holloway as something other than your boss?\u201d Jackson asked her.</p><p>\u201cAbout two months after his son died. His holding company has actually owned the house next door for several years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jackson demanded sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s no information on the senator\u2019s holding company in his file, and the police didn\u2019t mention it. You\u2019d think they would have, seeing as the house is next door to the house where Regina died!\u201d</p><p>Lisa looked surprised, and then concerned. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a company owned by a company, and I think there are other investors. The senator always wanted that kind of business interest kept quiet. Oh, it\u2019s not illegal at all! It\u2019s just all wrapped up in a lot of DBAs\u2014doing business as, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s illegal if he conceals his financial matters,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t relevant to Regina\u2019s death!\u201d Lisa protested. \u201cIf Senator Holloway had thought that the police needed to know, of course he would have mentioned it! It\u2019s a moneymaker\u2014they rent it to groups, and, recently, with all the film activity in New Orleans, they rent out to movie and television producers as well. He asked me to meet him there one afternoon, and it was actually very innocent, I was just going to pick up some papers. But he was so down! He said that he liked being here because he was near Regina, in case she should need him, but then, he started crying, and he told me that she didn\u2019t need or want him, no matter how he tried. She wanted their son back, and that was all that she wanted in the world. I guess it was my fault. I was just trying to comfort him, and one thing led to another, and...we started seeing one another,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cBut then you stopped.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhen Regina died, like I said. He\u2019d been at the office that day. When I saw him again, it was as if he\u2019d never really known me. I think, in his own mind, he tried to pretend that it had never happened.\u201d</p><p>Blake cleared his throat. \u201cI have loved Lisa from the moment I first saw her. And I didn\u2019t know about the affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one in the office\u2014or anywhere\u2014knew at first. And to this day, Blake only knows because I told him about it,\u201d Lisa said.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m lost now. Why are you afraid?\u201d Angela demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I afraid?\u201d Lisa asked. \u201cRegina is dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that affect you? I\u2019d think that\u2019d be a plus. Or is it that you think David killed her himself?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cI know that this house is strange. David became strange when he bought the place and stranger still as he spent more time in it. Once upon a time, he was a good politician. He was moderate, thoughtful, careful\u2014brilliant. I loved working for him. I believed in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t now?\u201d Jackson asked her.</p><p>She swallowed a sip of tea from the glass that Jenna had provided to her. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing I can put my finger on, but...I\u2019m scared. David became obsessed with losing her. He\u2019s handed a lot of his work and his business over to Martin DuPre, and I\u2019m not at all certain that Martin is serving his best interests, but when I try to point something out to him, he just ignores me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both go to work. We do what we do,\u201d Blake said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t tell him about us because he\u2019s ridiculously fragile right now. I know that when Regina died, he suddenly called Grable Haines into the office and told him to take the money he needed. Grable was shaken up because he said that the senator was so weird that he wouldn\u2019t have taken the money if he hadn\u2019t been desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get back to the office,\u201d Lisa said nervously.</p><p>\u201cAnd I need to get back, too,\u201d Blake said. \u201cThe senator said that he was locking up from noon until 2:00 p.m. for a break, but it\u2019s nearly two now.\u201d</p><p>Lisa looked at Jackson earnestly. \u201cWe want to get married, Blake and me. I\u2019m joining his church. When the time is right, we\u2019re going to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest. Neither of us feels that we can leave him in the lurch,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>Jackson leaned toward Blake and asked, \u201cWhy were you at the meeting of the Aryans?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat one was David Holloway, I swear. He wanted me to see what they were about, and who they were complaining about. I even talked to you when I was there!\u201d he said to Jake and Jenna.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you might have noticed\u2014talking doesn\u2019t always answer every question, does it?\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve told you what I know at every point when you talked to me,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>Lisa looked at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them about me, did you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, glancing at Jackson and looking a little uncomfortable. \u201cI mean, you know\u2014no. I never said that Holloway had been engaged in an affair with his secretary, or, she with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have to go back to work, go back to work,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut let me make a suggestion. Lisa, you should just tell Holloway that you two are seeing one another and planning on getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we should,\u201d Lisa said, looking at Blake.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right time,\u201d Blake said. \u201cI know you\u2019re still suspicious of me\u2014you have to be. I am the man\u2019s bodyguard. But I was at that meeting of the Aryans because the senator sent me. I swear it. I swear before God. He\u2019s paranoid. He brought you down here because no matter what he says, he\u2019s afraid of ghosts, and he\u2019s afraid of everyone around him.\u201d</p><p>Jackson listened to Blake gravely. \u201cAll right, then. Wait. But don\u2019t you think it might be worse if he finds out later, or by accident?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think he needs to find some peace. I think he needs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he needs to believe that he didn\u2019t cause his wife\u2019s death,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want to be caught like this. We have to go back now.\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded, lifting his hands. \u201cBy all means, return to work.\u201d</p> <p>Jenna rose. \u201cI\u2019ll see you out,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOne at a time, if you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll get the car out of here first,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cI walk back,\u201d Lisa told them.</p><p>No one said goodbye and no one spoke until Jenna returned to the kitchen. \u201cThey\u2019re out. We\u2019re locked,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was intriguing,\u201d Whitney said at last.</p> <p>\u201cVery,\u201d Jackson agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo, Senator Holloway was having an affair,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cActually, that\u2019s not half as important as the fact that Senator David Holloway owns the house right next door to this one\u2014and that he has, for years,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cBut what does it mean?\u201d Jake mused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. It may mean nothing, and it may put us back to square one. Or worse. Now we have the Aryans, the Church of Christ Arisen, a mistress, a bodyguard, a chauffeur\u2014and an aide we know to be a lying lech, if not something much worse,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI say we have to take down Martin DuPre. If we do something about him, the rest of the charade that is the senator may start to crumble,\u201d Jake said.</p> <p>Jackson looked at Angela. \u201cWe have to talk to Gabby Taylor. She\u2019s home now. I believe that what is going on at the Church of Christ Arisen might lead us to the answers.\u201d He hesitated a moment, and then grimaced. \u201cWe need to keep making every effort to discover what we can in the house, but I think we also have to concentrate heavily on the church. The girl was terrified of what they\u2019d do to her if they found her, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to be that hard to find. You\u2019re the one who befriended her. I need you, and I need you now, no matter how you feel that you\u2019re treading on a fragile young woman.\u201d</p><p>Angela winced, but nodded. \u201cOkay, so what are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill and Whitney, stay on the cameras. We need to be watching closely for anything that\u2019s going on in the house while we continue investigating other leads. Jenna and Jake, I need you to go back to the Aryans\u2014find out if Blake has anything to do with their membership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGag, vomit,\u201d Jenna said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work,\u201d Jake told her. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. It\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re whiter than the driven snow.\u201d</p><p>She cast him an evil glance. \u201cAll right, come on. We\u2019ll be able to find an address on the internet and if not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give Andy Devereaux a call. He\u2019ll find an address for you. And tell him I\u2019ll be talking to him later in the afternoon.\u201d He rose as well. \u201cI think that whether we\u2019re really getting to the truth or not, people will believe that we\u2019re getting close, and that could make them dangerous. Lethal. Right now, if the senator is as off his game as Blake says, he\u2019s not paying attention, and putting his life and his platform into the hands of Martin DuPre. Gabby Taylor could be in serious danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think that they kill young women who leave the fold\u2014and might talk?\u201d Jake asked him.</p> <p>Jackson said, \u201cI think that Gabby\u2019s fear says something. There are always going to be missing young women. Some will be runaways. And some will be cultists. And some will be dead. Come on, Angela, we\u2019re going to take a ride.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe know that they\u2019re killing young women. We know it. I\u2019ve seen one in the mirror,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>The Taylor home was a modest ranch, built in Metairie sometime in the 1940s, Angela thought. They had Jake\u2019s car\u2014he and Jenna were walking to the Aryans headquarters, discovered to be in the CBD, not far from the senator\u2019s home office.</p><p>\u201cShould we have asked Andy to send an officer with us\u2014or better yet, come along as well?\u201d Angela asked Jackson.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf we can get her to tell us something, we\u2019ll have enough so that the police can bring DuPre in,\u201d he said. \u201cAndy has patrol cars watching the house, and I let him know that we were coming by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. They may not let us in at all,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t know until we try,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Angela needn\u2019t have been worried. She raised her hand to knock at the door, and the door swung open. A slim woman with whitening platinum hair and a kind face threw her arms around Angela. \u201cThank you! Thank you so much! You brought our baby home to us! Gabby told us all about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re strangling her,\u201d Gabby said, coming out from behind her mother. She smiled at Angela. She already looked like another woman. The look of absolute dejection was gone from her face, and she was prettier than ever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine, and I\u2019m so happy to see that you\u2019re all doing so well,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cIs that her?\u201d came a booming male voice.</p><p>\u201cAngela, this is my mom, Ellie, and that\u2019s my dad, Sam,\u201d Gabby said.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Jackson Crow,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cPleasure,\u201d Jackson told them both.</p><p>\u201cGreat to meet you,\u201d Sam Taylor said. He was tall and thin, too, and his face was haggard. Angela imagined he had suffered badly over the loss of his daughter. \u201cWe can never thank you enough. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Gabby said.</p><p>\u201cIf there were only some way we could help you! We had a reward offered\u2014\u201d Ellie began.</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Jackson said with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re actually government employees\u2014your tax dollars at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to make sure that everything was all right,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Sam dragged his daughter into a hug. \u201cOur girl is back with us. What could be wrong?\u201d</p><p>A look of dismay and fear flashed across Gabby\u2019s face, but it was quickly gone. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on vacation, tonight!\u201d Ellie said. \u201cGabby wants to get away for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Jackson looked at them all. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gabby lost her poise; it looked as if she might have fallen, had she not been in her father\u2019s firm grip.</p><p>\u201cGabby, we have to get that church shut down. There\u2019s something very bad going on there, and you know it,\u201d Angela said quietly.</p><p>\u201cMay we sit?\u201d Jackson asked Sam.</p><p>\u201cMy girl just wants to get away from it all,\u201d Sam shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShe is afraid of people involved with that church,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe need her help. Desperately. Mr. Taylor, don\u2019t you want other girls to go home, too?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t prove anything. I can\u2019t really give you anything that will help. And if you know things and go into that church, they\u2019ll know that you learned about them from me,\u201d Gabby said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit. Please. I\u2019ll get some nice iced tea,\u201d Ellie said. She was obviously distressed, but she was a consummate hostess, and she seemed to realize that something worse could happen to her daughter now.</p><p>When they were seated in the pleasant family room and tea had been served, Gabby glanced uncomfortably at her father. \u201cThey really don\u2019t want to hear a lot of details,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t need to tell us any,\u201d Angela assured her.</p><p>\u201cWe just need to know about other people who were there. Other people who were there\u2014and then disappeared,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cGabby, how did you wind up being involved with the church?\u201d Angela asked her softly.</p><p>The girl\u2019s breathing quickened and she glanced at her mother, flushing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Gabby. You\u2019re home now,\u201d her mother said, her voice filled with tremulous affection.</p><p>Gabby looked at Angela. \u201cOh, that was easy enough,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI was with some friends on the riverfront one day, and we\u2019d been doing a lot of smoking. Weed, grass, you know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know the terms,\u201d Angela said, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom,\u201d Gabby said.</p><p>Her mother patted her knee. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jackson needs to know everything you told me, and anything at all you can think of that might help,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I saw him\u2014as if he were walking right out of the light! He was so\u2014holy. He started talking to me, and he told me to come to the church and see him. And all night, all I could remember was the way he\u2019d talked to me. And that light he\u2019d had around him. When he spoke, his voice was musical. He was...amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you went to the church.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, shaking her head. \u201cOnce I was there, nothing else mattered. We were in a group discussion one night and he looked at me. And he told me that my time was coming. That night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. His words filled my mind.\u201d She hesitated again. It had to be hard for her.</p><p>Her mother squeezed her hand.</p><p>Gabby looked at Angela and Jackson again. \u201cThere was a knock on the door, and it was one of the older girls, and she said that he had been expecting me, but I hadn\u2019t come to him. She said that I was privileged...I would be one of his wives. I kept seeing his face and hearing his voice, and when I went to his room, he was waiting for me. Naked. And then...well, it wasn\u2019t every night. He has other\u2014wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t jealous?\u201d Jackson asked her softly.</p><p>She studied his face and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. I don\u2019t know. He taught me that it was right, that I was a holy vessel, and that he was chosen, and that made me chosen.\u201d</p><p>Brainwashing. Mind control. He seemed to appear in light.</p><p>\u201cThere are others in danger out there, Gabby. Two women disappeared, one was named Susanne Crimshaw, and the other June Leven.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angela could see that Gabby recognized the names. \u201cThey were there,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell us anything about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune...June felt that she had sinned terribly, and hurt everyone around her,\u201d Gabby said. \u201cShe came into the church so hopeful. She was really beautiful. She had dark hair and bright, bright green eyes. And we knew that she was destined to be special. But one of the council members came and took her one night, and I never saw her again. And then...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo on, Gabby, please?\u201d Angela prodded. \u201cWhat about Susanne?\u201d</p><p>Gabby nodded. She grew whiter still. \u201cI heard her scream. And he said that Satan came from those who didn\u2019t give themselves totally over to God and the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe. He who, Gabby?\u201d Jackson asked. Angela saw that Jackson actually looked a little perplexed. \u201cRichard Gull? The bishop of the church?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cA friend of ours went into the church the other day. You must remember him. A tall, good-looking young fellow. He told me there was a picture on the wall, a big one, of a man named Richard Gull, who is the bishop.\u201d</p> <p>Gabby shook her head. \u201cRichard Gull is a saint now. He died years ago. That\u2019s what they told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGull is dead? The police don\u2019t know that,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cLegally, he\u2019s still listed as the head of the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe church has a bishop, and he\u2019s the one who is in control of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is Martin DuPre\u2014the man you were following the other night\u2014the bishop now?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cMartin DuPre\u2014he\u2019s Senator Holloway\u2019s aide, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Sam Taylor demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jackson said grimly. \u201cGabby, please go on. Is he the bishop now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2014he\u2019s just the bishop,\u201d Gabby said.</p><p>\u201cGabby, is he the man you were following the other night?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>She nodded solemnly. \u201cHe\u2019s the one,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jackson stood up. \u201cWe do need to get your family out of here, Mr. Taylor. And I\u2019d like it to be now\u2014not later. I think we\u2019ve been lucky that no attack has been made on Gabby yet, but I believe that the police have been careful, watching the house. I\u2019m going to call Detective Devereaux now and someone in the federal government. We\u2019re going to get you out in a private plane, so there will be no paper trail.</p><p>\u201cYou heard a young woman scream, and that young woman disappeared,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cGabby, for your own life, and for the life of your baby, you have to be strong.\u201d</p><p>Gabby buried her head against her mother\u2019s shoulder. Ellie looked helplessly at Angela.</p><p>Angela looked at Jackson. \u201cEverything is going to be fine,\u201d she told Ellie.</p><p>Whitney stretched and yawned, then blinked furiously. She looked over at Will, who was glued to the screens as if he was in a trance.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all when Angela isn\u2019t here,\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe seems to tap into something.</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you think that is?\u201d Will continued. \u201cFor one thing, why would a ghost only appear at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t like a lot of activity. Maybe there\u2019s so much commotion during the day, that they don\u2019t really have enough strength to combat all the data coming in. Maybe they do show up during the day, when they get to be good at being ghosts.\u201d</p><p>Will looked at her with a dry expression. \u201cIf these ghosts have been around for over a hundred years, they ought to be good at being ghosts.\u201d</p><p>Whitney shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re still forgetting the power of the individual. Maybe some are just more powerful, just as they were when they were alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something that we\u2019re not seeing yet.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAre they illusions? Maybe even shared illusions at times. Or some form of energy left behind. And they\u2019re individuals. Good people, bad people, all kinds of people. But we don\u2019t believe that a ghost killed Regina Holloway, though we do know that ghosts remain in the house. So, a person killed her, but how? And what do the ghosts have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Whitney stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a nap. I\u2019m going to head up to my room and take a nap. I want to be on these screens tonight. All night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat house next door is very convenient,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but they are separate houses, separate doors, separate walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Still, a great place to disappear\u2014if you need to get out of this place quickly.\u201d</p><p>A young man with crew-cut blond hair manned the desk in the small office of the Aryans headquarters and looked them both over when Jenna and Jake entered. The two held hands, and, Jake hoped, they looked like the pure all-American couple.</p><p>\u201cBrad Telfur,\u201d he said, shaking hands with them. \u201cI know you. I saw you at the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was our first time, right, honey?\u201d Jenna said to Jake.</p><p>\u201cOur first time!\u201d Jake agreed eagerly. \u201cWe were fascinated. I\u2019m from here, you know. And I want to stay here. Love the city, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not from here, and I\u2019m thinking there are a few other places we could live,\u201d Jenna said, rolling her eyes. \u201cBut...well, when we heard about the meeting, we thought there might be hope. You know, a strength for\u2014for our kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an accent,\u201d Brad said suspiciously to Jenna. \u201cYou\u2019re Irish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have dual citizenship,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cBritish and American. I\u2019m from Northern Ireland,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Catholic?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cWell, good, sit down, please. Are you interested in joining us then? Can you fill out some information for our roster?\u201d he asked them.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, first, we\u2019d like to find out a little more about your organization,\u201d Jake told him earnestly.</p><p>Telfur indicated seats in front of the desk.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t do anything unlawful. We support the candidates who can keep control on the various situations in our city. We exercise free speech, and we support the NRA. We\u2019re backed by a huge system throughout the country, really. We hold meetings, and we give speeches, and we try to educate people about the problems caused when we step outside our racial lines. We\u2019re social\u2014look on the walls. Bowling. And over there, a picnic at the park. We have dances, of course, try to get all the young folks meeting all the right kind of other young folks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>Jenna stood, anxious to look at the photos on the wall.</p><p>\u201cCertainly!\u201d</p><p>They pretended to enjoy the photos; Jake was stunned that many contained swastikas and other neo-Nazi paraphernalia. But one particular photo of a group at a picnic perplexed him.</p><p>He turned to look at Jenna, indicating that she should seize the young man\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cUm, Mr. Telfur, could you tell me where this is?\u201d Jenna asked, pointing at a shot near a waterfall.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d he said, striding over to Jenna.</p><p>Jake slid his phone from his pocket and quickly took a picture of the picture as they talked.</p><p>He turned back, hoping he\u2019d been swift and subtle. Apparently, he had been. Jenna was gushing away about something in the photo she and Telfur were looking at.</p><p>\u201cMr. Telfur, I\u2019m curious. I saw a friend at the meeting. A Mr. Conroy. Has he been with the group long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConroy?\u201d Telfur looked puzzled. \u201cI don\u2019t know that name. Perhaps he\u2019s a prospective member, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks,\u201d Jake told him. \u201cHoney, we should get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you going to fill out some of the papers?\u201d Telfur asked.</p><p>\u201cWe need to discuss this between ourselves, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be back. Right, honey?\u201d he asked Jenna, smiling broadly.</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>He caught her hand, and they left together.</p><p>\u201cThat was fast!\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cYou were enjoying yourself? You wanted to stay longer?\u201d he teased.</p><p>She shot him a look that could have killed.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it was business. Though, I don\u2019t think that the kid working the desk\u2014good old Brad\u2014did know Blake Conroy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that he did,\u201d Jake agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo Blake Conroy was telling the truth?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cBlake Conroy was telling the truth. But, I think we do have what we need,\u201d Jake told her. \u201cI think that Gabby gave Angela the information we need to force the truth out into the open.\u201d</p><p>Jackson was deeply gratified that the federal and local authorities had managed to coordinate and get Gabby Taylor and her family out of the city.</p><p>But after Gabby had sat in the station for an hour, relaying every bit of information she could about the Church of Christ Arisen, Andy Devereaux sat in conference with Jackson and Angela for another hour, debating the course of action that needed to be taken.</p><p>\u201cYou can get a search warrant, at least. Try to find out what happened to those other girls,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we search the place\u2014and find nothing. Where do we go from there?\u201d Andy asked him wearily.</p><p>\u201cI think we have to rattle the cage,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would be better to rattle it through Senator Holloway,\u201d Andy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the senator is involved in some way as well?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy would the senator be involved with a church that hates him?\u201d Andy said. \u201cHell, no. He\u2019ll fire DuPre\u2019s ass! Then, maybe, DuPre will get careless.\u201d</p><p>Jackson was quiet for a moment. \u201cRemember, the Feds are officially leading this investigation,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andy sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that the senator will know something is up with the place once we execute a search warrant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll find out about DuPre\u2014if he doesn\u2019t already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd cover up anything he might have been in on himself,\u201d Andy said.</p> <p>Angela suddenly sat forward. \u201cCome on, please! It\u2019s obvious that other girls may be in danger. No matter what, that church has to be shaken up.\u201d</p><p>Andy looked at her. He reached for his phone. \u201cI\u2019m calling the D.A.\u2019s office. We\u2019ll set the search up for this evening. I want it to be bedtime at the church. We\u2019ll try to see who is in what bed.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>\u201cGuess who is an Aryan?\u201d Jake demanded as Jackson opened the door to the house on Dauphine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say that it\u2019s going to have be the chauffeur\u2014 Grable Haines.\u201d</p> <p>Jake was so obviously disappointed that Jackson was sorry he had guessed.</p><p>But Jake produced his phone, and a picture of Grable Haines at a picnic, laughing with a woman. He stared at the phone image for a moment, frowning as he looked at the woman. Her back was to the camera; she was speaking with Haines.</p><p>\u201cHave you downloaded this yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jake looked at him. \u201cI can see him clearly\u2014it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Angela moved and studied the picture. \u201cI think he wants it blown up. Nice and big. He wants to see the woman in the picture.\u201d</p><p>Jake took the phone back and frowned, staring at the image. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m on it,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m preparing for a long night,\u201d Whitney told them all. She\u2019d entered the kitchen when she heard the noise. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens by darkness, because it\u2019s usually better at night. Or rather, it\u2019s better when Angela is in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m in the house. And I guess I will be here. We aren\u2019t going when they execute the search warrant,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cShe talked! Gabby talked,\u201d Will said. \u201cFill us in.\u201d</p><p>Jackson and Angela told them about Gabby and her family, and everything that Gabby had said. The so-called bishop Richard Gull was not at the church, and the people had been told that he was dead. Gabby had heard a scream the night that Jane Leven had been \u201ccalled,\u201d and she hadn\u2019t been seen since. The police had called the D.A.\u2019s office, and a judge had agreed it was enough for a search warrant. She hadn\u2019t mentioned Susanne, leading Jackson to believe that Susanne had been murdered before Gabby had come to the house.</p><p>\u201cSo, they\u2019ll be going in tonight, just a few hours from now,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cSo you think that Martin DuPre came in here and killed Regina Holloway,\u201d Jake said thoughtfully. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have had a few motives,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cMaybe she was beginning to suspect something about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone around him was a conniving bastard of one kind or another,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThe picture is downloaded. And I know why you wanted to see it blown up,\u201d he added. He was still seated at the counter with the computer. \u201cCome over here\u2014it gets thicker and thicker.\u201d</p> <p>They all gathered around the computer.</p><p>With the picture blown up and enhanced, they could see the woman\u2019s face.</p><p>Whitney gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s the senator\u2019s secretary! She\u2019s an Aryan, too! So she had an affair with the senator, and she was an Aryan, and the Aryans are against him, and now she\u2019s sleeping with the bodyguard, and he was at an Aryans meeting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a new scenario,\u201d Angela said. \u201cOn the other side of the coin. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the right one\u2014it\u2019s just a theory. Holloway is\u2014is as corrupt as they come. He has sent his people into organizations for an agenda of his own, thinking that as long as it\u2019s not him, and his name is not mentioned, his people will take the fall when something happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his agenda\u2014that\u2019s the question,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cKilling his wife?\u201d Angela asked softly.</p><p>\u201cBut he brought us in,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI think he really saw ghosts,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnd if there were ghosts, he\u2019d clear himself, clear her name...and it would become sad history, and he\u2019d smell like a rose. Remember, his reputation was at stake when she died. People began to wonder what kind of a husband he might be for her to have killed herself,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pay the senator a visit,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ll catch him before he takes off for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might already be gone for the day,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling,\u201d Jackson said. He already had his phone out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Jake said, getting up.</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cRemember, no one in the house goes anywhere alone. Everyone hangs tight here until we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Angela agreed.</p><p>The senator himself answered the phone. \u201cHolloway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenator, it\u2019s Jackson Crow. I need to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was about to head out. But I\u2019m sure I can arrange to meet with you tomorrow. Have you found out anything? Did a ghost kill my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with you. You may be able to help me.\u201d</p><p>There was silence on the other end. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll meet you at the Community Coffee shop on Royal. Give me about twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see you alone, Senator. Without your chauffeur and bodyguard hanging around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m alone right now. Twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>The senator hung up. \u201cWe won\u2019t be needing the car,\u201d Jackson told Jake. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>When they stepped outside, Jackson paused, looking down the street to the shotgun house next door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jake asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe gate was closed earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have sworn.\u201d He pulled his phone out and called Angela, despite the fact that they were still right in front of the street.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d she said.</p><p>He paused for a moment, curious that the tone of her voice when she just said his name seemed to make him grow warm.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m right outside. Get Whitney and Will to rig one of their cameras to keep an eye on the house next door. I want to see who is coming and going all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you sleep with your gun handy, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bedside drawer,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be on my cell phone if you need me for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she promised.</p><p>He and Jake walked down to Bourbon and then Decatur.</p><p>\u201cPolitics really do suck, don\u2019t they?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe the name of the game makes it hard. I like to believe there are decent people out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all based on lies. Even when a man\u2014or woman\u2014doesn\u2019t mean to lie, they make promises. And then compromises. So at what point does a man sell his soul? The real problem, as I see it, is that no one in Holloway\u2019s camp really knows how to tell the truth anymore,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you watch the body, my boy,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cThe little things, like the eyes. Sweat on the upper lip. You have to try to catch a liar in a lie, and see him try to weave his way out of it.\u201d</p><p>At the coffee shop, he ordered lattes, and he and Jake sat down to wait. He noted that the senator came down the street from Bourbon.</p><p>Holloway entered the shop and looked quickly around. Spotting them, he came to the corner table in the rear where they waited.</p><p>\u201cCrow, Mr. Mallory,\u201d he said, greeting them. He was in a tailored shirt and jeans. Not in any official business wear.</p><p>\u201cCasual day at the office, Senator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to tie up a few personal affairs. I\u2019m due back in Baton Rouge next week,\u201d he said. He leaned closer. \u201cSo, what have you found out?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMartin DuPre is some kind of elder at the Church of Christ Arisen,\u201d Jackson said, looking at the senator.</p><p>Holloway\u2019s brow knit; he looked confused rather than alarmed, or about to make a denial.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not. I sent him in a while ago to get friendly with the people there and try to find out what was going on. I was doing it in tandem with our work on the Aryans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe...seven, eight months ago,\u201d Holloway said.</p><p>\u201cI thought I should warn you\u2014he may be arrested tonight. The police are going into the church with a search warrant. One of the girls who left the organization has leveled some charges.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head sadly. \u201cWho would have ever imagined that DuPre would have fallen prey to that debauchery?\u201d</p><p>He seemed sincere. \u201cWhat did DuPre tell you about the church?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said he felt like an ass, but he\u2019d get involved, and try to keep an eye on what they were going to do with their demonstrations, what manner of spin and propaganda they were going to use against me. Frankly, recently...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you send your secretary into the Aryans fold?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cMy secretary? Lisa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the one you were sleeping with,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Holloway\u2019s face reddened. \u201cIt was brief. It was stupid. It is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you were sleeping with her in the house right next door to the Madden C. Newton house\u2014a place you own as well. You might have shared that information,\u201d Jackson told him.</p><p>The senator\u2019s face went nearly purple.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a rental property. I don\u2019t live there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did sleep there,\u201d Jake put in quietly.</p><p>Holloway sighed, looking downward. \u201cI just admitted to the affair.\u201d He looked up at them both again. \u201cAll right, the truth? I called friends in D.C., and I\u2019d known Adam Harrison, and something about some of the people he\u2019s used over the years. Dammit, don\u2019t you understand? Yes, I would go to the house next door. I was frustrated. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I loved my wife, but she wasn\u2019t a wife to me anymore. We talked about trying again, but hell, you have to have sex to have another child, and she cried rather than have sex with me. I want to believe that there were ghosts in the place and that she freaked out and fell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t fall\u2014she was pushed,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?

But we now know that young girls have been dying\u2014young girls involved with the Church of Christ Arisen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with Regina,\u201d the senator protested. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you expect me to say. I\u2019m not responsible for my staff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Senator, you are. To what degree\u2014we will find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The police ruled it a suicide, but there are ghosts in that house. Regina fell from that balcony\u2014and you can prove that ghosts caused her death. The police\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police were wrong,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cAnd it will all come out. So, it\u2019s not looking good for you, Senator. Your aide got very involved in the Church of Christ Arisen, and your secretary, bodyguard and chauffeur are all involved with the Aryans. Frankly, no one surrounding you is legitimate in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy secretary, bodyguard\u2014and chauffeur?\u201d he asked blankly.</p> <p>\u201cMartin DuPre impregnated one of the girls at the church.

Blake Conroy was at the Aryans meeting the other night,\u201d Jake provided. \u201cI know because I was there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cConroy\u2014I did send Conroy,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBut...Lisa? And Grable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they all now, Senator? Why are you alone? Isn\u2019t a bodyguard supposed to protect you on the streets?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t wanted people around me,\u201d Holloway said.</p><p>\u201cYou need to clean house,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cIf we found these things out in a matter of days, your constituents are going to know everything soon as well. And when the police go into the Church of Christ Arisen, I can promise you that Martin DuPre will wind up on the cover of many a newspaper, along with stories about corruption in politics.\u201d</p><p>Holloway nodded jerkily. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for a while,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhat would you like? I\u2019ll get you some coffee. We\u2019re just going to sit here awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re going to wait for the police results,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>The senator shook his head. \u201cLook, don\u2019t you get it yet, Jackson? I sent Conroy to the Aryans, and I sent DuPre to the Church of Christ Arisen. I was trying to find out if they were related in any way, because they were the groups so against me. And I think I was right. I still need the proof. But I believe that the Church of Christ Arisen was an offshoot of the Aryans. A sect, if you will. If I didn\u2019t get people involved, I\u2019d never know what was really happening. You\u2019ve got to understand\u2014if they started buying into the doctrine, I didn\u2019t know it. I swear I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>Angela helped clean up after dinner, but she was bored and restless. She sat in front of the screens with Will and Whitney for a while, and kept an eye on the screen that now showed the shotgun house from the side. But there was no one there; nothing happened at all.</p><p>Eventually, she yawned. She wondered if the police had stormed the Church of Christ Arisen yet, and if so, if they had found anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going up to bed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to wait until we hear back?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p> <p>\u201cI have my cell phone, or you two can come and get me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Upstairs, she showered in her own room, both fearful and hopeful that she would see a face in the mirror. But she didn\u2019t. She went into Jackson\u2019s room instead and stretched out on the bed there. For a while, her thoughts were torn between wanting him to come back and be there beside her, and twisting and turning with the questions that continued to plague them and grow worse. They weren\u2019t getting answers\u2014just more questions.</p><p>Eventually, she drifted, never sleeping soundly. Then, it seemed that she was wide-awake, and she wondered why. Jackson hadn\u2019t returned.</p><p>She realized that she had the sensation of being watched.</p><p>Carefully opening her eyes, she looked to the doorway that separated the room she stayed in with Jackson from the room Regina Holloway had chosen.</p><p>And there they were.</p><p>The children, and between Percy and Annabelle, the woman she had seen in the mirror. The woman who might have been Susanne Crimshaw. Whoever she was, she was dead, and though she hadn\u2019t died anywhere near the era the children had perished, it seemed that their souls transcended time and space, because it seemed as if they were together here now, no matter how many years apart their deaths had been.</p><p>The woman crooked a finger at Angela, asking her to come, to follow them.</p><p>For a moment, Angela just lay there, fighting a feeling of terror. But then she made herself get up and she walked to the specters who were beckoning to her. Susanne turned, holding little Annabelle\u2019s hand, and Percy reached out for Angela. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she whispered to him.</p><p>\u201cUp,\u201d he said.</p><p>They walked down the hallway together, and then up the stairs to the attic. Angela floundered for lights by the side of the wall, and the naked bulb sprang to life, casting light and shadow over the vast expanse of the room. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d Angela asked Susanne.</p><p>The ghost raised her arm, pointing, but Angela couldn\u2019t really see what she was trying to show her. Angela spun around. She saw a dressmaker\u2019s mannequin, a pile of old trunks, cases and boxes. She thought at first that none of it had been touched in ages\u2014other than the fact that she could see that the dormer windows had been wired for the alarm system. With the one bulb casting an eerie light over the piles of the past, she found the place unnerving.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>She turned around again, assessing the area slowly. There seemed to be something sad and poignant about the dressmaker\u2019s dummy with the full soldier\u2019s uniform upon it; made and never touched. The giant wire-mesh crate that held children\u2019s toys from all ages seemed very sad as well. There were old wooden trains, dolls from a distant time, trains and tracks, an old stuffed rocking horse and more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d she said again.</p><p>She felt the woman\u2019s presence behind her. The pretty young woman with the blond hair, the huge eyes, and jeans and T-shirt from the twenty-first century. She felt as if she touched her shoulders, turning her again.</p><p>Angela was certain that the ghost of Susanne Crimshaw and her young friends from another age were urging her toward the trunks against the wall. She walked over to them, curious, and still uneasy and unnerved, but certain that there was something she was supposed to discover.</p><p>She turned, wanting to know which of the trunks she should be going through, but the ghosts were gone. But she wasn\u2019t alone. She heard her name called. \u201cAngela! Angela!\u201d Whitney was shouting her name, and the pounding of footsteps on the stairs told her that Whitney wasn\u2019t coming up alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here\u2014I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>Whitney burst into view from the landing, and Will was right behind her.</p><p>\u201cWe saw you\u2014we saw you walking down the hall, and up the stairs!\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on film. You\u2014you weren\u2019t alone,\u201d Whitney said, her honey-colored skin an odd, mottled shade of paste as she looked at Angela. \u201cWe\u2014we were scared to death for you.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps sounded on the stairs again. It was Jenna, rushing up to meet them. \u201cIs everyone all right? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela walked here as if she was in a trance,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we were watching the screens, so we could see Angela,\u201d Will explained. \u201cWait until you see that film again,\u201d Will said, staring at Angela.</p><p>\u201cIt was Susanne Crimshaw,\u201d Angela said flatly. \u201cShe\u2019s here, and she\u2019s managed to make contact with the children. They\u2019re together, and they\u2019re trying to help us find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they brought you here,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cThey\u2019re gone, aren\u2019t they? I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t feel anything here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very shy ghosts, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Angela told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s get started looking,\u201d Will said. \u201cPick a corner, everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge\u2014three wings of attic, just like three wings of house, and three wings of basement,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cThis house is huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the ghosts brought Angela here,\u201d Will said. \u201cI\u2019ll take a quick walk through the place.\u201d</p><p>He headed toward the front.</p><p>Angela looked around. There were piles of lumber and pipe, there were ancient paint cans. All out in the open, and clearly, just what they appeared to be. She needed to be digging into the unseen\u2014what might be hidden up here.</p><p>She started for a far corner filled with trunks, and started to open them. They seemed to be mostly filled with clothing and mothballs.</p><p>\u201cStuff from the 1920s,\u201d Jenna said, closing one of the trunks she had opened.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m back in the 1860s or \u201970s,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Whitney called.</p><p>The third trunk that Angela opened was different. There was some kind of mechanism in it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...I have to get it out.\u201d</p><p>Will came back in. \u201cThat wing is like a big...like a shelter or something. Tons of bed frames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlave quarters, probably, back in the day,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d Will said, coming over to Angela. \u201cHey, it\u2019s a projector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA projector?\u201d Angela murmured. \u201cI wonder what it was projecting.\u201d</p><p>Will shook his head. \u201cWhatever it was, it was probably outstanding. I\u2019ve used this kind in a magic show. You can project images into the air with it, the thing is amazing\u2014and really expensive. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s on it\u2014grab that roll there, in the tin can, on the bottom of the trunk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angela grabbed the film canister and handed it to Will. He quickly searched for an outlet. \u201cThey can work on batteries, too, but...I think the ones in this thing are dead now. There\u2014there\u2019s an outlet.\u201d</p><p>He plugged in the projector and hit a button. \u201cTurn off the big overhead bulb. Let the light in from the stairs and hallway.\u201d</p><p>Jenna obliged him. And there, in the murky light, a horrible image appeared. It was the image of a little boy\u2014with an ax in his skull and blood creeping down his face.</p> <p>They heard a faint sound. A whisper. And it, too, was horrible. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Will exclaimed, and played with the machine, finding the volume control. The plaintive word became louder. The image moved, as if alive. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy, it hurts. It hurts so badly. Help me, Mommy,\u201d the image said, staring at them with wide blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Jenna said, and jumping up, she turned on the light. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry! I can\u2019t stand it. That\u2019s horrible, so horrible.\u201d</p><p>Even with the light on, they could faintly see the projected image.</p> <p>\u201cTurn it off, Will, turn it off, please,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWe know what it is. We can show Jackson, and he can get it to the police. Now we know for a fact that someone was in here, that they were playing horrible tricks on Regina\u2014a way to get her out on the balcony of her own room.\u201d</p><p>Will turned off the projector. He was quiet a minute. \u201cWas that the little boy you\u2019ve been seeing, Angela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t seeing a projected image\u2014you were seeing the real thing, right?\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t seeing a projected image,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cSo...do you think that whoever saw the image also saw the real ghost?\u201d Will asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Angela said. \u201cThere are all kinds of pictures at the museum\u2014and pictures of the children can be found there. They\u2019re probably also available in old newspaper archives. No, I don\u2019t think that anyone had to have seen the ghosts of the children to pull this off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell could have gotten into the house so easily, and managed this stuff?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, David Holloway, for one,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Jackson\u2019s phone rang while he was watching the senator sip a second latte. It was Andy Devereaux.</p><p>\u201cWell, we went in, and we have a couple of guys in for questioning,\u201d Andy said.</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything? Anything at all to suggest that a murder\u2014or murders\u2014were committed there?\u201d Jackson kept his eyes on David Holloway as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cNothing. There are a couple of girls here, and we\u2019re trying to question them. And I have two members of the church council, but no Martin DuPre, and they\u2019re saying that they\u2019ve never had anyone who matches that description as a member of the church. I can hold all of them for about twenty-four hours, but after that, I\u2019m going to hope that I can at least find proof of statutory rape, and that may be all that I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome in the morning. Maybe you have a unique way of asking questions,\u201d Andy suggested. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m praying the girls quit crying, that I can find out a few real names, and get something out of the crew. The financial guys are going over the books. But I need more. And I\u2019m going to have to bring your girl, Gabby Taylor, back to identify DuPre, if he\u2019s really the father of her child. Have you told any of this to David Holloway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m looking at him right now,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Get here in the morning. I\u2019ve got officers on the case, but this might be something you can handle with more intuitive questions. I haven\u2019t dealt with crazy cults before, though I have dealt with enough crazy teenage girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your best, Andy.\u201d</p><p>Jackson hung up. Both Holloway and Jake were watching him.</p><p>\u201cDuPre wasn\u2019t there. Do you have any idea where he might be, Senator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave him the night off,\u201d Holloway said.</p><p>\u201cCall him.\u201d</p><p>The senator did so. The phone just rang and rang.</p><p>Jackson wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cI doubt if he\u2019ll be reporting to work tomorrow, Senator.\u201d</p><p>As they sat there, Jackson\u2019s phone rang. It was Will. \u201cWe\u2019ve found something,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you still with the senator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you leave him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re telling me I need to do so.\u201d</p><p>Will began to speak quickly, so quickly that he didn\u2019t understand the gist of what Will was saying at first. And then he did.</p><p>\u201cYou need to see this,\u201d Will said. \u201cThe question is\u2014should you bring the senator with you or not?\u201d</p><p>Together, they watched the image projected. Jackson stared at the machinations, and thought about the fact that the answer had been in a trunk in the attic, and he grew cold. The cruelty behind the creation of the image was staggering; that the person with the mind to instigate such brutal torture was still walking around free was chilling.</p><p>He watched Senator David Holloway watching the images of the bloodied child, pleading for help, saying that \u201cit hurt.\u201d</p><p>He watched tears form in the senator\u2019s eyes, and then roll down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWho would do this?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cSomeone close to you,\u201d Jackson said, his voice harsh. He had to watch the senator\u2019s reactions. \u201cSomeone close to you who has access to the house. I\u2019m sure the plan was to allow the projection to lure your wife out to the balcony\u2014and to her death. But I\u2019m thinking that though she went to the balcony, she wasn\u2019t ready to jump. That\u2019s why she was thrown at the end, despite this display of smoke and mirrors, as Will would explain it. You have to know who did it, Senator. Because someone did it because they wanted to drag you down, or because they thought that they were doing you a favor. Frankly, I think it\u2019s the first\u2014your people are all involved in groups that do their best to tear down your campaigns.\u201d</p><p>The senator shook his head, stricken. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. I knew nothing.\u201d</p><p>He looked lost. Far older than his years.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some water, Senator?\u201d Whitney asked him.</p><p>The senator nodded. He had been seated in the grand ballroom, where they could best display the recorded image that was so state-of-the art, it appeared three-dimensional.</p><p>The figure began to repeat the pattern. \u201cMommy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn it off!\u201d the senator begged. \u201cPlease! Turn it off.\u201d</p><p>Will quickly hit the switch.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Senator. If you can think of anything that will help us, we need to know,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIf you have been involved in this in any way, we need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d Holloway huffed.</p><p>\u201cSenator, your people are involved up to the gills. What part you might have known about is still in question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done that to Regina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, the question remains\u2014were you being blackmailed for any reason? Did you want your wife gone\u2014just not this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Holloway told Jackson.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to find ghosts!\u201d Holloway raged.</p><p>\u201cWere you involved?\u201d Jackson demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you! Dammit\u2014I\u2019ve told you. Yes, I knew about my people going into those wretched communities\u2014joining the Aryans and the Church of Christ Arisen. Well, I knew about DuPre and Conroy. If they took that to mean they should go crazy\u2014it wasn\u2019t me. And I didn\u2019t kill my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all still looking so gray, Senator. Not at all good,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Holloway didn\u2019t seem to have anything else to say. He stared at Jackson a long time and spoke at last. \u201cYou are a bastard, Crow. An absolute bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have my team come in just to say that yes, there were ghosts, Senator? To distract from your little Aryans involvement?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cDid you think you were getting a team of paranormal experts who would want ghosts to exist, and play it out like a pack of innocent lackeys, swearing that there were ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass, and I\u2019m innocent,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cI did want you to prove there were ghosts. There are ghosts in that house\u2014and ghosts caused my wife to die. Quit accusing me. Maybe I did want to prove it because I didn\u2019t want to live with the guilt of having caused her to commit suicide\u2014but she didn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t kill her. And if you\u2019d let well enough alone, DuPre and Conroy would have gotten what we needed, and I could have shut them all down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all for the good of man, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m innocent of Regina\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you either killed other innocents\u2014or brought about their deaths with you machinations, Senator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t be responsible for others turning homicidal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Holloway stared at him, furious.</p><p>Jake cleared his throat. \u201cShall I drive you home, sir?\u201d</p><p>Holloway just shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll go next door,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019ll just go next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk him over, Will, please?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Will nodded and left with the senator.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the projector down to the police station with me first thing in the morning,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe have to keep investigating this house. Whoever used the projector seems absolutely confident in his or her ability to get away with what he\u2019s done. The damn thing has been here. He or she put it in a trunk and thought that would be the end of it\u2014it might have been. Some buyer another hundred years from now might have discovered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can try to trace the purchase,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive piece of equipment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jackson nodded. \u201cJake\u2014first thing in the morning, start up with your computer magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the house\u2014we\u2019ve seen it. The answers are in the house,\u201d Jackson repeated dully.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find the truth,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI know we\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>Jackson slipped an arm around Angela\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get some sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to get some sleep, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Whitney said. \u201cWhat happened with the police search at the Church of Christ Arisen? What did the senator know\u2014and not know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey missed DuPre. No one knows where he is. The senator originally sent him in like I sent Jake in\u2014for information. He did send Blake Conroy to the meeting of the Aryans, but didn\u2019t send either Grable Haines or his secretary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he says,\u201d Jake added.</p> <p>\u201cSo he says,\u201d Jackson agreed. \u201cThey have two council members from the Church of Christ Arisen at the station, and two of the young women who live at the church. They\u2019re all playing dumb\u2014they won\u2019t even give their real names. I\u2019m going to talk to them tomorrow, and if we don\u2019t get something quickly, we\u2019ll have to bring Gabby Taylor back, though she did sign statements about her time at the church. I don\u2019t think DuPre can stay underground that long. He didn\u2019t think he was caught, or in any trouble, and DuPre needs an income. If the church assets are frozen, he\u2019ll be in a desperate situation. Anyway, Jake, see what you can find out about that piece of equipment, and we\u2019ll call it a night. Oh, Whitney\u2014how\u2019s the camera on the house next door going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s working fine. No one in, no one out,\u201d Whitney reported.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on it\u2014the senator is in it tonight,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd make sure this place is locked up tight once Will is back in. We still don\u2019t know the truth\u2014whether the senator is involved, or whether his mental state caused him to be totally unaware of what people around him were really doing. The thing is, he did send DuPre into the Church of Christ Arisen. So, did he send his own people to join the Aryans as well? It\u2019s worse than ghosts\u2014it\u2019s the living, and we have to find exactly what is what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. And we\u2019ll watch the house. I\u2019m going to be on it until four in the morning... Will is going to take over then,\u201d Whitney told him.</p><p>\u201cEveryone stay vigilant,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI have a feeling things are going to come crashing down.\u201d</p><p>He caught Angela\u2019s hand, forgetful of everyone around them. It didn\u2019t matter anymore. She didn\u2019t say a word, and he didn\u2019t care what anyone thought.</p> <p>\u201cGood night, then,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNight, all,\u201d Angela told them.</p><p>\u201cThis is really quite sad,\u201d Angela said, as they left the group and walked up to their rooms. \u201cAll we\u2019ve learned is that Senator David Holloway\u2019s entire life was a lie, and the main missing ingredient is just how much he knew about the lie he was living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t solve anything else now,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>She smiled at him as they stood in the hallway on the second floor, eyes brilliantly blue, a half smile curved into her lips. \u201cWe can solve one thing,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that it was very lonely in that bed without you.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if he should feel badly that her words were a bolt of lightning ripping through him; if it was wrong that he could take such raw and carnal pleasure in being with her when they were sitting on a bombshell. And yet, the very history of the house reminded him that relationships were the essence of life. Angela had become a part of his life so quickly, something that he had missed, he thought, maybe always. He had become so focused on solving every dilemma out there.</p> <p>\u201cNo reply?\u201d she queried softly.</p><p>He drew her into his arms and kissed her gently, heedless of the fact that they remained in the hallway. Then he led her inside. \u201cI hope that was an appropriate reply?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cExcellent, right to the point,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He held her there for a moment, just looking down into the pool of her eyes, wanting to explain what he had never managed to get clear to himself. His hands were on her shoulders; his fingers delicately caressed, and he tried to form words, a sense of his feelings, the reality he knew, and why his skepticism meant so much to him.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute, and then, at last, he spoke. \u201cI have Native American blood,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I have done a dream quest, and seen amazing things, but that\u2019s not what touched me, made me wonder what was real, and what wasn\u2019t. Once, when I was in my early teens, with my mom\u2019s family, in northern Scotland, I was racing on horseback with friends. They thought that I had beat the hell out of them\u2014I\u2019m a good rider, and I had a damn good horse\u2014but I hadn\u2019t beaten them, I\u2019d been thrown. I wasn\u2019t ahead of them. I was lying there with a concussion, a rib broken as well, barely able to breathe. A kilted man had come along on a black horse that looked like some kind of mixed-breed warhorse and picked me up. I barely understood the man, his accent was so heavy and his speech was so strange. I was going in and out of consciousness. When I woke up, I found that I had been deposited on the steps of my mom\u2019s ancestral home in the Highlands. And then...well, later I saw the man again. I saw him on the wall in the grand hall of my mom\u2019s family estate. The painting was of Ewan McKeough, head of the clan in the late 1500s. He was the...he was the man who rescued me. Now, mind you, half the area of Scotland was McKeough. I tried to tell myself that he had to have been a relative. But I\u2019ve questioned the truth of it ever since\u2014being a skeptic, because so many people are willing to believe anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve known,\u201d Angela said quietly. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve known that you\u2019ve had the ability to see beyond what most people see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy real ability is to bring out the strongest reactions in gifted people like you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can bring out abilities in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll kinds of abilities!\u201d</p><p>She smiled and he closed the door firmly, turning to her. \u201cTonight, I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019ll bring out a few of your other abilities. Hmm...somehow, I just feel I\u2019ll help you along without the benefits of a strip club. I mean, if you don\u2019t mind. And, then again, feel free to strip....\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>Warmth enwrapped Jackson as Angela lay in his arms. Hours of night had passed when they had been engrossed in one another, in sensation, in need, whispers and laughter, tenderness and volatility, and he had dozed and woken, and been pleased just to lie beside her. He breathed in the sweet clean scent of her hair, and felt the softness of her flesh beneath his fingers. There was even a time when he wondered at what he felt; she had known what it had been like to really become involved with another person, to lie comfortable and sated, happy to share time and space, wake together, share the simple pleasures of being together. He had spent his life restless and ever ready to move on, the world on his mind the second hunger was spent. He didn\u2019t know why; something had happened to him those years ago on the Scottish cliffs, and he had become obsessed with the mind, with what was real, and what was illusion in the thoughts of man. And from there he had come into the Behavioral Science Unit, and the criminal mind had become his passion. There was always another case, and those working with him seemed a little bit hard and jaded as well, all fighting demons in their own minds. Work had been good; there had been times of escape, and he had always thought of himself as a decent man, a decent human being, but he might have been wrong. He hadn\u2019t known the pain she had known. And he had never known the simple pleasure of sleeping beside someone, waking beside them and wanting them again.</p><p>Angela had her own demons\u2014so many tragic deaths in her past. But she had learned to control the emotions that coiled around them. He didn\u2019t think he was emotionless, but he had never let feelings slip beneath the surface. He knew damn well that he couldn\u2019t solve the world\u2019s problems, but the demons in him kept wanting him to do so. The loss of his teammates might have been part of it, he knew. They were ghosts that now lived in his heart. He\u2019d never imagined that a woman could bring so much to his soul without even knowing the full damage that dwelled there now.</p><p>He wanted suddenly just to go somewhere with her and enjoy music or art, or a horseback ride through a beautiful forest, and not wonder about anything except the beauty around him and the wonder of his companion.</p><p>Then he started as there was a pounding at the door, and it burst open.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d Will said. \u201cBut there\u2019s someone prowling around the house next door.\u201d</p><p>Angela had been sleeping so soundly she was barely aware of the pounding of the door. She finally forced her eyes open to find that Jackson was already in his jeans, just sliding into his shoes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked him. He gave her a quick kiss on the forehead. \u201cWill was just here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? Damn\u2014I heard some kind of pounding, but I didn\u2019t see Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve picked up something on the cameras. It\u2019s not clear, but there\u2019s someone next door, slinking around the house. Will is staying here; he\u2019s downstairs watching the screens with Whitney. Jake is coming with me\u2014we\u2019re going over. Jenna tried to get the senator on his cell phone... He isn\u2019t answering.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll right. You go ahead, I\u2019ll hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got wires. Will is going to know where we are and what\u2019s going on. It might be nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone slinking around a yard is nothing?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it might be another excuse. Like it\u2019s the bodyguard, and the senator called him. Everyone seems to have an answer for everything around here,\u201d Jackson said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was out of bed, even as he left, closing the door behind him. She quickly slipped into jeans and a T-shirt and scrambled for her sneakers. As she pulled them on, she looked up.</p><p>They were there again. The twenty-first-century woman, Susanne Crimshaw, and the nineteenth-century children, Percy and Annabelle.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t come with you,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething is happening. We may be finding the answers.\u201d</p> <p>Susanne shook her head. Percy broke free and walked to her. He shook his head. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s in the wall. It\u2019s in the wall.\u201d They were not images made by a projector; they were real ghosts in the house, and they were trying to help her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the wall?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>She turned around, frowning, staring at the end of the room. This room met the ell in the house. It was part of the original kitchen structure that had been added to the main house.</p><p>She gasped suddenly, staring at the wall, at the way the panels joined.</p><p>On the outside, it would look as if the house were now one big horseshoe. On the outside, it all blended together perfectly. But now, she wasn\u2019t sure if the space in the rooms inside was as large as the space as viewed from outside. There had to be some type of secret room or crevice.</p> <p>She looked at Percy again. \u201cYou might have told me before.\u201d</p><p>The little boy shook his head. \u201cI tried to warn the lady. But she didn\u2019t see me. She saw the images, but she didn\u2019t see me.\u201d</p><p>Angela jumped up and walked to the wall, studying the paneling. There was space, she decided. Space between this room and the twist in the ell. When the buildings had been joined, they hadn\u2019t been flush. The architect who had drawn the plans for the renovation had cleverly hid the gap between the two buildings, but it was there.</p><p>Behind the wall.</p><p>She quickly wondered if whoever had designed to kill Regina Holloway had come across the plans and seen that there had to be a gap in there. Outside walls were flush, but the gap didn\u2019t allow for more rooms to be built, though on one of the ells, they might have been widened.</p><p>But they hadn\u2019t been.</p> <p>She started to press on the paneling. Nothing happened. She wondered if she was being absolutely ridiculous, listening to a ghost while something tangible was happening downstairs.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Percy,\u201d she said, and told him gravely, \u201cI just have to see what\u2019s happening downstairs. I have to make sure that I\u2019m not needed.\u201d</p><p>He clung to her hand. \u201cYou see me, you hear me, please.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the door, wishing that this room wasn\u2019t on the far side of the ell. \u201cWill?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cAngela?\u201d His voice came from the microphone at the camera.</p><p>\u201cYes, what\u2019s happening next door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Jake and Jackson are walking the perimeter...they\u2019re out of camera shot right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Percy said. She looked down. It was amazing\u2014she could see the little boy. She could feel the warmth where his spectral hand touched hers. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid for you,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cThen help me!\u201d</p><p>He looked at her solemnly. \u201cThe wall. They come through the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use the wall.\u201d</p><p>Jackson and Jake scaled the brick wall that separated the properties, landing silently on the earth on the side of the brick barrier. Jackson motioned to Jake, and Jake nodded, heading around the front while Jackson came around the back of the house next door.</p><p>The shadows were so dense that night. He moved silently, and as swiftly as possible, scanning the foliage and brush that grew along the wall and was thick and heavy around an old, moss-dripped tree in the far corner.</p><p>When he reached the back door, he saw that it was open. Not ajar, just not tightly closed. It hadn\u2019t been jimmied; there was no sign of forced entry.</p><p>Inside, he could hear voices.</p><p>He waited, speaking softly into the tiny wired microphone he was wearing. \u201cSomeone is in the house, there are voices. No forced entry. I\u2019m waiting for Jake...we\u2019re going to go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you, the line is clear,\u201d Will assured him.</p><p>A moment later, Jake came around the other side of the house. Jackson drew his gun, indicating the door. Jake pushed it inward.</p><p>They entered by the rear door, and heard voices from the front. Silently following the sound, they moved through the house. Jackson motioned Jake to keep to the left; he stood to the right as they followed the shotgun hallway.</p><p>They crept along, holding back when they reached the front parlor. From his angle, Jackson could see Martin DuPre. He held a gun on the senator.</p><p>\u201cYou sent me in!\u201d he accused David Holloway. \u201cYou sent me in, and I did what you told me to do. I infiltrated. I became part of them. It\u2019s what you told me to do. And now, you have to help me. You have to get me money. The cops are after me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent you in to find out just what those people were really doing. I needed information to get them all closed down, and you know that we had a real agenda, and that I couldn\u2019t have my name involved with any of it. You became hypnotized yourself, trying to take everything for yourself, to have a good time\u2014and you took it way too far, dragging all those girls off the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew!\u201d DuPre cried, waving the gun. \u201cYou knew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your mind, DuPre, in your mind! My name could never be tainted by scandal! I didn\u2019t tell you to drag girls off the street and force them to sleep with you,\u201d Holloway said sharply. \u201cWhat were you doing? Why are women missing, and did you kill my wife, you son of a bitch?\u201d Holloway demanded in return.</p><p>Jake motioned to Jackson. DuPre had a pretty careless hold on the pistol he was carrying. Jackson couldn\u2019t get a really good look at it. The weapon appeared to be a small, snub-nosed six-shooter. It would certainly be lethal at close range, and DuPre looked like a desperate man. His customary meticulousness was gone; his hair was tousled, sticking up in all directions and his customary meticulous attire was wrinkled and stained as if he\u2019d had to crawl through some muddy terrain to escape detection.</p><p>Jackson shook his head and brought his fingers to his lips, warning Jake to be silent. He was going to have to pick the right time to bring the man down, winging him but rendering him harmless. There were still a lot of questions DuPre needed to answer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill your wife, Senator. You killed your wife. You still can\u2019t admit the truth! You broke her heart. You put her in that house. I was nothing but your patsy\u2014every damn thing that I did was for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed those girls,\u201d Holloway said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill your wife! You made Regina think she was crazy, haunted by demon children. You killed the woman who didn\u2019t worship you as a god. Well I became a god, Senator. I learned I had it. I had more power than you, and I have the kind of power that I can make work again, work for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police are after you!\u201d Holloway said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know it was all you\u2014when you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Jackson and Jake frowned at one another, hearing Will\u2019s voice come through their earpieces. \u201cSomeone else is coming, bursting through the gate. High speed. It\u2019s the bodyguard, the bald guy, Blake Conroy.\u201d</p><p>Jackson swore. He burst out from his hiding place, gun held between both hands. \u201cGet down, get down!\u201d he warned the senator and DuPre.</p><p>But the front door burst open as if a bull had come through. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot, dammit, no, don\u2019t shoot!\u201d Jackson cried.</p><p>But gunshots exploded.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell!\u201d Will shouted.</p><p>Angela heard the shout and the sound of gunfire.</p><p>She jerked away from her exploration of the paneling, and came running to the hallway, shouting to the camera and the microphone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGunfire next door!\u201d Will cried back. \u201cCan\u2019t hear anything\u2014it\u2019s mass confusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way!\u201d</p><p>She raced into Regina Holloway\u2019s bedroom and grabbed her Smith &amp; Wesson from the drawer, and then raced downstairs. The others were already heading out the front door.</p><p>Police sirens could be heard on the air.</p><p>They raced around to the gate. \u201cGet back,\u201d she warned. \u201cStay flat against the wall, keep low!\u201d</p><p>They obeyed and moved swiftly but carefully along the wall, then ran along the path to the house, and the front door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right now,\u201d Jackson called. \u201cAmbulances are on the way.\u201d</p><p>Angela frowned, and the others stayed back. She stepped carefully to the front, but Jackson called to her, \u201cStay back. It\u2019s a crime scene now.\u201d</p><p>She looked inside. David Holloway lay on the ground, moaning. Jackson was at his side, staunching the flow of blood that was oozing from a shoulder wound. Jake was next to a fallen Martin DuPre; DuPre wasn\u2019t getting back up, and no ambulance was going to help him.</p><p>Blake Conroy knelt on the floor, clutching his shattered hand, and blood dripped from it as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming in,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cI can help.\u201d</p><p>Jenna stepped into the house, rushing past Blake Conroy to assess the senator\u2019s more dire condition. She spoke to him quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s a shoulder wound. Looks like a through and through. Breathe easily, Senator. Jackson, apply more pressure. You\u2019ll be all right.\u201d She moved over to Conroy to examine his hand.</p><p>A moment later, the police cars arrived. Andy Devereaux stepped out of the first one, and hurried toward the house.</p><p>The ambulance came screeching to a halt.</p><p>For the next five minutes, there was mayhem.</p><p>But, eventually, Jackson, Andy and Angela stood alone on the sidewalk just outside the house. \u201cWe showed Holloway the projector and the images it had on its reels,\u201d Jackson explained. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t go home, he decided to sleep here. We had cameras rolling on the place. The best I can figure is that he did get hold of Martin DuPre, or DuPre figured out where he was and came after him. I don\u2019t think he intended to kill the senator, but we\u2019ll never know now. He wanted money. He wanted help to get out of New Orleans. But Blake Conroy burst through the door before we could defuse the situation. DuPre panicked and got off a shot when Conroy shot him\u2014I shot Conroy\u2019s hand, trying to get him to put his weapon down,\u201d Jackson said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andy nodded, scratching his cheek. \u201cWell, DuPre is dead. It will save the taxpayers a lot of money. He would have gone up for murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that he didn\u2019t kill Regina,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHe said that the senator killed her, that Holloway broke her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Andy asked.</p> <p>\u201cDid you miss the part where DuPre died?\u201d Jackson said, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on,\u201d Andy interrupted. \u201cLook, I\u2019m an officer of the law, and I respect my office. I don\u2019t shoot to kill, and I bring a man in every time rather than shoot a bloody murderer, child molester and so on, but don\u2019t expect me to weep over this one, Jackson Crow,\u201d Andy said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Angela explained quietly. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what happened. Jackson\u2019s explaining that they were listening to DuPre when Conroy burst in.\u201d</p><p>Andy nodded. \u201cYeah, well, we\u2019ll have to piece together the rest.\u201d He stared at Jackson. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come down to the station. We\u2019ll need a slew of statements. DuPre is dead, we\u2019ll have the bodyguard questioned at the hospital, and the senator won\u2019t be in shape for any information until tomorrow. But I\u2019ll need you, Jake and the nurse\u2014she came into the house,\u201d he said apologetically.</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>The ambulance was leaving with the senator on a stretcher. The EMTs were walking with Jenna, who was still holding Holloway\u2019s hand. The senator now had an IV in his arm and an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose.</p><p>Medical pathologists from the coroner\u2019s office had arrived, but they\u2019d be working in the house for a while. Blake Conroy had already been situated in the back of another ambulance. He glared at them all with red, angry eyes.</p><p>Jackson glared back with anger.</p><p>Conroy suddenly jumped out of the ambulance, racing toward Jackson. Andy stepped between the men.</p><p>\u201cYou shot me!\u201d Conroy accused Jackson. \u201cYou shot me! The bastard was going to kill the senator. It was my job to shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had it covered, Conroy. And you killed the truth when you shot DuPre!\u201d Jackson told him.</p> <p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Andy said. \u201cWe\u2019ll sort this all out at the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing charges against you,\u201d Conroy threatened Jackson.</p><p>\u201cAnd you could be facing murder charges yourself,\u201d Jackson told him.</p><p>\u201cHe had a gun,\u201d Conroy said.</p><p>\u201cGet back in the ambulance. Get back in the damn ambulance!\u201d Andy said. \u201cAnd get to the hospital... Charges are possible, Conroy, so cut the temper tantrums. And it\u2019s 2:00 a.m., dammit,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cLet\u2019s move this. Move it!\u201d</p><p>He got Conroy back to the ambulance. Jackson stood with Angela. She wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cWell, Martin DuPre did become a monster,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t finished,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t finished. I still don\u2019t trust Conroy. Hey!\u201d he called to Andy. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be in custody, right?\u201d</p><p>Andy looked back at him, his expression tense. \u201cHe\u2019ll be at the hospital, and then down at the station.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson nodded, then turned to Angela, taking her shoulders. \u201cAll right, then, go back, you, Will and Whitney. Try to get some sleep, and we\u2019ll try to figure out if we can make any more sense out of it all tomorrow. Something still just isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can all come to the station,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He shook his head wearily. \u201cThat won\u2019t make sense, that\u2019s for sure. Get some sleep. Get in, lock up and get some sleep. At least I won\u2019t be that worried. DuPre is dead, and Blake Conroy will be occupied. Our time at the station will be as quick as I can make it.\u201d He gave her a pained and rueful smile. \u201cAnd it had been one of my best nights, oddly.\u201d</p><p>She grinned in return.</p><p>\u201cI can wait up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson! You coming with me?\u201d Andy scowled at him.</p><p>Jackson gave Angela a quick kiss on the lips. \u201cSoon,\u201d he promised.</p><p>He got into Andy Devereaux\u2019s unmarked car with Jake and Jenna. Will and Whitney came over to stand by Angela.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so upset,\u201d Whitney remarked.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to know more from Martin DuPre,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cWell, he managed it in the best possible way,\u201d Will said. \u201cHe may have to be happy with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, handsome, you did all right, too!\u201d Whitney teased him. \u201cYou caught DuPre breaking into that house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Will said. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s try to get some rest. My eyes are killing me from staring at those screens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think a glass of wine is in order,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cThen, maybe, my adrenaline will be down enough for me to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>They walked slowly back to the house, tired but wired. Angela decided that when Jackson returned and had gotten some sleep, they could start inspecting the walls. He\u2019d been angry, frustrated and disconcerted when he\u2019d headed toward the station; a dead man still lay in the house next door. Tomorrow would be time to tell him what discoveries they might make through the ghosts.</p><p>They walked into the grand ballroom. Will checked the door and set the alarms. \u201cShould I forget about the cameras and film? I guess we are working on taxpayer money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep them up for tonight,\u201d Angela told him.</p><p>\u201cIs it over? Is it really over? Did we solve it? No ghosts\u2014just a very evil man?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we know there are ghosts,\u201d Angela said. \u201cBut Jackson was right\u2014evil is done by the living.\u201d</p><p>She headed into the kitchen, leaving them to do whatever their wonderful technical minds did with their technical equipment. For the moment, she slid her Smith &amp; Wesson into one of the kitchen drawers.</p><p>She walked to the refrigerator and found a bottle of chilled Chablis. She took out the wine, opened the bottle and went to the cupboard for glasses. She noted that Jake\u2019s computer was on the counter bypass and she went to look at the screen.</p><p>He\u2019d had a search engine at work. Jackson had told him to research the projector they had found. He\u2019d gone to a number of sites, and she glanced at them curiously\u2014the projector was in high demand by magicians.</p><p>She started backtracking through his system, and he\u2019d been busy, using what codes she didn\u2019t know, but he\u2019d done some hacking.</p><p>As she stood there, growing absorbed, little blips alerted her to responses coming in from the questions he\u2019d been asking.</p><p>She clicked on the mouse, and it brought up another screen. It was listings of the trace he had made on the purchases of the projector.</p><p>She gasped suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d she called.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>\u201cWhitney, Will! Come in here.\u201d</p><p>There was still no answer. She stepped into the hall, \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>A muffled laugh made her shake her head. Well, they were young, and the case was apparently over.</p><p>She walked down the hallway, aggravated. But when she reached the grand ballroom, she didn\u2019t see either of them. She walked around to look at the screens.</p><p>And when she did, she froze, berating herself for her stupidity.</p><p>One screen showed Whitney, knocked flat in the upstairs hallway; Angela couldn\u2019t tell if she was dead or alive.</p><p>Will could be seen in a like position on the landing of the central stairway, just above her.</p><p>They had all run out at the sound of the shots next door; they had run out, leaving the Madden C. Newton house open and vulnerable.</p><p>And they weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>She knew before she turned that someone was behind her.</p><p>She even knew who.</p><p>But the blow against her head took her down before she could turn to face their attacker.</p><p>Jackson gave his statement at another desk across from where Jake gave his statement. Jenna had come in after the fact, but she sat at another desk, telling the officer the senator\u2019s condition as she had seen it, and the emergency treatment she had helped administer.</p><p>Andy finished typing up the document, printed it out and gave it to Jackson to sign.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Conroy now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s an officer with him at the hospital. He\u2019ll be here with an escort, don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s not out on the streets.\u201d Andy chuckled. \u201cHe will need surgery on that hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shot for the gun,\u201d Jackson said wearily. \u201cAnd I was a split second too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, the senator is still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShots should never have been fired, period,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Andy shrugged. \u201cBut they were. And the senator is going to live, and a bad man is dead. Come on, Jackson, I can live with that. You\u2019re going to have to. Let\u2019s see, when it all comes out\u2014that the senator\u2019s aide was in on fleecing and seducing young women in the name of the church\u2014I\u2019d say that fellow\u2019s career may be over, but then again, he may be so damn broken now he\u2019d be no good in politics anyway. He had to have been slipping, to have ignored everything that was going on in his own house, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Andy. We can\u2019t let this go. We really don\u2019t know yet if the senator was heavily involved with those people,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cOr...just how deeply others around him were involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Andy said wearily. \u201cBut it looks like we did find out the murderer.\u201d</p><p>But Jackson had heard the conversation between DuPre and Holloway. And DuPre had denied killing the senator\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, we can meet in the morning and try to sort more out,\u201d Andy said.</p><p>\u201cIs that it for now? Can we get back?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to go,\u201d Andy told him. \u201cJust as soon as the others wrap up. The patrolman over there, Smith, will give you a ride back.\u201d</p><p>They left the station. Two blocks down, they passed a police car on the side of the road. There were two silhouettes visible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop, go back,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d Smith said.</p><p>\u201cGo back\u2014there were two officers in that car, and they didn\u2019t look right,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>Even Jake, next to him in the backseat of the car, looked at him as if he was losing it.</p><p>\u201cSmith, go back, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably just on break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jackson said firmly.</p><p>With a sigh, Smith did as he was asked. He parked the police car and Jackson hopped out. He walked toward the car.</p> <p>Both occupants were slumped over.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>The driver was a police officer.</p><p>The passenger was not.</p><p>Angela woke with her head pounding. For a moment, she was lost\u2014completely lost. Disoriented, and in pain.</p><p>Then she remembered clearly what had happened. She was in Regina Holloway\u2019s bedroom, on the floor. The pain of rug burns on her flesh told her that she\u2019d been dragged there.</p> <p>Something was touching her foot. Whitney\u2019s body, she realized.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she heard.</p><p>She looked up. Grable Haines was grinning down at her, a gun in his hand. \u201cGhost busters, busted! Cool. The legend of this house is going to grow and grow.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, knowing that he wasn\u2019t alone when she heard the giggle behind him. It was Lisa Drummond, of course.</p><p>\u201cBe careful. The ghosts will get you,\u201d Lisa said.</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cI\u2019ve got the gun. Ghosts don\u2019t get guns, I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how powerful they can be,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cMake her shut up, Grable,\u201d Lisa said.</p> <p>He ignored Lisa.</p><p>Angela shook her head. \u201cThe senator is an amazing actor. I believed he was horrified by the images the projector put out. But he ordered the projector,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, Lisa ordered the projector. But, yes, the sainted Senator Holloway knew. He wanted his wife to think that she was meeting her son. He thought that she would die happily that way. He never saw the images we created,\u201d Grable said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone in this was a liar,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnd you should know this\u2014I think the senator actually brought us in, knowing what would finally come out and planning on getting rid of DuPre and all of you, through us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Grable said. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand politics. The senator will come out of all this just fine\u2014after you\u2019re dead, of course. And we\u2019ll be just fine as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, she doesn\u2019t need to know any of this!\u201d Lisa said. \u201cEverything will fall on Martin DuPre, and they\u2019ll think street thugs got hold of Blake and that cop. And everything went just perfectly, so let\u2019s just finish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe senator will get you\u2014just as he got DuPre,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Lisa insisted. \u201cOh, yes, we\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. Don\u2019t you see\u2014the senator really has to clean house. And speaking of which, that leads to one more question\u2014you obviously slept with everyone,\u201d Angela said to Lisa. \u201cWhich one are you really trying to be with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, I\u2019m going to be the next Mrs. Holloway,\u201d Lisa said with disgust. She didn\u2019t seem to mind explaining things to Angela, as long as she was the one doing the talking. \u201cAnd once you\u2019re dead, taken by the ghosts, it will be clean and clear. Martin DuPre went insane. He was responsible for everything. And Blake is dead now, too. So we\u2019ve survived, horrified and grieving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you back here to kill us? That makes no sense,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Lisa smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not a dumb blonde. I know all about Jackson Crow\u2014and the members of his last team! They died. And now, he\u2019s lost so many people on this new team. His word will be worthless. Nothing he says against the senator will mean anything\u2014because DuPre was the killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know we died after DuPre,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Lisa shook her head. \u201cTime of death is never that specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it can be,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d Grable said. \u201cThe ghosts will be blamed for anything that doesn\u2019t fall on DuPre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please! You can\u2019t believe that! This may be New Orleans, and people love their stories and their legends, but they\u2019ll never blame it all on ghosts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself\u2014when men can\u2019t find an explanation, they look to legend all the time, and to superstition!\u201d Grable said. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to waste time. And you\u2019re not going to do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really are an idiot. Don\u2019t you see\u2014you just told me. Holloway did want his wife dead. You carried it out for him. If he\u2019s really cleaning house now, he\u2019s going to have to get rid of the both of you, too. Lisa, you are never going to be Mrs. Holloway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything!\u201d Lisa told her. \u201cMen love me. He loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike he loved his wife,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d Grable ordered again.</p><p>Angela staggered to her feet. She could see that Whitney and Will were alive, thank God, but they weren\u2019t going to help her. They were still unconscious. Maybe it was best that way.</p><p>Standing was painful. Time. She had to play for more time, get them arguing, explaining again and again. Lisa liked to prove she was smart. She didn\u2019t want to be a dumb blonde. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. You really are. Did Martin DuPre really kill the missing girls? Or did you? Was DuPre being set up and framed for everything? I\u2019d say you could have done it, easily. Maybe DuPre was really the one being set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet up? The little bastard was going to ruin everything. He wanted to be the real messiah. He thought he was God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut did he kill the girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out on the balcony,\u201d Grable said.</p><p>\u201cWait. I\u2019m going to die. I want the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Lisa said, pushing past him. \u201cYou want it all? Regina Holloway went nuts with grief. The senator was desperate. First, Martin got him a girl, pretending in the dark that David Holloway was the \u2018bishop.\u2019 Then Martin took her himself. And then...well, Martin was the one who killed the girl. He got the bright idea to bring her here, and she started screaming, and he could hear that Regina Holloway was coming in the house\u2014home early from some function or the other. He killed the girl to shut her up, stuffed the body down in the basement for the night, but then had to come back to actually get rid of the corpse. It wasn\u2019t so hard. In his mind, he\u2019d become like a god, so he didn\u2019t owe anything to Holloway or anyone. He did it a second time\u2014got carried away with one of the girls\u2014when the little bitch got bitchy. Holloway needed to get rid of his wife anyway. So I talked him into a bit of a scheme that would just rid him of her. He ordered the projector, but he said that the house was creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did Blake fall into it all?\u201d Angela demanded.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, he was the fool, you see. He fell for Lisa, and he believed everything that she said to him. He was set up to kill Martin DuPre,\u201d Haines explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd both the girls are buried in the wall, right?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cWeirdest damn thing,\u201d Grable said, grinning. \u201cIt was like someone showed me where to bury those bodies! But, you know, someone did show me.\u201d He started to laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s some old bones back there, so...hey, this is a murder house. Has been, always will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. Do you think that Jackson Crow is going to come back and let all this rest? Do you think that he won\u2019t tear apart the whole damn place? He\u2019ll find the bodies\u2014and you\u2019ll be all who\u2019s left!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuPre will be blamed.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe projector,\u201d she said.</p><p>Grable\u2019s fingers twitched at the trigger of the gun. \u201cGet out,\u201d he told her. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go first,\u201d Lisa said, laughing. \u201cYour ghost can wait for your little friends!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Grable said, angry. \u201cWait! The projector? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe traced it,\u201d Angela told him. \u201cThe police will know that Senator Holloway\u2014or someone in his office\u2014bought the projector. You see, actually, I\u2019m thinking that the senator didn\u2019t really know about it. Sure, his wife was making his life hell. But he didn\u2019t want anything like what happened to her happening. Let\u2019s think\u2014I bet he also had ordered Martin DuPre bring women from the Church of Christ Arisen to meet with him, and that might have been why the first one had to die. And why the senator had to pay blackmail. Not his loan to you, Grable. But blackmail. Blackmail, because you figured out that DuPre was getting him a young girl. But what does that really matter now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you are an ass! The senator knew about the projector. He knew,\u201d Lisa said, pushing forward. \u201cHe knew! He had to get rid of his wife, for his polecat future. Come on, think about it, Angela. He was a desperate man. But what he wanted was me. At the beginning, it was just an affair. And, at the beginning, he did just want the organizations infiltrated. The church was a group that splintered off from the Aryans. The Aryans didn\u2019t care enough about God\u2014they were all about color and race! Holloway just wanted to find something that would bring them down at first, but he was always a dog. He loved listening to DuPre talk about what was going on. He loved women. But his wife was a worthless, sopping pile of tears all the time. I wasn\u2019t the first woman with whom he had an affair, but now, I\u2019ll keep him happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he used the women Martin DuPre cajoled into his sect. He slept with them. He pretended to be a bishop. He doesn\u2019t love you, and I just don\u2019t believe that the two of you can\u2019t see that he\u2019s going to have to kill you, too.\u201d She turned from Lisa to stare at Grable.</p><p>\u201cGrable\u2014you were seen at the casino the day that Regina Holloway died.\u201d She turned back to look at Lisa. \u201cSo, you were the one who ran the projector and killed Regina Holloway. She didn\u2019t just plummet over the balcony with fear\u2014so you pushed her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I did.

And I\u2019ll just take your friend\u2019s computer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, Grable. You can\u2019t be that much of an idiot. We\u2019ll just look it all up again.\u201d</p><p>Grable looked at Lisa, uncertain. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get to the senator. We\u2019ll have to finish him. And quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m going to be the senator\u2019s wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, come on, Lisa! She\u2019s right. Don\u2019t you see\u2014she\u2019s right! David Holloway did use Martin DuPre\u2019s association with the church\u2014I don\u2019t care how it all started out! DuPre used the women, and the senator used them, too. God knows, maybe the senator killed them, and not DuPre\u2014we only know what he told us. We know about the bodies, but...what if we have been duped? What if the senator brought these people in on purpose\u2014to expose all of us and get everything blamed on DuPre, and then us. He\u2019d find a way to kill us, too. He got us to kill Blake...he can get someone to kill us. He manipulated everyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a politician,\u201d Angela said dryly, watching the pair.</p> <p>\u201cHe loves me!\u201d Lisa said. She was almost pathetic.</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d Angela told them softly. \u201cI can help you get this all straightened out. Grable, you didn\u2019t kill anyone. Lisa killed Regina Holloway, and DuPre killed the young women. At least he killed the one\u2014the girl he had here when he heard Regina Holloway coming home. Grable, you can make it out of all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrable knew the women, too!\u201d Lisa protested. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand\u2014they were all involved. The people who weren\u2019t getting enough out of the Aryans formed the church, and there\u2019s always been the association! Grable knew the women. He helped get them around\u2014he helped hide their bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go to prison,\u201d Grable said dully.</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t get the needle,\u201d Angela said softly.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes you will, you\u2019ll die right along with me!\u201d Lisa said. \u201cYou conspired! Conspired is the same thing\u2014she\u2019s just trying to trick you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the senator has been tricking us both!\u201d Grable said.</p><p>Tears suddenly trickled down Lisa\u2019s face. She believed.</p><p>\u201cWe have to kill the senator, too,\u201d Grable said. \u201cAnd get far, far away from here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means we have to finish here!\u201d Lisa said. \u201cGet her out on the balcony, now, Grable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot me,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI won\u2019t jump, and they\u2019ll trace the bullets. Go ahead. Shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d Lisa ran at her. Angela\u2019s head was still killing her; she wasn\u2019t prepared and she fell back, but when the woman pounced on her, she fought back. She managed to throw Lisa off, but she was weak, and Grable reached down for her, jerking her to her feet and landing a hard, bone-jarring blow to her chin.</p><p>\u201cGet out on the balcony!\u201d he roared.</p><p>She walked toward the balcony, praying one of them would come close enough.</p> <p>If she was going over, one of them was coming.</p><p>She edged out just ahead of Grable.</p><p>But then she saw them. The ghosts. The two children flanked Susanne Crimshaw.</p><p>And the woman found a voice.</p><p>\u201cGrable. Grable Haines.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly stood still, and turned around. A scream ripped from his throat.</p><p>He grasped hold of Angela\u2019s arm. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lisa cried hurrying after them. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t see the ghosts, but the ghosts saw her. Little Percy raced toward her, ramming her. She was thrown against the balcony railing. She staggered for balance.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, Grable!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t move; he was mesmerized. He shouted again; he started shooting wildly at the ghost.</p><p>He shot Lisa Drummond.</p><p>And Lisa went catapulting over the railing.</p><p>Grable started to shoot wildly again, but the door to the bedroom was thrown open and Jackson came rushing in. His gun was in his hand, and he shouted, but Grable didn\u2019t hear him. He started to turn the gun on Angela.</p><p>And Jackson shot him. Dead on, in the chest.</p><p>Grable grabbed at Angela again. They started to fall, together.</p><p>She felt herself tip over the railing.</p><p>She imagined the hard brick below her.</p><p>Then she felt Jackson\u2019s hard grasp, catching her arm. She looked up, terrified that her fingers would slip.</p><p>He held on hard. She felt other hands. Ethereal hands.</p><p>And slowly, slowly, she was dragged back up and over the railing, and into his arms.</p><p>Whitney and Will were kept in the hospital for observation the next day; Angela insisted that she was not suffering any ill effects from concussion. She wanted to be with Jackson. They all gave their statements, which took hours.</p><p>The senator was arrested that night; they could only imagine the sensation there would be when he finally went to trial and his reign of complete corruption was uncovered. Angela had supplied the police with everything she knew after her exchange with Grable and Lisa, and Andy was working on getting Holloway to unweave the tangle he had created with all those around him.</p><p>He had thought that he could really be the puppet master; he had forgotten that he was working with people and personalities, and someone was bound to come apart.</p><p>Jackson was with Andy when they carried out their first interrogation with the man. He still thought he could pull strings, and talked without a lawyer.</p><p>It was almost morning when Jackson joined the other three.</p><p>So far, according to Andy and Jackson, Holloway was still trying to proclaim his innocence; he hadn\u2019t killed the girls\u2014 DuPre had done it\u2014and Lisa had ordered the projector that had created the images that she\u2019d intended to use to kill his wife. Jackson said it was probably the truth\u2014Holloway was a man who liked sex with adoring women, but he didn\u2019t like dirty work himself. He wanted others to do the actual killing.</p><p>They weren\u2019t finished with the business of the house, though.</p><p>\u201cWe should sleep,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. While the questions still remain,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>They looked at one another. \u201cBack to the house then,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ll get Andy to send over a few of his men since we\u2019re pretty damned sure of what we\u2019ll find.\u201d</p><p>They were right.</p><p>They discovered the bodies of the two dead girls from the Church of Christ Arisen, and another skeleton. A very old skeleton\u2014that of Madden C. Newton. After his hanging, someone had brought him back to the house to inter him in the wall. Maybe they had thought that his body would be some kind of an offering to the victims he\u2019d killed in the house. It was a historical mystery they were unlikely to solve.</p><p>But when they found his bones, a groan seemed to echo from the walls; a groan, and something like a cry of rage.</p><p>\u201cThese old places do settle and shake,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>They were all still for a moment then, because it seemed that the sound came again, and then, shadow filled the crevice in the wall despite the lanterns there, and a darkening shadow, huge and hideous, came for that shadow.</p><p>As the greater darkness enveloped the first, the horrible groan and cry of rage increased so that the whole house shuddered, and then, in a blink, it was gone, and all was silent.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the real evil was Madden C. Newton after all,\u201d Angela said. \u201cHe\u2019s been the evil in the house all along, tormenting some people\u2014and tapping into the evil to be found in others. Maybe he\u2019s been able to keep the essence of his cruelty alive, and to make it seep into the minds of some who come here. But no more. I think that whatever lurks in hell finally came for him. He managed to exert his influence over others, but we finally fought him on his level. He\u2019s been beaten.\u201d</p><p>They were all silent for a moment, wondering what they really saw, what was in the mind, and still, knowing somehow that it had been Madden C. Newton, and he was gone. Only the crumbling bones of the man remained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call Devereaux and get him over here, no matter how tired he might be,\u201d one of the officers said.</p><p>Andy came back with crime scene techs and a medical examiner from the coroner\u2019s office, and the day was spent again with the police. That night, exhausted, the team slept over at the beautiful Hotel Monteleone, where they would stay until it was time to leave the city.</p><p>But the next day, Angela wanted to go back to the house\u2014with everyone. Will and Whitney had been released from the hospital, and they were all together again.</p><p>She urged Jackson that they go.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>It was Whitney who answered him. \u201cMy great-grandmother is coming over, and we\u2019re going to try to see that the children meet their parents.\u201d</p><p>The house was still officially under criminal investigation, and yellow tape covered the entire end of the block.</p><p>But Andy Devereaux gave them permission. The six members of the team sat with Mama Matisse while she prayed to saints and gods, and incense burned in the air.</p><p>The children appeared, still holding hands with the specter of Susanne Crimshaw.</p><p>And then, they all saw the light. It was stunning, and it might have been a mass hallucination, except, in their hearts, they all knew that wasn\u2019t so.</p><p>There was the light, a shaft, a ray, a hallway. A woman came walking toward them. She was sad, but she smiled when she saw the children. She was dressed in Victorian attire, and she moved slowly at first, and then she ran, and she fell to her knees, taking the children into her arms. She stood then, and hugged Susanne.</p><p>Then, other images appeared. Instead of walking toward the light, they were walking from the light.</p><p>They remained at a distance; but Angela clearly saw a woman and a little boy. She knew the woman\u2014she recognized her from the pictures she had seen. It was Regina Holloway, and Angela knew then that she had surmised the situation correctly. Regina had never haunted them because she had gone on. She had gone on to be with her son. But she was grateful to them, and she had come there, for just a shimmering instant, to say thank you. She mouthed the words; she smiled, and then she turned away, her son\u2019s hand held tightly in her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the light faded from the room.</p><p>\u201cIt is done,\u201d Mama Matisse said.</p><p>And it was.</p> <p>That evening, the kids headed out for a night on Bourbon Street.</p><p>Angela and Jackson did not.</p><p>They played in the rooftop pool for a while, and they enjoyed the carousel bar, and they dined on delicious room service. Jackson told Angela the story of his first strange encounter when he was a child, and he talked about taking her to Scotland. He talked about the guilt he couldn\u2019t help but feel over the loss of the members of his previous team, and she felt that she\u2019d shared more of him than anyone had before. He had shared his heart and soul, and he had done so much to mend hers.</p><p>They teased, laughed, grew serious, made passionate love.</p><p>And then, early in the morning, Jackson\u2019s phone rang.</p> <p>He answered it. Angela listened lazily, half-awake.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she asked when Jackson hung up.</p><p>\u201cAdam Harrison,\u201d he said slowly, looking over at her. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten our next assignment,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>But he took her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t start until tomorrow,\u201d he said, and he gave her a dazzling smile. She grinned slowly in return, and then she kissed him. Today, they were going to exercise a few of the amazing joys that came with being alive.</p>  </body></html>"]
