And if his bored expression hadn\u2019t told her he wasn\u2019t interested in talking to her, his tone would have.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>She straightened her dress and then ran a hand over her hair, smoothing it. She could do this. Four appletinis and enough outrage bottled inside her chest to choke a bear virtually guaranteed enough courage.</p><p>\u201cHi, Noah,\u201d she said, forcing a smile. She could do this. The worst he could do was say no, right? \u201cCan I come in and talk to you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment, and the humiliating thought that he\u2019d deny her even that simple request flashed through her mind. But finally, he nodded and stepped back.</p><p>She steeled her spine and walked past him into his foyer, glancing around even though she\u2019d seen it several times in the five years she\u2019d lived next door. But that had been for silly requests or neighborly things. Asking him to get a tree trimmed was one thing, and didn\u2019t really compare to what she intended to ask now. And it hit her how very nice his house was. What did the man do for a living to afford such a place at his age? He couldn\u2019t be much older than thirty. Family money?</p><p>Noah walked past her and his dark grey dress shirt brushed against her bare shoulder. She suppressed a shiver, smoothed her sundress, and followed him. And she did her best to keep from staring at the smooth line of his wide shoulders, and the way his pants revealed one of the nicest butts she\u2019d seen in...well, ever.</p> <p>Down girl. There was no doubt about it, Noah was attractive. Her sister had asked once if Alice\u2019s neighbor was cute. The word didn\u2019t apply. Even the word handsome didn\u2019t do him justice. Erotic. Sensual. Dangerous. But never simply handsome. And certainly not cute.</p><p>With dark hair cropped close, a sharp jaw, and a Roman nose, he made her breath catch every time she saw him. But the chiseled features had nothing over his eyes. Dark and impenetrable, he had the bluest eyes she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>She half tripped on his hallway rug, but managed to catch herself before she fell. Noah glanced back, and her face burned.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair. Not only was he handsome, but he had a body that promised to be lean and perfect, even though it had been covered in expensive clothing every time she\u2019d seen him.</p> <p>Well, every time she\u2019d seen him close-up. A glimpse or two from her balcony while he took a midnight swim in his pool hardly counted. She couldn\u2019t make out much detail in the moonlight.</p><p>Besides, fantasizing about him was pointless. She wasn\u2019t ready to move on yet, anyway. She liked being alone. Sure, she got a little lonely sometimes, but she could deal with that a lot more easily than she could the alternative. On her own, she didn\u2019t have to worry about keeping her guard up, or what anyone else thought of her choices. She didn\u2019t have to go to the constant string of parties Brent enjoyed, didn\u2019t have to watch out for his dark moods.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d he asked when they reached the kitchen.</p><p>She leaned on the granite breakfast bar, ignoring the barstools tucked beneath it. He\u2019d obviously spent a lot on redoing the home with the nicest finishes around. Granite and marble abounded, and the floors were some sort of dark, exotic wood.</p><p>God, yes. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She had to get this over with quickly. Before she lost her nerve. Before the alcohol content in her blood got any lower.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Miss Shepard?\u201d He stepped away from the refrigerator and turned those brilliant eyes on her. She lost her train of thought. Her stomach clenched, and she could only stare.</p><p>\u201cMiss Shepard?\u201d he asked again, but his tone was different. Lower.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d The kitchen smelled clean\u2014almost too clean and fresh. The man didn\u2019t cook much, she would bet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you came to ask me?\u201d</p><p>No. Crap. \u201cNo, I\u2014this is a nice place is all. A little impersonal though.\u201d She glanced nervously at her surroundings. \u201cIt could use some clutter.\u201d Had she just told him his house could use some clutter? What the heck was wrong with her? There weren\u2019t enough drinks in the world to excuse the comment...at least from her mouth. They weren\u2019t exactly close.</p><p>He looked a little bemused. \u201cYou think my home could use some clutter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, kind of. I mean, it\u2019s nice. Just not terribly homey.\u201d Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve had some appletinis and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can smell them,\u201d he said.</p><p>Double crap. Did she smell that bad? But his neutral expression didn\u2019t support that theory, and if anything, he leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to ask me something? You\u2019re not only here to insult my decor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...sorry. Yes, I did want to ask you something.\u201d But asking him then felt very wrong. She\u2019d already made a fool of herself. Her stomach swirled. Oh God, too many drinks.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d The words escaped her before she could stop them. Dammit. The room churned.</p><p>Noah stared at her, apparently dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she muttered, then turned away.</p><p>She practically ran out of Noah\u2019s and across the short distance to her own home. Her front door slammed behind her, and she turned back and pressed her face against the hard wood. After a few seconds, her nausea lifted, but it was too late. Damn those appletinis. And damn her nerves.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that Noah was gorgeous and always seemed so polite. Since she\u2019d come to live at her grandma\u2019s home, he\u2019d been a constant presence in the large house next door. And from the very day she moved in, she\u2019d noticed him. Who wouldn\u2019t? The man was over six feet of pure hunk.</p><p>She had to do something\u2014and fast. She couldn\u2019t afford self-pity. A backup plan, that\u2019s what she needed. Maybe she could ask someone at work to go with her. Her fellow accountants might not match the muscly goodness of Noah, but there were a couple who were handsome enough. And they\u2019d be a much safer option anyway.</p><p>She grabbed her cell phone from her purse and fumbled around with it until she found her sister\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cHidey-ho,\u201d her sister, Cindy, said. Their usual silly greeting never failed to bring a smile to Alice\u2019s face, but tonight she couldn\u2019t seem to muster a grin.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy, you sound depressed. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally embarrassed myself in front of my neighbor. I went to ask him to your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big guy you told me about? Wow. How many drinks did that take?\u201d Her sister\u2019s voice was laced with amusement.</p><p>\u201cEnough. I\u2019ll have a hell of a hangover tomorrow. And worse, I didn\u2019t even ask. I lost my nerve.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cAnd, I almost threw up on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. Maybe I\u2019ll ask someone else.\u201d She kicked her sandals off and trotted into her kitchen. Unlike the spacious room Noah\u2019s house sported, it was cozy and homey. And covered in flowers. Flowery wallpaper and rugs. Just like Grandma left it.</p><p>\u201cYou almost threw up on him?\u201d Cindy laughed. \u201cToo many appletinis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and too many nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you ask someone from work, then? You haven\u2019t threatened to puke on any of them, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s words echoed her own thoughts, but a niggling of worry held her back. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It seems like that could make work awkward.\u201d Even as she said it, she knew it was true. She couldn\u2019t ask one of the passable men from work. That was just begging for trouble. She had to be smart, put her emotions aside. If she had to, she\u2019d grin and bear it. Go to her sister\u2019s wedding alone and look like a dateless loser in front of her ex.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cJust come by yourself. It\u2019ll be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Brent bringing a date?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to check the guest list\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, yes. He\u2019s bringing a date. And yes, it\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s her. The words pinged through her head like a pinball. Suddenly, the appletinis pressed against her stomach again, full force.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry sis, I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d She hit the end button on her phone and took a deep breath, grateful for the solid wall under her hand when she reached out to lean on it for support.</p><p>Slowly, she made her way to the couch and plopped down. She had to come up with a plan, but her thoughts didn\u2019t want to come into focus. Cindy\u2019s words reverberated, smiting any attempt she could make at a fully-formed thought.</p><p>He was bringing her. That meant they were still together. They weren\u2019t just a fling. He really cared about Kristen.</p><p>He never cared about me.</p><p>No. She couldn\u2019t let herself go down that line of thought. She had to pull it together, get her mind straight, and figure out a new plan. Going down without a fight wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>But heading back to Noah\u2019s right away wasn\u2019t an option either. Her stomach wasn\u2019t reliable after the appletinis, and she needed to regroup. She itched to jump on the web and continue her genealogy research. Working on her family tree relaxed her. Something about researching her family\u2019s history, finding interesting old snippets of their lives from so long ago, gave her a rush. But after all those drinks, she was in no condition to make sense of old records.</p><p>Instead, she got a few hours of sleep, and then formulated her plan of attack in the shower. Courage\u2014not liquid courage, but plain old determination\u2014was what she needed to ask Noah. And if he said no? Well, she\u2019d cross that bridge when she came to it.</p><p>The next morning, the smell of coffee saturated the air, and she watched the pot fill impatiently. She\u2019d just have to appeal to his good human nature. Noah was a nice man. He\u2019d always waved at her when they passed on the street, and he even helped her that time she\u2019d locked herself out of her house. Something about him made her comfortable, and she knew enough to trust her instincts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That had been a hard lesson to learn.</p><p>A photo of her grandmother, taken when she was a young woman, caught Alice\u2019s attention, and she slid her finger against the side of the frame. The picture was her favorite. Her grandmother had been so strong, and the turn of her jaw and determined eyes in the picture revealed the woman of courage she had been. And for some reason, looking into her grandmother\u2019s eyes fueled her confidence. Like it always did.</p><p>She applied some makeup and threw on a new sundress and then checked herself in the mirror. The pretty dress hung just right over her suntanned body, maybe a bit more revealing than the one she\u2019d worn the day before. Couldn\u2019t hurt, right?</p> <p>A cup of coffee burned its way down her throat, but it gave her back the bit of energy the alcohol had robbed her of. Radiating confidence she wasn\u2019t entirely certain she felt, she forced a smile onto her face and headed back to her neighbor\u2019s.</p><p>She\u2019d convince Noah. She had to.</p><p>Noah opened the door hesitantly, half expecting his pretty neighbor to be waiting for him with an unuttered idea gleaming in her eyes, and random insults on her tongue. He\u2019d half expected her to return the night before, but either her embarrassment or the amount of alcohol she\u2019d consumed must have gotten the better of her, because she hadn\u2019t shown up again. Thankfully, he\u2019d distracted her and managed to get her to leave before he\u2019d had to answer her questions about his job, which would inevitably lead to questions about his life. Questions he couldn\u2019t answer. But a very male face greeted him with an easygoing smile, and his stomach dropped in unexpected disappointment.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to invite me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Come in, Charles,\u201d he said, and then stepped back so the other man could enter. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve been here a dozen times in the last year alone. You don\u2019t need the formal invitation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I know, but old habits. You know the drill,\u201d Charles said as he wandered toward the kitchen.</p><p>Noah grimaced but didn\u2019t reply. He knew how old habits became ingrained, if you let them. Noah was all about habits. All about keeping things safe and avoiding change.</p><p>\u201cYou could stand to loosen up on some of those old habits,\u201d Charles said, his gaze surveying the house. His frown made Noah think of Alice\u2019s assessment that he needed more clutter. \u201cI don\u2019t think a single thing has moved in here since you decorated a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the word?\u201d Noah asked. His decor was fine. And it wasn\u2019t up for discussion with his friend or his pretty neighbor.</p><p>Charles opened the refrigerator door and pulled out two beers. \u201cLet\u2019s talk out back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a beautiful, cloudy day in California, my friend. Such a day shouldn\u2019t be wasted indoors. Especially since your deck is shaded.\u201d</p><p>Noah took one of the beers and nodded. This couldn\u2019t be good. Charles wanted to go outside. Had offered him a beer. His own beer, but still. The news couldn\u2019t be what he wanted to hear.</p><p>They went out to his back deck and he shot a quick glance at Alice\u2019s house. Her second floor balcony offered her a bit of a view of his backyard. Not the whole area, she was at the wrong angle for that, and he\u2019d had his landscaping designed for privacy. But she could see parts of his pool. And he could watch her read out there. Which she did, almost nightly. Sometimes with a glass of wine, and sometimes with only a book to keep her company.</p><p>Watching her was wrong. He had no right. But he couldn\u2019t seem to help himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Charles asked, his smooth tone curious.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo eloquent, my friend. So polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, tell me.\u201d Charles was stalling. Great. That could only mean one thing.</p> <p>Charles took a long drink of his beer. \u201cAll right. They\u2019ve decided to go ahead with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still working on it. So is Alex. We\u2019ll get it fixed, but it might be best if you get out of town while we do.\u201d He sat down heavily onto one of the cushioned outdoor chairs surrounding the large table. \u201cCan you do that? Shouldn\u2019t need to be gone for long. A couple of days to appeal the ruling. Maybe a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly can I go where they won\u2019t find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a boat departing day after tomorrow,\u201d a clear voice said from behind them.</p><p>Charles jumped from his chair and Noah spun to face the intruder. When the bright dress\u2014pink this time\u2014came into view from around the corner of his house, he held up a hand to stop Charles from accosting her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing creeping around in my back yard, Miss Shepard?\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to keep the anger from his tone. She\u2019d invaded his space without being invited. Listened in to his conversation. The things she could have heard\u2014well, it wasn\u2019t worth worrying about. They hadn\u2019t said anything important.</p><p>Even worse, she was just as beautiful as always. Her long blonde hair was pulled back in a casual design, begging to be released. A minimal amount of make-up adorned her sun-touched skin. And her body curved in all the right places.</p><p>\u201cAlice,\u201d she corrected, voice perky. A large smile lit up her face as if she hadn\u2019t heard the warning in his tone. \u201cHi there.\u201d She gave Charles a small wave.</p><p>Charles stepped forward and took one of Alice\u2019s delicate hands into his, flashing her an appreciative grin. Charles\u2019s flirtatious personality and easy confidence had never bothered Noah before, but he couldn\u2019t keep the frown from his face when Alice smiled at his friend.</p><p>Few women resisted Charles. He looked like he should be on a surfboard with his dark blond hair, which appeared to have been highlighted by the sun, and his easygoing attitude. Charles knew exactly how attractive he was to the opposite sex. A fact of which he availed himself at every opportunity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Charles, as Noah would tell you if he wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude?\u201d Alice asked with a teasing smile, and Charles let out a loud roar of a laugh.</p><p>Noah stepped next to them, slightly in Alice\u2019s personal space. As he intended, she released Charles\u2019s hand and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI can see she knows you well, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know me at all,\u201d he said, never moving his gaze from Alice\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cWhy are you here, Miss Shepard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlice. Why can\u2019t you call me Alice?\u201d She waved her hand in the air, dismissing any attempt at an answer he might make. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer your door, and I could see you were probably home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeering through windows now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Her voice remained calm, but a bit of pink crept up her neck. She had enough sense to at least be a little embarrassed. \u201cBut a BMW was in your driveway\u2014your car, Charles?\u201d she asked, glancing to her side to include Charles in their conversation.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Charles replied, a big grin still engulfing his face.</p><p>She nodded to him. \u201cPlus, you never go anywhere during the day. Anyway, I decided to see if you were out back. Pretty sculpture.\u201d Her gaze shifted to the sun he\u2019d painstakingly carved from wood that was set between the house and pool.</p><p>Noah lifted an eyebrow at her and grinned, his ire lifting a bit at the thought of her watching him and at her admiration of his work. \u201cDo you monitor my back yard a lot, Alice?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help the flirtation in his tone. It wasn\u2019t the right thing to do, but he\u2019d be damned if she didn\u2019t bring it out in him. She\u2019d been spying on him. Somehow, that made his occasional\u2014and that\u2019s all they were, occasional\u2014glances at her balcony while she read more acceptable. She was as guilty as he was.</p><p>\u201cI do not,\u201d she said primly, but the red that had started up her neck flushed her cheeks, and if he wasn\u2019t mistaken, her pulse had kicked up a notch or five. \u201cI\u2014well, never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re here because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I know we don\u2019t know each other very well. Or, at all, really. I mean, we\u2019ve lived right next door to one another for what is it...five years now? But you\u2019re not exactly the sociable type so\u2014\u201d Her words stopped abruptly and her cheeks reddened even more.</p><p>Charles coughed, stifling the laugh for Alice\u2019s benefit, no doubt.</p><p>Noah\u2019s mouth twitched, but he forced away the grin. \u201cI\u2019m aware of my anti-social nature, Miss\u2014Alice. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and plowed ahead. \u201cWell, social or not, I could use your help. And there\u2019s a free cruise in it for you. All you have to do is agree to...a little game of pretend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA game of pretend,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes. A game where you pretend to be my new boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long, awkward moment. She wanted him to do what?</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d she continued, \u201cit\u2019s not like we have to really do anything. I just need you to pretend to be with me during the few social events of the cruise where we\u2019d have to show up together. Like the wedding. The rehearsal dinner. Maybe a few other events. And the rest of the time is yours.\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>Charles gave up his fight, and collapsed into a chair laughing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Alice.\u201d He managed. \u201cIt\u2019s just...the look on Noah\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alice shot a quick, nervous glance at Charles, but trudged on with her sales pitch. \u201cNot that you look like you need a free vacation. But it would really help me out and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand, and she faltered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He waved at her. \u201cExplain. Slowly.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and let it out in a big whoosh. \u201cI have to go on a weeklong cruise for my sister\u2019s wedding. The problem is, her fianc\u00e9\u2019s best man happens to be my ex. And I don\u2019t want to show up alone like some giant goober who couldn\u2019t get a date.\u201d</p><p>His amusement vanished, and Charles\u2019s laughter faded.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want to use me to get the schmuck back?\u201d Noah asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh no.

Go with your pretty neighbor.\u201d Charles got up from the chair and stepped to the side so Noah wasn\u2019t blocking his view of Alice so effectively. \u201cHelp her make this rogue rue the day\u2014\u201d Charles paused and turned to Alice. \u201cHe is a rogue, I assume.\u201d</p><p>She started. \u201cUh...yes. That\u2019s a good word for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d Charles slapped Noah on the back, hard enough for it to leave sting behind. \u201cThis is perfect, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Noah insisted. He couldn\u2019t go on a cruise with the woman; he could barely stand to be this close to her. She didn\u2019t smell of apples today, but some sort of fruity scent still clung to her. Maybe from her shampoo? Whatever it was, it made his mouth water and his teeth ache.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, exactly?\u201d Charles asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a one-week cruise down the Pacific coastline to Mexico. Nice and relaxing.\u201d</p><p>Noah ran his fingers through his hair and glared at her. Women. They just oozed difficulty. Especially this one.</p><p>\u201cWell that does sound perfect. When does he need to be ready to go?\u201d Charles, was as close to giddy as was possible for a vampire who\u2019d been around for decades longer than he appeared.</p> <p>\u201cDay after tomorrow. I\u2019ll come by at noon to get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait a damn minute,\u201d Noah said, finally finding his voice. \u201cI\u2019m not going on any cruise. And I\u2019m definitely not going to play your boyfriend so you can get your idiot ex back.\u201d</p><p>Alice grimaced and hurt flashed behind her eyes, but she didn\u2019t look any less determined. \u201cLook, I get it, okay? I\u2019m not your type. But you obviously need to get out of town for a week for some probably nefarious reason, and I need a date.\u201d Her determined expression faltered for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything illegal, is it? Why you need to get out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s girl trouble,\u201d Charles provided, most unhelpfully.</p><p>Her smile came back full force. \u201cPerfect!\u201d</p><p>Noah opened his mouth to argue and then snapped it shut. What was the use? Charles was right. He needed to get out of town or he\u2019d have to put up with far more than a single week of discomfort. And when he got back, things would be settled.</p><p>And then he\u2019d have to move.</p> <p>His chest tightened at the thought, but there was no way around it. Alice had become too comfortable just dropping in. She\u2019d become too observant of his habits. If she saw too much, she\u2019d be in far more trouble than she could imagine.</p><p>And if she figured out he was a vampire, he wasn\u2019t sure there would be anything he could do to save her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be perfect,\u201d she said, and she reached out and patted his arm, making his chest constrict tighter as he met her bright eyes. \u201cTwo birds, one cruise ship.\u201d</p><p>Alice waved goodbye after confirming he\u2019d be ready to go the day after next, and then disappeared back around the side of his house.</p><p>Noah turned to Charles, and pushed down the urge to punch his good friend in the nose. \u201cInside. Now.\u201d</p><p>Charles grinned at his tone, but followed him into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this a problem?\u201d</p><p>Because she smells too damn good? Her particularly intoxicating blend of apples and alcohol last night had almost forced his fangs out in front of her. But he couldn\u2019t tell Charles that. He was a friend, but there were limits. Self-control was the most important thing to vampires, and if Charles thought his hung by a thread\u2014no matter how good she smelled\u2014he might decide he shouldn\u2019t fight the ruling.</p><p>\u201cLook, I get you don\u2019t want to be trapped on a cruise ship for a week. That\u2019s a lot of sun to avoid. But this is perfect, really. And they won\u2019t be able to track you easily. Pull out some cash before you go, and you won\u2019t even need to use a credit card. I\u2019ll get you an untraceable cell phone.\u201d</p><p>Charles thought the sun was his biggest concern about the trip. Good. The sun was a worry\u2014it didn\u2019t cause him to burst into flames like in the movies, it could just sicken him a great deal\u2014but it definitely wasn\u2019t number one on his list of potential complications.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he said, stiffly. Being mad at Charles was pointless. His friend was right. But he didn\u2019t have to like it.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Charles whistled softly, \u201cby the looks of your neighbor, I think it could be a fun trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I have to live next door to her, she\u2019s not a chew toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bite her to sleep with her. Could be a fun week, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d Young for a vampire, Charles made full use of his energy to have many fun weeks with many different women. But Noah was older, and he no longer found one night stands as fun as he used to. And he stuck with women who he didn\u2019t have to hide his nature from\u2014fellow vampires. Old friends who were traveling through town. Women who wouldn\u2019t get attached, nor tempt him to become attached. Alice had been the first woman in a long time to even tempt him into thinking about a human.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t the kind of girl he could relieve that itch with. Rage fired from his gut at the idea of anyone\u2014even himself\u2014using Alice for a week of fun, only to say goodbye to her. She wasn\u2019t the type, and he held his fists at his sides to avoid showing Charles how he felt about the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cShe lives next door. If I slept with her, she\u2019d assume that would give her the right to drop in whenever.\u201d He forced the words out, hoping Charles would believe that\u2019s what worried him.</p><p>Charles didn\u2019t look convinced, but he tilted his head in a quick nod. \u201cTrue. You\u2019re right. Best to keep things friendly. But it\u2019s also best you go on this cruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But if I come back here to a wedding, I\u2019m going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Alice still wore her optimistic smile\u2014and yet another sundress\u2014when she knocked on his door the morning of the cruise. His chest lightened at the sight of her. What was it about her that did that to him every time? The constant positive energy radiating from her? Maybe. He didn\u2019t get out much anymore. He needed to fix that, leave the house more once he got back from this cruise. A little time around other women and she wouldn\u2019t affect him so damn much.</p><p>\u201cHi, there. Are you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>A whiff of something fruity flowed from her, different than the appletinis she\u2019d smelled of the night she\u2019d failed to ask him to go. She smelled good enough to eat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he said, unable to keep a touch of annoyance from his tone. He still wasn\u2019t entirely happy about the situation he\u2019d been forced into. Damn The Council.</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cAren\u2019t we grumpy this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>She had no idea. He\u2019d packed quickly, and picked up the cell phone from Charles. Alex and Charles could contact him that way, but he\u2019d be difficult to track by The Council. Of course, they had other ways of finding him, but this might slow them down in case they jumped the gun. \u201cJust need some caffeine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can pick up some coffee on the way.\u201d</p><p>Perky as she was, he didn\u2019t think she really needed the caffeine, but he could definitely use it. Not what he\u2019d like to be drinking\u2014nor the best beverage from which to get his energy\u2014but he\u2019d have to deal with it. Besides, he\u2019d fed well with Charles the night before. Although Charles, like usual, had been annoyed Noah insisted on bagged blood. He\u2019d be okay for a while yet.</p><p>He carried his suitcase and followed her out to her car, setting the house alarm along the way.</p><p>\u201cThat was a long security code,\u201d she said after they were loaded into her Accord.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the size of my television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Not to mention your furniture. And I suspect a lot of the art on your walls is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been casing my house, Miss Shepard?\u201d He slipped his sunglasses on.</p><p>She snorted in a most unladylike way. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m only taking you on vacation with me so my accomplices can rob you.\u201d Her smile dropped off. \u201cActually, that\u2019s going to sound super suspicious if someone actually does rob you while we\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>A laugh escaped him before he realized it was coming. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m sure of about you, Miss\u2014Alice. You\u2019re not a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d Her smile returned in full force.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you could lie believably if your life depended on it.\u201d Was that what made her so attractive to him? He glanced at her and leaned into the door as they made a hard turn into the Starbucks drive-thru.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said good-naturedly, dismissing his observation.</p><p>They ordered at the staticy box. A simple black coffee for him, but her order gave him pause.</p><p>\u201cApple cider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpicy apple cider,\u201d she said, pulling the car around to the window.</p><p>\u201cNot coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had coffee earlier. It\u2019s already twelve-thirty.\u201d She put the car into park and then turned to look at him, pushing her sunglasses up. \u201cDo you think I need more caffeine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and took their order from the gangly Starbucks\u2019 boy at the window and slipped the drinks into the cup holder sandwiched between their seats. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He played with her radio until he found an oldies station. \u201cI still don\u2019t think this is the best idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis whole thing. Why can\u2019t you tell the guy your boyfriend can\u2019t come?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019d be convincing.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t argue, and besides, he\u2019d committed to this course of action. He\u2019d see it through. And Charles was right. He needed to be out of town when The Council came calling. Alex might be able to wrangle him out of the arranged bonding, but it would be more difficult if he were easily accessible. It would take Alex time to change their minds. Vampires\u2014especially ones as old as those who graced The Council\u2014did not easily alter their paths.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t mind Alice\u2019s company. Of course, that was the heart of the problem.</p><p>They drove most of the way to the cruise ship in companionable silence. He did his best to ignore the smell of apples, and beneath it, the fresh scent of her skin. A short time later, they were making their way through the boarding line.</p><p>\u201cHow many people are coming to this cruise wedding?\u201d he asked Alice while they waited for an elderly couple in line in front of them to check in.</p> <p>\u201cHundred and twenty-five. Something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of people to coordinate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not everyone is attending everything. She\u2019s left the activities pretty open. The wedding party has more required things to go to\u2014that\u2019s us, by the way\u2014but for the most part, people are on their own except for the wedding and reception.\u201d She tucked a chunk of hair that had escaped her clip behind her ear. Again the urge to yank the clip and release her long hair to tumble down her back hit him.</p><p>\u201cWhat things do we have to attend?\u201d At least the salty smell this close to the ocean made her scent fade to the background.</p><p>She reached out and took his passport from his hand, her fingers brushing his ever so slightly. A spark of heat ran up his arm from her touch. She stepped away to hand their identification to the young woman behind the registration desk.</p><p>\u201cThe rehearsal dinner, of course. Cindy will have a few other things for us to do, too. I\u2019m sure she has an itinerary mapped out with games, activities, that sort of thing. And the bachelor and bachelorette parties, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a little bit of a sun allergy, so I\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, I think most of the planned stuff will be indoors. For stuff that\u2019s not, I\u2019m sure I can get you a doctor\u2019s note.\u201d She winked at him and then took back their identification. She paused before handing his back. \u201cSun allergy, huh? What are you, some kind of vampire?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth and forced a small smile onto his face. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>His irritation must have shown, because a frown swept away her good humor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Noah. That was thoughtless of me. I shouldn\u2019t have made light of your condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Not like I haven\u2019t heard that joke before.\u201d He hadn\u2019t, because he\u2019d never used such an excuse before, nor had he needed to. He didn\u2019t spend enough time with humans to require an excuse to avoid the daylight. But he wasn\u2019t about to tell her that. Besides, if she felt guilty, she was less likely to push him for more information about his \u201ccondition\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go ahead and board. We\u2019re supposed to meet everyone in an hour at,\u201d she consulted a computer printout pulled from her purse, \u201cone of the buffet areas, looks like, for a late lunch. Not sure we\u2019ll have time to stop by the room. Let\u2019s just send all the bags to be delivered.\u201d</p><p>Arguing about the bags seemed like a good way to make her suspicious, so he decided against it. He opened his mouth to ask about her family, so he\u2019d know what to expect, but then snapped it shut. Asking about them might give the wrong impression. Like he was interested. Which he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Their bags disappeared with a promise that they\u2019d be delivered, and he resisted shooting a nervous glance after them. He chastised himself for even bothering to worry. If they were scanned or even rifled through, the blood would look like nothing out of the ordinary in what appeared to be old shampoo and conditioner bottles. And they wouldn\u2019t leak, because the bottles\u2014despite their commonplace appearance\u2014were specially designed to carry blood.</p> <p>He walked with Alice through the windowed walkway and onto the ship. The lines had grown while they checked in, and he was glad she\u2019d thought to arrive early. The idea of an hour in a line like that, surrounded by people, made him itchy.</p><p>The cruise ship was exactly what he\u2019d expected: gaudy, brilliant, and fake. Brass colored metal bars ran everywhere, keeping patrons from falling to their deaths off walkways into common areas. Purple and maroon carpets, beaten down by the feet of thousands of travelers, covered the floors.</p><p>He loathed it.</p><p>But Alice grinned at the false luxury surrounding them, and even laughed at the sight of a garish fountain that sported a lion\u2019s head with a stream of water cascading from its roaring mouth. For a brief moment, he wondered if he\u2019d misjudged her.</p><p>No. Bad taste and all, she was still dangerous.</p><p>\u201cGod, isn\u2019t this terrible?\u201d she asked, pointing out an abstract sculpture of geometric designs crisscrossing, brightly colored to match the decor surrounding it.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were enjoying the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s horrible. I love it.\u201d</p><p>The opposing sentiments of her words didn\u2019t seem to bother her, so he didn\u2019t push for clarification. If she could love and hate it, who was he to call her crazy?</p><p>They turned the corner into the dining area, and a loud scream sounded from across the room. A tall blonde, at least six inches taller than Alice\u2019s five-foot-three inch frame, flung herself into Alice\u2019s arms. And high-pitched chatter, streaming almost too fast for him follow the actual words, filled the air.</p><p>A couple of minutes passed while he stood awkwardly next to Alice and the woman he assumed had to be her sister. Feeling forgotten, and more than a little annoyed with himself for the spike of loneliness that followed, he crossed his arms and did his best to look like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Cindy, this is Noah. Noah, this is my sister, Cindy. The bride.\u201d</p><p>Cindy\u2019s smile was vibrant, like her sister\u2019s. But her eyes were serious when she shook his hand and examined him. She looked a lot like Alice. The same blonde hair adorned her face\u2014albeit in a shorter, more modern cut than Alice wore\u2014and she had the same brown eyes. But he didn\u2019t feel the same energy in her, the same vibrancy.</p><p>Cindy Shepard was a more cautious soul than her sister.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d he replied, \u201cand congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Cindy turned to Alice and added conspiratorially, \u201cWait until you see the young hunk Mom brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucinda!\u201d A high-pitched voice called from only a few feet away.</p><p>Cindy winced. Noah stepped back to avoid being trampled by the slight woman that rushed past him. An older version of Cindy pulled the bride into her arms, then Alice.</p><p>Alice made the introductions after extracting herself from what turned out to be her mother\u2019s arms, introducing Noah as a friend. The woman gave him a big hug that forced his breath from his lungs. He stiffened in her embrace and patted her awkwardly on the back. A soft yearning touched his chest, and he wrestled with the temptation to relax into the hug.</p><p>When was the last time someone had hugged him?</p><p>He stepped away from Edna Shepard and shook himself mentally. He needed to keep his shit together. This wasn\u2019t his family. It was an acting gig.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet a friend of Alice\u2019s,\u201d Edna said. Her words dripped with speculation, and she reached out and squeezed his shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s been hinting around about bringing you for weeks, of course, but getting details out of this girl is impossible. She\u2019s so tight-lipped.\u201d</p><p>Noah stifled a laugh. Alice and tight-lipped didn\u2019t belong in the same sentence, so she must have blurted her intention to bring a friend, and then spent weeks finding someone to fill the position. He shot Alice a glance and there was a warning in her eyes. Didn\u2019t her mother know his presence was a farce?</p><p>\u201cNow that I see you though, I can see why.\u201d She eyed him up and down, and he felt an inexplicable blush crawl up his neck. \u201cYou are a prince, aren\u2019t you? If I were a couple of decades younger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Alice and Cindy said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret, he knows I\u2019m teasing,\u201d Edna said, but the glint in her eye belied her words, and he couldn\u2019t help the real smile that forced itself onto his face. He took her hand and kissed the back of it, and she laughed and made her way to the next group of family members.</p><p>Alice tugged on his shirt and led him to a buffet that seemed to be for their party alone, if the chatter amongst the guests was any indication. He selected a couple of things he particularly enjoyed: fresh fruit and a turkey sandwich. He didn\u2019t have to eat normal food to survive, and it didn\u2019t do much for him, but keeping up appearances was important. And he still loved the taste of strawberries.</p><p>He glanced at Alice\u2019s plate when they sat down at a table full of her cousins. A large hamburger and French fries. And a giant slice of chocolate cake.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in healthy eating, do you?\u201d he asked, but when her smile faltered, he regretted the words. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you need to,\u201d he found himself clarifying, \u201cyou\u2019re in great shape.\u201d His eyes flashed over her sundress-adorned body, now mostly blocked from his view by the table between them. But every delicious curve was burned into his memory. He felt himself start to harden in his jeans and whipped his focus back to her face.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered, her attention on her food.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop it, okay?\u201d Yep. She definitely thought he\u2019d been critiquing her appearance. Dammit. He should clear the air, but that could be misconstrued. And he couldn\u2019t afford for her to think he cared. She might get it in her head to pursue him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to resist her.</p><p>They ate in silence, then Cindy came by to tell them it was almost time for miniature golf. Alice emptied her plate, despite his comment, which brought a smile to his face. The woman wasn\u2019t going to change her lunch because of what she thought was a critical statement about her figure. Good for her.</p><p>\u201cLucinda!\u201d A loud voice called, hitting an octave that made Noah cringe. Edna waved from across the room, and Alice\u2019s sister waved back.</p> <p>\u201cOne sec, Mom,\u201d Cindy called back. Then to Noah, \u201cShe\u2019s the only one who ever calls me by my full name.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if she was just making conversation, or if he was being very specifically warned not to call her Lucinda.</p><p>Alice turned to him and Cindy went to tend to her mother.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess I\u2019ll catch up with you later?\u201d he asked.</p><p>A quizzical expression touched her face. \u201cBut we have miniature golf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, whoops, guess I forgot to mention golf. Cindy had a few more things planned than I thought.\u201d She shifted her weight and looked at her fingernails, as if checking for a flaw in her manicure. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth at the thought of spending even more time in Alice\u2019s company, with her tempting scent and sparkling smile. He could resist for a week. Only a week. One week of his very long life.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said. Besides, what was the worst that could happen while playing miniature golf?</p><p>Mini-golfing, as it turned out, was very dangerous. Alice bent over her club at the ninth hole and examined her route carefully, and Noah did his best to keep his eyes away from her lithe form.</p><p>Nearly twenty of the guests had turned out for the mini golf after-lunch game, but they\u2019d divided into groups of four to six, and everyone moved pretty slowly through the course. The only good thing about the whole situation was the fact the course was indoors\u2014this particular one, anyway.</p><p>\u201cFore!\u201d Alice called before taking her swing. She flinched as the bright purple ball bounced off of the windmill under which she\u2019d tried to shoot it.</p> <p>He grinned when she turned around to complain about the obvious design flaws in the course.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure you can blame the course, dear,\u201d Edna said, and Alice shot her a dramatic glare.</p><p>\u201cJust because you obviously paid extra for a magic ball doesn\u2019t mean the course isn\u2019t flawed, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Noah chuckled and took his own shot, and then laughed outright at Alice\u2019s cry of outrage as his ball rolled through the windmill and right up to the hole.</p><p>\u201cBeginner\u2019s luck,\u201d Alice muttered, her anger obviously feigned.</p><p>He\u2019d told Alice the truth. He\u2019d never played miniature golf. Apparently, even after two hundred years, the world still held its new experiences. He wished he could make The Council understand this. Then he wouldn\u2019t be stuck on this ship, trying too hard to keep his desires at bay. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to being new at anything, so he was relieved to find all it required was a healthy dose of coordination and a little luck. Surprisingly, he wasn\u2019t the best of their five-some. Edna Shepard had him by two swings. Apparently, when it came to mini-golf, Alice\u2019s mother had better reflexes than a vampire.</p><p>They played through another four holes before one of Alice\u2019s swings ricocheted her ball off a clown\u2019s face to connect with the side of Noah\u2019s head.</p><p>He glared at her, rubbing the back of his skull and feigning pain.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the grin that rose to his face at her horrified expression. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to swing harder than that to take me down.\u201d</p><p>A tentative smile rose, but her blush remained. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Here, let me show you how it\u2019s done,\u201d he said.</p><p>She quirked an eyebrow at him and lined the ball up again. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet your legs a little farther apart, and keep your wrists straight.\u201d He closed the distance between them to help her with her stance and ignored the little jolts of electricity that ran up his fingertips as he touched her softly on her shoulders, then her arms.</p><p>\u201cBend here,\u201d he murmured, touching the small of her back, a slight brush of his skin on her dress. He was close, too close. The smell of her filled his nose and he fought not to lean in and see if her hair was as soft as it looked.</p><p>She took in a quick breath. He stepped back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swing like it\u2019s a baseball. Tap it.\u201d</p><p>She swung at the ball slowly, and it rolled forward into the hole.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Alice yelled. She bounced up and down a couple of times and then gave him a quick hug before pulling back with a dazzling smile on her face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>His reply caught in his throat.</p><p>She seemed unaware of his discomfort. Turning to her sister, she said, \u201cNext game is all mine.\u201d</p><p>Alice performed better through the next few holes. She didn\u2019t break any records, but no balls flew at his head either, so he counted that as a win. Noah went first at the last hole, and managed his first hole-in-one for the night. Alice cheered him on, and he gave her a mock bow.</p><p>\u201cI have to make a call,\u201d he said when Alice positioned herself to hit the final hole.</p><p>She waved at him and he walked to the entrance of the golf area, handing his club off to the attendant along the way. Glancing around to ensure he was as alone as possible when trapped on a ship with thousands of tourists, he hit Charles\u2019s name on his phone. It rang through to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cCall me when you get this. I need an update.\u201d He hit end and then tracked down another number on his contact list and dialed it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d an emotionless voice said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles requested an audience. Could be a couple of days. They aren\u2019t happy you left the city,\u201d Alex replied, his tone still calm.</p><p>Noah had the sudden urge to reach through the phone and shake the detached man on the other end of the line. Alex was old, older even than Noah, and he didn\u2019t even bother to pretend to feel things anymore. He hadn\u2019t always been that way, but centuries of life would do that to a vampire. And Alex had been old when Noah was made vampire. His lack of humanity was exactly the sort of thing the bonding was supposed to prevent in Noah, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let The Council decide his fate like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going through with it.\u201d</p><p>Alex snorted, and Noah tensed. That was the closest thing to emotion he\u2019d heard from his friend in far too long.</p><p>\u201cUnless they give you a stay, you will go through with it, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Noah tapped his fist lightly against the wall, forcing down the urge to really hit something. That was the crux of it, wasn\u2019t it? The Council wasn\u2019t disobeyed, not when it really mattered. And they took bondings very seriously.</p><p>A fact Alex knew all too well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>Now it was Noah\u2019s turn to snort with derision. \u201cYou\u2019ve been bonded for five years and haven\u2019t set eyes on your so-called bride since the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Like I said, it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>Noah ran his hand over his hair, not sure what to say, but unable to hang up just yet. Alex was loyal to a fault, and he always did what he needed to in order to help his friends, but it had been a long time since he\u2019d displayed much humor. It was a treat, but held dangerous hope.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be tied to someone I don\u2019t at least care for. Hell, I don\u2019t want to be tied to any woman. Not like that. Not even for a mere decade or two.\u201d</p><p>Long silence filled the line. \u201cIt\u2019s...a responsibility,\u201d Alex said finally.</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t say what they were both thinking, although the little he said was true enough. It was a responsibility. One that had kept Alex around the last five years. One that would keep him alive\u2014whether he wanted to be or not\u2014for another five. A heavy weight settled on Noah\u2019s chest at the thought of his friend being gone.</p><p>Like humans, vampires varied in their appearance and personalities, but nearly all shared a sense of duty and honor to their fellow vampires. It was something ingrained culturally and had been for centuries. And though it was treated as a trait\u2014a sign of the mental fortitude and control required to make it as a vampire\u2014Noah had long suspected even more than mental character was at play. That magic was behind their need to preserve the lives of their fellow vampires.</p><p>And if one vampire died, his or her bondmate died as well.</p><p>This fact meant bonding was not only used to connect vampires who wished for something deeper than human marriage, but also to give life to older vampires through the psychic connection. The bond allowed younger vampires to gain strength and much-needed control, and gave older ones a chance to fall in love with life again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014hell, Alex, I know I don\u2019t need a bonding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you aren\u2019t yet so tired of this life that you\u2019re suicidal\u2014so the forced bonding would be worthless to you?\u201d Alex asked, bitterness lacing his tone. \u201cThat\u2019s what Charles will tell The Council. Two hundred or no, you haven\u2019t hit that place yet where you need a bondmate to tie you to this life. In all likelihood, they\u2019ll grant you a fifty year stay. Then you\u2019ll have a few more decades before they\u2019ll propose this again.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded to himself and then stepped even closer to the wall as a large group of young college-age students\u2014party-goers, not wedding guests, he would bet\u2014passed him on their way to miniature golf.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing these days?\u201d Noah asked, then immediately regretted the impulse.</p><p>\u201cJust as tired as always, my friend.\u201d</p><p>The line clicked and Alex was gone.</p><p>Noah shook his head. He\u2019d do anything to help Alex, but decades of trying to pull him out of the shell into which he\u2019d bound himself hadn\u2019t worked. The bonding The Council had forced on Alex hadn\u2019t revived him either. He certainly couldn\u2019t do anything during a five-minute phone call. Frustration burned in his chest. Alex was a good man. A strong warrior. A loyal friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t really believe Alex was suicidal, but he showed all of the signs of a vampire nearing the end of his life. So he\u2019d been bound to a bride, which tied his fate to hers. And like most of his kin, Alex wouldn\u2019t take the life of a young vampire in order to soothe his own pain. So his continued life\u2014for the time being\u2014was guaranteed.</p><p>\u201cHey, there.\u201d Alice still wore her bright smile, but tentativeness shadowed it now. Had something happened while he was on the phone? He glanced behind her but didn\u2019t see anything amiss.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, then more firmly, \u201cNo. Do you want to go relax for a few minutes? We have a little over an hour before dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>He followed her down a hallway and up several flights of stairs until she stopped at a room and used her keycard to open the door.</p><p>\u201cIs this your room or mine?\u201d he asked, peering in from the doorway. The suite appeared spacious for a cruise ship room. A large bed equipped with a dizzying bedspread took up most of the room space, with a loveseat and dresser filling the rest of the room. Propped up high was a flat screen television. A small table\u2014nightstand size\u2014was the only other furnishing inside the room. But sliding glass doors led to a small balcony on which he glimpsed a couple of chairs and a table. Alice\u2019s family had spared no expense on the rooms.</p><p>Most importantly, heavy curtains were pushed to one side of the door, which would allow for near total darkness during the daytime.</p> <p>He caught sight of his bags\u2014sitting right next to hers\u2014just as she turned with guilt written all over her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our room,\u201d she said.</p><p>She\u2019d expected a reaction from that news, but she didn\u2019t count on the flash of panic on his face that quickly settled into anger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our room?\u201d He stepped past her and walked through the space.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a small pullout in the couch,\u201d she said, waving at the small love seat. Even the nice rooms on the cruise ship weren\u2019t exactly spacious, but they only had to coexist for a week.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no privacy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s plenty private. The bathroom has a door. And the room and bathroom are more than twice the size of a standard cruise ship room, so really, you\u2019re getting more space than you should have expected.\u201d Her mother might not be outlandish in the way she spent her rather large fortune, but she had spared no expense when it came to her daughter\u2019s wedding. The rooms were more than adequate and were a far cry from standard cruise ship fare. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever been on a cruise before? They don\u2019t really book one to a cabin.\u201d</p><p>Besides, what did he think, that she was going to jump him the second he drifted off to sleep? Fat chance. She might have been desperate not to show up alone, but that was it. Getting laid\u2014which would no doubt be quite an experience with her sexy neighbor\u2014wasn\u2019t on the agenda.</p><p>He glared at her and she let out a big sigh. \u201cMom booked this room months ago for me and my \u201cplus-one,\u201d which turns out to be you. How could I have explained at the last minute that my boyfriend might prefer his own room?</p><p>\u201cI thought we just had to convince your ex. I didn\u2019t sign on for a sleepover. You didn\u2019t even introduce me as your boyfriend to your mother.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her toes; the pedicurist had done an excellent job.</p><p>\u201cAlice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom can\u2019t keep a secret. Scratch that\u2014my whole family can\u2019t keep a secret. Honestly, it\u2019s bad enough Cindy knows the truth. And I didn\u2019t introduce you as my boyfriend because I figured she\u2019d draw her own conclusions and I wouldn\u2019t have to lie to her face.\u201d She met his gaze and he took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one bed!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe couch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that big. I don\u2019t know what you had in mind, but I only agreed to come because I needed to get out of town.\u201d He crossed his arms and glared at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to jump you.\u201d She threw her hands up in frustration, trying to suppress the urge to run away from the room, from the man in front of her, from her embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cStill seems weird to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flatter yourself,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He looked up, and the shock on his face almost made the whole ordeal worth it. Almost. What? Did he think he was irresistible? She almost laughed at his surprise, but that would hardly prompt him to help her, so she bit her lip and suppressed the urge.</p><p>\u201cWell, what I am supposed to think? You invited me on this cruise. You want me to play your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to think that I was being honest with you,\u201d she said, amusement suddenly stifled under a wave of anger. \u201cYou think I need to trick men into my bed or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a breath of fresh air.\u201d The words rushed out of her, and she turned and headed for the door.</p><p>Safely out of the suite, she wandered the halls. Chest tight, she refused to allow herself to sink into the misery filling her. Where had this gone wrong? She wasn\u2019t supposed to feel more miserable. Noah\u2019s presence should have bolstered her confidence, not shattered it.</p><p>Did he think so little of her? It wasn\u2019t like she couldn\u2019t get a date\u2014she could. She just chose not to. And she had her reasons. Reasons that would probably make him think her a prize idiot. Not that it mattered. She didn\u2019t care what Noah thought of her. But she wasn\u2019t about to confide in him. They weren\u2019t friends. They were acquaintances who both happened to benefit from the same thing\u2014being on this cruise together.</p><p>She walked slowly down the halls, not sure exactly where she should go. She didn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for dinner. Going back to the room was exactly what she should do, but she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to face Noah again. Not yet. When she reached another open area over a public space, she stopped and leaned on the railing, peering over at the strangers milling around below.</p><p>Maybe it had been wrong to ask him to come with her. The man was a recluse, as far as she could tell. Oh, other people occasionally came to see him, and he went out once in a while, but he never seemed to have any long term visitors. And if he worked, he did so from home.</p><p>She really knew so little about him.</p><p>Then there was the sun allergy. She\u2019d had to fight to keep her face clear when he\u2019d mentioned it. But that\u2019s all it was, right? Nothing to worry about. People did have strange allergies, after all. And that explained why he only rarely went out during the day. A weird allergy was something she could deal with. And it was far more likely than him being a\u2014no. She wasn\u2019t even going to think it. It was impossible.</p><p>Her mouth went dry, and she glanced around for a water fountain. Noah had lived next door to her for five years\u2014or to be more accurate, she\u2019d lived next to him for five years. How long had he lived there? Since before her grandmother died and left her the property, at least. And she\u2019d always felt so comfortable around him, even only seeing him once a month or so. Had she allowed her instinctual trust to override her good sense? Instincts weren\u2019t always trustworthy, and his good looks probably threw them into the totally useless pile.</p><p>After all, she\u2019d trusted Brent, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>As if summoned by her thoughts, the man himself stepped out of the casino, only feet from where she stood. She stopped in her tracks and stared, heart thumping against her chest. She wasn\u2019t ready. Her outfit for the meeting still waited to be ironed in her suitcase, and she wore almost no make-up with her hair pulled back.</p><p>Her foot slid back, as if of its own will, and he looked up. Dark eyes met hers. Recognition flashed, and the slow, smooth smile that had always made her heart race slid over his face. Although still handsome, with the slick blond hair she\u2019d loved running her hands through, something about him struck her as different. Smaller.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello, baby\u2014Alice,\u201d he said, then he shook his head as if clearing their history, reminding himself he\u2019d made his choice. \u201cSorry. Habit.\u201d</p><p>Baby. She\u2019d loved him calling her that once. As if it made her his, like he was laying claim to her. But now the word twisted in her gut like a knife. Nausea rolled over her, as if the ship had shifted quickly. But only her world moved.</p><p>The word was a lie.</p><p>\u201cBrent,\u201d she managed, voice breathy. Crap. What was wrong with her? She\u2019d planned on this. Where was her uppity attitude, her holier-than-thou confidence? With one glimpse, he\u2019d knocked all of her plans away, and she felt like the same heartbroken girl he\u2019d left a year ago.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been? You look tired.\u201d His voice had always sounded so genuine, so concerned. But now she could hear that edge. The tiny bit of falseness. Had he always sounded so fake?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d She should say something else. Damn. What was she supposed to say? Her thoughts slid away as he stepped closer, arrogant smile still pulling his lips to press against his big, white teeth. \u201cHow are you?\u201d she said, finally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you brought Kristen,\u201d she said, focusing in on the woman he\u2019d left her for.</p><p>He nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI did. She\u2019s getting a manicure. I\u2014wow, this is awkward.\u201d He laughed nervously, and she pursed her lips in what she hoped looked like a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the slight crack from her tone\u2014the hurt\u2014and she cringed.</p><p>His lips pressed together in a thin line, and he watched her expression. She averted her gaze, taking in the gauche splendor that was the colorful cruise ship floor. The word \u201cbaby\u201d rung through her ears like a filthy curse word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re wishing you\u2019d never introduced your little sister to my big brother right about now,\u201d he said, tone falsely light and teasing.</p><p>A small laugh escaped her, and she forced in a deep breath. He regarded her carefully, as though waiting for something to happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, if you want, we could go sit and talk. We never got the chance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Brent.\u201d She took a deep breath and made her voice as light and airy as she could manage. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m here with someone. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d appreciate us spending time together. He\u2019s got a bit of a jealous streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here with someone?\u201d Brent asked, and the disbelief in his voice made her want to scratch his eyes out. Why hadn\u2019t she stayed in the suite? This was so not happening how she\u2019d planned it.</p> <p>Buck up, girl. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet him at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were seeing someone.\u201d He took another step closer, far too close now.</p><p>\u201cBite me, Brent,\u201d she said, voice as upbeat as she could manage. It was rude, but the last time she\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d been wrapped in her best friend\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. Baby\u2014\u201d He touched her shoulder, a friendly gesture, but more than she could deal with from him.</p><p>She stepped back, right into a hard body.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me\u2014\u201d she began, and tried to step away from the person she\u2019d run over. But unyielding hands gripped her shoulders, holding her fast against the man\u2019s firm body. Panic spiked through her.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay here, beautiful?\u201d Noah\u2019s voice vibrated against her back and relief flooded her.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cWho is this, Alice?\u201d The man crossed his arms and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her boyfriend, Noah Thorpe,\u201d Noah said. Alice stiffened under his hands. This was her idea, hopefully she could play along. He let his own guard down, knowing some of what he felt showed through on his face to the man in front of him. The man\u2019s eyes widened slightly, and a muscle in his jaw ticked.</p><p>Rage had rolled through him at the sight of the pretty boy staring at Alice. And when he touched her, Noah wanted to do more than just step between them.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t so much the look on the man\u2019s face, and not even the possessive way he\u2019d touched her\u2014although that made Noah want to tear his hand off\u2014it was Alice\u2019s reaction to the man that made his hands clench at his sides in an effort not to hit her ex.</p><p>She looked smaller, somehow. Her shoulders drew in, even as her chin jutted out in defiance. He\u2019d known, even without seeing her face, how upset she was. Noah might not have a claim to Alice, but that didn\u2019t mean he was going to let some asshole hurt her.</p><p>The blond man looked taken aback at Noah\u2019s appearance, but he quickly smoothed his features to show only polite interest.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is\u2014\u201d Alice began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Brent Strub. Alice\u2019s...former fianc\u00e9.\u201d Brent glanced at Alice, worry creasing his brow.</p><p>The man was smooth, he\u2019d give him that. The concern draping his features when he looked at Alice proved he was good at hiding his true nature. But if he was digging for a reaction, Noah wasn\u2019t going to give him one. He\u2019d known who Brent was the second he laid eyes on him, if not his name or that they were actually engaged. What had Alice\u2014lovely, smart, kind Alice\u2014seen in this man? He radiated smugness the way a vampire on the hunt exuded violence. Cruelty hid behind his condescending expression.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t good enough for her. And more than that, he would never be good to her.</p> <p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Noah said, but he didn\u2019t offer his hand to shake, and neither did Brent.</p><p>Sure, he was decent looking\u2014handsome even\u2014if a woman liked her man fully manicured and wearing cologne. Noah was certain he had a degree from somewhere impressive, Harvard maybe, or Yale. But he wasn\u2019t special, and he was no deeper than a puddle. Just another narcissistic asshole.</p><p>Noah pulled Alice back a step, out of the way of a group of loud twenty-somethings exiting the casino. Cheap beer and perfume rolled off of them, and Noah blew out a breath to clear the scent from his nose.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was nice to see you again, Brent,\u201d Alice said. \u201cBut we have to be going.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat still thudded too quickly for the calm tone her voice had assumed, but at least she sounded better. And she felt wonderful, so soft against him. He shot a quick glance at her, before returning his gaze to watch Brent.</p><p>She\u2019d leaned into him, as if needing his body to support hers. And though the top of her head only barely reached his chin, she fit against him perfectly. The smell of her shampoo swirled around him, something sweet and fruity. Did the woman always smell of fruit?</p><p>Her body was so soft against his that he fought not to snuggle a little closer. Nuzzle her neck and flick his tongue against her skin. See if she tasted as good as she smelled. Show Brent she belonged to him.</p><p>A loud squeal came from inside the casino, and an alarm sounded. Jackpot.</p><p>He shook himself mentally. What the hell was he thinking? Alice didn\u2019t belong to anyone, least of all him. Facing down Brent was messing with his instincts.</p><p>Reluctantly, he released his grip on her shoulders, sliding his hands down her arms before he realized what he was doing. Her skin felt as soft as it appeared.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d a surprised voice said from behind them.</p><p>Noah glanced over his shoulder. Svelte and wearing an uncertain smile, the brunette was tall, nearly as tall as Brent in her heels. Which probably put her at around five-eight without them. A bit too thin for Noah\u2019s tastes, but her features were stunning. A pained expression crossed her face and she rushed to Brent\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cKristen,\u201d Alice said, voice catching. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>The emotion she\u2019d managed to hide when she saw Brent seemed to be coming out through the cracks in her defenses, so Noah stepped next to her and wrapped his arm around her. He held his other hand out to the woman who approached.</p><p>\u201cNoah Thorpe,\u201d he said, forcing a smile.</p><p>She paused, unsure of herself, then took his hand and shook it. Her grip was surprisingly firm, but her palms were damp and her pulse beat like she\u2019d just run a mile. \u201cKristen, Brent\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>If Alice had been stiff under his arm before, she turned into a block of ice at Kristen\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cNoah is Alice\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d Brent offered, his nice-guy mask on full.</p><p>A woman in her early fifties bumped into Noah, and he spared her a glance. Paying him no mind, she yelled at her friend in the casino far too close to Noah\u2019s ear, and he cringed. She smelled of old cigarettes.</p><p>When he looked back, Kristen\u2019s eyes were narrowed at Brent, but when she recovered, her smiled looked genuine. \u201cOh, Alice, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>As if Noah didn\u2019t exist, the woman wrapped Alice in her arms, forcing him to release his hold.</p><p>Kristen pulled Alice to the side and Noah watched warily for any sign from Alice that she didn\u2019t want to go. But Alice flashed him a hesitant smile and followed Kristen, although she didn\u2019t radiate the enthusiasm the other woman did. Kristen murmured to Alice quietly, while Alice stood stiffly with her arms crossed. Noah tried to listen in, but Brent pulled his attention away.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you two been dating?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>Noah opened his mouth to tell Brent that their lives were none of his damn business but thought better of it. That kind of answer would only fan the man\u2019s suspicions. And like a shark, once he smelled blood in the water, Brent would go after his prey mercilessly\u2014and Noah had no doubts that Brent was the worst kind of shark.</p><p>And his prey was Alice.</p><p>\u201cA few months. But we\u2019ve known each other for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know each other?\u201d Brent crossed his arms and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re neighbors. Well, we were. Alice has moved half her stuff into my house already.\u201d</p><p>A real smile, full of triumph, encompassed Brent\u2019s face. \u201cOh, did she?\u201d</p><p>His tone was too casual. Fuck. He\u2019d said something wrong. Something that had made Brent suspicious.</p><p>They needed to get out of here. Get their stories straight before he screwed this up for her. Because no matter how this had all started, no way was he letting Alice fall into this man\u2019s clutches again. Over his dead\u2014truly dead\u2014body. She might not be his, but she was a good person and she roused all of his protective instincts.</p><p>The whispers from Kristen and Alice grew louder. Noah\u2019s stomach twisted at the sight of Alice\u2019s faltering expression. She was trying to put on a good show, pretend she wasn\u2019t at all bothered by talking to these two, but her mask was slipping.</p><p>\u201cKristen,\u201d Brent called. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get some drinks with the happy new couple? We can catch up and,\u201d he shot Noah a confident smile, \u201cget to know Noah better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I really need to get back to the room. I have to clean up and unpack.\u201d Alice said, voice wavering.</p><p>Had he ever heard her sound so unsure of herself before? He\u2019d keep her safe from this man if he had to lock her in their cabin all week to do it. Flashes of what they could do while locked up alone ran through his mind. He gritted his teeth and concentrated on withdrawing his fangs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. How about in an hour?\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know if we should intrude...\u201d Despite her words, Kristen sounded hopeful.</p><p>Alice opened her mouth to answer, and he could see her resolve wavering.</p><p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow? We have plans already,\u201d Noah cut in.</p><p>Brent grinned at them, and if Noah hadn\u2019t sensed his true nature, he would have called the expression charming. Even endearing. Definitely a shark. \u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have let me answer for myself,\u201d Alice said for the third time since they\u2019d left the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed unsettled.\u201d His jaw tensed like he wanted to say more.</p><p>She mentally shrugged off his curt response. Was he angry? She was more than a little irritated, herself. But she wasn\u2019t entirely certain why he would be mad. Unless Brent had said something while Kristen dragged her off to make small talk.</p><p>Brent was her greatest mistake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nothing was going right. Why couldn\u2019t anything ever go according to plan? She followed Noah to the stateroom silently, still trying to process what had just happened. Everything had been planned so perfectly. Every detail down to the dress she\u2019d wear. A gorgeous dress that made her look like sin, but not like a hooker\u2014not a cheap hooker, anyway. And the new shoes. Ones that would normally be far too tall for her, but she\u2019d learned to walk in them. Practiced. So she\u2019d be perfect.</p><p>She let out a loud groan and threw herself face first on the bed the second the door clicked shut behind them. Noah didn\u2019t say anything, but she could hear him moving around, taking off his jacket.</p><p>\u201cThat was such a disaster,\u201d she finally managed. \u201cBut thank goodness you came when you did.\u201d She pushed herself onto her elbows and glanced over her shoulder. He\u2019d tossed his jacket on the small couch. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t reply for a few seconds, as if searching for the right thing to say. \u201cHe\u2019s an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people like Brent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people are idiots.\u201d Yep, he was definitely still snippy about something.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bright and shiny outlook you have there.\u201d She grabbed one of the pillows and tossed it at him. He caught it with ease. \u201cI mean it. Thank you. You saved me out there.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and looked away, tossing the pillow onto the couch. \u201cWhen we have a minute, we need to get our stories straight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been dating a few months. You worship the ground I walk on.\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile touched his lips. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I was quite the catch for you.\u201d Forcing herself off the bed, she rummaged through her suitcase and finally found it. The dress. The one she\u2019d hoped to wear to knock Brent\u2019s socks off\u2014make him appreciate what he\u2019d lost. She couldn\u2019t regain the moment, but she might still be able to pull off some sort of good revenge.</p><p>Noah searched through his bag, too, his back to her as he bent over the couch to peer inside. His muscles were hard, just as hard as she\u2019d imagined, and backing into him had been like backing into a brick wall. If the wall happened to smell like nothing she\u2019d ever smelled before. Something spicy and raw. Masculine.</p><p>Noah Thorpe needed no cologne.</p><p>Not to mention the strength in those hands. She couldn\u2019t see them as he sorted, but the muscles in his back pressed against his shirt, and his wide shoulders were smooth and strong. Her breath quickened at the memory of him at her back, his skin only a shirt away from sliding against hers. His arms practically wrapped around her. And the strange feelings that washed over her when he was near. Aroused, sure. But more than that. Safe. Happy.</p> <p>As if sensing her thoughts, Noah stiffened and turned to face her. Her mouth went dry at the sight of that intense gaze. She licked her lips, and his eyes followed the motion.</p><p>She glanced away. She wasn\u2019t making a play for him, right? No. Not going to happen. He\u2019d made it clear he wasn\u2019t interested, and she was just as certain as he was that this should be kept friendly, but not too friendly. \u201cSo what did you and Brent talk about after Kristen dragged me away?\u201d</p><p>The tension broke like a bubble bursting, and he tugged a shirt from his bag. \u201cHe was fishing for information. Trying to figure out how long we\u2019d been seeing each other. How serious we are.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stilled over her makeup bag. \u201cAnd were you convincing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll have to be convincing when we see them at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we will.\u201d</p><p>She looked back and arched an eyebrow at him. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t one hundred percent behind this whole idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was before I met the ass. I don\u2019t understand how someone like you could be with a guy like him,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her stomach dropped and she turned away. \u201cLike I said, most people like him.\u201d And she\u2019d liked him, once upon a time. She\u2019d loved him and had mentally planned a life with him. Those emotions and thoughts had come so readily to her only several months ago. Yet now, as she shared a boat with Brent, she couldn\u2019t summon even a ghost of the emotion she\u2019d once felt.</p><p>She took a haggard breath. \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t know me that well, and you probably don\u2019t approve of this...farce. But I\u2019d really appreciate it if you\u2019d keep helping me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t reply, so she ducked into the bathroom to do her makeup and hair. When she emerged, he was ironing his shirt, and she noticed her dress had been pressed.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Was it possible he knew how much she loathed ironing?</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He didn\u2019t look up from his shirt.</p><p>She rushed through the rest of her preparations and noted Noah looked even more handsome in the black dress shirt he donned than the plain white polo shirt he\u2019d worn to the ship. He was striking enough, in the simple outfit, to make her breath catch in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBefore we go, I should probably prepare you for my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother? The same mother I spent the afternoon playing miniature golf with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pretty tame during golf. I just don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea about her. She can come across as a bit of a...flirt. But at her core, she\u2019s a romantic. She and my dad\u2014well, they were sort of a fairy tale couple.\u201d How did she explain without making her mother sound nuts? Who was she kidding\u2014her mom was a little nuts. But she was also a strong, wonderful woman who loved her family dearly. \u201cHe\u2019s been gone for a really long time. She gets lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t\u2014not really. But then, he wouldn\u2019t really grasp the loving insanity of her mother until he spent some time with her. But Alice appreciated his words. \u201cAll right, then. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><p>Sconces on the walls and small lights designed to look like candles set on the tables lit the room, and a quiet hum of classical music made the place feel relaxing and a bit romantic.</p><p>Most of their party was already there. Cindy\u2019s soon-to-be husband, Robert, and his cousin were laughing loudly and jovially as only the best of friends could. Cindy sat glowing between Robert and her mother. Edna\u2019s escort was in attendance, and as Cindy had dished earlier in the week, he was far too young. Edna was pushing sixty, and the man on her left couldn\u2019t be a day over forty. Only three seats remained, two right across from Edna and her escort, with the last on one end of the table.</p><p>Alice glanced sharply at her sister and Cindy shrugged. They exchanged greetings. Noah pulled out her chair for her, and she gave him a small smile before turning to face her mother.</p><p>\u201cBrent said Kristen isn\u2019t feeling well, so they moved us to a smaller table,\u201d Edna said as Alice\u2019s hand closed over her cloth napkin. \u201cHe\u2019ll be along later.\u201d</p><p>She nodded politely, when she really wanted to point out that she hadn\u2019t asked, nor did she care, where Brent was. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Noah said, waving the waiter over, \u201cshe looked fine when we saw her a less than an hour ago.\u201d The waiter arrived and Noah ordered something that sounded suspiciously French, but she didn\u2019t catch the exact wording.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Edna said, leaning over the table to peer at Noah. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Brent, then?\u201d</p><p>Noah opened his mouth, no doubt to give her mother an education both of his opinion of Brent and knowledge of swear words, but Alice cut him off. \u201cMother, you haven\u2019t introduced us to your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear. This is Jake. Jake, say hello to my daughter and her friend.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded politely. The man was handsome; she\u2019d give her mother that. He had hazel eyes, and the lines around his mouth suggested he always wore a smile. A fun guy, then. Just what Edna preferred.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d Noah corrected. Cindy choked on her wine, turning wide eyes to her sister.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Edna asked, enunciating the word just so, to make sure she\u2019d heard right. \u201cI knew you wanted to add a friend to the group, but I didn\u2019t realize it was someone you were seeing.\u201d Edna laughed. \u201cTo be honest Noah, I had expected you to be a girl.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t reply vocally, but jerked his head in a quick nod.</p><p>Alice closed her eyes. You can do this. It\u2019s a tiny lie.</p><p>Crap. This wasn\u2019t fair. A little ruse to fool Brent was justifiable, deserved even. But lying to her mother? She\u2019d planned to call Noah a friend\u2014sort of true\u2014and let her always-hopeful mom fill in the details of that friendship. That way it wouldn\u2019t be such a lie.</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t be such a liar.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were bringing a boyfriend?\u201d Edna asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to steal Robert and Cindy\u2019s thunder,\u201d Noah replied smoothly.</p><p>She shot him a thankful glance.</p><p>\u201cYou should know your sister wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d She picked up her wine glass and waved a hand over it at one of the waiters. The man, dressed in a suit, regally refilled her glass and even returned her wink with a small grin.</p><p>\u201cYou know Alice. Far too considerate for her own good,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Edna grinned at Noah. Alice\u2019s throat tightened painfully, and she nudged her plate toward the center of the table. No way was she going to be able to eat now. It wasn\u2019t Noah\u2019s fault. How could he know how hard her mother had been pushing her to date since she\u2019d left Brent?</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Edna said, \u201cYou\u2019re so right about her. Why, I didn\u2019t realize how well you knew her already. But you really get her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s head jerked back and he stared at her mom for a moment, silver tongue finally lacking a smooth reply.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not make a big deal about this, Mom,\u201d Alice pleaded. She shot her sister a meaningful look. \u201cThis is Cindy\u2019s week. Come on, let\u2019s all drink some wine to Cindy and Robert.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Edna dragged her gaze away from Noah, but her chin was set to argue.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cCan\u2019t I have a single week devoted to me? We can focus on Alice\u2019s great news next week.\u201d</p><p>Such a statement was so unlike Cindy that Alice was certain her mother wouldn\u2019t buy it. Cindy had her faults, but needing to be the center of attention wasn\u2019t one of them. Not even during the week of her wedding.</p> <p>But finally, Edna\u2019s shoulders relaxed and she smiled. \u201cOf course, dear,\u201d she said to Cindy. \u201cOf course.\u201d Again she waved down a waiter, and this time, he filled all the glasses at the table, with the help of one of the waitresses.</p><p>\u201cTo the happy couple,\u201d Alice said, holding her wineglass up. The table murmured their agreement, and Alice sipped at her wine. Smooth and rich, the red wine slid down her throat with only the slightest of bites.</p><p>\u201cTo the happy couple,\u201d Brent agreed loudly, sliding into a chair on the end of the table. He murmured an apology for being late. Noah sat a little straighter in his chair.</p><p>\u201cHas Alice asked you for your parent\u2019s and grandparent\u2019s names yet, Noah?\u201d Cindy asked. \u201cIt\u2019s her hobby, you know. Her little obsession.\u201d</p><p>Noah choked on his drink and Alice cringed. Could Cindy have made her hobby sound any weirder?</p> <p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d he finally managed after clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cI like genealogy,\u201d Alice said, before her sister could add some enigmatic yet awkward hint.</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d Her mother gestured to Alice with her wine glass. \u201cAlice has traced our family back to an earl of some sort.\u201d</p><p>Heat crept up Alice\u2019s neck at Noah\u2019s curious glance. \u201cIt was a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny skeletons in your family\u2019s history, Noah?\u201d Cindy arched an eyebrow at him, and he paled slightly.</p><p>\u201cFeel free not to answer that,\u201d Alice muttered, embarrassment making her want to crawl under the table.</p> <p>\u201cNone that I know of. So how did you two meet?\u201d Noah asked Robert.</p><p>Her appetite fled, and she forced a smile as she waited for the story she knew all too well. The pace the discussion was moving downhill, her mother would have naked bathtub pictures of her when she was a baby out of her wallet by the end of dinner.</p><p>Robert shifted in his seat and his smile looked pasted on. \u201cActually, Alice and Brent introduced us.\u201d</p><p>Brent slapped his brother on the back and laughed. \u201cWhat a night that was. Alice was upset because she\u2019d gotten a B or something.\u201d His gaze flitted to her, and she gritted her teeth to keep her smile fixed. \u201cWhat was it again, ba\u2014Alice?\u201d</p><p>Noah stiffened next to her and Alice wondered if he felt unwell. She glanced quickly up at him, but his face was impassive and his usual relaxed demeanor was in place.</p><p>\u201cNo idea. It was so long ago.\u201d She\u2019d gotten a C on a final exam. Her first C. But she wasn\u2019t about to admit to remembering that.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Cindy said, ice in her voice. \u201cKeep going, Robert.\u201d</p><p>Robert grimaced at his soon-to-be wife\u2019s tone, but knew better than to argue. \u201cSo it was supposed to be a small get together to celebrate Brent\u2019s graduation. Not the big party, just informal with his close friends. I didn\u2019t live in California at the time, but since I was in town visiting, Brent deigned to invite me.\u201d</p> <p>Brent chuckled and Robert grinned at him. Robert looked so like his brother, but they were such different people. Had she really thought Robert boring compared to Brent? Brent had always seemed so full of life and dreams. Big ideas and big actions. Robert\u2014sweet Robert\u2014had always been so steady and quiet.</p><p>\u201cI took one look at this beautiful smile.\u201d Robert touched Cindy\u2019s cheek with a fingertip, and the look they gave each other made Alice\u2019s eyes prick with moisture. \u201cAnd I was lost.\u201d</p><p>As Robert and Cindy shared a chaste kiss, Alice blinked back tears. Robert was a good man. How had she ever considered him boring?</p><p>The rest of dinner flew by without drama, but Alice spent the moments full of tension. Her body urging her to run, as if lying to her mother was something she could actually escape on foot. Trapped on a boat, no less.</p><p>Noah and Alice said their goodbyes, and she watched him lean over her mother\u2019s chair to plant a soft kiss on her cheek. She swallowed hard. He was so good with them. Charming and kind and always ready to laugh at her mother\u2019s somewhat inappropriate jokes. A bit of the wall he always seemed to guard himself with seemed to have come down. For her mother, anyway.</p><p>They headed out of the restaurant, and Alice tugged on Noah\u2019s sleeve when they cleared the room out into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly happy about lying to my mother, but thanks for being so...charming, I guess. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>And like she\u2019d flipped a switch, his guarded look returned. \u201cNo problem. You play your part, and I\u2019ll play mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart?\u201d A slurred voice asked.</p><p>Alice turned, already knowing who had just exited the restaurant to confront them.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of part?\u201d Brent stopped and leaned against the wall, eyes flashing triumph, like he\u2019d really caught them admitting something of interest.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. \u201cNone of your business,\u201d Alice said. Then she reached out and took Noah\u2019s hand in her own, and then pulled him toward their room. \u201cCome on, sexy, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Noah dropped her hand the second they rounded the corner away from Brent and his prying eyes, even though letting her go was the last thing he wanted to do. He wished he wasn\u2019t so incensed, so he could savor the moment of Alice calling him sexy.</p><p>And hell, to find out she was obsessed with\u2014or at least very interested in\u2014family history had almost made him even more tense. Thank God he\u2019d sidestepped that conversation. His family history wasn\u2019t something he could divulge. And if she decided to research his cover, she\u2019d find exactly squat. He had to make sure the subject never came up again.</p><p>He stalked back to their cabin, with Alice trailing at his heels. He should go. Get away from her for a while. It didn\u2019t matter that he wasn\u2019t mad at her\u2014not exactly. He simply wasn\u2019t safe to be around when he was feeling so intense. Blood rushed through his ears and he saw red. Every cell in his body pulsed with anger.</p><p>But he ignored common sense and went into the cabin.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell could you ever be with that\u2014\u201d he struggled to find a word bad enough to encompass Brent Strub, \u201c\u2014fucking asshole?\u201d He crossed the room and closed the drapes, blocking the view of the ocean beyond. The view was dark and soothing, and he didn\u2019t want to be soothed.</p><p>Anger coated her expression, too. \u201cWhat right do you have to judge me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone would judge you, sweetheart. The guy is obviously a creep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right. Not like you\u2019re an expert on relationships. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even seen a woman around your place for more than a single night. Not once in five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been looking?\u201d he asked, and suddenly it was all he could do not to cross the two feet of carpet between them and take her into his arms. She was sexy as hell all the time, with her bright smile and fast wit. But angry, she practically glowed with energy. She\u2019d be just as fiery in bed, he was sure of it. All teeth and spirit.</p><p>His canines lengthened in his mouth and his cock hardened in his jeans. Dammit. He turned away from her and took a deep breath to calm himself. \u201cTell me what happened with him.\u201d Talking about her ex was the last thing on his mind, but it would calm him. Keep him from tossing her on the bed, shoving up that tight little dress and\u2014</p><p>Shit. He shook his head. Get a grip.</p><p>\u201cI was young, okay? I don\u2019t have a good excuse. I was eighteen when I met Brent in college. By nineteen we were inseparable. And by the time I finished graduate school at twenty-four...\u201d She took a deep breath and let it out in a ragged rattle of air as she sat heavily on the corner of the bed and then plucked nervously on the threads of the bright blue and purple bedspread. \u201cWell, last year, right after college ended, I found out about him and Kristen. She was my best friend.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her. Annoyance laced her tone when she spoke of Brent, but sadness replaced it when she talked about her former friend.</p><p>The rest of what she\u2019d said sunk in. Shit. He\u2019d known she was young, but twenty-five? He was a world-class jerk. Even after her confession, all he could think about was sinking his teeth into her neck. Sliding his hands under her dress. Making her call out his name.</p><p>He should know better. She might very well see him as a man who didn\u2019t look a day over thirty, but he hadn\u2019t seen thirty in a very long time.</p><p>He had to keep focused, and keep away from her. He sat on the couch and leaned forward, his elbows on his thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou left him. After you found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I caught them together, yes. Brent wasn\u2019t happy about it.\u201d One of her dress straps had slid over her shoulder, revealing nothing but an inch more of her skin. A tiny bit of flesh, but tantalizing all the same. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen him act with such venom.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at that. People, in his experience\u2014and he had a hell of a lot of experience with people\u2014didn\u2019t change all that much.</p><p>\u201cI know it was there, even if I was too close to see it at the time. Too entrenched in our relationship to think about what it meant. But this...\u201d She shook her head and her brows scrunched together with worry. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten worse. I almost feel bad for Kristen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you\u2019ve seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year. He bothered me for a couple of months after I left, but then seemed to give up when I refused to see him and avoided him like the plague.\u201d</p><p>A lock of hair fell into her face and she tucked it back behind her ear. All that beautiful blonde hair was finally free, flowing down her back. So soft. He pushed up from the couch and stepped closer to her. Her scent touched his nose and he clenched his fists at his sides. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis front we\u2019re putting up aside, you need to stay away from him if I\u2019m not with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle Brent.\u201d Chin jutting into the air, she pushed up from the bed to face him head on.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. Maybe you could before.\u201d Not likely. \u201cBut you can\u2019t now.\u201d</p> <p>She opened her mouth to argue, and he waved her off. \u201cIf you want me to continue this charade, then you\u2019ll do this one thing for me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip and then nodded. \u201cBut I do need to talk to Kristen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway from Brent. I need to get her alone. See if I can help her get away from him.\u201d She poked at his chest and he suppressed the urge to grab the offending hand and pull her closer. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said he wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe slept with your boyfriend and you\u2019re worried about helping her?\u201d Was she, really? Or was this just an attempt to get Kristen and Brent to break up? That would certainly give her another chance at the jackass. Fuck. No way could he let her do that.</p> <p>\u201cFianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got it.\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cAre you sure this is about helping Kristen? Maybe you want another chance at Brent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? How stupid do I look to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her hand waved, cutting him off. \u201cI get why you might think that, but the last thing I want is another chance with Brent. I\u2019m just not sure Kristen deserves to be stuck with him for the rest of her life because of one mistake.\u201d She frowned. \u201cAlthough, they do deserve each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you were going to marry that buffoon.\u201d</p> <p>She took a step toward him. \u201cStop judging me, Mr. High and Mighty. And anyway, who says buffoon anymore?\u201d When she looked up and met his gaze with her warm eyes, so full of annoyance and caring, the force of the whole night rushed over him in a flood of emotion. Rage and anger and lust assaulted him. And a fierce protectiveness he couldn\u2019t remember feeling since he\u2019d left his humanity behind came with it.</p><p>Her eyes widened at whatever expression crossed his face, but she didn\u2019t look afraid. Her tongue flitted out, wetting her lips.</p><p>Before his good sense could kick in, he crossed the short space between them and closed his mouth over hers. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew he\u2019d moved too fast. Inhumanly fast. But he didn\u2019t care. Her sweet scent filled his nose and swirled around them both. And her soft lips greeted his eagerly.</p><p>She melted into him and he wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close. A soft noise escaped her throat and he growled against her lips. She was soft, so soft. Warm, comforting, and passionate. Her hands slid up his chest, leaving fire in their wake, before settling around his neck. She opened her mouth to him, and he slid his tongue against hers.</p><p>He hardened painfully in his jeans and kissed her a bit more forcefully. She moaned and pressed her body closer, writhing against his hardness. A small part of his mind screamed that this was a terrible idea.</p><p>But the rest of him didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Then her mouth was gone from his, and he stared dumbly. Still in his arms, her face was flushed and her mouth slightly open. Her eyes were bright with wonder and she looked so sexy it was all he could do to keep himself from kissing her again. She took a step back, forcing him to loosen his arms around her and release her. His body cried out at the loss, and he fisted his hands at his sides to keep from reaching for her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go take a shower,\u201d she said, finally, breaking the silence and whatever bond that had kept his eyes affixed to her.</p> <p>He turned and opened the heavy curtain leading to the balcony. Moonlight lit the outside of the ship, as did the lights from the ship itself. And the ocean was clear and dark. Alone. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Shuffling noises sounded behind him as she no doubt fished out more of those sweet-smelling toiletries to tantalize him with. Less than a minute later, the bathroom door clicked shut behind her.</p><p>He let out a long breath and opened the door to the balcony. What the hell just happened? Air heavy with humidity and laden with the salt of the ocean surrounded him, and he gazed out over the endless sea, as if it could offer him answers. But its only reply was the sound of waves lapping against the ship.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Alice blinked at the dark room and suppressed the urge to hide under the covers for the rest of the day. What a night. She pushed up onto her elbow and looked at the digital clock sitting on the desk across from Noah\u2019s sleeping form. Ten o\u2019clock. They\u2019d be late for brunch.</p><p>Noah\u2019s too-tall body looked awkward on the loveseat\u2019s pullout. The bed couldn\u2019t have been designed for anyone over five and a half feet tall, and Noah stood over six feet. He lay from corner to corner.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he taken the bed, for crying out loud? She was only five-three, the pullout would have been perfectly serviceable for her. But no, the man had to be stubborn about it. Just like he was with everything. The idea of ever being agreeable without argument had probably never even occurred to him.</p><p>But sleeping, he looked so peaceful. Quiet. Awake, he carried an energy with him at all times, not violent exactly, but...powerful. Like he expected and was ready for action everywhere he went.</p><p>She touched her lips with her fingertips. She could still feel him there, his mouth pressed against hers, his clever tongue teasing her into oblivion. She could taste his drink in her mouth and smell his scent. Feel his arms wrapped around her. Holding her close. Burning her up. Pushing her to the brink with the slightest caress.</p><p>Like it had been carved from stone, his jawline was smooth and perfect, and she ached to slide her fingers down its surface, feel the roughness of his dark five o\u2019clock shadow.</p><p>She half wanted to kick herself for pulling away from his kiss, but the other half remained convinced it had been the right thing to do. Noah was gorgeous and sexy and seemed to be a genuinely good man, but she wasn\u2019t ready to jump into a new relationship. Trusting someone that much again...no. Last night had proven she wasn\u2019t ready yet. The second she felt herself losing control with Noah, panic set in. And she couldn\u2019t run away fast enough.</p><p>But oh, what a kiss.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t noticed him before. Heck, he was the reason she organized neighborhood parties and went out of her way to drop in at least every few weeks to borrow something or just say hello. He hadn\u2019t exactly said he enjoyed seeing her outright, but she always felt his gaze linger on her body.</p><p>As if sensing her eyes on him, Noah\u2019s fluttered open. Their gazes met for a brief moment, and she could almost imagine no time had passed since she\u2019d been in his arms. Catching herself, she broke the moment by looking away as though she hadn\u2019t been watching him sleep. Which she most certainly had been. If he felt uncomfortable, Noah didn\u2019t show it. He glanced at the clock and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cAre we late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter get going, then,\u201d he said, voice rough with sleep. His hair was tousled and sexy. The man looked good right out of bed. That should have been a crime.</p><p>He avoided meeting her eyes as they got ready, and an awkwardness settled over them. Every instinct in her body told her to break it before the gap grew too far between them, but she couldn\u2019t think of the right thing to say. Should she apologize for breaking up the kiss? No, that was a stupid idea. Make light of it? That didn\u2019t seem right either.</p><p>So she let the discomfort settle over both of them, so thick she thought it bordered on being visible. By the time they walked to brunch, they\u2019d been reduced to one-word questions and answers and a whole lot of pointing.</p><p>Brent and Kristen were nowhere to be seen at the morning brunch, at least not in the nook her family had reserved for breakfast on each day of the trip. Her mother and sister sat with their heads together at the table, and her mom said something to make Cindy laugh and appear mortified at the same time. Cindy looked radiant and so happy\u2014every bit the glowing bride\u2014that Alice found her mood lifting despite her worries about Noah.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, ladies,\u201d Noah said, and the tension he\u2019d carried in his shoulders all morning seemed to dissipate. Now that they were no longer alone.</p><p>\u201cAnything planned for this morning?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, a Shepard family volleyball tournament.\u201d</p><p>Alice groaned. She was no slouch, but the tournaments always ended with Brent and Robert battling for supremacy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they aren\u2019t teaming up this time,\u201d her sister said, knowing exactly what Alice was thinking. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a couples\u2019 tournament. So you\u2019ll be competing with Noah on your team.\u201d</p><p>Noah raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a bit of a sun allergy, so I guess we\u2019ll have to sit this one out,\u201d Alice said. Thank goodness. Maybe there\u2019d be a way out of the tournament. She didn\u2019t relish playing volleyball with Brent and Kristen on the other side of the net.</p><p>Cindy\u2019s eyebrows shot up at that, but she didn\u2019t argue. \u201cDarn. Guess it\u2019ll be our responsibility to make sure Brent doesn\u2019t win.\u201d She smiled at her soon-to-be husband and he took her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d Alice replied.</p><p>\u201cYou know how competitive Brent is. He\u2019ll have a big head about it the entire week if he wins.\u201d Cindy waved her fork around as she spoke, and Alice caught sight of her pancakes. Her mouth watered. While they were playing volleyball, she could enjoy the cruise ship\u2019s excellent breakfast menu. She wiggled in her shorts. Yes, she still had room. The gym would be waiting when she got home.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Noah cut in. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your allergy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Alice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Cindy said. \u201cWe need to head over there soon. I only have the courts booked for a couple of hours.\u201d She glanced at Alice. \u201cYou guys should eat something. Maybe grab a banana to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alice glared at her sister and Cindy got up from the table, an innocent look plastered on her face. Cindy knew exactly how she felt about healthy breakfasts on vacation.</p><p>\u201cOh, and don\u2019t forget to stop by your room and change,\u201d her sister added.</p><p>\u201cChange?\u201d Alice tugged at her shorts. \u201cIs this some sort of weird, dressy volleyball?\u201d</p> <p>Cindy laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s pool volleyball.\u201d</p><p>If looks could have killed, Cindy would have been rolling around the floor in agony. But they couldn\u2019t, so Alice simply glared. Noah was quiet on the way back to the room and seemed resigned to his fate. Alice changed quickly in the bathroom, wishing she\u2019d spent a few more hours a week at the gym.</p><p>The sexy bikini had seemed like such a good idea in the store\u2014a way to show Brent exactly what he was missing. But now she\u2019d kill for a one-piece. She wrapped a poolside-robe around herself in the bathroom. Maybe she could toss it at a chair as she flung herself into the pool.</p><p>The volleyball courts were outside in one of the pools, but the temperature was still quite nice, and the water made diving for the ball a real possibility, if one didn\u2019t mind a face full of water. Cindy had booked two courts, and created brackets for all of the couples who played.</p><p>Alice watched the first sets of couples play and clutched at her robe self-consciously. One set was Robert\u2019s cousin, Tom, and his wife versus two of Alice\u2019s cousins. Unlike Cindy\u2019s soon-to-be husband, Tom was slight, and it became obvious very quickly the match wouldn\u2019t be going their way. On the other court, her mother and Jake played a couple Alice didn\u2019t recognize.</p> <p>Jake was actually pretty good, and what her mother lacked in volleyball skill, she made up for in enthusiasm.</p><p>Alice cheered her family on, but wasn\u2019t feeling as into the game as she should have. Noah enveloped her thoughts. His touch, his spicy scent, the obvious desire on his face when she\u2019d broken their kiss.</p><p>Not to mention how he looked in his swimming trunks.</p><p>The well-defined muscles that were only hinted at under his clothing flexed as he moved. And it took every bit of her self-control not to stare. It helped that his eyes were firmly averted from her. She sniffed. She wasn\u2019t unpleasant to look at in a bathing suit; she was self-aware enough to know that, even if she didn\u2019t feel totally comfortable in the two-piece. If he didn\u2019t care for a peek, it was his loss. Besides, she was still wearing the short robe.</p><p>The crowd had pulled away from them, getting closer to the games to call out of play balls and cheer on the competitors. She and Noah were alone, or at least as alone as they were likely to be until they retired for the night.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, and he turned to face her. God, his eyes were so blue. So striking. And for a brief second before his expression closed to her, they were expressive. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying yourself,\u201d she said, shocked.</p> <p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked, and the last bit of enjoyment was squashed from his face by his normal, guarded expression.</p><p>\u201cSorry, that\u2019s not what I was going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to enjoy yourself. I didn\u2019t mean that how it sounded. I was just surprised.\u201d Great. That sounds so much better. Why not just call him cantankerous and be done with it?</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI can see that. Is this deep discussion of my happiness what you wanted to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I thought we should talk about last night.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms and turned his attention back to the game. \u201cThat\u2019s wholly unnecessary, Alice.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to argue, but he refused to look at her. Instead, he took a couple of steps forward, getting just close enough to the crowd of onlookers to make a private conversation impossible.</p> <p>The urge to grab his arm and drag him back came over her, and she shoved it down. What a scene that would make. She couldn\u2019t afford word getting back to Brent that they were having problems. He\u2019d use the slightest inkling to try to worm his way back into her good graces. Not to mention the snake was likely hovering around nearby.</p><p>Her stomach dropped at the thought and she scanned the crowd. Sure enough, Brent and Kristen stood on the other side of the pool. Expensive sunglasses adorned Brent\u2019s face, and Kristen stood stiffly in a bikini that had to be illegal in at least eleven states. It made Alice\u2019s look positively matronly by comparison. Maybe she could do this after all.</p><p>Annoyance flashed through her and she frowned. Kristen had always favored slinky swimsuits.</p><p>\u201cYou sure got your gold goose,\u201d she murmured. Sure, Kristen\u2019s family wasn\u2019t quite as well-off as Alice\u2019s was, but her family would keep Brent in style.</p><p>Noah, although too far away to hear her quiet aside, turned his head to glance at her over his shoulder. He grinned and pulled his sunglasses off his head and over his eyes. She frowned at him. What was he so happy about?</p><p>She resisted making a silly face at him, and finally decided she couldn\u2019t leave the robe on without looking odd. She tugged it off and set it on a nearby chair, then looked back up at Noah. His grin was gone, and he looked truly expressionless with his eyes covered by the dark glasses. But he looked at her for a smidgeon longer than was comfortable. Heat crept up her neck, but she ignored it.</p><p>Less than five minutes later, her mother and Jake proved victorious, and it was Alice and Noah\u2019s turn. She waded into the water, which was cool enough to send a shiver up her spine. The smell of chlorine grew stronger, and she glanced at Noah, who walked beside her. He looked about as happy as she felt to be in the pool.</p><p>She slapped water at him playfully before she could think better of it.</p><p>His mouth dropped open for a split second before it snapped shut and he splashed her back. Water flew into her face, and a laugh bubbled out of her chest. She splashed him again and Noah burst into laughter, too. Her heart twinged. The man looked so different when he laughed. So much more open. They were soaked by the time they got to the net hanging over the middle of the pool, even though the water only came up to Noah\u2019s waist.</p><p>Under the quickly heating sun, they won their first two matches. Noah was good, his reflexes fast, and he seemed to genuinely enjoy himself. Alice did her best, managing to save a few balls herself and even score a few points.</p><p>During their third match, which pitted them against Robert and Cindy, Alice dove for the game-saving point. She coughed out water from where she\u2019d slid into the pool with her fist leading the way and her face not far behind. Wiping at her mouth, she laughed around the water.</p><p>Cheers sounded from the sides of the pool, and a loud whistle split the air. Her mother had mastered the art of whistling with her fingers in her mouth, something Alice had never been able to manage.</p><p>A shadow appeared over her as she tried to spit water from her mouth in as ladylike a manner as possible. \u201cDid I get it?\u201d she asked the shadow.</p><p>Noah pulled her up in the water. His strong grip made her already-weak knees weaker, and once he got her up, he held her by her elbows.</p><p>\u201cYou did. Nice save,\u201d he said. But his voice was low and quiet, and when she looked up, the amusement was gone from his eyes. Intensity flared, and she flashed back to the night before. He\u2019d looked at her like that just before kissing her. She licked her lips, unable to look away. And managed not to make a face when she tasted chlorine.</p><p>\u201cNice job, dear,\u201d her mother said, voice coming from only a couple of feet away.</p><p>Then she could feel hands at her back, leading her out of the pool. Noah\u2019s eyes were still fixed on her, but she looked down at her suit. Thank goodness it still covered everything.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom. Yikes. Did I leave any water in the pool?\u201d She straightened her swimsuit and ignored the way Noah\u2019s gaze followed her movement. A few seconds later, his attention shifted away.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Cindy said, handing her a towel. \u201cYou two have made it to the championship.\u201d</p><p>Alice smiled at her sister. The dramatic way she said championship made it sound like they were in the Olympics.</p><p>\u201cGood job, partner.\u201d She held up her hand for a high-five from Noah and some of the tension left his face. His hand slapped against hers, sending a tingle down her arm.</p><p>\u201cAll right, who\u2019re we taking down next?\u201d she asked Cindy.</p><p>Cindy smiled, but the expression didn\u2019t touch her eyes. \u201cBrent and Kristen.\u201d</p><p>Kristen had been, among other things, a champion high school volleyball player. And while she hadn\u2019t pursued it as hard in college, she\u2019d remained on the team for all four years. And Brent might have been a lot of bad things, but sucking at sports was not one of his faults.</p><p>Brent, a competitor to his core, played hard. Alice did her best to keep up, but ball after ball escaped her, and she enviously watched her sister drink a pina colada on the side of the pool. She gasped for air and glanced at Noah. He wasn\u2019t sweating, but he did seem a bit wearied around the eyes. His sun allergy? She didn\u2019t see a rash, but his skin had definitely reddened. \u201cPrepare to go down, Noah.\u201d Brent grinned on the other side of the net.</p><p>Noah remained silent, a strangely intense look in his eyes.</p><p>Needing to fill the silence with something, Alice yelled. \u201cYou two are the ones going down. Prepare to eat some pool water, Brent.\u201d</p><p>Brent laughed, and Kristen frowned.</p><p>\u201cZero serving zero,\u201d Kristen called.</p><p>Sweat beaded on Alice\u2019s brow by the third volley, and she could sense the wear of the sun on Noah, too. He still moved fast, but his eyes were half closed between rounds, and his jaw tense.</p><p>But Brent and Kristen were showing signs of wear, too. Sloshing around in a pool was hard work. Not that Brent let it show in his attitude.</p><p>\u201cNot getting tired over there, are you?\u201d He rolled the ball on the surface of the pool, then pushed it under the water and caught it as if flew back up. \u201cCome on, Alice. You\u2019re a tougher fighter than that.\u201d He laughed. \u201cRemember that time in the Bahamas? We rolled over that couple.\u201d</p><p>She grinned before thinking better of it. It had been a fun trip. A big group of college friends, a lot of alcohol, and she\u2019d been in love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Water flew from her hair as she shook herself free from the memory.</p><p>\u201cThirteen serving nine,\u201d Brent called. She looked up at him, and he paused, gave her a very distinctive wink, and then served the ball.</p><p>Noah went stiff beside her, no doubt seeing the wink as a challenge. And as the ball flew over the net, Noah flew into action.</p> <p>It was as if something possessed him the second Brent winked at her. His speed increased, and he crossed over into her side of the court when it looked like she might not make a save. Brent and Kristen tried to keep up, but Noah was simply too quick. He moved as if on land, treading the water as if it was air. And when he hit the ball, it flew almost dangerously fast.</p><p>Alice wiped sweat from her brow with the back of her hand and stared at Noah as he served, calling out the score.</p><p>\u201cFourteen serving thirteen.\u201d</p><p>And then, with two volleys and one spike, delivered by Noah with a stunning vertical, the game was over.</p><p>Brent shouted an obscenity and Kristen rushed to his side. But Brent would have none of it and stalked out of the pool and back into the ship. Kristen followed, ever faithfully, at his heels.</p> <p>Alice shook her head and walked out of the pool. Noah high-fived her after she hit dry poolside, and then he accepted a bottle of water from Cindy. Alice returned his congratulations, but mentally, she was trying to pull the pieces together. He\u2019d been so fast, as if a second wind had hit him.</p><p>She watched him under hooded eyes as she nursed her bottle of water, mind churning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go take a break,\u201d he told her after most of the family had dispersed. \u201cSun is kind of getting to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. He did look tired. Red, his skin was damp with sweat and pool water. Tension rode his shoulders, and a scowl cut into his handsome face. For once, the man didn\u2019t look perfect.</p><p>He gave her a quick nod, then turned and disappeared back into the cruise ship.</p><p>Noah stalked down the hallway, elation at the win fading until he was so pissed he could barely think. He couldn\u2019t decide who he was angrier with: himself or Brent. The little twerp goaded him on purpose. The wink directed at Alice wasn\u2019t meant for her, it was meant for Noah. And the simple gesture made him see red.</p> <p>Idiot. One silly act of aggression toward a woman who wasn\u2019t anything more to him than a neighbor\u2014an acquaintance\u2014had pushed him to show speed and strength bordering on inhuman. He was better than this. Charles was the rash one in their little group, their family. Noah was always cool-headed.</p><p>Except when he was around her.</p><p>Alice\u2019s dazzling smile flashed in his head, and a warmth blossomed in his chest.</p><p>Shit. He opened the suite door and then shut it behind him and leaned against it. He stared at the inside of the room. The room where he\u2019d kissed her. Where she\u2019d melted against him, her body warm and wanting. He could smell her desire, could practically taste it. Why had she pushed him away?</p><p>He grimaced and stepped away from the door. He should be happy that she\u2019d brought the situation back under control. Sleeping with her would have complicated everything. Would have tossed his plan to keep her at a safe distance all to hell.</p><p>But while he might be able to pretend to be happy about it to her, he wasn\u2019t happy. At all. He was angry and frustrated and horny. He wanted to drag her out of the pool, toss her over his shoulder, and carry her back to the room. Pluck that little swimsuit off of her. He wanted to make love to her for the rest of the trip. Taste the desire he smelled on her. Hell, he could make love to her forev\u2014no. What was he thinking? Lust was muddling things up, making him think impossible things.</p><p>He paced back and forth in the suite, but the couple of strides it took him to cross the painfully colored space didn\u2019t take a bit of edge off his nerves. He stopped and forced a few deep breaths. He closed his eyes and was suddenly off balance.</p><p>The sun. He wasn\u2019t feeling like himself because of sun poisoning.</p> <p>He walked into the bathroom he shared with her and grabbed his fake shampoo bottle from the bag holding his bathroom supplies. He\u2019d stuffed it under the sink, knowing she\u2019d never be the type of person to go through his belongings, even if she did happen to discover the bag. He flipped the top open and downed a few mouthfuls of blood. Careful to make sure none had spilled onto the bottle, he replaced it in the bag, brushed his teeth, and headed for the bed. His head hit the pillow and he immediately regretted lying down.</p><p>Her scent surrounded him, covering the pillow and the bedding. He turned his head and took a deep breath, and instantly, his cock hardened painfully in his shorts, and his fangs lengthened.</p><p>God, he still wanted her. It wasn\u2019t a desire he could blame on sun poisoning.</p><p>And if he was honest, he\u2019d wanted her for a very long time.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d never gone to a single neighborhood event before she\u2019d moved into the house next door. Not a single party. Not a single meeting to discuss common areas. But ever since she\u2019d shown up on his doorstep five years before, asking him to sign up to help build a neighborhood park, he\u2019d gone to every damn thing. Sat through the boring meetings. Nodded politely at his neighbor\u2019s stories and banter. All for a glimpse of Alice.</p><p>Ridiculous. Boredom had to be to blame. He wasn\u2019t in love with her. He didn\u2019t know her that well, even if he had believed in something as impossible to find as real, long lasting, romantic love. But something about her drew him. Every. Damn. Time.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just her beauty, although she was truly magnificent to behold. She was also tenacious and smart. And her smile...hell, the whole room lit up when she flashed her brilliant white teeth. Infectious, that\u2019s what she was. Her energy and her optimism warmed part of him that had lived in shadow for so long he had thought it had died with his humanity.</p><p>His phone buzzed in his pocket and he pushed up to sit at the edge of the bed.</p><p>The caller ID read Charles. \u201cAbout time you called me back,\u201d he said when he picked up.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s not get in a snit. You talked to Alex, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Charles said, amusement plain in his tone.</p><p>\u201cYes, and Alex had exactly nothing to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know Alex, not very well-informed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what the fuck you\u2019ve found out,\u201d Noah snapped.</p><p>Silence answered him on the line and he rubbed his face with his hand. \u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry, Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Charles asked, his normally light tone tight with worry.</p><p>Noah let out a breath. He couldn\u2019t tell Charles he\u2019d shown almost inhuman skill in front of a bunch of damn wedding guests to win a volleyball match. He couldn\u2019t tell him he was inches from losing control and sleeping with Alice. Hell, the way she\u2019d backed off the night before, that wasn\u2019t really a problem anyway. And he could control himself with her even if she changed her mind about sleeping with him. He could.</p><p>\u201cScaring me a little here, man,\u201d Charles prodded, voice soft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I am. Just came in from a few hours in the sun is all. A little on edge.\u201d Not exactly a lie. Nice. You\u2019re \u201cnot exactly\u201d lying to your friend. Your brother in everything but birth. Way to go.</p><p>\u201cGet some blood in you,\u201d Charles replied, relief flooding his voice with emotion. \u201cShit man, you gotta be careful with that. You know how much blood it can take to recover from too much sun exposure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Or, I will be. It was an oversight. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d And it wouldn\u2019t. Not the sun exposure. Not the fucking demonstrations of his power in front of mortals. Not another kiss.</p><p>Definitely not another kiss.</p><p>\u201cDo you have enough?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s mind went blank. What had they been talking about? \u201cEnough what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...blood? Do you have enough blood? I know you were planning on a minimal supply, keeping just enough to keep things on the level while you were there. So with this sun exposure, you sure you got enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty,\u201d he answered automatically. But did he? Not if he had to take another jaunt in the sun, that was certain. He\u2019d brought what he could reasonably fit into fake toiletry containers. Thank goodness for the chemicals vampire scientists had created to keep blood fresh without refrigeration, or he\u2019d definitely have to hunt onboard the cruise ship.</p><p>\u201cIf you run low, you know you\u2019re better off with a quick, controlled hunt, right? I know it\u2019s been a while for you, but better that\u2014fuzzy a memory\u2014than getting hungry.\u201d Charles paused, as if waiting for a response, then added, \u201cIf you get too hungry, things could go bad real quick.\u201d</p><p>Better off blanking out a human\u2019s memory after taking a little blood than losing control, maybe hurting someone\u2014or worse. That\u2019s what Charles meant. But Noah was glad he didn\u2019t say it outright. Charles had faith he could handle it, even if his worry prompted him to suggest a hunt. And Charles\u2019s faith wasn\u2019t misplaced\u2014it wasn\u2019t. Noah was older than Charles. Granted, that made him even more susceptible to the effects of the sun and more reliant on blood. But it also meant he had decades more experience at controlling the need.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any news for me?\u201d Noah asked. Best to keep the conversation away from his blood supply. No need to worry Charles unnecessarily. Besides, if he did run low, he\u2019d be okay. He had excellent control.</p><p>Hesitation again. Noah gritted his teeth and shoved down the rage that all too swiftly rose in his chest. Definitely more blood\u2014he shouldn\u2019t be this easy to anger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. No progress yet. They\u2019re pretty damn insistent. I don\u2019t know the why of it all yet, but I\u2019m fishing it out. Takes time, you know? I should have better news for you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed his anger. Charles didn\u2019t deserve getting his head bitten off. He was doing his damnedest to help.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he finally managed. \u201cThey aren\u2019t hunting me yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I would have heard about that. I think they\u2019re at a standstill, just like we hoped.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the wedding going? Hey, if you were out in the sun, tell me you at least got to see some babes in bikinis.\u201d</p><p>Noah suppressed a sigh. That was Charles. No matter how dire their situation, there was always time to discuss women. \u201cSorry to disappoint you. Volleyball kept me too busy to ogle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, man. You could lie to me.\u201d His voice still light\u2014too light. He added, \u201cHow\u2019s it going with your hottie next door neighbor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrustrating,\u201d he said without thinking.</p><p>\u201cWell now that sounds interesting,\u201d Charles said. \u201cWhat kind of frustration are we talking here? Sexual or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Charles laughed. \u201cSure, man.\u201d</p><p>Noah tossed his cell phone on the bed and stared at the bright wallpaper, and wished it didn\u2019t suddenly feel like the walls were all closing in on him.</p> <p>Charles was right. He needed more blood. And he needed to get away from her scent.</p><p>She was too sweaty after volleyball to go with Cindy to get their nails done without showering first. Noah would be resting, and she didn\u2019t want to disturb him, but hopefully, a fifteen-minute shower and quick change wouldn\u2019t bother him overly much.</p><p>She opened the stateroom door quietly. Maybe if he was already asleep she could slip in and not wake him. Movement caught her eye, and the full-length mirror across from the bathroom revealed Noah. He was awake. And\u2014was he drinking from the shampoo bottle?</p><p>Her bag thunked when it hit the floor, and she turned her eyes to it. When she looked back up, Noah stood in the bathroom doorway, no longer carrying the shampoo bottle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back early,\u201d he said, as if he hadn\u2019t just been drinking shampoo.</p><p>She opened her mouth, then snapped it shut. What the hell? Had she invited a total crazy person to room with her? No. Noah wasn\u2019t crazy. Not shampoo-drinking crazy anyway. Yikes. Talk about a stomach ache.</p> <p>\u201cI need a shower before I meet up with Cindy. Feeling a little scuzzy after volleyball. Glad I didn\u2019t wake you,\u201d she said, forcing the words past the shampoo-drinker thought pulsating in her brain.</p><p>His brows drew together with worry. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>Shampoo-drinker. Shampoo-drinker. Shampoo-drinker. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I...\u201d Saw you drinking shampoo. Am now wondering if you\u2019re total crazypants. Think that drinking shampoo has to be really bad for you. \u201cI\u2019m just a little tired. It\u2019s been a while since I played volleyball.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat was fun, I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you would think so. You creamed them for the championship. Cindy was thinking of buying you a trophy. Something supremely awful and garish to celebrate your victory. Of course, it would give her an excuse to stop by your house at some point. So, you\u2019d have to leave it out somewhere it could be seen.\u201d She widened her eyes dramatically. \u201cMy, I wonder how that would look with your decor.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and the sound warmed her far more than it should have. The man had one heck of a laugh. And kind eyes\u2014when they weren\u2019t so guarded. She risked a look at them. So dark, and such a color of blue she could get lost in them. And in the intensity behind them. He noticed her gaze, and like a wall, guarded amusement replaced the true feeling she\u2019d seen there. The man was a contradiction.</p><p>\u201cAll right, guess I\u2019d better get out of your way.\u201d He stepped out of the bathroom and made his way to the pullout couch. The television clicked to life, and the familiar hum of it hit her, breaking the surreal moment. She reached into her bag, grabbed a random outfit, and then stepped into the bathroom.</p><p>Her history with men should have made her assume there was something off about Noah. But he\u2019d seemed so nice. So normal. So unlike Brent.</p> <p>And she\u2019d sworn she\u2019d never fall for a man like Brent again. Or any man at all. Especially not one who drank shampoo.</p><p>She could forgive herself for Brent. They\u2019d started dating when she was young. She hadn\u2019t known what to look for. Hadn\u2019t realized why he\u2019d asked about her family. He\u2019d noticed her, lavished attention on her, told her she was beautiful.</p><p>Heady stuff for an eighteen-year-old.</p><p>She ran a brush through her hair, and then tugged off her clothes and folded them before piling them neatly.</p><p>And when he\u2019d started acting a little controlling, he\u2019d explained away the behavior with reasons she wanted to hear. He loved her so much, of course he was jealous when she talked to other guys. He needed her so much, that\u2019s why he\u2019d wanted her by his side all the time.</p><p>Bull.</p><p>When she\u2019d finally started to realize he was interested in her because of her family\u2019s money\u2014in her potential inheritance\u2014she\u2019d been in so far she hadn\u2019t wanted to admit her mistake. Digging deeply within herself, she\u2019d finally found the courage to call him on it. To ask the questions she didn\u2019t want the answers to.</p><p>To push him away.</p><p>She\u2019d gone back to make up with him after their fight. After she\u2019d accused him of being more interested in her family\u2019s money than in her. Of course she had. She\u2019d been with him for several years by then. They were going to get married. Start a family. And he was so good at playing the part of the nice guy when he put his mind to it.</p><p>Even as the niggling of doubt about him grew within her, she hadn\u2019t really been ready for it to be over. She\u2019d gone to his apartment without calling to make up. To tell him she believed him. To lie to herself and him, and say that she knew he wasn\u2019t interested in her because of her family\u2019s money.</p><p>And walked in on him and Kristen.</p><p>After Kristen had run out of the apartment in tears, he\u2019d been angry. It was the first time he\u2019d willingly revealed the monster lurking under his charming surface to her. The things he\u2019d said. About Alice. About how cold she was. About how she\u2019d never find anyone who would love her like he did. The words had stuck with her. Even as her feelings for Brent had faded.</p><p>She shook her head. It didn\u2019t matter now. She was better off without Brent, that was obvious, even before this trip\u2014her need to show him she was over him notwithstanding. But she\u2019d thought Noah was a good one. And maybe he was. He wasn\u2019t a jerk at least. Just crazy enough to drink shampoo.</p><p>A nervous giggle caught in her throat. She opened the cabinet below the sink. The shampoo bottle stood out. The rest of his toiletries were still in the bag below the sink, but he hadn\u2019t had time to do more than shove the shampoo bottle next to it. She ignored it and turned the shower on. Only after she undressed and was ready to step under the steady stream of water did she risk picking it up. She took it with her into the shower, in the unlikely chance he could actually distinguish the sound of his shampoo bottle opening from outside the bathroom door.</p><p>Come on, Noah. Don\u2019t be a crazy man. I can\u2019t be wrong about you.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she thumbed the bottle lid open.</p><p>Nothing sprang out, and she laughed nervously under her breath. What had she expected? It wasn\u2019t a trick can of nuts. She sniffed at the open bottle, and the smell that touched her nose wasn\u2019t chemical, or heavily scented like shampoo would be. Almost metallic, the scent was familiar, but she couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on what it smelled like.</p><p>Body tense despite the steaming water pouring over her back, she turned the bottle over and squeezed it into her hand. Red liquid filled her palm, and the bottle slipped from her fingers, clattering to the floor of the shower.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing this,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cI know how you hate these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Maid of Honor for, if not to endure what she must for the bride? Even if she has to look like a goblin to do it.\u201d Alice forced a smile, wishing even the sight of her sister\u2019s green face could distract her from her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing you, you know. I love spending time with you.\u201d</p><p>Cindy grinned at her through the beauty mask cream that had been spread over both their faces, looking quite garish for a bride. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the wedding is almost here. I mean, this whole year of planning passed by so fast.\u201d</p><p>Alice wiggled her toes. The water felt good on her feet after the rough surface of the pool. Soon, she\u2019d have bright, flashy toes to match her newly resurfaced face. \u201cWell, you\u2019re marrying the man of your dreams. Time flies when you\u2019re having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Cindy\u2019s smile faded, and her expression turned serious. \u201cBut I actually wanted to talk to you about something not wedding-related.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Alice said, keeping her voice light. But her stomach dropped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me, Alice. The way he moved. The allergy to sunlight. It\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d</p><p>Alice winced. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t obvious to me. Not until I saw the blood. Do you think anyone else noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood? Andrew would have noticed if he was here, I\u2019m sure. But as far as I know, we\u2019re the only other ones who know about Olivia.\u201d She glanced around, but they were still very alone in the small, private room that had been reserved for their spa treatments. \u201cI don\u2019t think he did anything that would scream vampire.\u201d</p><p>Alice let out a breath she didn\u2019t even realize she was holding. Her brother probably would have known, but being engaged to a vampire gave him an edge she didn\u2019t have. She\u2019d barely spent any time around Olivia.</p><p>\u201cAt least, not that would be apparent to anyone who didn\u2019t already know vampires are real,\u201d Cindy continued. \u201cHonestly, if I didn\u2019t already kind of suspect, I think it would have looked more like he was just playing with Brent for the first half of the game.\u201d Her smile widened. \u201cBrent must be pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis sun allergy gave him away with you, huh?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Also, there\u2019s sort of an aura about him. Not sure how to describe it, exactly. Like a power. Olivia had that, too, but to a lesser extent than Noah.\u201d Cindy nibbled on her lip, a gesture that revealed her worry no matter how hard she tried to hide it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alice opened her mouth to reply, but a woman stepped into the room. White teeth flashing, she wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d applied their masks, but she wore the same collared shirt that declared her a spa employee. \u201cHow are we doing back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, thanks,\u201d Alice said. Had the woman overheard?</p><p>\u201cAnother ten minutes and we\u2019ll be back to remove the masks and start the pedicures. Can I get you anything? Coffee? A magazine?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Alice replied, wishing the woman was a little worse at her job.</p><p>She nodded and disappeared back the way she\u2019d come, leaving the door only partially shut.</p><p>\u201cSo you found blood?\u201d Cindy asked, pitching her voice even lower.</p><p>Alice groaned. \u201cI walked in and saw him drinking from his shampoo bottle,\u201d she muttered as quietly as she could manage.</p><p>\u201cGross!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight? He didn\u2019t see me see him. But I checked it when I took a shower. I knew he smelled like my shampoo. He\u2019s probably been using mine. And I snuck a peek in his bag. He brought a ton of product with him. Cologne, hair gel, stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man doesn\u2019t seem to use any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I guess I should have suspected it sooner.\u201d And maybe she should have. But the idea of vampires being real was something she still struggled with. Granted, Olivia had proven her powers and showed off her fangs to her, Cindy, and Andrew. But now, months removed from her demonstration, it all seemed too surreal.</p><p>Cindy shrugged and examined her freshly manicured nails. \u201cWhy would you? Olivia was very clear on that. Vampires are really rare. Meeting one in a lifetime is a statistical improbability, she said. And running into another one who is totally unrelated to the first? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have something to say about those odds.\u201d</p><p>Alice sighed. \u201cI miss her. The way she talked. Who would have guessed we\u2019d meet a vampire and she\u2019d be such a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNerd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCindy,\u201d she said, suppressing a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat? She\u2019s a total nerd.\u201d</p><p>Cindy was right. But somehow, the smart little vampire had seemed like such a perfect match for their athletic, outgoing brother. \u201cHow is Andrew doing?\u201d Alice asked, good humor draining from her as she remembered the last time she\u2019d seen her big brother. \u201cI knew he\u2019d have a hard time with the wedding, but I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t show up.\u201d</p><p>Cindy leaned back in her chair and fanned herself with the spa\u2019s brochure. \u201cHe said he\u2019s fine. And he claimed he had to work. I say he\u2019s full of it. Getting left at the altar...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not something you get over quickly. And it\u2019s only been six months.\u201d</p><p>Alice shook her head, not sure what to say. Andrew had always been closer to Cindy, and if he wouldn\u2019t open up to her, he certainly wasn\u2019t likely to open up to anyone else. Olivia had hurt him deeply, even if he refused to admit it. Nothing else would have kept him from his younger sister\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you feel about the whole vampire thing?\u201d Cindy asked.</p><p>Alice shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me. Why should it? We\u2019re just neighbors.\u201d</p><p>Cindy\u2019s eyebrows flew up. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I thought maybe we could be friends, but I\u2019m not even sure we can be that.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t. Not after that kiss.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. That man doesn\u2019t look at you like a friend, and you practically have to wipe the drool off your chin around him.\u201d</p><p>Alice gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s not true! I mean, sure. He\u2019s not bad to look at\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cindy snickered.</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m drooling over him. And even if I was interested in him\u2014which I\u2019m not\u2014he\u2019s out of my league.\u201d That Noah was a vampire made the fact even clearer. Noah, the man, was quite a catch; Noah, the vampire, had to send all women\u2019s hearts aflutter.</p><p>\u201cHe is not! You don\u2019t give yourself enough credit.\u201d Cindy\u2019s eyes narrowed, but she didn\u2019t follow it with a strike at Brent like she would have a year ago. The whole situation had to be awkward for her. She had disliked Brent intensely, even before he\u2019d hurt Alice. But he was her soon-to-be husband\u2019s brother. Robert was a good man, too good. And he saw only the good in other people; he didn\u2019t see the selfishness in Brent Cindy saw.</p><p>\u201cRegardless, I\u2019m not ready for anything like that yet.\u201d She wasn\u2019t ready for something serious. And no matter how cool she played it with Cindy, she couldn\u2019t contemplate a simple short-term thing with Noah, no matter how tempting the idea was. And contemplating letting anyone close enough to use her again turned her stomach.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if a vampire as nice as Olivia could leave Andrew at the altar, maybe they\u2019re all a bunch of heartless bastards,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>Cindy\u2019s worried movements suddenly made sense, and Alice forced down the urge to defend Noah. Cindy was right to be concerned. She didn\u2019t know Noah well enough\u2014not really\u2014to declare his motives pure. Even though, strangely, she felt like she did.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him you know what he is?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhy bring it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should ask about his family, for your genealogy hobby. Just to see him fumble around for an excuse.\u201d</p><p>Alice snickered. \u201cIt\u2019s his secret. If he doesn\u2019t want me to know about it, well, then I guess I\u2019ll pretend I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s fair.\u201d Cindy took a deep breath. \u201cI tried to get Robert to leave Brent off the guest list.\u201d</p><p>Alice started at the change in subject. \u201cCindy! You shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>Cindy scratched at the corner of her mask and avoided meeting Alice\u2019s gaze. \u201cI can\u2019t stand him\u2014and it kills me that you have to see him again after what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s Robert\u2019s brother.\u201d Her heart swelled and she blinked back tears. The mask would be a dead giveaway. But her sister, her tough little sister, had fought for her. It meant a lot.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what Robert said. And I know he\u2019s a little...blind to Brent\u2019s faults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t try to step between them for me. I\u2019m just fine. But\u2014thank you.\u201d</p><p>They finished their beautifying and Alice headed back to her shared room. Not much time remained to get ready for dinner, and she wanted to make sure she was as close to a knock out as she could get tonight. If she wasn\u2019t, Brent and Kristen were sure to show up. And despite all the feelings Noah stirred in her, she still cared about showing Brent what he was missing. Annoyance flashed through her at that realization, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that she cared.</p><p>She opened the door as quietly as she could, but Noah sat up on the loveseat as she entered the room. His hair was smooshed and ruffled in a very enticing way, and he stared at her in confusion before his features settled into their normal polite smoothness.</p><p>She tugged on her fingers, suppressing the urge to run them through his mussed hair. His lips were parted slightly, and she knew a very clever tongue waited behind them. As if sensing her desire to smooth his hair, he ran his own hand over it. His hands were so strong, large, and a little rough, as if he actually worked with them occasionally. Maybe he did.</p><p>She really didn\u2019t know him all that well. For all she knew, he was a master craftsman. Heck, he could dig ditches for fun and she\u2019d have no idea. But she knew what those hands felt like on her arms, against her back. And she could almost feel them on her stomach, and teasing her breasts.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, then cocked his head to the side. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, and heat rushed over her cheeks. She spun quickly to avoid his knowing eyes, and hit her own suitcase with her big toe.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d she said. Noah appeared at her side, his arm already under hers. She tried to hobble away, not sure if she could resist tearing his clothes off if he kept touching her. But he ignored her meager efforts to escape\u2014if he noticed them at all\u2014and he half-carried her to the bed and helped her sit.</p><p>\u201cThat sounded like it hurt,\u201d he said, kneeling in front of her and taking her foot into his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just a klutz.\u201d Her toe throbbed slightly, calling her a liar with every beat of her pulse.</p><p>He grinned at her red toe. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem like a klutz on the volleyball court today. I think you were trying to hide your blush. No doubt, terribly perverse thoughts about me were flying through your head.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him.</p><p>\u201cYour toe is fine,\u201d he announced, but he didn\u2019t release her foot. He looked up and met her eyes, and the intensity of his gaze swept over her. Desire hit her like a bag of bricks, a swift blow that robbed her of her breath and made her whole body ache.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking no such things,\u201d she said, wishing her breathlessness didn\u2019t give her away.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t right for each other. And what happened last night isn\u2019t happening again.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. It couldn\u2019t. There was no way she\u2019d be able to stop things again like she did the night before. Not if he kept looking at her like that. And he was a vampire, just like Olivia. And she\u2019d run off after swearing to love her brother forever. What would stop Noah from doing the same? Vampires weren\u2019t normal people. She had to remember that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We aren\u2019t right for each other.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed through her, fanning her desire in a most annoying way. The greatest defense is a good offense. \u201cWe\u2019re not. In fact, I can\u2019t think of anyone less suitable for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He quirked an eyebrow at her and she ignored it. How could he look so scrumptious and be so annoying at the same time?</p><p>\u201cNo. Besides, I\u2019m not looking to be tied down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A feral grin blossomed on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Shepard, if I tied you down I\u2019d be sure to untie you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth but she was unable to summon even a word to argue with him. She managed a squeak as images ran through her mind, unbidden and most unwelcome. Noah, tying her wrists with something soft. His mouth, trailing its way down her body, leaving flecks of fire behind. Her, writhing against him, unable to seek what she most wanted from him until he chose to give it to her. Her belly clenched with desire.</p><p>Crap.</p> <p>She shook her head rapidly and then yanked her foot from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cYou will do no such thing, and I\u2019ll thank you to keep your silly flirtations to yourself. We are not anything more than neighbors, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to stay.\u201d She pushed up from the bed in a huff, grimacing at a flash of pain from her toe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one imagining us otherwise.\u201d He got up from the floor and looked at her calmly, but passion still lit his eyes, she could see it. She wasn\u2019t the only one in the room imagining her tied up, she would bet her house on it.</p><p>She steeled her spine. Nothing could happen between her and Noah. He might be mad at her for a while, but he\u2019d cool off. And they might at least be able to be civil again. Maybe be friends. That was better than what would undoubtedly happen if they tried to be anything else. Brent had proven that. So had Olivia.</p><p>A niggling doubt touched her. Noah was nothing like Brent, maybe she wouldn\u2019t end up hating herself for months if things didn\u2019t work out with him. Unlike her ex, he didn\u2019t have ulterior motives for touching her. Didn\u2019t want anything from her. Did he? She shoved the paranoid thoughts away.</p> <p>Heck, the man was immortal\u2014or as close to it as a person could get. What could he possibly want to use her for? No. It didn\u2019t matter. Noah wasn\u2019t a risk she could afford to take.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019ve seen a few of your dates the last few years. Even if you were my type, they would be enough to deter me,\u201d she added. She was trying to convince him. Not herself. And if she repeated that three times, maybe she\u2019d believe it.</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d Her eyes met his, and the challenge in them goaded her. They were all beautiful. Model-perfect from what she could see. But she couldn\u2019t say that, it would reveal too much. Give him the chance to see through her defenses.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? They didn\u2019t compete with the likes of Brent?\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cThey could compete just fine. But not a one of them lasted more than a night or two, did they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it if I\u2019m discerning, Miss Shepard.\u201d</p><p>Miss Shepard. God, he was such a jerk. \u201cDiscerning? With the line of models you\u2019ve had through there? More like scared.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Til death do us part is a long time.\u201d</p><p>For him, especially, she wanted to say. But she managed to stop herself. \u201cIt is,\u201d she murmured, instead.</p><p>He took a step toward her, so close now. Their eyes met and her breath caught in her throat. No anger danced behind his gaze and the corner of his mouth turned up. He was baiting her. Enjoying their argument. She should be mad. He\u2019d brought up Brent, after all. But she couldn\u2019t seem to summon any real ire. Her blood rushed through her ears, and she bit her lip.</p><p>Fists at his sides, he stopped, and the amusement drained from his expression. Only one step away, but the man might as well have been on the other side of the ship. And it was almost as if she could see his mental debate. His warning bells going off. His decision.</p> <p>He turned away and reached for his bag. \u201cMy personal life isn\u2019t any of your business. Don\u2019t we have a dinner to get to soon?\u201d</p><p>He had to get a grip.</p><p>Noah ran a brush through his hair and smeared a small dab of some product through it that Charles insisted he use whenever they went somewhere requiring a jacket or tie.</p><p>He\u2019d almost kissed her again, deciding the chance to make love to Alice was worth any risk. He\u2019d almost pulled her back into his arms so he could feel her softness pressed against him. Almost said to hell with dinner, to hell with his intentions to keep things businesslike between them, to hell with playing it safe.</p><p>Fuck. He couldn\u2019t afford to think like that. This was a one-week cruise. If he couldn\u2019t get through a week without kissing one woman, what did that say about him? Vampires prized control above all else. They had to. It was what kept them safe. What kept the humans around them safe.</p><p>He\u2019d be damned if he let Alice break the control he\u2019d spent decades perfecting.</p><p>Their dinner in the ship\u2019s Italian-themed restaurant flew by too quickly, because after dinner was the bachelor party. Not to mention the bachelorette party.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t a bachelor party traditionally held the night before the wedding?\u201d he asked Alice as she munched on the last bite of a large piece of tiramisu. She finished off her coffee before answering him.</p><p>\u201cSure. But who wants to be hung over for their wedding?\u201d</p><p>She had a point.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019ll be tossing dollar bills at some muscle bound idiot this evening?\u201d Not that he cared. Had he sounded like he cared? Shit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d she said, expression far too innocent.</p><p>The idea of her watching men strut around all night didn\u2019t bother him nearly as much as the possibility they\u2019d enjoy dancing around her. It was silly, really. A night of harmless fun, even if there were strippers.</p><p>Hell, maybe strippers would be good for him. Take his mind off of Alice. He shook his head. Who was he kidding? No stripper was going to replace lovely, enticing Alice in his thoughts.</p><p>He followed the Robert\u2014who, for a man entering his bachelor party, didn\u2019t seem at all nervous\u2014and the far-too-young Jake, to a medium-sized banquet hall. The brightness of the room surprised him, as did the lack of stripper poles. The room was empty save for a dozen or so men Noah recognized from other family events\u2014wedding guests, then. Not a cruise ship-run strip club. A private party?</p><p>But instead of scantily clad women, the room had several poker tables set up.</p><p>He glanced at Robert, and the groom shrugged. \u201cDidn\u2019t really feel comfortable getting strippers with Cindy only a few rooms over. So instead, we have poker and some pretty cocktail waitresses. Also,\u201d he grinned, \u201ccigars.\u201d</p><p>Brent walked in and Noah would have bristled at him if he\u2019d had fur. Instead, he watched the other man with a suspicious eye. Brent, surprisingly, kept his gaze firmly away from Noah. And the few times he did glance in Noah\u2019s direction, he slid his gaze over him, as if he didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Should he be insulted at Brent\u2019s disinterest, or happy the other man was ignoring him? Maybe Brent had realized the battle for Alice was one he couldn\u2019t win. Noah shook himself mentally. Battle for Alice? There was no battle. She was a prize he could never claim.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes as Brent outlined the plan for the night. Noah might not be able to take Alice for his own, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let an asshole like Brent have her either.</p><p>Shit. He had to stop thinking about her.</p><p>He found himself sitting at a table between Jake and Robert, and directly across from Brent. He grimaced. What? The man couldn\u2019t beat him at volleyball so he was determined to take him down playing poker?</p><p>Brent had a hell of a lot to learn.</p><p>A couple of other men sat at the table with them, but Noah missed their names. Alice\u2019s uncle, he thought he recalled. And one of her cousins.</p><p>A cocktail waitress, in a dress so tiny she might as well have been a stripper, came by for their drink orders.</p><p>\u201cJohnnie Walker Blue, straight up,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Robert agreed, a smile on his face for the waitress. \u201cBut make mine on the rocks.\u201d The groom\u2019s eyes actually managed to stay out of the waitress\u2019s cleavage while he ordered. Good man.</p><p>Shockingly, Brent\u2019s gaze also remained on the woman\u2019s eyes as he ordered a Coke. But Jake didn\u2019t even bother to conceal his interest. Noah doubted he\u2019d even be able to say the color of the woman\u2019s eyes if questioned with a gun to his head.</p><p>The dealer, also scantily clad, dealt the first hand.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jake,\u201d Noah said once the waitress had disappeared to retrieve their drinks. \u201cHow long have you been seeing Edna?\u201d</p><p>Jake dragged his gaze away from where the waitress had disappeared, eyes a touch glassy. \u201cOh, Edna and I have been seeing each other causally for two years now.\u201d</p><p>Noah frowned. Defending Alice\u2019s mother was hardly his job, but she was a good woman, and Jake\u2019s lack of control annoyed him. \u201cAnd do you drool over other women around her, too?\u201d</p><p>Someone snickered, and Jake looked flummoxed, his eyes wide and mouth open.</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not like Edna and I are exactly exclusive, Noah,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cEdna\u2019s always got at least three guys on speed dial,\u201d Robert explained, tossing two cards toward the dealer.</p><p>\u201cThree, huh? She must be slowing down,\u201d Brent added.</p><p>Noah wasn\u2019t sure what to say to that, so he frowned at Jake. But Jake didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by Brent and Robert\u2019s observations. If anything, the man grinned a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta understand, Noah,\u201d another man said. Alice\u2019s uncle, maybe. Then Edna\u2019s own brother? \u201cEdna\u2019s quite a woman. But she won\u2019t ever commit to a man again. Not after her husband. He was her very own Prince Charming. And she\u2019ll tell you the same, if you ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s quite measured up to the kids\u2019 father,\u201d Jake agreed, not seeming insulted by the comparison. \u201cMostly, she keeps guys like me around for entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Noah asked. Cigar smoke swirled around them, almost unseen, but the smell was strong enough to be distracting. A good smell, one that threatened to drag him into the past. How many nights had he spent in a club so like this, with glasses clinking and smoke filling the air? But that was a long time ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell, no. She\u2019s a great woman. We have fun together.\u201d He tossed his cards back at the dealer along with a gratuity and she tipped an invisible hat to him in thanks.</p><p>Half a dozen hands later, Noah realized Brent wasn\u2019t the pushover he\u2019d assumed when it came to poker. The man was up almost as much as Noah, and even though the actual betting amounts were kept low, he found Brent\u2019s skill annoying.</p><p>Gone was the man who exuded emotion, and before him now was one who actually seemed to know how to keep his cool. The transformation was unsettling.</p> <p>The waitress dropped off the table\u2019s latest rounds of drinks, and finally, Noah put his finger on the difference.</p><p>\u201cNot drinking tonight, Brent?\u201d he asked over the steady murmur of voices that grew louder with every round of drinks.</p><p>Brent eyed him over his hand. \u201cI never drink while gambling. I like to keep a clear head.\u201d</p><p>Noah murmured in approval but watched Brent carefully for the rest of the night. Alice\u2019s shock at Brent\u2019s behavior finally made sense. The man hid his snakeskin under a charming facade. Knowing what lurked just beneath the surface, Noah could still pinpoint the cruel glint in his eye. But if he\u2019d met this man first\u2014the man with the clear head\u2014Brent might have even fooled him. For a short while, anyway.</p><p>Time seemed to tick by in slow motion as he watched the handsome man play hand after hand, winning far more often than he lost. If confronted by this man, would Alice believe the facade? Fall for Brent again? Surely not. She\u2019d seen behind the mask and Alice was a smart woman.</p> <p>But she\u2019d been with him for years before seeing Brent with her best friend. Something about the man appealed to her. Got to her. Could he snake his way back into her life? With greater certainty than he should have felt, Noah was quite sure that was exactly what Brent planned to do.</p><p>Over his dead body.</p><p>He beat Alice back to the cabin after the party. And from the way she\u2019d stumbled into the room giggling and smelling strongly of appletinis, he suspected the bachelorette party had been a lot more fun than the low-key gambling of the bachelor party. But when he\u2019d asked, even as tipsy as she was, she\u2019d solemnly told him that her lips were sealed.</p><p>She fell asleep quickly, while his mind still whirred with thoughts. He nodded off to the rhythm of her heartbeat and the sound of her steady breathing.</p><p>They slept late the next morning and spent a lazy day relaxing around the ship. Alice hit up the spa with her sister again while Noah met Jake for an early lunch. Shortly before dinner, he returned to the room and showered.</p><p>He exited the bathroom and the sight of her hit him like running into a brick wall. The spa had agreed with her. She was stunning, in a flowing skirt that hit a couple of inches above her knees, and short-heeled sandals that accentuated her pretty toes and perfectly-formed calves. Her hair flowed around her shoulders, and pretty curls bounced around her face.</p> <p>And he did his best to ignore the scoop neck of her blouse. The light material made it look like it would be all too easy to feel her body through it. To touch her breasts, which the low neck displayed clearly.</p><p>He dragged his gaze away before his attraction revealed itself in a most embarrassing way. A set of curlers sat on the nightstand next to the bed.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t do your hair at the spa?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at the curlers. \u201cI just wanted a little bounce\u2014they flat-ironed it at the salon. We stopped by the gift shop. You like the sandals?\u201d She pointed at her wiggling toes.</p><p>\u201cNice. Ready to go?\u201d he asked, voice gruff. He swallowed hard. Get a grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look nice, by the way,\u201d she added, voice soft.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare glance her way. \u201cThanks. You, too.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was a larger affair than the night before. They\u2019d chosen a different restaurant\u2014this one specializing in Asian cuisine\u2014but the ambiance was much the same. Despite the large number of people, the space resonated a hum of conversation, but he could still clearly hear their dinner companions. And even more impressive, his companions could hear him without vampire senses.</p> <p>He casually noted Brent and Kristen were not in attendance and Cindy replied that they\u2019d be joining later.</p><p>\u201cSo tell us about yourself, Noah,\u201d Edna said, warm smile on her face. He found himself smiling back, and some of the tension he\u2019d carried since being reminded of how good Alice could look faded away.</p><p>Something about Alice\u2019s mother made him feel comfortable, even as she pressed him for information about himself. An odd sensation. He would have attributed it to be a simple mother thing, but she was nothing like his mother had been. They were very different women. Of course, how could they not be, with centuries between them?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what there is to tell,\u201d he said, finally. He had a prepared background, of course. One that would withstand a good deal of scrutiny if a person was curious\u2014or suspicious\u2014enough to check it out. But he hesitated to lie to Edna.</p><p>\u201cWell, start at the beginning, why don\u2019t you? Where are you from, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m originally from New York,\u201d he said, the lie leaving a heavy weight on his tongue. \u201cBut I\u2019ve lived in California for the last decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brought you out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork,\u201d he said, and that much was the truth.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Alice asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to keep a regular work schedule.\u201d</p><p>Edna shot her a considering look, before returning her gaze to Noah.</p><p>He suppressed a grimace. Alice had just revealed\u2014to anyone who was paying close enough attention\u2014that she didn\u2019t know him well enough to call him her boyfriend. And he got the feeling Edna always paid very close attention to her daughters.</p><p>But a pleasant feeling filled his chest. How closely had Alice been observing him? Had she secretly watched him over the years like he had her? \u201cMy work involves importing and exporting with several Asian countries. I tend to keep their business hours, which keeps me up most nights working. The in-person meetings I attend locally only happen occasionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fascinating,\u201d Edna said. \u201cWhat kinds of things do you import?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh-end antiquities, for the most part. Although, I\u2019ve brokered deals for less exciting products as well.\u201d</p><p>Edna rattled off a few other questions, and hearing the topic of discussion, the rest of the table asked about his business as well. He was suddenly thankful his line of work was one that could be shared. He had a feeling that even he would have been thrown by some of the odd details they\u2019d asked if he hadn\u2019t actually worked in his field.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been married?\u201d Edna asked, after a barrage of questions from Cindy that seemed to suggest she thought he might be bringing in antiquities that were stolen from long lost emperors.</p><p>He blinked at her. And the truth spilled out of him before he could think better of it. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>Alice went suddenly still next to him, and Edna\u2019s eyes blazed with triumph. And he suddenly wondered if the barrage of seemingly ordinary questions had been designed to butter him up to reveal the truth of this one.</p><p>\u201cYou were married?\u201d Alice asked, voice soft.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, simply. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out.\u201d And that was all he was going to say about it.</p><p>To his surprise, no one pressed him for more information and the conversation turned to Cindy and Robert, with suggestions from Edna that news of a grandbaby would be a fabulous Christmas present.</p><p>Robert, with his obsession with sports, already had names picked out for any boys. All of them were for his favorite sports heroes. Cindy seemed determined to have girls only, because boys, she said, were far too much trouble. But she smiled softly at Robert when she said it, the love between them plain for the world to see.</p><p>Happy the pressure had moved from him, Noah finished his meal, silently watching the family around him. Their love for each other was obvious. Did they know how lucky they were?</p><p>\u201cShare a dessert with me?\u201d Alice asked after the meal had concluded.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>The waitress brought them a giant piece of cheesecake that Alice eyed as though it were the first bit of food she\u2019d seen after a week on a desert island. He managed a single bite before she finished the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cSo much for sharing,\u201d he told her quietly.</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s cheesecake. Not my fault if you can\u2019t eat fast enough to get your share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. It\u2019s every man for himself when it comes to dessert.\u201d Her eyes glittered with mischief in the ambient light as she smiled sideways at him like a little girl hiding something behind her back. As uncomfortable as he was with the feelings she stirred in him, he couldn\u2019t tear his gaze from her. She licked her fork and he followed the movement with his eyes, mesmerized. God, that tongue. His jeans grew tighter, and he took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you\u2019re an only child,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d If she kept licking that fork he\u2019d have to kiss her. Drag her off to the room and taste her. Did she have any idea how sexy she was?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to fight for your food.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, only half hearing her words as he watched her clean the fork. Finally, she set the utensil down, and he flip-flopped between being thankful and utterly disappointed. If he needed to fight for anything, it was for keeping his hands off Alice.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys ready?\u201d Cindy asked, and he yanked his attention away from Alice to focus on her sister. Half the table was already up from their chairs, and Cindy leaned over the table to address them, her expression laced with amusement.</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d he asked, smiling nervously and knowing he wasn\u2019t going to like her response. She looked far too excited for his comfort level.</p><p>\u201cSalsa dancing,\u201d Cindy replied, her smile growing to envelop her face. Noah felt his face fall as his heart began to race.</p><p>Dancing. Of course. Just what he needed to keep his hands off of Alice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cStart with your left foot,\u201d the instructor called, keeping his voice loud to make himself heard over the music. \u201cOne, two, three. Back to the neutral position. Pause on four. Good! Five, step back with your right foot. Six, seven. Nice job. Again!\u201d</p><p>Alice tapped her feet on the hardwood floors and tried to avoid looking at her own form in the full-length mirrors lining one of the walls. She felt pretty good about the dancing, and was doing as good a job as the rest of the guests who\u2019d joined them at picking up the steps. Several couples lined up next to each other, forming four long, uneven lines of dancers.</p> <p>She\u2019d dreaded the opportunity, even as her pulse raced at the thought of moving to a fast-tempo song in Noah\u2019s arms. But it seemed that she hadn\u2019t needed to worry, because the first thirty minutes of dance class hadn\u2019t yet involved dancing with a partner. Instead, they\u2019d lined up and worked at learning the steps on their own.</p><p>\u201cStep! Two, three,\u201d the instructor said, stomping his foot on the hardwood floors and clapping in time with the music. Alice wavered and lost her balance as she tried to correct her beat. A steady hand grasped her elbow. She gave Noah a thankful smile and tried to ignore the heat that seemed to pulse from his grip into her, up her arm and down to her core.</p><p>\u201cOkay, time to dance with your partner.\u201d The instructor gave them all a brilliant smile, as if this was the moment they\u2019d all been waiting for. Then again, by the looks of the other couples, he was probably right. The crowd scattered, chattering excitedly to each other, still filling only a small area of the dance studio, which was large enough to teach a big group.</p><p>But Alice\u2019s stomach dropped. She wanted nothing more than to be in Noah\u2019s arms right this second, but she wasn\u2019t entirely sure she could hide her attraction. She spared him a glance, and felt even worse. He looked...well, he looked whatever the opposite of excited was to dance with her.</p><p>But when the salsa music started thumping again, he pulled her close to him, his hard biceps gently flexing. His hand settled firmly on the small of her back, its span almost perfectly as wide as her waist. Her breath caught at the suddenly dark look in his eyes and the power he exuded, even in this casual embrace. Weren\u2019t vampires supposed to be cold? Come to think of it, Olivia had never seemed cold to the touch either. And Noah was never cold. Certainly, she\u2019d never noticed him doing something so odd as not breathing. His body against hers, he felt like a normal man. A normal, sexy, well built, Adonis of a man.</p> <p>His proximity rendered her slightly breathless, but his strong arms kept a small distance between them as they danced to the music. Somehow, the steps seemed easier to follow with him leading the way, even though for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t keep her focus on counting the steps in her head. The music thrummed through her, booming as if coming from her own heart, and she rocked to it. Her feet glided across the wood floor, and for a few moments she felt almost as graceful and sexy as the Latin music demanded.</p><p>Then she tripped, on absolutely nothing. Noah pulled her a little closer until she got her balance. Heat rushed to her face. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not the best dancer,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>God, he smelled good. Not like cologne, but of something spicy and exotic, with just a touch of sweat. She hadn\u2019t realized vampires sweated. But they did. He\u2019d sweated quite a bit playing volleyball. Olivia had never sweated. But then, Olivia was more of an indoor brainiac, and not much of an athlete.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine,\u201d Noah said, but he looked over her shoulder at the other couples, avoiding her gaze. She glanced back to see if something had caught his eye, but the wedding guests all danced obliviously, trying\u2014most of them in vain\u2014to find the beat.</p><p>They danced a little ways from the crowd, avoiding the occasional elbow to the side or stumbling of the couples around them, but the instructor\u2019s voice was still clear over the festive beat.</p><p>The instructor changed the music to a song that sounded almost exactly the same as the one that had played for most of the class, and Noah and Alice fell into silence, listening to the instructor\u2019s words and obeying, but avoiding looking at each other. Annoyance raged through her. He kept her at arm\u2019s length, as if holding her closer was distasteful. Anger replaced her embarrassment. She might not be the best dancer, but she certainly wasn\u2019t that bad.</p> <p>\u201cOkay change partners!\u201d the instructor called. He pointed at Noah and her, then at the closest couple to them.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019m cutting in,\u201d a smooth, familiar voice said. Dammit. She\u2019d almost forgotten Brent was even in the room dancing with Kristen. Everything around them had faded away with the exception of Noah. Kristen stood to Brent\u2019s side, shifting her weight from foot to foot, looking carefully at the floor.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Alice answered, and Noah narrowed his eyes at her. She gave Noah a meaningful look. A short dance wasn\u2019t worth starting a scene. Brent smiled widely, triumphant. And as Brent tugged her away from Noah, Kristen moved to take her place. Alice fought the flash of jealousy that ran through her at the sight of Kristen in Noah\u2019s arms. Noah was no Brent, and besides, she had no claim on Noah. Who was she to get jealous when other girls danced with Noah?</p><p>The music filled the room again, far too cheerful and sexy for her current mood and her current partner.</p><p>Brent danced like he did everything in life: with great precision and little passion. She danced just as mechanically, or as woodenly as she could with such a spirited type of dance. The smell of his cologne rolled over her, eliciting an odd swirl of emotions. The scent, familiar and almost comforting, also made her nauseous. Her body warred between taking more of it into her lungs and shoving him away so she never had to smell it again.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to apologize to you,\u201d he said as they went through the movements.</p><p>She looked up from his shoulder and met his gaze, startled. The number of times he\u2019d apologized and admitted wrongdoing the entire time they\u2019d been together could be counted on one hand.</p><p>\u201cI acted like an ass the first night on the boat. And I\u2019ve been a jerk ever since. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re apologizing?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but gape at him. Brent Strub had just apologized. Someone needed to take a damn picture. Catch it on film. Something.</p><p>He winced. \u201cI owe you a lot of apologies, Alice. I realize that. And I came to this wedding intent on doing just that. But when I saw you\u2014and then I saw him\u2014\u201d Brent shook his head. \u201cWell, that\u2019s neither here nor there, is it?\u201d His eyes met hers, and they carried the bit of fervor that had always made her feel like he really cared for her. It wasn\u2019t passion, exactly\u2014she could tell the difference now, after looking into Noah\u2019s stormy blue eyes before he\u2019d kissed her\u2014but it was powerful. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Alice.\u201d</p><p>The music stopped and so did they. She stared at him, her mind refusing to offer her any remotely suitable response. He stared back at her, his expression wistful, and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, a little sad.</p><p>A hard hand gripped her arm above the elbow, not quite painful, but firm. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking my dance partner back now,\u201d Noah said, sounding like he spoke through gritted teeth. He pulled her away before Brent could argue.</p><p>He swung her back into his arms and they resumed their dance, the music picking up with them. Her mind whirred at Brent\u2019s words. She\u2019d stopped listening to the instructor long ago, so she and Noah only danced the basic moves, while others in the class had gone on to learn fancier footwork.</p><p>Noah still held her at a distance, and something in her snapped. She\u2019d had just about enough of this night. Enough of Brent\u2019s weirdness. Enough of Noah\u2019s cool regard. If he didn\u2019t want to dance with her, why on Earth had he come back for more? Propriety? Ugh.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you could make it any more obvious you don\u2019t want to dance with me?\u201d she said, knowing her tone sounded bitchy, but not caring. \u201cI mean, maybe you could stick a chair or something between us so you don\u2019t accidentally touch my repulsive body.\u201d</p><p>His gaze met hers and desire, plain as day, flashed in his eyes. There was nothing cold nor distant in his expression. Her stomach flip-flopped and she momentarily stopped breathing. They both stopped dancing, and anger warred with passion to dominate his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t want to touch you?\u201d he whispered angrily.</p><p>She glanced around, but they\u2019d salsa-stepped a short distance from the other dancers, who huddled around the instructor so he could easily correct their motions. Brent\u2019s eyes still followed them, even as he swung Kristen around the dance floor, but he was too far away to hear their conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt sure doesn\u2019t seem like you do.\u201d She shouldn\u2019t challenge him, something instinctual in her gut told her that was a bad idea, but she couldn\u2019t seem to help herself. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Noah? Afraid you\u2019ll like it too much?\u201d</p><p>His lip rose in a snarl, but he yanked her roughly against his hard body, frightening her just a tiny bit. Nervously, she glanced away from him, briefly and accidentally catching Brent\u2019s watchful eye. As if nothing had happened, Noah started the dance again, but his body moved so closely against hers that she could feel him. So tempting. So powerful.</p><p>The air left the room, and it was as if they were alone with the thundering beat and Spanish words singing around them. There was nothing but him. His scent draped around her, filling her lungs with spice and a touch of sweat. He smelled like a man should smell. His hand slid down to caress the small of her back. His body directed her every movement.</p><p>Heat slid through her and settled at her core. God, she wanted him. Wanted him to slip off her dress, and slide those strong hands down her body. Touch her and make her call out his name. She could feel it. He\u2019d be as commanding in bed. Showing her what he wanted with his body. Reading hers just as easily.</p><p>Crap. The music had stopped. When had it stopped? Noah held her close, one hand still on the small of her back, while his other arm encircled her waist, wrapping her in his arms. His face was so close to hers, and he moved down to her neck, burying his face in her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips touched her neck, brushing her skin lightly. He tugged her closer, and she could feel his erection pressing against her stomach. His very large erection. Her own immediate reaction surprised her. Her pulse quickened and she could feel color beginning to bloom on her cheeks. She inhaled sharply.</p><p>The instructor cleared his throat, and Noah stilled against her. Slowly, his head rose from her neck, and his dark eyes met hers. Need so strong hit her that she didn\u2019t care they weren\u2019t alone, or what her family might think. The obvious desire in his eyes made her instantly wet.</p><p>And something was wrong with his mouth. The skin looked stretched around his teeth. Oh, God, his teeth. Were those his fangs? The thought of him sinking those sharp teeth into her skin suddenly didn\u2019t seem frightening at all, and her knees grew weak at the thought. She shuddered softly against him, knowing he could see it in her eyes, see how much she wanted him.</p> <p>The class seemed to be emptying around them. People were talking. Saying things. Asking her questions. She couldn\u2019t hear them.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Noah called over his shoulder, breaking their eye contact. Then they were moving. Walking\u2014somehow she was walking\u2014out of the room.</p><p>If there hadn\u2019t been a crowd of Alice\u2019s family members at the salsa dancing lesson, Noah wasn\u2019t entirely certain he could have kept himself from pushing her down onto the dance floor and taking her right there. Dancing had been bad enough, but when she\u2019d doubted him, anger had pulsed through him. Anger that quickly morphed into passion as soon as he\u2019d pulled her close.</p><p>Half-dragging her down the hallway, he was silent all the way to the room. To his surprise, so was she. And when the door clicked shut behind them, her wide eyes met his in a room lit only by the moonlight streaming in from their balcony.</p><p>He stopped and stared at her. She was so beautiful, even now, with an almost grim expression on her face. Slowly, she kicked off her dancing shoes, and her eyes didn\u2019t shy from his. He opened his mouth, not sure what to say, but somehow, he needed to break the silence surrounding them. She stopped him with a finger to his lips and a shake of her head.</p> <p>He wanted\u2014needed\u2014to touch her, but she stepped back again and pulled her blouse over her head. A thin bra covered her breasts, and he could see the outline of her beading nipples through the fabric. The swell of her breasts was pale in the moonlight. He hadn\u2019t thought his cock could get any harder, but it did at the sight of her. And he couldn\u2019t just stand and watch anymore.</p><p>He closed the distance between them, and then took her mouth ferociously. The taste of the red wine they\u2019d enjoyed with dinner filled her mouth. He wanted\u2014ached\u2014to sink his fangs into her skin. Vampire bites could give pleasure, and he needed so badly to give her every pleasure he could imagine.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t bite her. So he forced away the urge and kissed her, expertly avoiding revealing his fangs with his possession of her mouth.</p><p>He slid his hand down and palmed her soft breast. She moaned, his lips capturing the sound, and then he pulled away from the kiss.</p><p>She was just as he\u2019d imagined her to be\u2014far more times than he\u2019d like to admit. Her lips were swollen and her eyes heavily lidded with passion. He slid his thumb over her nipple and could feel it so tantalizingly close under the thin fabric.</p><p>A warning flickered in his mind. This wasn\u2019t the control he\u2019d promised himself. He wasn\u2019t supposed to make love to her. It wasn\u2019t the logical thing to do. Hell, he was pretty damn certain it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. But he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d never wanted anything so badly in his life.</p> <p>\u201cNoah,\u201d she said, voice weak.</p><p>He closed his mouth over her nipple, the material of her bra still between his lips and her sensitive skin. She gasped, her fingers tangled in his hair. With his tongue, he stroked her through the fabric and was rewarded with breathless words. He sucked and licked at both of her breasts and then stepped back to remove her bra. He needed to see her, all of her.</p><p>The bit of light in the room revealed her bra, now wet and translucent, with her dark nipples stark against her pale skin.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking sexy,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He met her eyes, and something behind the passion startled him enough to form real thoughts. Fear. Or uncertainty, at least.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to, I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and chuckled. \u201cOh, we\u2019re doing this. We are so doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just looked\u2014\u201d he started. She unclasped her bra and let it fall, and he lost his train of thought. While he gaped at her, she dropped her skirt as well.</p> <p>And there was not one bit of material beneath it.</p><p>Magnificent. That was the only word he could think of as he raked his gaze over her body. Perky breasts and smooth hips, she was the most perfect picture of a woman he could imagine. He met her gaze and quirked an eyebrow at her.</p><p>She shrugged, a hesitant grin on her face. \u201cDidn\u2019t want a panty line.\u201d When he couldn\u2019t seem to move, she closed the gap between them. Slipping her hands inside his shirt, she slid them up and over his chest, exploring his body as he ached to explore hers. She pulled his mouth down against hers and kissed him. Soft, testing.</p><p>Then, quite insistently, she tugged his shirt off. Her soft touches all over his skin were laced in fire. And when her lips nipped down his neck, it was all he could do not to toss her on the bed and take her like an animal.</p><p>\u201cMinx,\u201d he said, instead. He traced his way down her body, caressing her softly, exploring. As he slid his hand down her stomach and teasingly touched her thighs, she gasped.</p><p>And the second he touched her soft wetness, the urge to toss her down and have his way with her surged again. She was so ready. So hot and wet and perfect.</p><p>Shit. He had to move slowly. Had to make this as good for her as he knew it would be for him. He nudged her toward the bed and helped her lie down.</p><p>\u201cNot fair,\u201d she muttered, tugging at his pants.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair in war,\u201d he said, then his mouth found her breast again.</p><p>She chuckled, low and sexy. \u201cIs that what this is? War?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply with words. Instead, he kissed her, then slipped his hand down to touch her again. She bucked against him, but he touched her slowly, languidly. Exploring her. Learning how she needed to be touched.</p><p>When she moved against him, seeking her pleasure, he palmed her. Only when she relaxed did he continue his exploration.</p><p>She moaned and writhed beneath him. \u201cFuck, Noah. Please.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her neck, enjoying that he\u2019d pulled such a naughty word from the mostly proper Miss Shepard. She smelled so fucking sweet. The urge to bite her overwhelmed him. Her fruity shampoo, the wine on her tongue, the smell of her arousal. He pushed away from her and took a haggard breath. Air. He needed air. Air that didn\u2019t smell so fucking tempting.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he managed. His teeth ached for her. His dick ached for her. One need he had to ignore, but the other\u2014</p><p>He got up from the bed and yanked his pants off. Alice watched him silently from the bed, her expression hidden in the darkness. He reached into the side pocket of his bag. She didn\u2019t know he was a vampire. Didn\u2019t know he couldn\u2019t give her a disease or impregnate her. Thank God he had left that package of condoms in his bag after his last vacation.</p><p>She pulled him to her as soon as he leaned over her on the bed. Her tongue slid against his. Her hand found his cock, and the urge to bite receded, replaced by an urge just as great. She stroked him and kissed him, and all he could think of was burying himself in her heat.</p><p>The desire to thrust into her, take her with abandon, overwhelmed him. But he forced himself to slide in slowly, working to ease himself into her. Giving her body a chance to adjust. But she was so fucking warm and wet and\u2014he rocked forward, pushing most of his length into her.</p><p>Her body wrapped around him, and she thrust her hips forward, pulling even more of him into her body. She cried out his name, and her fingernails dug into his ass.</p><p>He pushed himself the rest of the way into her tightness, and then forced himself to stop moving. She writhed against him. He held her still with his weight. Her scent enveloped him, and the urge to bite her hit again.</p><p>He nuzzled her neck. So close. He sucked on her neck. His teeth slid against her skin.</p><p>No. He yanked his face away from her neck. No. He wasn\u2019t going to bite her. Her hips pushed against him and brought back the other hunger. Yes. That was a hunger he could sate.</p><p>He moved, thrusting in and out slowly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Noah,\u201d she said, voice barely above a whisper. She pulled his face back to hers, and she kissed him. Her body welcoming him. So tight, warm, and wet. He thrust harder. Her tongue slipped between his teeth, scraping against his extended canines.</p><p>Blood. The taste filled his mouth as he shoved himself into her harder. Had to be careful. Could hurt her. Why was there blood on his lips?</p><p>And then he couldn\u2019t think. He could only feel her. Smell her. Hear his name calling from her lips. Feel her moaning against his mouth.</p><p>He slipped a hand between them. He was so close. But couldn\u2019t go there. Not without her.</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d he said, voice harsh and low.</p><p>He touched her, stroked her. Pumped in and out of her. So fast. Had to slow down.</p><p>Then she yelled. Something. His name maybe. He couldn\u2019t hear because the blood rushed through his ears as her body contracted around him, shaking with her orgasm. She shuddered and cried out again. Her blood was on his tongue.</p><p>He thrust into her again. Then the world exploded.</p><p>Alice stared into the relative darkness of the room, so warm and comfortable, her back snuggled into Noah\u2019s arms. But she couldn\u2019t sleep. Despite the comfort. Despite the perfection of the moment. Despite the mind-blowing orgasm.</p><p>Her thoughts raced.</p><p>She\u2019d slept with Noah. And it had been terrifyingly wonderful. Despite every logical part of her brain insisting it had been a mistake, she couldn\u2019t regret it.</p><p>It had just been too darn good.</p><p>Not that she hadn\u2019t had good sex before. She had. She\u2019d thought she had. But sex had never been so...mind-blowing. She took a deep breath and Noah\u2019s arms tightened ever so slightly around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you were married before?\u201d she said, then immediately regretted the words. His body stiffened against hers as humiliation flooded her and she glanced away from him. Had she really brought up his marriage?</p><p>She\u2019d needed to say something. To make sure this wasn\u2019t all some sort of amazingly wonderful dream. And she wasn\u2019t ready to discuss what had just happened. Not yet. Not in the dark, where it was too easy to be far too honest.</p><p>\u201cI was. But not for long. And it was,\u201d he hesitated, \u201ca long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>She almost asked how long ago it could have been. Noah didn\u2019t look a day over thirty. But she stopped herself before the moronic question passed her lips, continuing this inappropriate conversation. He was a vampire. It could have been decades, if not centuries, before. Alice inhaled and parted her lips to speak. Now that she\u2019d already opened this door, she might as well see what was behind it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was she like?\u201d</p><p>Hesitation again, longer this time. \u201cI don\u2019t really think this is the best time\u2014I mean, it\u2019s kind of uncomfortable to talk about this right now.\u201d</p><p>God, he was right. Why was she even asking about his ex right now? Her timing sucked. But after being with him in such an amazing way, it was hard not to wonder about the kind of woman who was able to make Noah Thorpe fall in love.</p><p>Her chest tightened. She must have been amazing, whoever she was.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We can talk about it some other time maybe.\u201d He relaxed against her, but his tone left her little doubt of the chances of that happening. The ex was a sensitive subject. How could it not be? She hadn\u2019t even married Brent and she was touchy talking about him.</p><p>But the silence was deafening. She had to say something. \u201cI wish Andrew was here.\u201d</p><p>Again he tensed. \u201cAndrew?\u201d</p><p>She grinned in the darkness. \u201cMy brother. And not here, here. That would be the awkwardest thing ever. At the wedding, on the cruise ship, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, voice full of relief.</p> <p>She chuckled. \u201cWhat did you think I was talking about? Some dude I\u2019d wished I\u2019d called in for a threesome?\u201d</p><p>He shifted his weight, and she could feel his smile against her scalp. \u201cI never know what to expect from you. You\u2019re constantly surprising me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not used to people surprising you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. She pushed down the urge to ask if that\u2019s why he liked her, if that\u2019s why he was attracted to her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d He took a deep breath, face still buried in her hair. \u201cSo why isn\u2019t Andrew coming to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>The laughter died in her throat. She couldn\u2019t explain all of it, even if Noah had confided his vampire heritage in her. Olivia warned them it would be her head\u2014literally\u2014if anyone found out she\u2019d shared what she was with humans. \u201cHe was left at the altar.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her more tightly in his arms. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. How long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout six months. Not long enough for him to be ready to come to a wedding yet, I guess. She\u2014\u201d Edited version, Alice. Edited. \u201cI don\u2019t know all of the details. But I guess the gist of it is she decided her lifestyle wasn\u2019t something she wanted to drag him into. It hurt him. Badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d he said. Something in his voice made her want to ask about his ex again, but she suppressed the urge. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened to your brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she replied automatically. The mood was dimming, she could feel it slipping away, out of her grasp. This might be their only night together, and she\u2019d decided to mention her brother? And ask about his ex-wife? She was practically shooting herself in the foot here, but couldn\u2019t seem to help it. Talk about bringing the night to an abrupt end. Her throat was suddenly dry at the realization. She didn\u2019t want it to end yet. Not like this.</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re broaching awkward subjects tonight, Brent said something I\u2019ve been wondering about,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Great. Now they\u2019d added her ex to the conversation. But fair was fair, she supposed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to find it unlikely that you were moving into my house.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cWell, you know I\u2019m living in my grandma\u2019s old house, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe exchanged waves. But, I never spoke with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMister Sociable,\u201d she said, and he chuckled. \u201cWell, I wish you\u2019d had the chance to meet her. She was quite a lady.\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s warm smile and sturdy hugs flashed in her mind, and familiar sadness wormed its way into her heart. \u201cI spent a lot of time in that house when I was growing up. We had a bond, you know?\u201d She cleared her throat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, but his fingers slid along her arm, comforting her. \u201cAnyway, she left me the house when she passed away. And I swore I\u2019d never leave it after I moved in when I finished college. That was something Brent and I fought over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just didn\u2019t get a lot of time with her the last couple of years,\u201d she said. And that was the crux of it, her regret. She\u2019d been young, too obsessed with her own life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she knew how you felt.\u201d Noah hugged her more tightly against him.</p><p>Alice knew she had, but that didn\u2019t lessen her regret. And life was too short for regret.</p><p>She\u2019d taken the giant leap to sleep with Noah. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t last beyond the night. Their relationship certainly wouldn\u2019t last beyond the cruise. She wasn\u2019t ready to trust a man again for something long term, and Noah had shown every indication that he wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship.</p><p>So she would be damned if she didn\u2019t at least enjoy the night.</p><p>She squirmed around in his arms until they were face to face. The night, with the moonlight at his back, hid his expression. But she could feel his body react to her motion.</p><p>She kissed him and rubbed her body slowly against his. His erection pressed against her, fully interested. \u201cI\u2019m feeling grubby,\u201d she announced when she broke the kiss. \u201cAnd you\u2019re definitely dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d he asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cVery. And I\u2019m pretty sure that shower is big enough for two. In fact, I\u2019m certain it was designed for two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. It would be very rude of us to ignore the design of such a nice shower, wouldn\u2019t it? That would be an insult to whoever crafted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said as he kissed her. His tongue slipped between her lips, and she pulled her head back. \u201cCatch me if you can.\u201d The notion was silly, especially since she was still in his arms when she said it, but he allowed her to wriggle away and run for it.</p><p>He caught her as her hand touched the bathroom doorknob.</p><p>She squealed and he pulled her close for a kiss. They made their way into the bathroom, alternatively kissing and wrestling until they hit the shower. Then, under the water, steam swirling around them, she insisted on washing his back.</p><p>She ran her soap-slicked hands over his back. Muscles she\u2019d only seen hints of beneath his clothing tensed under her hands. She\u2019d known he was tall. The top of her head hit his shoulders when she wore low heels. But she hadn\u2019t felt it so much as she did now, reaching up to slide her hands across his smooth skin.</p><p>She shifted her hands down to his lower back. Several ragged scars, white with age, ran over his skin. One particularly long one marred his shoulder. \u201cWhere did you get these?\u201d she asked, then winced. Would he have to lie to her now? Every question that pertained to his past basically forced him to lie to her. But she couldn\u2019t help her curiosity.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I had a bad boy complex when I was young.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWhen you were young, huh?\u201d They looked like knife wounds. And nothing like a controlled surgery scar. Could he have brawled with knives? Heck, she had no idea how old he was, they could be from combat with swords for all she knew. The idea made her head hurt. She knew he was probably much older than he looked, but the actual idea of him living so long ago was hard for her to wrap her mind around.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d his voice rumbled from low in his chest. He turned and captured her gaze with those stormy eyes. Her breath caught in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m an upstanding citizen these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d She couldn\u2019t look away from his eyes. God, they were beautiful. Swirling with emotion and strength. She could live and die in those eyes.</p><p>He took the soap from her hands and then tugged her into his spot under the pouring water. Hot and soothing, it rushed over the skin on her back. She didn\u2019t want to look away from him, but had to when he made a spinning motion with his finger.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, almost shivering in anticipation, despite the warmth of the water. His hands slid against her back. Slow and sultry, and with far too much soap. Then they moved over her shoulders, his slightly rough hands slid around her breasts, making her gasp. Then he glided them down to her stomach. Why were his hands rough?</p><p>\u201cYour hands are rougher than I\u2019d expect for someone in your line of work,\u201d she murmured. His hands stilled. \u201cIt feels nice,\u201d she added in a whisper.</p><p>He continued his half wash, half massage of her stomach and hips. \u201cI do some woodworking in my garage. It\u2019s cathartic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sun sculpture in your backyard?\u201d God that was a beautiful woodcarving. She\u2019d asked about it when she\u2019d gone there to ask him on the cruise, and she\u2019d wanted to know more. But he hadn\u2019t exactly been thrilled to see her that day, so she hadn\u2019t wanted to hang around and give him a chance to change his mind. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI carved it.\u201d He sounded pleased.</p><p>He explored her hips, and her breath caught in her throat. How could she be this turned on so soon after they\u2019d just had sex? Her breasts suddenly ached to be touched, teased by the water spraying against them. And her sex pulsed as his hands grew closer, caressing her thighs before moving back up to her bottom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d he asked, mouth very close to her ear. His hand paused over a small scar on her hip.</p><p>\u201cMy first and only attempt at skateboarding.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against her ear as his fingers caressed the scar. How could such a simple thing, a massage of an old wound, be so erotic?</p> <p>His soapy hands moved back up her body and she almost cried out in protest. But when he squeezed and caressed her breasts, she moaned.</p><p>One in each hand, he massaged her, then slid his thumbs over her nipples. Like a shock, the sensation shot from her breasts to her sex, and her stomach clenched in response.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you, Alice.\u201d His chest rumbled against her back as he spoke, and his hand slid down to her core. She almost jumped when he touched her. He stroked her confidently, and every thought she might have had flew away as a rush of sensation overwhelmed her. The hot water streaming over her while he touched her so possessively made her ache so badly for him that she writhed against his hand.</p><p>Before she even realized she was moving, she stood on the other side of the shower. Noah lifted her leg and set it on a large ledge, near her soaps and shampoos. His shampoo bottle was under the sink, full of blood. The thought almost startled some sense in her, but then he knelt between her legs and she couldn\u2019t think anymore.</p> <p>His tongue touched her, the gentlest of touches. And she suddenly felt very exposed\u2014spread out in front of him, under the too bright lights of the bathroom. Painful shyness hit her. \u201cNoah, I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh...\u201d His hand held her hip firmly, and his eyes raged like a storm when they met hers. So intense, she couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful, do you know that? Do you even realize\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t. But you will.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand the words. He\u2019d called her beautiful, and the emotion in his voice was so strong she couldn\u2019t even summon an argument. Or a polite platitude. Or even a thank you.</p><p>He lowered his head, and his mouth touched her again. He held her hips firmly. To keep her upright, she was sure. His tongue stroked her. So intimately. The explosion of sensation as he explored her pushed any shyness out of her head. She sucked in a lungful of steam, listening to hypnotic sound of the shower water hitting the tile.</p><p>\u201cGod, you taste so good. So sweet. I knew you would.\u201d He stroked her softly, then harder. Licking, sucking, and nibbling. God, his fangs. They didn\u2019t touch her, but were so close. The idea of it should have horrified her, she knew that. But instead, it pushed her even further, closer to bliss.</p><p>She used one hand to balance herself on the wall and gripped his hair with the other. She didn\u2019t mean to pull it, but when he growled against her, she realized how hard she clutched him. But she couldn\u2019t stop. If she relaxed, she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever come down from it.</p> <p>One of his hands moved from her hip, and then she felt him push into her. One finger, stroking her inside as his mouth sucked on the center of her desire. Then two. Pushing in and out. His mouth, no longer gentle. His other hand, digging into her hips.</p><p>The orgasm hit her like nothing she\u2019d ever felt before. Her body convulsed, and then she was standing only because he held her. His mouth stayed on her, coaxing aftershock after aftershock from her. And when her body finally stilled, he was there. His mouth on hers, the taste of her still on his tongue.</p><p>He drove his cock into her without warning. And the sensation of being so suddenly full rocked another orgasm from her. Mercilessly, he drove into her, holding her leg up to his hip. He pushed her closer and closer to the brink again. The thought that she shouldn\u2019t be able to come again so soon hit her a split second before the orgasm did. She tensed in his arms, her body rocking. Her name fell from his lips, low and guttural, almost unrecognizable. And she felt him shudder against her, his face buried against her neck as he found his own release.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Sunlight streaming through the balcony door woke him. They\u2019d forgotten to shut the curtains. The light didn\u2019t touch his skin, but it pained his eyes to look at it. Alice snuggled into the crook of his arm, asleep and wearing one of his T-shirts. He pressed a kiss onto her forehead, smelling her hair as he did. Fruity shampoo. He was starting to really love the smell of shampoo.</p><p>His cock stirred, but he ignored it. After last night, she needed her rest. They both did. How long had they slept? He glanced at the clock. They\u2019d definitely missed brunch. Maybe they\u2019d be able to catch the family for a late lunch. He didn\u2019t want to keep Alice from seeing her family at this joyful time.</p><p>He slipped out of the bed and she made a small noise of protest. But by the time he got across the room to close the drapes, she was sleeping again. A small snore escaped her and he stifled a laugh. The ocean slid by them, bright and beautiful. Too bright for a vampire. He slid the drapes closed.</p><p>He locked the bathroom door behind him and turned on the water in the sink. A long drink of blood from the shampoo bottle perked him up. Treated blood\u2014originating from the blood bank with added chemicals to keep it from going bad outside of refrigeration\u2014wasn\u2019t anywhere near as good as the real thing, especially straight from the vein.</p> <p>But that form of feeding brought its own headaches. For one, you had to mess with the memory of your victim in most cases, and that felt far too close to immoral for him to indulge in it except when absolutely necessary. Not that he hadn\u2019t lived differently before. But those were different times, and he was a different man. And there were rules about it. The Council had rules for everything these days. Modern technology demanded it. It was too easy to be videotaped on a cell phone camera and end up on YouTube. Careful rules kept them all safe.</p><p>Feeling the weight of the bottle, he frowned and shook it. Empty. He must have drunk a bit more than he\u2019d thought the day before. But it was okay. He still had a bottle of blood disguised as conditioner and a small emergency supply in what looked like a cologne bottle.</p><p>He brushed his teeth and his mind wandered to the night before. What a night. Had he ever felt such fire with a woman? No. Not even when he was still human. Not even with his wife\u2014as brief as their marriage had been. He\u2019d known her an even shorter amount of time than he\u2019d known Alice.</p><p>His wife had been a woman of a different time. More reserved. Lovely and kind and giving. But she simply couldn\u2019t deal with what he was. What she needed to become to be with him. But she hadn\u2019t had Alice\u2019s resilient character.</p><p>Alice was as passionate as he knew she\u2019d be. Perfect in how she fit him, in how they both seemed to have an innate understanding of how the other liked to be touched. And her blood...a sharp stab of guilt hit him as he remembered the teasing taste of her blood on his tongue.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t nicked her on purpose, but he certainly hadn\u2019t pulled away when the sweet taste hit him. If anything, he\u2019d milked her mouth for more. And despite the guilt, he hardened at the memory, and his fangs lengthened, pressing against his bottom lip.</p><p>Blood and sex weren\u2019t always intertwined, but when they were, it was like nothing else in the world. He couldn\u2019t help his desire for both, but he could control his actions.</p><p>With water from the sink, he wet his hair and smoothed it. She\u2019d fulfilled his every need, except for his desire to plunge his fangs into her neck while he took her. He\u2019d been able to stop himself. But never had he been so tempted. Sharing blood wasn\u2019t something he could take lightly. There were laws that had to be upheld. Drinking blood from a living human was only permitted if the donor\u2019s memory was fogged after. Sharing of blood was also allowed between vampires.</p><p>And of course, allowances were made for human mates\u2014people who were transitioning into vampires.</p><p>He leaned against the counter, weight on his hands, and shook his head. No. He wasn\u2019t going to bite her. No matter how much he ached to. Sex would have to be enough. And sex with Alice was better than blood and sex with anyone else, so he wasn\u2019t exactly suffering.</p><p>Not that he had any intention of going back to their formerly platonic relationship. They couldn\u2019t just be friends, not after last night. If that had ever been a real possibility. He hadn\u2019t intended to sleep with her, and was more than a little irritated with his lack of control. But it had happened.</p><p>And maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014it didn\u2019t have to end with the cruise.</p><p>He flashed his teeth in the mirror, and with a slight push in his mind, his fangs grew. No, he couldn\u2019t tell her about himself, not right away. And he certainly couldn\u2019t tell her about his impending nuptials. Trust wasn\u2019t something that came easily to her, not after Brent. His hands fisted at the thought of her ex. She might take the whole \u201csupposed to marry another person\u201d thing the wrong way. If the vampire part didn\u2019t send her screaming out the door first.</p><p>And it would. His wife\u2019s face had faded from his memory. Odd, the things you forgot when enough time passed. He could still picture her, but her features had fuzzied. The exact shade of her eyes escaped him, and the line of her jaw.</p><p>But the horror in her expression after he explained what he was\u2014after he\u2019d proven to her he was a vampire\u2014stayed with him. He couldn\u2019t deal with that from Alice. He\u2019d have to be sure of her first. Certain she\u2019d at least give him a chance.</p><p>He could spend the rest of the cruise convincing her to trust him.</p><p>They needed to talk, at least. He had to make sure she knew he took this\u2014and her\u2014seriously. He\u2019d meant what he said to Charles. Alice was not someone he\u2019d just play around with. A lifetime commitment wasn\u2019t something he could promise. She\u2019d run for the hills when she found out what he was, and he couldn\u2019t hide that from her for long if they spent enough time together. Even if he were very careful, it would only be a scant number of years before she would notice he never aged. But he couldn\u2019t see not being with her\u2014not being able to hold her, kiss her, touch her\u2014anytime soon.</p><p>He slipped back under the covers, this time on the side she faced, and woke her with a quick peck on her nose. Her eyes opened slowly, fluttering before a slow, satisfied smile enveloped her face. The room warmed with that smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he said, then kissed her mouth softly.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she replied, face flushed.

And Edna, he suspected, was paying attention and certainly anything but an idiot. A keen mind hid behind her joking attitude, and she seemed to see far more than she let on. Not a quality he normally found appealing in a human, but Edna was an exception to the rule. She was the mother he\u2014everyone\u2014wished they\u2019d been blessed with.</p><p>The small flush on Alice\u2019s face grew exponentially and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh God, they\u2019re going to all be staring at us this morning. Cindy isn\u2019t so bad, but Mom will\u2014well, prepare yourself for some really awkward commentary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can handle it if you can.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cWe should probably get going soon then, before she comes to check on us to amuse herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should talk first,\u201d he said, and her grin faltered.</p><p>\u201cDo we really need to talk?\u201d She looked at her hand on the comforter, as if her fingernails were suddenly doing interesting things.</p><p>They had to talk. He had to tell her how he felt. Or at least, tell her that he cared for her, since he wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to identify the emotions swirling through him. It was better to get things out in the open. \u201cI think we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, let\u2019s make a deal. No talking about...anything. Not until we get back to California. Let\u2019s call this a serious talk-free boat.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t look at him as she spoke, and there was a tremor in her voice that he didn\u2019t care for. \u201cCan\u2019t we enjoy ourselves without\u2014\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWithout talking about the future until we get back to port?\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. Something worried her\u2014and he would swear that fear caused the quiver in her voice. But was she afraid he wanted something past this cruise, or that he didn\u2019t? It hadn\u2019t been long since her last\u2014and he suspected only\u2014serious relationship ended badly. Maybe she wasn\u2019t ready to commit to something serious yet. Or even talk about the possibility.</p><p>His stomach rolled at the thought and words to convince her were on the edge of his tongue. But that wouldn\u2019t be fair to her. If she wasn\u2019t ready yet, he\u2019d have to spend the rest of the cruise convincing her he was trustworthy, that he wasn\u2019t going to use her like Brent had. For now, he had to respect her wishes.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he replied, and to his relief his voice came out strong. Confident. Not at all worried.</p><p>Tension visibly drained from her shoulders and something fisted over his heart, squeezing it. Was she that worried he\u2019d press her for something serious? Did she find the idea of a serious relationship that repulsive? That frightening?</p><p>He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, wishing he could take his feelings out on someone deserving. Namely Brent. But this was good. He could deal with it. It wasn\u2019t like he was in love. If he couldn\u2019t convince her to be with him seriously by the end of the cruise, he\u2019d survive.</p><p>After all, he\u2019d lived for decades without anyone in his life other than Charles and Alex. He could do it again. A sudden pang of loneliness twisted in his gut, and despite what he told himself, he felt unsure. He rolled over and pushed up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cBetter get ready before they send in the search team,\u201d he said, forcing a smile to his face.</p><p>Alice had prepared herself for the knowing looks. But the occasional grins from her mother and sister when they reached the deck for lunch still brought heat to her cheeks no matter how cool she tried to play it. They made her want to run back to her room and hide for the rest of the trip\u2014preferably with Noah in tow\u2014her family\u2019s speculation be damned.</p> <p>There were so many things they could do alone for the next couple of days. Sexy things. In the shower and the bed. The couch and the floor. The cabin could really use some more rooms. But heck, what they lacked in space they could make up for in other creative ways. A knowing look from her mother brought her out of her speculation, and she kept her gaze from meeting anyone else\u2019s at the table after that.</p><p>But Noah handled the knowing looks and suspiciously innocent questions with ease. She watched him from under her eyelashes, and warmth filled her chest.</p><p>He was so good with her family. He seemed comfortable with them, even more so than he\u2019d been around her until this trip. And if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, her family was quite taken with her reserved neighbor as well. Why wouldn\u2019t they be? He was genuinely kind. Funny. Strong.</p><p>She liked him for all the same reasons her family did. And she liked him for her own reasons, too. The desire in his eyes when he looked at her. The way he held her and guided her across the dance floor. Not to mention the sex. And it was worth mentioning. Last night had been an experience she would never forget.</p><p>And that was the problem.</p><p>She\u2019d known exactly what he was going to say when that serious expression came over his face after he\u2019d woken her up. The words\u2014even unspoken\u2014reverberated through her mind. First, he\u2019d tell her what a nice time he\u2019d had. Reassure her she was a wonderful girl and that he\u2019d enjoyed their time together. Then his smile would turn grim, and he would bring far too much reality into the conversation.</p><p>He\u2019d tell her he wasn\u2019t in a position to make a commitment. His job, his family, his whatever, wouldn\u2019t allow it. And maybe it would be true, if not exactly for the reason he\u2019d specify. He wasn\u2019t a normal man; he was a vampire.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to hear it.</p><p>In her heart, she knew this wouldn\u2019t be lasting. It felt too perfect. And they were too different. But she wanted\u2014needed\u2014to tell herself they might have a future. Even if it was a fantasy. Just for a little while. A few days.</p><p>She deserved that, didn\u2019t she? After Brent, she deserved to at least pretend. And Noah was trustworthy. She felt that down to her bones. He wouldn\u2019t use her like Brent had tried to. Nor would he treat her badly or make her feel like shit.</p><p>He just wouldn\u2019t stay.</p><p>And she was okay with that. She was. She had to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d she asked her sister as her name being called finally penetrated her brain.</p><p>Her face bright with the sunshine streaming in from the window beside her, Cindy smirked at her. \u201cI said, are you still going onshore early so you can cook dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Noah squeezed her knee, a show of support, and she gave him a small smile.</p><p>His plate filled with eggs and sausage from the breakfast buffet, Robert pulled out one of the white chairs and sat next to Cindy.</p><p>Her sister clapped, a big smile on her face. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so excited. You may not know this about my sister, Noah, but she makes the absolute best lasagna. It\u2019s just...\u201d Cindy\u2019s eyes glazed over. \u201cSo. Good.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed at Cindy\u2019s expression. \u201cThat good, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Cindy assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s a family recipe. One our aunt only shared with Alice. She\u2019s got the gift, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your aunt make it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s retired from making lasagna. Or so she says.\u201d Cindy shook her head regretfully. \u201cBut Alice does the lasagna justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only gotten to try it once, at Edna\u2019s birthday party a couple of years ago. But Cindy isn\u2019t exaggerating,\u201d Robert offered. He took a bite of sausage, then around the food mumbled, \u201cBest. Lasagna. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it is pretty darn awesome,\u201d Alice said. Her sister and mother laughed and then went on to discuss the new house Cindy and Robert were considering purchasing. Thankful that the attention had moved away from them, she put her hand over Noah\u2019s, which still rested on her knee. \u201cNot to mention that you were able to rent Mom and Dad\u2019s bungalow for us to share this meal in. That\u2019s...\u201d she swallowed down the sudden lump in her throat, \u201creally special.\u201d</p><p>Cindy\u2019s eyes were bright, too, and she nodded vigorously without speaking.</p><p>It was oddly comfortable, sitting there chatting with her family, with Noah at her side, touching her. But at the same time, she was almost painfully aware of him. Of his every movement and expression.</p><p>\u201cSo Noah, tell us about your family,\u201d her mom said, cutting into Alice\u2019s reverie.</p><p>Alice glanced at Noah and frowned. His smile had disappeared and he shifted his weight and pulled his hand back from her. \u201cMy family is a little difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. Are your parents still with you?\u201d Her mom asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cMy father is still with me, but we don\u2019t talk much,\u201d he said. \u201cI have two brothers. Alice met one of them the other day.\u201d</p><p>She had? Oh, of course. \u201cCharles?\u201d The other man\u2019s dark blond hair, easy smile, and light green eyes flashed through her mind. \u201cBut you look nothing alike,\u201d she said without thinking.</p><p>Noah grimaced and she was flooded with guilt. Of course they looked nothing alike. Noah probably didn\u2019t have any blood relatives still alive, unless they were vampires like him. Was his father really his father, or was that some sort of vampire term? Her brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e hadn\u2019t delved into the specifics of vampire society with her and Cindy.</p><p>The silence went on for too long, stifled only by the constant murmur of voices coming from the other passengers around them, and the table stilled as discomfort settled over everyone. \u201cWe\u2019re all adopted,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cBut Charles, Alex, and me...we\u2019re very close.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s wonderful, dear,\u201d her mother said. \u201cAre they tall and handsome like you?\u201d</p><p>Alice shot her mother a glare, one which the elder woman pointedly ignored. Her mother was worse than she was when it came to not being able to edit what she said. Couldn\u2019t she see Noah was uncomfortable talking about his family?</p><p>But Noah actually smiled at that question, an arrogant grin that made her want to kiss him. Drag him back to the room. Do unspeakable things to him. \u201cWell, I like to think I\u2019m the best looking of the bunch.\u201d</p> <p>Alice couldn\u2019t skip the opportunity to tease him. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. That Charles was quite the handsome devil.\u201d And he was, but he didn\u2019t hold a candle to Noah in her eyes.</p><p>He turned to face her, and while amusement laced his expression, there was something else in his eyes. Intensity. Fire. But not anger. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm...\u201d She took a sip of her iced tea. \u201cPretty green eyes.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow and suddenly she felt like a green-eyed monster was looking at her. Mouth suddenly dry, despite the tea, she licked her lips. His eyes followed the motion before meeting her gaze again, and she suddenly wished very much that they were alone.</p><p>He picked up his own glass to block his mouth from her family, and mouthed, \u201cLater,\u201d at her. She shivered.</p> <p>\u201cWell it\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t have a pretty sister,\u201d her mom said.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Noah asked, and his expression schooled into to something far more PG-13 when he turned to face her mother.</p><p>\u201cFor Andrew, of course,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>Alice choked on her tea. If only her mother knew how close Andrew\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e had been to being a sister of Noah\u2019s.</p><p>Noah stiffened, and for half a second Alice thought he might know about Olivia, as improbable as that seemed. But he didn\u2019t seem to be paying attention to the conversation anymore. Instead, he glanced down at his breakfast.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, friends. Or, I guess good afternoon is more in order,\u201d Brent said, strolling up to the table with Kristen following a couple of steps behind. She looked upset, and Alice was struck by the sudden and surprising urge to take her old friend aside and make sure she was okay. She shoved down the desire. Kristen was no longer her friend, by her own choice. And while Alice still wasn\u2019t entirely happy to see her saddled with Brent, she wasn\u2019t about to let Kristen back into her life again, into her heart.</p> <p>But being polite wouldn\u2019t kill her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Alice replied, as the rest of the table murmured their hellos. Noah gave her a sharp glance, but she ignored it. She hadn\u2019t told him about Brent\u2019s apology, and with Kristen talking his ear off while they danced, not to mention the loud salsa music, he probably hadn\u2019t overheard.</p><p>Should she tell him? Maybe. But the fact that she felt like she should made her question it. They weren\u2019t in a relationship, not really. Spilling more intimate things to Noah felt like giving more of herself to him. And she was already so enamored, getting even closer felt...dangerous.</p><p>Besides, he\u2019d confided so little in her, things already felt a bit unbalanced between them. Even though she knew the necessity of it\u2014a man didn\u2019t go off and tell everyone he was a vampire, after all\u2014she wasn\u2019t exactly sure she was comfortable with it.</p><p>To her relief, Brent and Kristen took seats at the far end of the table from them, and didn\u2019t seem to pay her or Noah any mind, save for the occasional glance Brent sent in her direction.</p><p>\u201cDo you guys want to come with us into Cabo for the day?\u201d Cindy asked. \u201cOtherwise, I think Brent and Jake are putting together some kind of casino run.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Noah. Taking him outside in the sun sounded like a bad plan, although he\u2019d seemed to take the volleyball in stride. But hanging out with Brent sounded even worse. Maybe they could lock themselves in their room for the rest of the day? That sounded like the best plan ever.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes met hers and the slight grin and raised eyebrow made her think that he was considering the same thing. She bit her lower lip.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be fun, I mean, if you\u2019re okay with the sun, Noah. If not, we understand,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze flicked back to her sister. \u201cThe sun won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d he replied, voice a little cooler than normal. \u201cSounds fun.\u201d</p><p>Alice suppressed a heavy sigh. A trip into town with her sister sounded far less fun now that she\u2019d already mentally compared it to a day in bed with Noah. But at least they\u2019d still be together.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, finally, but her eyes lingered on Noah.</p><p>He led the way back to their room after Cindy told them they needed to wear jeans for the day trip, while remaining secretive as to why. It was stupid, really. Agreeing to go to town, during the day. But he hadn\u2019t been able to refuse. Cindy wasn\u2019t trying to challenge him, or questioning how good his control was. Hell, she didn\u2019t even know he was a vampire.</p><p>But when he\u2019d heard the question, her uncertainty about whether or not he could handle a day in the sun, he couldn\u2019t help but agree to go. If only to prove to himself that his control held strong.</p><p>No matter how much sunshine, it would be more bearable than spending a day in Brent\u2019s company, anyway.</p><p>He glanced at Alice after she emerged from the bathroom. She\u2019d pulled her hair back and put on jeans that hugged her curves in a most distracting way. He almost asked her about Brent, but decided against it. What would he say? Why weren\u2019t you angrier when you saw your ex? Why didn\u2019t the very sight of him piss you off like it did me? What the hell did he say to you on that dance floor?</p><p>Doubt curdled in his stomach. Stupid and pointless. But it was there.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he said, then followed her out of the room.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to listen in when Brent took her from his arms during the salsa dancing lessons, but Kristen had been talking to him, asking him questions. And he\u2019d felt guilty. Like some jealous boyfriend. It made him feel small. So he\u2019d concentrated on Kristen, and trusted that Alice could handle Brent on her own. It had been the right decision. But he couldn\u2019t help the small bit of insecurity. Especially after she\u2019d so blatantly refused to discuss their future.</p><p>They walked down the stairs and neared the exit before it hit him. He should have drunk blood before they left. Shit. He\u2019d been too distracted thinking about Brent and Alice to remember.</p><p>\u201cI need to go back to the room for a minute.\u201d He searched his mind for an excuse. \u201cNeed to use the restroom.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t you use the one on this floor? We\u2019re already late.\u201d</p><p>He suppressed a grimace. No, he couldn\u2019t use the bathroom down here. But he didn\u2019t say that. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And he would be. He\u2019d drunk his normal ration for the day. A bit extra would have been nice since they were likely to have some exposure to the sun, but it wasn\u2019t necessary. His control was good. He\u2019d just stay out of the sun as much as possible and drink an extra mouthful or two when they got back.</p><p>They emerged from the ship out onto the sandy ground of Cabo San Lucas. The sun was bright and intense, beating down on him.</p><p>Cindy and Robert waited for them not far from where they exited the port. They also wore casual jeans and T-shirts.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we off to?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst, to the glass blowing factory. Then, horseback riding,\u201d Cindy announced proudly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to ride?\u201d Robert asked him.</p><p>Noah smiled. It had been a very long time since he\u2019d been on horseback, but his body would never forget the mode of transport he\u2019d used for decades. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>The glass blowing factory was stunning. Decorative glass filled the windows of the brick building that housed the gift store. And the process itself fascinated Alice. He watched the surprise and delight cross her features while she stared at the men forming works of art from molten glass and blowpipes.</p><p>Studying Alice enthralled him far more than watching the artists. And even with the relatively high temperatures, he appreciated being out of the sunlight. The artists worked while a tour guide talked them through the process.</p><p>\u201cGlass blowing started centuries ago, and not much has changed...\u201d The tour guide gestured toward the artists.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Robert said quietly to their little group, his eyes wide as he watched the artists roll the molten glass on what looked like a thick stack of wet newspaper.</p><p>\u201cPretty incredible,\u201d Cindy agreed, but she watched her husband, a tender expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cLooks scary to me,\u201d Alice said, then slapped her hand over her mouth when the couple in front of them glanced back at her. Voice lower, she added, \u201cI mean, they\u2019re using newspaper to shape it. Newspaper. I\u2019d stick with those huge oven mitts if it were me.\u201d</p><p>One of the men knelt down and began blowing into a curved tube to make an impression on one of the ends of what looked like a soon-to-be vase.</p><p>\u201cBut maybe that\u2019s part of the attraction of the art,\u201d Alice mused. Her gaze flashed to Noah, then back to the men working on the glass. \u201cThe danger.\u201d</p><p>But their time at the glass blowing company went quickly, and they ended up in the gift shop connected to it. He wandered down the aisles, fully aware of where Alice stood, even though they made their own ways through the shop. He selected a set of beer mugs he knew Charles and Alex would like, and then a small piece that caught his eye for Alice. The pieces were wrapped and set for delivery to their cabin by the time Alice caught up with him at the counter.</p><p>\u201cA dolphin?\u201d he asked, as she approached.</p><p>She smiled at the delicate glass-blown dolphin in her hand. \u201cMy mom loves dolphins.\u201d</p><p>Of course she did. The happy, smart creatures were just up Edna\u2019s alley. He couldn\u2019t help but return her smile, and a few minutes later, they walked out of the building.</p><p>The sun beat down intensely, shining off the ground and the buildings around them. He pressed his sunglasses closer to his eyes, knowing that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. The sun exposure on his skin was the problem, even though the pain started as a slight headache around his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sharp hunger twisted his stomach, but Noah ignored the need. Alice looked even more beautiful in the sunlight, which reflected off her golden hair, making it glow. And today, she shone even more brightly than normal, with a big smile on her face, a laugh on her lips, and a bounce in her step. Some of that, he dared hope, was because of him.</p><p>She was born to walk in the sunshine.</p><p>The thought stilled him, and Alice shot him an inquiring glance. He shook his head.</p> <p>The horseback riding facility was a short walk away. They stopped at a food stand along the way and ate easy-to-carry snack food as they walked. Before they got out of the shopping area, Noah spotted a hat shop and stopped. Robert followed him.</p><p>\u201cCindy is going to love this,\u201d Robert said, smiling as they made their purchases. Noah couldn\u2019t help but smile back. The man glowed when he spoke of his soon-to-be bride.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Cindy asked when they got back.</p><p>Noah plopped a western-style straw hat on Alice\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYour protection from the sun,\u201d Robert said. He placed Cindy\u2019s hat on her head like Noah had done, too, but pushed it down over Cindy\u2019s eyes. She shrieked and smacked him, before they both dissolved into a laughter-filled mini-wrestling match.</p> <p>Noah\u2019s gaze met Alice\u2019s, and he kissed her softly while Cindy and Robert composed themselves.</p><p>\u201cAww, you guys are so sweet. And look, Alice, yours even has a little feather,\u201d Cindy replied.</p><p>Alice grinned and felt along the hat until her fingers hit the feather. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her eyes curiously fixed on him.</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want you to get burned.\u201d</p><p>Cindy had arranged a private horseback riding outing for their foursome. It was obvious Alice and Cindy had ridden before, although Noah would be willing to bet that they\u2019d never been regular riders. And just as apparent was Robert\u2019s complete and utter lack of experience.</p><p>Blinding, the beach glittered in the sunlight. Noah pushed his sunglasses up on his nose and watched the water hit the sand, the salty smell of the ocean in his lungs. This area of the beach was private, and very few people were around. It was quiet, save the crash of the waves and the chatter of Alice and her sister. The openness felt amazing after being on the cruise ship for so many days, even with the rocky hills lining the beach. The rocks seemed to reach for the ocean, and made the beach feel almost private. He couldn\u2019t remember a time when he\u2019d felt so happy, and simultaneously so unsettled.</p> <p>Noah suppressed a laugh as Cindy tried to coax Robert into a gait slightly faster than plodding, and Robert gripped the pommel on his saddle until his knuckles turned white. She alternatively cooed at him and made fun of him. And Robert, kind man that he was, didn\u2019t even glare at her. What a man wouldn\u2019t do for his bride. Finally, after nearly an hour and a half, he started to loosen up.</p><p>Noah and Alice chatted as they rode, before falling into a comfortable silence. A wave crashed through some of the rock pillars that reached out into the ocean, cascading down like a water fall. Alice screamed and pointed. As they followed their guide, nearly back at the stables, Alice rode ahead.</p><p>Beautiful Alice. With a quick flick of her wrist, she released her hair from its clip and let it run down her back as she rode a little ahead of Noah, leaving only the hat to confine her golden locks. Her sun-kissed skin and musical laugh filled his senses.</p><p>His chest constricted. She belonged here. In the sunshine. Everything about her was light and bright and free. If anything happened between them long-term, she\u2019d have to give up the sun.</p><p>Could he ask that of her?</p><p>A wave of dizziness hit him, and he took a haggard breath. Sweat dripped down his skin and hit the saddle. He touched his forehead with his fingertips. Too much sweat.</p><p>The landscape rolled around him, moving unnaturally, as if he could actually see the heat like an ocean wave. Shit. Sun poisoning.</p><p>He should have drunk more blood before they left the ship. Should have made an excuse. Should have done what he needed to in order to make sure he was safe to be around. But it was so hard to concentrate on his vampire needs around her; she overran his thoughts.</p> <p>Alice pulled her horse alongside his, and he looked up to see her brows drawn with worry, and a frown on her face. The expression was almost unnatural on her.</p><p>\u201cYou should be smiling,\u201d he murmured. God, it was hot. But soon\u2014too soon\u2014it would be cold.</p><p>\u201cNoah? Are you okay?\u201d she reached out and touched his forehead, then yanked her hand back like he\u2019d burned her. Hell, with sun poisoning setting in, he probably felt like he had a fever to challenge the glowing sand around them.</p><p>He swayed a bit in his saddle, and the sand rolled like the waves.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s the sun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould probably get back to the ship soon,\u201d he said, and the words made the slight pounding in his head grow exponentially. Thudding like a jackhammer, it made his stomach churn.</p><p>She reached into a bag attached to her saddle and pulled out a half-empty bottle of water. \u201cWater?\u201d</p><p>His stomach surged anew at the thought and he shook his head, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back to the ship,\u201d Alice called to her sister, and he winced at her volume.</p><p>Cindy waved. She and Robert had managed to get a good distance away. He hoped they thought he and Alice were going back for lustful reasons. If they thought it was his weakness to the sun...he hated to look weak.</p><p>Wordlessly, Alice led their horses back to the stable and dropped them with a groomsman. Noah dismounted, feeling sick, but not yet too dizzy to stand on his own. He shivered as the ground beneath his feet shifted. The horse stared at him, eyes wide. Did it sense a predator? Could it see him?</p><p>Alice touched his shoulder and he started, then glanced at the horse. It calmly ate a bit of grass off the ground, waiting to be unsaddled and fed.</p><p>He could make it. There was no other option. Instead of heading for the road to walk, Alice asked one of the workers to call them a taxi. Then she sat him on a bench facing the road. It was out of direct sunlight, better but still straining. She sat next to him, and her scent filled his lungs. She smelled so damn good. Did she know how she smelled?</p><p>He leaned over and nuzzled her hair. The throbbing of her pulse, just under her skin, rang in his ears. He took a deep breath, his mouth hovering a hairsbreadth from her skin. And his fangs lengthened in his mouth.</p><p>Just a taste. One little taste of her. To see if the sweetness he\u2019d accidentally tasted the night before was real.</p><p>Alice stilled, her body suddenly stiff. \u201cNoah?\u201d</p><p>So good. Like apples. She would taste like apples.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d she said, voice stronger than before. Almost commanding. He growled. No one could keep him from his prey. No one denied him. No one commanded him. Least of all a tiny human like Alice.</p><p>Alice.</p><p>Noah shoved himself away from her and off of the bench, swaying a bit on his feet.</p><p>She jumped up, too, and he took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, holding a hand out to stave her off. Alice stopped in her tracks, keeping the distance between them.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>Was he? Even now, he wanted her. Wanted to sink his teeth into the vein that pulsed in her neck. Wanted to sate his taste for her blood.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m just nauseous. I didn\u2019t want to get sick on you.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened and a tiny grin emerged. \u201cWell, I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>The cab ride flew by, and Noah kept his window down the whole time, his head on the doorframe. He needed the fresh air. She smelled too good, and her scent filled the small cab. When they arrived at the cruise ship, he managed to pull cash out of his wallet to pay, ignoring Alice\u2019s protests.</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to touch him again, but she hovered nearby until they reached the room. His head pounded and throwing up on her was becoming a real possibility. He\u2019d have to go in the bathroom. Turn on the water.</p><p>But after she opened the door, Alice didn\u2019t follow him in. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see if they have something for your headache.\u201d</p><p>He nodded gratefully. It would be easier to drink, knowing she wasn\u2019t only a wall away.</p><p>She disappeared down the hall, and the door shut behind her. Noah made his way into the bathroom, and reached for the conditioner bottle. He sucked greedily at it, feeling more than a little like a degenerate alcoholic seeking his next fix. After another couple of swigs for good measure, and with normalcy fast returning to him, he swung the bottle back and forth between his thumb and index finger. Its lightness told him everything he needed to know. He\u2019d have to hunt at some point before this trip was over. Hunt, or risk losing control around the most tempting woman he\u2019d ever been around. He couldn\u2019t risk hurting her.</p><p>Hunting it would be.</p><p>After replacing the conditioner bottle, he sat down heavily on the bed and ran his hands over his hair. The afternoon was vague in his mind, but he remembered her scent, the feel of her soft hair on his face. God, he\u2019d almost bitten her. Almost tasted her blood.</p><p>The thought made his fangs lengthen painfully in his mouth. He took a few deep, slow breaths. In and out. In and out.</p><p>A weight settled on his chest and it refused to move. His control had almost slipped. He could have hurt her. Disgust washed over him. What kind of vampire was he? Some infant who had just been turned? No. He had two centuries of practice. Two centuries during which he\u2019d never lost control. And now, when it mattered the most, he\u2019d failed.</p><p>Somewhere in his mind he knew that even if he had bitten her, he would have regained control fairly quickly after ingesting some of her blood. Just enough to counteract the effects of the sun poisoning. Her life was never really in danger, but any chance their shared future certainly had been.</p><p>That realization didn\u2019t lessen the guilt weighing him down. That kind of experience would have not only blown any chance for them to have a future together, it might well have scarred her mentally.</p><p>And the likelihood that she would have even been willing to listen to his explanation after that? Zero. Shit. He\u2019d come so close to blowing it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His phone vibrated and he answered it without looking.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, brother,\u201d Charles\u2019s smooth voice answered.</p> <p>Relief flooded him. \u201cHey, Charles. I could really use some good news right now.\u201d</p><p>Charles was silent for a few seconds, and Noah\u2019s grip on the phone tightened. He loosened his hold. Replacing a cell phone with another that couldn\u2019t be traced back to him while cruising next to Mexico was a pain in the ass he didn\u2019t need. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have any to give me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, man. I was able to figure out what the push was, but I\u2019m afraid even Alex doesn\u2019t have the clout to counteract it,\u201d Charles said, his light tone burdened by the news.</p><p>Confusion washed over him. Who wouldn\u2019t Alex be able to persuade? The man was one of the oldest vampires in North America, and few on The Council wouldn\u2019t be swayed by his reassurance that Noah would be fine on his own for a few more decades. Alex could be on the subcouncil that ran the whole of the continent if he\u2019d wanted to be. But he wasn\u2019t interested in ruling.</p><p>Vampires were, above all things, unfailingly honest among themselves. Surely no one would suspect Alex of lying? Hell, Alex had been honest enough to admit he might not make it another fifty years if unbonded, which had resulted in a marriage Alex didn\u2019t want. No one would suspect him of lying for a friend.</p> <p>His stomach dropped. There was only one person he could think of with the clout to contradict Alex, who also had an interest in Noah\u2019s fate.</p><p>\u201cFather. Kane is behind this, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to track him down yet, talk to him in person. Alex is working on it, too. But you know how...difficult he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find him until he wants to be found. I know.\u201d Hell. It was over. He would have to go through with the bonding. Escaping wasn\u2019t an option. It wasn\u2019t even a consideration, no matter how much he wished it was. And by going through with The Council\u2019s arranged marriage, he\u2019d be forced to stop seeing Alice.</p><p>Unless he didn\u2019t have to. Hell, most vampire bondings were a formality. They had to be consummated\u2014once\u2014for the magic to take hold. But after that, the couple was free to live how they wanted. In all likelihood, his vampire \u201cbride\u201d wouldn\u2019t be any happier about being stuck with him than he was with her.</p><p>Just as hope surged through his chest at the thought, cold reality swept it away. No. He couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014do that to Alice. Even if the bonding was in name only, how could he return to her after sleeping with another woman? He couldn\u2019t. And he wouldn\u2019t continue seeing her if there was no hope of it becoming more than a dalliance. She deserved better.</p> <p>She deserved everything.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could do something. I mean, maybe that neighbor of yours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d he said, unable to keep the anger from his voice. The whole situation was just so damned stupid, and the timing of it all couldn\u2019t have been worse.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, maybe you could talk to her. Bring her over.\u201d</p><p>Noah couldn\u2019t find a reply to that. The idea of Alice being a vampire both fascinated and scared him. Spending decades\u2014centuries\u2014with her was a heady thought. But she\u2019d have to avoid the sun. And eventually, she\u2019d have to watch her family die.</p><p>Granted, she\u2019d have at least a lifetime with them, and it was possible some could be brought over by her after a few years, but that wasn\u2019t guaranteed. To be with him, she\u2019d have to be willing to give so many other things up.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t know her that well, but the two of you seem to have a connection. Might be better than taking a roll of the die with whomever The Council picks. If it comes down to them, you\u2019ll be tied to one so young she needs your strength to keep her from biting anyone who comes in range, and she\u2019ll be a stranger.\u201d Just seems like someone you know\u2014someone you already like\u2014might be a better choice.\u201d Charles let out a long sigh. \u201cFuck, man. I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m just searching for a way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a way out,\u201d he said, but Charles\u2019s words pounded through his brain. He\u2019d only thought about his side of this mess, but what about the poor woman he was bonded to? She was likely to be equally as unhappy about the pairing, and even if she wasn\u2019t, one look at Noah would tell her he was mooning over someone else. That wasn\u2019t fair to anyone, but he was damned if he could see a way out of it.</p> <p>Bonding and turning Alice\u2014that wasn\u2019t something he was certain he was ready to do. And it damned sure wasn\u2019t something Alice was ready for.</p><p>Charles was silent on the other end of the line, but Noah could picture his drawn expression. Charles never lost hope. He was ever the optimist. But a situation had finally hit where all the optimism in the world wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Charles,\u201d he managed, \u201cI appreciate you trying.\u201d He hit end on the phone, mind reeling.</p><p>Why would his father be concerned about him now? After all these years? After the warring between the vampire groups had calmed, not long after Charles was brought over, Kane had disappeared. With the cryptic instruction that his blood sons take care of each other. Alex, Noah, and Charles. Brothers in blood. And Kane, their father in blood, if not in birth.</p><p>What the hell was the old man playing at?</p><p>Alice unlocked the door to their shared cabin, hands trembling from nerves, two hours after she\u2019d left Noah with the poor excuse of looking for medicine. She carried some ibuprofen with her, although she knew it probably looked weird that she\u2019d waited so long to come back. She didn\u2019t really have a good excuse ready, but hoped he wouldn\u2019t press her for one, anyway.</p><p>He\u2019d needed the time alone, no doubt to feed on the blood he\u2019d hidden. And she\u2019d needed to get the hell out of there. Because no matter how safe Noah made her feel, that afternoon on the bench there had been no mistaking his hunger.</p><p>And that hunger had scared her.</p><p>Not that Noah made her afraid, exactly. But the way he\u2019d smelled her, looked at her. It was as if Noah wasn\u2019t entirely in control of his own body. And it suddenly hit her on a visceral level that he was really a creature that survived on human blood.</p><p>Noah sat on the couch, freshly showered and dressed. He looked up as she entered, his face still strained, but he didn\u2019t look hungry. If anything, his frown and flitting gaze suggested guilt.</p><p>\u201cHey, how are you feeling?\u201d Despite seeing his darker side, her heart still skipped the way it always had when she saw him. And whatever fear had gripped her on that bench no longer touched her. He was just Noah, and she hated the line between his brows when he was unhappy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good now. Thanks for getting me back to the ship.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry if I acted oddly, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to argue, but finally he shook his head and turned his gaze to his hands.</p><p>She bit the inside of her lip. Something had changed in him. And it felt like a wall was being erected between them. She couldn\u2019t allow that. There might not be a future for her and Noah, but she cared about him. And wanted, so badly, for their time together to be happy. Limited though that time might be.</p><p>With confidence she didn\u2019t really feel, she strode to the couch and sat next to him. Her shoulder brushed against his, and she took his hands in hers.</p><p>\u201cEverything is going to be okay,\u201d she said, and her voice came out as she\u2019d hoped: confident, clear, and lacking any worry.</p><p>His eyes met hers, and the yearning in them stilled her breath. \u201cYou sound pretty sure of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She released his hands and then reached up and held his face gently. \u201cWe\u2019re fine, right?\u201d</p><p>He searched her face for something before he answered. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The words sounded like a lie, but she wasn\u2019t pushing it. Not today. She leaned forward and kissed him soundly on the lips. \u201cGood. We\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>Was he even feeling well enough to leave the suite? He looked\u2014well, he looked scrumptious, but that didn\u2019t mean he really felt well. The man was far too good at hiding his discomfort. \u201cI have to cook that lasagna for Cindy. If you feel well enough to help me, you can come assist. But it\u2019s off the ship, in a bungalow we\u2019ve rented for the day. If you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this make me your sous chef?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI guess so. Do you like lasagna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds delicious,\u201d he said, and the low growl in his voice sent shivers running down her spine. She would bet the man didn\u2019t have food on his mind.</p><p>They headed back off the ship, to a bungalow Cindy had reserved for the wedding party for the night. The space was large enough for a group five times their size, and came with an attached galley.</p><p>They took a cab to the small house on the beach. The bungalow was charming and bright, and sun was cresting toward the horizon. Waves splashed against the beach, soothing. The salty smell of the ocean draped the air.</p><p>\u201cSo this place belonged to your parents?\u201d Noah said as he checked out the living room.</p><p>If ever a home deserved to be called quaint, it was this one.</p><p>\u201cThey never owned it or anything, but they did spend a lot of time here. It\u2019s special,\u201d she said.</p><p>She rushed Noah to the kitchen, which wasn\u2019t a bad size, and more importantly, it appeared to have all the ingredients she\u2019d ordered in the refrigerator and pantry. There wasn\u2019t much time left to do everything, so she was grateful to have Noah along to help with the prep work.</p><p>Whatever had bothered him when she entered the room seemed to lift when they started cooking. And as she chirped instructions at him, she was happy to discover Noah knew his way around the kitchen. Did vampires enjoy eating? She\u2019d assumed they ate to maintain their cover in front of humans, but maybe they liked lasagna as much as any non-vampire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould you grab that for me?\u201d she asked, pointing at a can of diced tomatoes.</p><p>He waggled his eyebrows at her. \u201cI\u2019ll grab anything you want me to, Miss Shepard.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and whacked him with the spoon in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll thank you to keep your mind on the food, Mr. Thorpe.\u201d</p> <p>He moved in, and she could feel his body close against her back. His hands settled on both sides of her, trapping her between the counter and his body. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I always think of my appetite when I\u2019m around you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched and then he stepped away with a chuckle, far too pleased with himself. Suddenly, her breasts ached, and her body thrummed with need. Maybe if they finished dinner early, they could run back to the room. Thoughts of the night before rushed through her mind. His touch. His tongue. His arms holding her so close.</p><p>Flushed, she worked on the lasagna with Noah\u2019s help. Halfway through the prep, they moved almost silently, side by side. He started handing her things before she even asked for them, and they fell into a comfortable harmony.</p><p>She spread the first layer of sauce in the pan, and he watched her, his chest flush with her back.</p><p>\u201cSmells good,\u201d he murmured in her ear.</p> <p>The noodles went on next, a thin layer. \u201cHand me the ricotta?\u201d</p><p>He reached to the side and then slid the bowl to her. She grabbed a handful of the mixture, while his hand caressed her bare shoulder softly.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cThat\u2019s not helping, Mister.\u201d</p><p>Soft, his lips brushed the back of her neck. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. The lasagna smells so delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you smelling my hair?\u201d Her voice was breathy and weak, but she didn\u2019t care. Not if he\u2019d just keep doing that.</p><p>\u201cYou smell even more delicious.\u201d</p> <p>She threw the rest of the layers together in a warm daze, barely noticing if they were in the right order. She pushed the pan into the oven and then went to the sink to rinse off her hands. The clock hanging above the stove revealed that there wasn\u2019t a lot of time before dinner. An hour, which was just long enough for the lasagna to cook. Dammit. No time to run back to the room. It was at least a ten minute round trip, and she really needed to stay by the oven, just in case.</p><p>Noah disappeared into the living room. A few moments later, his arms came around her again, and his body pressed even closer than before. His frame lined her body, barely close enough for her to feel him, all of him. He pressed a kiss onto the bare skin of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to run back to the room,\u201d she said, her whole body screaming at her to make the time. \u201cI have to take the foil off in twenty-five minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>His body pressed closer, and she could feel his erection on the small of her back. \u201cWho said anything about the room? I locked the front door.\u201d</p><p>She felt her hair slide off to one side, and then his lips and tongue traced their way up her neck. His touch was so soft, but it sent shocks through her body, and her stomach clenched in need.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you. Now.\u201d His teeth nipped the muscle between her shoulder and neck softly and she couldn\u2019t remember what she was going to say. She shuddered against him, and his hands traced her sides. With one quick motion, he spun her around, and then his mouth was on hers.</p><p>When he\u2019d kissed her before, there had been a hesitancy, at least at first. But now, all uncertainty was gone. He kissed her with force and passion. His tongue dipped into her mouth and warred with hers. His clever, clever hands roamed over her body, massaging and caressing. Pinching and grasping.</p> <p>Every thought that tried to form kept slipping from her. This wasn\u2019t right, part of her mind insisted. People make food in here. But somehow, the location, the knowledge that someone with a key could easily interrupt them, stoked the fire within her even more. Brought her to the point of desperation.</p><p>One of his hands slipped under her shirt and bra, and he slid his thumb over her nipple roughly. His other hand gripped her ass, pulling her hard against his body. She slid her hands up to his neck, then to back of his head to tug on a handful of his hair. His hunger infected her, and she writhed against him, feeling herself already slick with need.</p><p>He set her on the counter, which still held a few ingredients she hadn\u2019t put away. But she ignored them as his hands roved over her again. One slipped between her legs, and she was so glad she\u2019d worn a skirt.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d she gasped out when he touched her heat.</p><p>He leaned back in and kissed her, softer this time, as his hand stroked her. He slipped under her soaked panties and pushed a finger into her.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she cried out against his lips. It was all almost too much. Too erotic. Their almost public location. His roughness and obvious need. His disregard for anything but being with her, right then and there. Her body cried out with need.</p><p>Noah stepped back, taking her underwear with him. He tucked them into a pocket and gave her a wicked grin. Then his hands were on her again. She pressed her hands onto the counter behind her, supporting herself, as he pushed down her shirt and bra with one hand, revealing her right breast. His other hand slipped down to stroke her again, and she felt herself at the brink so quickly it was almost embarrassing.</p><p>He watched her as he touched her, and she closed her eyes and threw her head back, unable to meet his intense gaze for too long. It was like he could see her\u2014really see her. Every weakness she tried to hide, every insecurity beneath her surface. And it left her feeling open and raw. Disconcerted, but so needy she almost didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He leaned in and nipped her neck again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet, Alice.\u201d He shuddered against her as his lips brushed the vein in her neck.</p><p>Suddenly, she could practically feel it. His teeth sinking in her neck as his cock thrust into her body. She yearned for it so painfully. The words were on the tip of her tongue. Not an insult. A demand.</p><p>Bite me.</p><p>The urge to sink his fangs into her thrummed in his mind, so powerful he had to pull away from her neck, even as he pushed two fingers into her body and pinched her nipple before rubbing away the sting.</p><p>Her mouth was slightly open, and her eyes wide, filled with passion. Her lips were swollen from his kisses. And there was such want in her expression that he could almost fool himself into thinking she knew what he wanted from her neck.</p><p>She moved as if to speak, but stopped as his rhythm increased, moaning instead. He needed to see her, needed to make her come. Needed to watch her break apart around him, even more than he needed to taste the sweetness of her blood.</p><p>He leaned down and licked her, sucking on her sex even as he fucked her with his fingers. She yelled out and he reached up with his free hand to cover her mouth automatically. No matter how much he wanted her here, in this very nearly public place, he didn\u2019t actually want anyone to walk in on them.</p><p>The orgasm shook her body, and she bit his hand, hard. He glanced up, and seeing her teeth sunk into his skin almost pushed him over the edge.</p><p>He yanked the condom out of his pocket and then pushed her back onto the counter, knocking off a container of ricotta and a mostly empty can of tomato juice. Her hands moved over his body and gripped him through his pants. Fire shot through him and he groaned against her lips.</p><p>He wanted so badly to sink his fangs into her. Could almost taste her blood, so sweet on his tongue, mixing with the taste of her arousal. Her blood rushing into his mouth as he fucked her.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He\u2019d nuzzled her neck again, but pulled away as she tried to tug him closer. With her help, he shoved his pants down, just far enough to put the condom on. Then he crawled onto the counter with her. She pushed his pants down farther so she could grip his ass.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered, trying to get his cock into place.</p><p>\u201cA little more challenging than a bed.\u201d She chuckled and kissed him.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around him and he pushed into her. Two thrusts, and he could feel her tightness wrapped around him. So warm. So wet. So tight. Fucking paradise.</p><p>He stopped there, taking a moment for the sensation to sink in. Reveling in how perfectly they fit together. He\u2019d been so fucked up after that phone call. After he\u2019d decided there was no way out of the wedding. And that not telling Alice the truth of it all would be leading her on. Lying to her. But when she looked at him with her face so full of concern and caring, he came to a realization.</p><p>He needed her.</p><p>Not just for the short term\u2014during this cruise\u2014but as a real part of his life. Her smile filled the dark corners of his heart in a way he\u2019d never experienced, not once in his very long life. And if you couldn\u2019t take a chance on someone like that, what the hell could you take a chance on?</p><p>It was all too soon, he knew that. Too soon to talk about forever. Too soon to make promises. Too soon to spout his feelings like a lovelorn teenager.</p><p>But part of him wanted to.</p><p>And he knew, no matter what else happened, he wasn\u2019t going to lose her. He would get out of the wedding. Somehow.</p><p>She moaned beneath him and urged him on, her hands gripping his ass and her body writhing against him. He moved, thrusting and touching and coaxing more from her. And with her abandon, she pushed him to the edge.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, beautiful,\u201d he gasped out, his thumb moving on her most sensitive place while he drove himself into her, barely able to hold on enough to remember she was human. That he could hurt her if he wasn\u2019t at least a little careful. His mouth closed over her breast, and he bit her nipple. Not hard. Not nearly as hard as he wanted to.</p><p>She broke apart, crying out his name while her body convulsed around his. The orgasm hit him violently, and he drove himself into her hard, reeling from the power of it. Then he collapsed onto her, his body spasming. Her scent surrounded him, and he found his face in her hair, his mouth open against her, and his fangs a millimeter away from her skin. One little movement was all it would take. So fucking close.</p><p>He took a shuddering breath, and pulled away.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>The heavenly smell of lasagna in the air roused her from the half-trance kitchen sex with Noah had put her in. They\u2019d both put back on the bit of clothing they\u2019d lost in the heat of passion, and then Noah held her against him for a few minutes. Silence hung over them, so heavy she feared breaking it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But finally, she couldn\u2019t resist the urge. He still held her on the counter\u2014an oddly comfortable position.</p><p>\u201cThis probably broke at least five laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaws?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cKitchen cleanliness laws. Or food handling ones. Or something.\u201d</p><p>He laughed into her hair and stroked her cheek lightly with the back of his fingers. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t remember handling any food while we were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but food is definitely handled here.\u201d She snickered. \u201cI\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself onto an elbow and looked up at him. \u201cReally? No crazy locales for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. Well, none so publicly kitchen-oriented. I can\u2019t say that lasagna\u2019s ever had this effect on me before.\u201d He smiled and kissed her softly. \u201cGuess it must be the chef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am an excellent chef,\u201d she lied. Lasagna was her only real forte when it came to cooking. But now that she\u2019d found the kitchen so versatile, she could imagine spending a lot more time in it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking evil thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d She rolled off the counter and then shot him a wicked grin. \u201cYou can\u2019t prove a thing.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and followed her, grabbing her before she could go far. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lasagna\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan wait.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her then, so tenderly that she couldn\u2019t help but melt against him. They were both breathing hard when she finally pulled away, and her whole body was hot and achy. How could she want him so much only moments after she\u2019d felt so satisfied?</p><p>\u201cCrap!\u201d She stepped away from Noah, regretting the loss of his heat. She avoided his eyes, which were still dark with passion. Maybe if she didn\u2019t look directly at him, she\u2019d be able to resist. Concentrate. It was worth a shot. \u201cDo you smell that? God, is it burning?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for a response, instead, she ran for the oven. \u201cOh no. I forgot about the foil.\u201d She pulled the lasagna out of the oven and set it on the stove. Hands still in the oven mitts, she tugged off the aluminum foil and stared at the lasagna in disgust.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look badly burned,\u201d Noah observed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too bad, I guess. Just a little around the edges. But it\u2019s definitely not going to have any texture now. All mushy. Which is okay for lasagna, I just hope it didn\u2019t get too much moisture.\u201d She tossed the oven mitts onto the counter and sighed heavily. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no time to really do anything about it. So I guess it doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d</p><p>Quickly, they straightened up their clothes and hair as well as they could without a mirror, relying on each other for feedback. Then Alice had Noah help her scoop lasagna onto plates.</p><p>\u201cOnly feeding eight people tonight?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She counted off on her fingers. \u201cYou and me. Mom and Jake. Cindy, Robert, his cousin...oh I can\u2019t think of his name, and his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only six.\u201d He leaned forward and gave her a quick peck on the nose. \u201cHas amazing sex overrun your ability to count? Too many orgasms?\u201d</p><p>She giggled and slapped at him. \u201cBrent and Kristen. They\u2019re the last two.\u201d</p><p>A darkness fell over his face and the amusement there faltered. She punched him in the arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t honestly be worried about Brent after\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d he said, too quickly. \u201cJust makes things a little more tense is all.\u201d</p><p>She debated telling him about Brent\u2019s apology, if only to clarify why she wasn\u2019t feeling as annoyed as he was about the man joining them for dinner. But that was a long conversation, one that would no doubt require delving into her past and dredging up details she didn\u2019t feel like thinking about, let alone discussing with Noah. Not right this second anyway, when everything felt so perfect. Besides, they didn\u2019t have that much time to talk much before dinner.</p><p>A loud knock pulled her from her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOh no, the salad,\u201d she exclaimed, holding a plate of lasagna in each hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the salad. You get out there with the lasagna before it cools and let them in before they break the door down,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>She gave him a wary glance, but he approached the romaine with confidence and actually started washing it in front of her, so she headed out into the dining room. She dropped off the first couple of plates, then went to get the door. And for the first time, she was thankful her family was nearly always late to everything, or just barely on time. If they\u2019d come early.... Her cheeks burned at the thought.</p><p>The dinner guests were all waiting on the porch, standing around a mat that proclaimed they were welcome, with the waves crashing onto the beach behind them. They chattered happily as they piled in and headed for the table. Alice swallowed hard at the thought of them all waiting out here while she and Noah had...well thank goodness no one had knocked. Unless\u2014no, they would have heard a knock, right? Thank God the door locked.</p><p>Her mom got up as soon as she approached. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to go to the kitchen and grab some plates, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>Her mom nodded and headed for the kitchen. Alice dropped off the first two plates and declined further help from her sister and Brent. \u201cNot much else is coming, just lasagna and a salad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need anything else with your lasagna,\u201d Cindy replied, her eyes fixed on the plate in front of her.</p><p>She gave her sister a smile and then spun around and headed for the kitchen. Her mom appeared with a couple of plates, and Noah was right on her heels with a salad that looked oddly professional. He carried a stack of bowls in his other hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured as she passed him. His eyebrows moved up in acknowledgment.</p><p>With the lasagna delivered and the salad on the large oak table, they sat to eat. Alice felt surprisingly good, considering the near disaster she and Noah had averted. And everyone murmured over how delicious the lasagna was. Thank goodness her family was okay with casual dinners, no one even seemed to notice she didn\u2019t serve anything in courses, and she\u2019d completely forgotten appetizers.</p><p>The house felt homey, with its light tile floors and bright, festively painted walls. And other than a few pieces of furniture that had been swapped out for more modern choices, it looked largely unchanged from the old pictures her mom still kept on her mantle. The table looked like it had been around a while, as did the matching chairs. The oak was nicked and a bit outdated, and the chairs had small pads tied to them to make them more comfortable, but the idea that her father might have actually eaten there was comforting.</p><p>\u201cIs this a new thing you\u2019re doing?\u201d Cindy asked, halfway into her lasagna serving.</p><p>Noah\u2019s hand stilled over his lasagna</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Alice asked, keeping her voice nonchalant. Her mother watched her with interest, and Robert seemed to be having trouble keeping his expression serious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as...I\u2019m not sure what.\u201d Cindy looked like she was searching her thoughts, but Alice knew what her sister looked like when she was making mischief. And something was definitely up. \u201cNot as much texture on the top, I guess. Like you forgot to take off the foil.\u201d</p><p>Look innocent. No one will be able to say anything if you don\u2019t give them the bait. \u201cMust not have taken the foil off fast enough, I guess.\u201d She turned her gaze to the chandelier above them. The pieces of cut glass forming the light fixture were plain, but pretty. \u201cIs that the same chandelier, Mom?\u201d she asked, desperate to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo unlike you to miss a detail. Strange,\u201d Cindy said, then shoved a mouthful of the lasagna between her lips.</p><p>Alice glared daggers at her sister. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem to be bothering you much.\u201d She mentally dared her to say something else, but Cindy just grinned as she chewed. Robert coughed into a napkin, his sudden fit sounded suspiciously like muffled laughter.</p><p>The attack came from a new direction.</p><p>\u201cIs that ricotta in your hair, dear?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Alice\u2019s eyes widened and she resisted the urge to swipe madly at her hair while Cindy half-laughed, half-choked into her cloth napkin. Her mother\u2019s face remained a picture of virtue and concern. But then, she had more practice at feigning innocence than her daughters.</p><p>Kristen smiled widely while Robert gave up on hiding hid laughter. Brent stabbed at his lasagna like it had done something to piss him off.</p><p>She started when she felt something touching her hair, and then gave Noah a grateful glance as he plucked a chunk of cheese out of one of her curls. Their eyes met, and his darkened. She drew in a quick breath, and a slow grin overtook his face while she watched.</p><p>\u201cMust have been flinging the cheese around back there.\u201d He turned to their very interested audience. \u201cShe was in a rush to make sure the lasagna was done in time and perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d her mom agreed, but mischief danced in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite the chef, you know,\u201d Alice said, playing along with Noah\u2019s story.</p><p>Cindy laughed outright then, almost choking on the bite of lasagna she\u2019d been chewing. Robert, his expression a mix of amusement and concern, patted her back as she struggled.</p><p>\u201cMore tea?\u201d Alice asked sweetly once Cindy had her coughing fit under control. She held out the pitcher. Cindy shook her head, but an evil look still danced in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, dear?\u201d Her mom asked.</p><p>Cindy nodded and shoved another bite of lasagna in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Noah made the salad.\u201d Alice picked out a grape tomato and bit into it, relishing the flavor as it exploded in her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, dear,\u201d her mother assured him. Noah nodded in thanks.</p><p>\u201cYou are a very good chef, Alice,\u201d her mother continued. She leaned in and whispered so only Alice could hear her. \u201cAnd that cheese flinging explains the mess in the kitchen, too. Would you believe it looked like a half-full container of ricotta got away from you? I found it on the floor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heat rose to overtake her face, but she couldn\u2019t find a reply, so she forced a bite of lasagna between her lips and pretended her mother hadn\u2019t said a thing.</p><p>Through it all, Brent was quiet, his attention fixed on the food in front of him. But Kristen had observed the jokes with a smile. \u201cWell, I know one thing Alice isn\u2019t the best at. And luckily for those of us who aren\u2019t such fantastic cooks, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing tonight. Have to keep things even.\u201d</p><p>Alice searched her mind for what Kristen was talking about, and dread filled her. She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kristen said, a big smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014no. Let\u2019s do something else. Anything else,\u201d Alice begged. She turned to Cindy. \u201cAren\u2019t you and Robert staying in the bungalow tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. We just wanted to use it for dinner. We\u2019ll head back to the ship tonight,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cThat seems wasteful,\u201d Alice muttered, but she couldn\u2019t really argue. That Cindy and Robert didn\u2019t want to stay the night here wasn\u2019t really odd. And her mother surely wouldn\u2019t want to stay, especially not with her date.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Noah asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all doing karaoke tonight,\u201d Kristen announced.</p><p>Alice glanced at Noah, expecting him to tease her about it as well. But the vampire\u2019s face was serious, and his skin pale.</p><p>\u201cBetter make it a double,\u201d Noah told the bartender. The man nodded and turned to make their drinks. Noah looked back at Alice, and hoped he didn\u2019t appear as sick as he felt.</p><p>The flashy karaoke bar glowed with brightly colored lights that did little to actually reveal the space. Instead, the room was both dark and glaring, and full of small groups of people who crowded around bar-height tables strewn around the room, or who clung to the bar itself, which lined one of the walls. And central to it all was a stage set only a couple of feet higher than the main floor.</p><p>The hum of the revelers was low enough for the karaoke singers to be heard clearly when they sang\u2014unfortunately. He\u2019d have had a much easier time getting on stage if no one would actually hear him when he got there.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked. So much for not looking sick.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cI\u2019m just not big on...singing.\u201d He crinkled his nose against the smell of bodies and alcohol.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like to sing?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. What could he say to that? Who really hated singing? Sure, a lot of people didn\u2019t like to sing in public, but Alice was so free, so confident. With her bright attitude at life, he was surprised she didn\u2019t constantly sing a happy tune to herself. The woman did nothing halfway, and she lived life to the fullest extent. How did you explain a fear of singing in public to someone like that?</p><p>And he\u2019d be damned if he admitted being scared of anything. He was turning two hundred years old, for fuck\u2019s sake. He wasn\u2019t afraid to get up in front of her whole family\u2014not to mention her ex\u2014and sing so awfully and horribly that she\u2019d probably never talk to him again for fear of associating herself with such an embarrassment.</p><p>She watched his expression, her eyes wide with fascination.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a singer,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, shocked. But she watched her prettily manicured toes. The bartender interrupted with their drinks, and Noah downed his scotch and waved for another.</p> <p>\u201cGet me another, too,\u201d Alice called after the bartender. Then, she drank the appletini in two long drinks.</p><p>Noah blinked at her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking hate singing in public. And they\u2019re totally going to make us do it.\u201d She waved her empty martini glass toward her family. Edna and Jake had accompanied them, sitting across from Cindy and Robert. Brent and Kristen took up the end of the table opposite of the chairs they\u2019d saved for Noah and Alice. \u201cWow.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cStrong drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should slow down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. After I\u2019m a little more certain I won\u2019t remember this tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Noah watched her sip at the second appletini, her desire to avoid getting sick apparently slightly stronger than her need to forget their night of karaoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d he said, finally.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she asked, glaring at her sister. Cindy was making some sort of motions barely within his peripheral vision, but he didn\u2019t turn around to see what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cI would have thought you\u2019d like singing. You\u2019re so...I don\u2019t know. Bright. Happy. Singing seems like it would be something you\u2019d enjoy.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shifted to him. \u201cI love to sing. Just not where people can hear me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI understand. I totally understand.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a suspicious glance, but then straightened her spine. \u201cYou ready to go face them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe after a few more of these.\u201d He waved his scotch at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, we can go sit with them. Mom and Cindy will be all over this for a while, anyway. Brent and Kristen, too. It\u2019ll be a good hour or so before they force us onto the stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could just leave, you know. Go lock ourselves in the room.\u201d</p><p>Hope lit up her face for a few seconds before she shook her head. \u201cLeaving would be rude. I\u2019m sorry Noah, but some things are unavoidable.\u201d She threw her free hand over her heart dramatically. \u201c\u2019Tis our fate.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her dramatics, but his stomach flip-flopped when her words hit him. Nothing was unavoidable. Nothing. And he\u2019d be damned if he just rolled over for that bonding. He needed a plan.</p><p>Everything about Alice demanded that he make sure that they at least get a shot. And he was in no danger of offing himself or retreating into a dark depression. His father\u2019s insistence he be bonded was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cReady to face the table?\u201d she asked, a third appletini in hand. Her cheeks were flushed a bit from the drinks.</p><p>He reached out and stroked her cheek softly with his thumb. \u201cReady when you are.\u201d</p><p>They made their way to the table, and by the sounds of it, everyone seemed to be enjoying the bar\u2019s offerings. The noise level grew when Cindy got up to sing.</p><p>Her rendition of Don\u2019t Stop Believing by Journey was actually quite good. Could Alice really be that terrible if her sister was so good? Maybe she just feared getting up in front of everyone. He glanced at her while she cheered her sister on. No. That didn\u2019t fit either. Alice didn\u2019t fear being the center of attention, even if she didn\u2019t seek it.</p><p>As the night progressed, Noah fell into the cheerful mood that surrounded him, and Alice seemed to as well. Edna got up and sang a country song he didn\u2019t recognize, but did it with such gusto that he couldn\u2019t help enjoying it. Robert and Jake\u2019s take on an AC/DC song was laughable, but they were so far gone by the time they walked onto the stage, they didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>Brent downed the rest of his drink and then grabbed Kristen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go next,\u201d Brent said. \u201cShow you all how it\u2019s done.\u201d Kristen nodded, obviously excited.</p><p>When they launched into Summer Nights from Grease, Noah was struck by how good they were, almost theatrical in their performance. Great. Of course Brent would be a good singer. He shook himself mentally. Alice wasn\u2019t going to go running back to Brent for his voice.</p><p>But she was obviously uncomfortable. She crossed her arms and seemed to sink into her chair, a fake smile plastered on her face as she watched the couple on the stage.</p><p>\u201cOkay Alice, Noah. You guys are up,\u201d Cindy insisted after everyone else at the table had taken their shot. Noah\u2019s stomach swirled at the thought, and Alice\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d Alice began.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d Cindy insisted. \u201cGo up together, that way you\u2019ll both get it out of the way. You might even have fun.\u201d</p><p>Fat chance of that. Alice shrugged at him, and he pushed up from the table. He\u2019d fought battles before anyone in this room was even born. He\u2019d taken out vampires who attacked him with swords, seeking his head. He\u2019d faced down groups that should have killed him and his brothers, going by the numbers. He could do this. He could sing in front of these people.</p><p>Alice seemed to be warring a battle in her own mind as they approached the stage.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked. She nodded, and picked up the mics. Handing him one, she turned to face the audience. Cindy was down with the man who controlled the music, saying something in his ear, loudly, to be heard over the ever-increasing crowd. Noah made out the words, and almost ran off the stage.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>He shook his head. And then the music started.</p><p>When the first notes for Leather and Lace hit, he knew he was screwed.</p><p>But when Alice started singing, he smiled. He might be screwed, but at least they\u2019d go down together. He and Alice limped through the song, and by the end, they were laughing and leaning against each other. And they sang the final notes with enthusiasm. Much to the chagrin of the listeners.</p><p>They left the stage still laughing, and most of their table cheered them on. All but Brent, whose expression had gone from hard to angry at some point during their duet.</p><p>\u201cYou suck!\u201d Alice told Cindy. Her sister giggled and dodged Alice\u2019s half-hearted punches.</p><p>Later, Cindy and Alice sang a song together. Noah had a tough time making out the lyrics, but he was pretty sure girl power was the theme.</p><p>After a couple more drinks, he and Alice got up for another duet. And to his amazement, he realized that he was actually having fun.</p><p>After her second song with Noah, she started having a hard time reading the monitor. Her last couple of appletinis pushed everything from a happy haze to a difficult-to-make-out fuzz.</p><p>Noah helped her back to their room, and she clung to his arm. He\u2019d drunk as much as she had, and she almost asked him if his vampire metabolism was better than a human\u2019s. But she caught herself, just barely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wrangled the door open while she leaned against a wall.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.

Sitting heavily on the bed, she watched Noah as he went to close the heavy drapes. His secret still on the tip of her tongue, she swallowed the words. A new subject\u2014a non-vampire subject\u2014that\u2019s what she needed.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your wife,\u201d she said, then clapped her hand over her mouth. Why did she keep asking about her? Maybe that wasn\u2019t the best thing to ask about. Not if she wanted to have sex tonight anyway. And she so did.</p><p>Noah winced, but nodded. \u201cYou have a right to ask.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. If he thought she had a right to know about his ex-wife, that meant something, didn\u2019t it?</p> <p>\u201cWe met when we were young\u2014too young, really.\u201d He paused, searching his thoughts. Probably deciding what was safe to tell her and what verged too close to the truth. Because she had no doubt that his vampire nature had something to do with why he was no longer with his wife.</p><p>\u201cSo you married too young?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cYes. And there were things she didn\u2019t like about me, about my life. Things she didn\u2019t really find out about until after we were married.\u201d He let out a short laugh and then sat down on the bed, a couple of feet between them. \u201cShit, that sounded ominous. I guess\u2014it\u2019s hard to explain. We were just very different people.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, wanting to push for more information, but knowing she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>But Noah didn\u2019t give her a chance to push. \u201cWhy have you been acting different around Brent?\u201d</p><p>She smiled to herself. Apparently she wasn\u2019t the only one who wondered about things. \u201cHe apologized for his behavior when we danced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? An apology?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cWhat\u2019s the subtext here, Noah? That I\u2019m naive to forgive him after an apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? Fuck yeah.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. She should have been angry\u2014or at least irritated\u2014at his words, but somehow, she wasn\u2019t. His worries were too ridiculous. \u201cI\u2019m not running back to Brent. I\u2019ll never go back to him. And even though Kristen betrayed me, and I might never completely forgive her, I won\u2019t ever think he\u2019s good enough for her. But hating him for being an asshole isn\u2019t something I care to spend the energy on.\u201d Elation rushed through her as she realized how true that was. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t give two figs what Brent thinks now.\u201d</p><p>Noah gave her a doubtful glance, but she didn\u2019t bother to push the issue. She knew how she felt, and Noah would either figure it out or he wouldn\u2019t. But he was a pretty smart guy, so she had faith that he\u2019d get it eventually. Besides, insisting on her point would probably only make her look defensive, like she was trying to convince herself.</p><p>\u201cI was never married to Brent.\u201d She felt compelled to point that out. And Noah knew far more about Brent than she did about his wife. \u201cWhat was her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have a thing for A-named women.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at that. \u201cI must.\u201d His smile faded and his brows drew together. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t honest with her about something, not soon enough. Not until after we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a learning moment,\u201d she said, keeping her voice light.</p><p>His eyes were dark and rolling with emotion when they met hers, like the ocean during a storm. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>She tried to smile, but faltered, her mind reeling. If he told her, what would she say? Should she try to pretend it was a shock to her? That she had no idea vampires existed, let alone that Noah was one of them?</p><p>That was probably the route Olivia would choose for her, and the smart thing to do. He would wonder why she hadn\u2019t told him before if she confessed the truth. And he would wonder how she knew. She\u2019d promised Olivia that she would keep her secret.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>She schooled her expression, thoughts still reeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>And she knew, with his worried expression and hopeful eyes, she could trust him. In a way she\u2019d never been able to trust anyone. And she didn\u2019t want to keep any secrets from Noah.</p><p>He took her hands in his, his eyes entreating her to believe him. \u201cLook, I know this is sort of impossible to believe, but let me show you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, simply.</p><p>He gaped at her. \u201cYou...what?\u201d</p><p>She forced a small smile to her face and hoped she looked more reassuring than she felt. \u201cI know you\u2019re a vampire. I\u2019ve known for a while.\u201d</p><p>He released her hands and leaned away from her, looking at her as if he\u2019d never seen her before. \u201cAgain, what? How?\u201d His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cNo need to look so suspicious. I knew a vampire, once. She\u2019s not around anymore\u2014I mean she\u2019s around, but not around us.\u201d Alice shook her head. \u201cThis is coming out all muddled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come back to that.\u201d He gave her a pointed look, but the suspicion had faded from his expression, so she counted that as a win. \u201cHow did you know\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cHow did you figure out I was one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were either a vampire, or a total psycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shampoo. You were either a vampire or a man kooky enough to drink shampoo.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cAnd I\u2019d much rather date someone who drinks blood. Shampoo is disgusting.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, unblinking, until she snickered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d get to see such a totally shocked expression on your face. It\u2019s very cute.\u201d</p><p>His shock shifted to a glare, and her snicker blossomed into an outright laugh.</p><p>He ignored her humor. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was tempting to mess with you\u2014ask about your family. Pretend to want to look up them for my genealogy hobby. But, I figured it was your secret to tell.\u201d And that was the truth\u2014a decision she still believed right. Her amusement faded. \u201cI still stand by that.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a painfully long moment, his gaze searching her face. \u201cDo you have any idea how fucking amazing you are?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands, uncomfortable. Her mind searched for an appropriate answer to that. Flippant or denial? Finally she settled on deflection. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty amazing yourself.\u201d</p><p>She forced her gaze up to meet his, ignoring her own discomfort. Wide eyes, lacking any guile or walls, met hers.</p><p>And then they were kissing.</p><p>As if Noah were both a vampire and a magician, their clothes disappeared so quickly that she suspected wizardry. There was at least some sleight of hand involved. Noah kissed her so carefully, it was as if he worried she might break in his hands.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>She kissed him back forcefully, her hands roaming over his body, drawing a low growl from his lips when she found his erection. She stroked him and he moaned into her mouth.</p><p>She liked the sound of that.</p><p>She pushed against his chest, and he rolled over onto his back for her, his eyes questioning. But the look on his face changed when she started licking her way down his chest, confusion replaced by anticipation.</p><p>When she licked his cock, he jumped, muttering an expletive under his breath. She grinned, then took him in her mouth.</p><p>She explored him with her tongue, loving the salty taste, the pure, manly scent of him. Clean and strong. Noah gasped when she started to move faster, take him deeper. His hand threaded through her hair, not directing her, but desperately gripping it, holding it out of her face. The noises he made spurred her on, and she relished in being able to make him lose control in such a way.</p><p>He gasped loudly, and then his grip on her her hair turned almost painful. He tugged her back up, his face a picture of need. He was close.</p><p>High on that knowledge, she went to take him back in her mouth, but he rolled her over onto her back and kissed her with a ferocity that made her gasp in need. His hands seemed to be everywhere at once, touching and stroking, making her feel as desperate as he had just looked.</p><p>He positioned himself at her entrance and she pulled him close, her mouth against his ear. Did Noah want a future with her? Surely he wouldn\u2019t have told her about his vampire heritage if he didn\u2019t. And she trusted him\u2014actually trusted him. She needed to show him how much.</p><p>\u201cYou can bite me, if you want to,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His head pulled back and she expected to see shock on his face. Instead, his mouth was wide, in a snarl that revealed his fangs. God, his fangs. Long and sharp, they looked every bit the weapon. Her stomach twisted as desire mixed with a healthy dose of fear.</p><p>His face was laced with wanting so fierce she wasn\u2019t surprised when he didn\u2019t ask if she was certain. Instead, he lowered his face to her neck and took a deep breath, taking in her scent. Then he pushed his cock into her with a long, swift stroke. She moaned at the sudden fullness, but her voice cut off when she felt a sharp pain at her neck.</p><p>The warring sensations overwhelmed her senses, but before she could wrap her shocked mind around it all, a strange heat spread from her neck, and euphoria hit her. The world went surreal.</p><p>Intense pleasure crashed into her, swirling and mixing, familiar yet strange. Noah pumped into her fiercely while his mouth sucked at her neck. Her head grew light, and there was nothing but him and the sensations he wrought through her. The pull on her neck. The thrust of his thickness into her. The weight of his hard body on top of her. And then the orgasm hit.</p><p>It started the normal way, rolling from her core and sending her muscles shuddering, but the euphoria from the bite intensified it, and her whole body shook from the sensation. Her mind couldn\u2019t grasp the feelings, as wave after wave hit her, extending far past when a normal orgasm would have ended. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everything went black for a moment. Then Noah was shouting his own pleasure above her, and rocking into her body so hard she was certain she would feel it the next day.</p><p>Finally, he stilled, and then lowered his face back to her neck. He licked her long and hard where he\u2019d bit her, and she felt a twinge of pain. They stayed that way for a few minutes, her mind unable to form real thoughts, and Noah huddled into her neck. He held her so tightly it was as if he feared she would go running from the room if he let her go. Her hands were tangled in his hair. There had never been such a perfect moment.</p><p>\u201cIf you let me go, I promise I won\u2019t run away,\u201d she said, amused despite the awe-inspiring thing that had just happened.</p> <p>He laughed softly against her hair before rolling over to lie beside her. \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But that\u2019s part of your charm.\u201d A sudden thought hit her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wake up a vampire, right?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, low and throaty. \u201cNo. It takes a good deal of sharing blood for that to happen.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk then, they just lay next to each other until her eyelids grew heavy. She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d fallen asleep until she woke with a start. She stared at the drapes, still slightly open to the dark ocean beyond, they flitted with the breeze. Noah was no longer next to her. She sat up in the bed and glanced around. No edge of light indicated he was in the bathroom. Had he gone out? The murmur of a voice drew her to the balcony.</p><p>The sliding glass door stood a couple of inches open and she heard Noah on the other side. She turned away, but her name caught her attention.</p> <p>\u201c\u2014Alice. Yes...I\u2019m aware of that Charles, but if I parade Alice in front of The Council and tell them my intentions, they\u2019ll let me out of the bonding. You know that.\u201d Noah paused for a few moments, and she took a careful step closer to the door, her form hidden by the drapes, and the muted sound of her steps on the carpeting no doubt muffled by the ocean and the man on the other end of the phone call.</p><p>\u201cI know it hasn\u2019t been long, but that doesn\u2019t matter, does it? The intent to bond another is enough to get out of this fucking arranged marriage,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Her stomach dropped and the room spun. But she didn\u2019t walk away, she couldn\u2019t. She had to hear the rest. Maybe she\u2019d misheard.</p><p>\u201cYes, Charles. Yes. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll agree.\u201d He chuckled, a low and sexy sound that suddenly made her sick instead of turned on. \u201cIf not, I\u2019ll convince her.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away and doubled over, pain spiking from her stomach and chest. She lay down on the bed and forced back the tears burning her throat. She\u2019d believed him, really believed. Trusted him.</p><p>And he was just like Brent.</p> <p>Using her. Using her to get out of some vampire arranged marriage. Using her to get something for himself. Had he cared for her, even a little bit?</p><p>Misery filled her, and she wanted to scream to find a release for all of the tension, all of the pain. She couldn\u2019t act normal, not if he came back. But she had to, didn\u2019t she? Talking to him about this would only make her humiliation that much worse. She couldn\u2019t let him know she\u2019d overheard.</p><p>The bed moved under his weight, and her lungs constricted. She struggled to keep her breathing even. When his arm wrapped around her and his body melded to her back, it took every bit of willpower she had to bite her lip and not cry out in anger. Her eyes watered, but she ignored the sensation. It was all she could do to breathe.</p><p>Finally, he slept. And Alice stared into the night.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Noah woke with light heart, in an empty bed. Alice wasn\u2019t next to him, and he glanced around the room, looking for her. But the water running in the bathroom caught his ear, and he grinned. Maybe she\u2019d want company?</p><p>What a perfect night. Their conversation hadn\u2019t gone at all how he\u2019d planned\u2014it had gone better. Not only had Alice already known he was a vampire, but she accepted him for it, without fear. And she had tasted just as sweet as he knew she would. That she trusted him enough to let him bite her, made him feel like a goddamned giant.</p><p>Sure, suspicion had hit him when she\u2019d first confessed to already knowing what he was. He\u2019d immediately wondered if she worked for The Council somehow, had been planted by them to get close to him. But the idea was ridiculous, and he\u2019d dismissed it at once. The Council would have no way of knowing Alice might be able to get close to him where others could not. And they were an honorable lot, unlikely to try to play with his feelings in that kind of manner.</p> <p>Besides, they had no need for subterfuge, they could simply force their hand if they wanted.</p><p>Noah stretched, and glanced down at the messy state of the bed. The comforter stretched across the bed at a haphazard angle, and the top sheet was missing. He grinned.</p><p>The conversation with Charles hadn\u2019t gone exactly as he hoped, but it had been about what he\u2019d expected. He\u2019d confessed he had feelings for Alice, and that she knew what he was. What they were. And after Charles got over his shock, Noah told him the plan.</p><p>The Council could be harsh in enforcing their will, but they weren\u2019t unreasonable. If anything, they were logical to a fault. And if Noah approached them with an offer to bond Alice, to make her one of them, they would give them the time to build the relationship before he would have to turn her and make her his. He would be permitted to be with Alice rather than be forced into a marriage with a stranger.</p><p>Sun shone through the corners of the drapes, lighting the room and filling the shadows. Alice had opened them just enough for him to catch a glimpse of the blue sky beyond. It was going to be a beautiful day.</p><p>Despite his earlier enthusiasm for Alice, Charles hadn\u2019t been totally behind the plan, even with Noah\u2019s reassurance it would work. He\u2019d had to force some confidence with Charles, but he couldn\u2019t risk the other man thinking the plan could fail. Noah needed his support.</p><p>That Alice already knew about vampires had thrown Charles. But Noah made his feeling clear, and then he seemed to understand. In fact, he\u2019d been positively annoying about his understanding. As if he\u2019d known the whole time that Noah felt something far beyond neighborly for Alice.</p><p>Now, he just had to convince her.</p><p>In the dark of night, after they\u2019d made love, he\u2019d been certain he could get her to agree. And he\u2019d been forced to sound even more certain than he felt on the phone to Charles. He couldn\u2019t give his friend any reason to doubt the plan with Alice would work.</p><p>Noah sat up in the bed, but the water shut off before he could get any farther. He grimaced, but a quick glance at the clock revealed it was probably for the best. They didn\u2019t want to miss the morning gathering two days in a row. Or, he assumed, Alice probably wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d mind spending all day in bed with her, several days, in fact. But, he couldn\u2019t ask her to abandon her family right now, not right before the wedding. If he took a quick shower, they wouldn\u2019t be all that late to brunch.</p><p>The bathroom door opened to reveal Alice, fully dressed and styling her damp hair back in a conservative clip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head down there. I have to help Cindy with some wedding stuff,\u201d she said, and he tensed. It wasn\u2019t her words, but the way she stood. She dropped her arms from her hair and crossed them. Her side faced him instead of her whole body. The stance was almost defensive. And her tone held no intimacy, like she spoke to a stranger.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked. She\u2019d seemed fine the night before, happy even. Had she experienced some sort of delayed regret? Had fear hit her when she\u2019d seen his marks in her neck? But with his saliva, there should be only small marks left, and they were surely not enough to shock her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she snapped, and his head whipped back, her tone like a slap to the face.</p><p>\u201cAlice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Noah. I\u2019m sorry if I led you on, but this was never a long-term thing. I think we both knew that going in. And even though I knew about the vampire thing, knowing and experiencing are two very different things.\u201d She kept her gaze firmly affixed to her hands, refusing to look at him, even when he stood.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to find breath, let alone form words. Instead, he gaped at her and tried to wrap his mind around her words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading down for breakfast. I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d And with those final words, she turned on her heel and left. The door clicked shut behind her, and Noah dropped back down to the bed.</p><p>What had just happened? His mind refused to understand her words, her coldness. A knife wrenched in his gut, and he took a deep breath.</p><p>It was happening again. Another woman turning from him because of what he was. Couldn\u2019t Alice see he was more than a vampire? That he was a man who lov\u2014no. He couldn\u2019t think like that, not right now. But he cared for her. How could she drop him like that?</p><p>Forcing a long breath through his nose, he swallowed hard. Maybe he would have been better off if he\u2019d never been turned. If he\u2019d lived out his life like a normal man, working the fields of his father\u2019s farm. He could have had a simple life with a wife and kids. But he\u2019d gone to town on that fateful day. Fought a man to satisfy the entertainment and gambling needs of other men. Shown how tough he was\u2014even for a human. And then the simple life had been wrenched from him.</p><p>He shook his head. Kane might have stolen his life that day, but he\u2019d been offered a choice. He just hadn\u2019t realized the extent that choice would really change the course of his fate.</p><p>But he had a choice now, didn\u2019t he?</p><p>No, this wasn\u2019t going to happen. He had to talk to her. Find out what had changed. Fucking fix it.</p><p>He dressed quickly and headed for the nook where her family had met up to eat breakfast every day. Alice sat with a plate of fruit. He stopped and stared. She joked and chatted with Cindy, who sat across from her. Could she be as cool as she acted, with everything that happened between them?</p><p>\u201cHello, Noah,\u201d Edna said. He gave her a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cAlice, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Alice opened her mouth as if she would argue, but then glanced around, taking in their audience. \u201cSure,\u201d she said brightly, and for the first time since he\u2019d met her, he saw her lie to him. Her cavalier attitude was forced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The spark of hope elicited by that thought was almost painful.</p><p>They walked a short distance away from her family\u2019s curious eyes. And when they found a semi-private spot, she stopped and crossed her arms, her stare as sharp as a knife.</p><p>\u201cTell me what the hell is happening,\u201d he said without preamble.</p> <p>\u201cI told you, this was just a bit of fun, and now it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. This wasn\u2019t just a bit of fun and it\u2019s not over.\u201d He wanted to shake her, make her listen to him. \u201cCome on, Alice. Be honest with me. Did the bite freak you out? We don\u2019t ever have to do that again if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2014\u201d his voice cracked with emotion and he swallowed hard, staring into her eyes. Trying to convince her with his own to talk to him.</p><p>Her eyes widened a bit at that, but her tone didn\u2019t soften. \u201cNo.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cFine. I\u2019m not a good liar, anyway. You want to know the truth? I overheard your phone call. It\u2019s pretty damn obvious what you wanted from me. And you\u2019re not getting it.\u201d</p><p>He reached out to touch her but she stepped back, out of his reach.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cFunny thing is, if you\u2019d asked me, I probably would have helped you with your situation. But no. You lied to me. You acted like you didn\u2019t want to use me for your own gain, but that\u2019s exactly what you were after. Just like Brent.\u201d</p> <p>He gaped at her. If she\u2019d overheard his conversation with Charles, he could see why she\u2019d be upset. But she didn\u2019t understand. Yes, he\u2019d intended to use her to get out of the vampire bonding but\u2014shit. Did it matter to her that he was only willing to do that because he cared about her? That he hadn\u2019t intended to use her? Maybe the difference wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>Her eyes, bright with unshed tears, stared back at him, hard for all the emotion they revealed.</p><p>He finally found his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to dismiss everything that happened between us over a half-heard conversation?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at that, and emotions warred on her face. \u201cDo you deny you were going to use me to get out of some sort of arranged marriage?\u201d</p><p>The lie was on the tip of his tongue. All it would take was spitting it out. Weaving a plausible tale. He could tell her the truth later, after he showed her how much he cared about her. And unlike Alice, he was a damned good liar. But the words wouldn\u2019t come out, and her face hardened as the silence drew out longer.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t lie to her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a high, angry sound. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d She took a haggard breath. \u201cStay away from me for the rest of this trip, Noah. We\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>With that, she turned to go back to the table. He reached out and grabbed her arm to stop her. But when her angry eyes turned back to him, he couldn\u2019t find any words to explain, to make things right.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d She pulled out of his grip and strode back toward the table.</p><p>A heavy weight slammed into his chest. He\u2019d fucked it all up. The right words still out of his grasp, he watched her walk away.</p><p>He wandered the ship for a while, the whole place pressing against him. The garishly colored walls closed in, trapping him. How had things gone so wrong so quickly?</p><p>What should he have said? That he cared about her? She knew that, she had to. That he wanted to spend eternity convincing her how much he cared?</p><p>Did he?</p> <p>Vampires weren\u2019t guaranteed eternity, but it was damn near close enough, especially now that the faction wars had dimmed to almost nothing. Certainly, they could be killed by someone taking their heads, or by starving themselves and remaining in sunlight for a long enough period, but such things were rare. They lived in peace, policing themselves and protecting humans from the occasional rogue.</p><p>Committing to Alice wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean eternity; vampires could dissolve their bondings, after all, even though such a thing was rare. But by saying he was willing to bond her, he had to go in fully committed. Alice deserved no less.</p><p>He made his way back to the cabin they shared without even realizing where he headed until he walked through the door. The smell hit him first\u2014her scent. Sweet, heady, and full of newly-made memories.</p><p>The sun was bright and oppressive, but he yanked the door open and stepped out onto the balcony anyway. He inhaled a deep breath of the humid, salty air, and tried to force out her scent.</p><p>She\u2019d let him go so easily, and his chest ached at that thought. Instead of demanding explanations, having some sort of faith that he cared for her, she\u2019d pushed him away at the first sign he wasn\u2019t forthcoming about everything. If she\u2019d really cared, she wouldn\u2019t have pushed him away.</p><p>Except\u2014she did care. He knew she did. He could feel it every time her warm brown eyes met his. She\u2019d just been hurt before\u2014badly.</p><p>By another man who wanted to use her.</p><p>Never before had he wanted to tear a man\u2019s head off so much as he wanted Brent\u2019s.</p><p>But was that reason enough to commit to her? The idea of being with Alice forever wasn\u2019t the fearful thing it might have once been to him. Because he couldn\u2019t envision a future without her bright smile and bigger than life personality. Yes. He could make that commitment to her.</p><p>He ran his hand over his hair and then leaned against the railing. But for it to work, she had to be willing to take the leap with him. With how easily she\u2019d dropped him\u2014that didn\u2019t seem likely.</p><p>No matter how he tried to sort through his tangled thoughts and emotions to come up with a plan, he couldn\u2019t move beyond the hurt in her eyes, the cold expression on her face.</p><p>He had to get off the damn boat.</p><p>They were docking in Puerto Vallarta for two days before the ship would leave, head back to California. He\u2019d fucked everything up with Alice, and she wasn\u2019t going to listen to him. Maybe they both needed some time to think. Some space.</p><p>He stepped back into the room, then grabbed his bags and stuffed the little blood he still had in it and the rest of his things. He was okay on blood, having drunk freely from Alice the night before. A quick flight home and he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his food supply.</p><p>He shoved thoughts of Alice\u2019s sweet-tasting blood from his mind. She\u2019d made her choice. He wasn\u2019t welcome here anymore.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t leave without saying something. He picked up a casino-provided notepad and stared at the small square of white paper, blank except for the cruise line\u2019s contact information and slogan in one corner.</p><p>He stared at the paper for several minutes, his mind wrestling with his options. An angry accusation, a poem, a clever turn of phrase that would bring a smile to her face\u2014remind her of better times? A long explanation of why he\u2019d kept the whole truth from her?</p><p>Finally, he wrote a few short words and then folded the paper. He leaned over her pillow and inhaled her scent. His stomach wrenched at the thought of never seeing her again. Or worse, seeing her with a new bride on his arm. He set the note on her pillow.</p><p>A half-smile on his face, he took out the small glass-blown figurine he\u2019d bought for her. It was a silly thing, something he wasn\u2019t even entirely sure he\u2019d bought for Alice, or just to remind himself of her.</p><p>The glass-blown sun sparkled in the sunlight that peeked in from the half shut curtains, pretty and bright and full of life\u2014despite its inanimate nature. Alice should have it. He set it on the pillow next to the note.</p><p>Noah left the ship, pulling down his sunglasses to avoid the glare of the sun. He took a cab to a hotel near the cruise ship\u2019s port and checked into a room. His cash was running low, so he used a credit card. Staying hidden didn\u2019t matter much anymore. The Council had ruled. Alice had kicked him out.</p><p>Heading home and marrying some stranger was his unavoidable fate.</p><p>The hotel room door clicked shut behind him and he tossed his bag onto the lone chair in the room. Covered in colors even more garish than the ones that adorned the interior of the cruise ship, the room was depressing in its attempt at fake cheer. And it smelled faintly of cigarettes and sun tan oil, although neither scent was heavy enough to be picked up by a human nose.</p><p>Blinking against the sun, he closed the heavy drapes in the room. The near darkness was good for him, almost comforting, and he pushed down a sudden urge to tear down the curtains. He didn\u2019t want to be comforted. Not right now, when the pain was so raw and real and he wasn\u2019t entirely certain he deserved comfort.</p><p>He called down to the front desk and asked them to book him a flight out of Puerto Vallarta as soon as possible. They called back quickly and said he was booked on a flight departing the next morning. Then he stared at nothing, and tried to think of anything but Alice. But her eyes, her smile, the bright reflection of the sun off her hair dogged him.</p><p>The ring of his cell phone brought him out of his daze.</p><p>\u201cHello, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d Alex acknowledged. \u201cI spoke with Charles this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan\u2019s off,\u201d Noah said, hating the catch in his voice.</p><p>Alex paused, as if waiting for an explanation, but Noah couldn\u2019t give him one. Not when emotion churned in his gut. If he opened up enough to let even a bit of it out, he\u2019d be overrun with pain. Regret.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Alex said, finally. \u201cI just wanted to give you a head\u2019s up. Kane spoke of heading your direction to check out the plan you offered up to Charles last night. Wanted to let you know in case we couldn\u2019t talk him out of it.\u201d</p><p>To check out the plan\u2014more like to check up on Alice. \u201cWell, like I said, plan\u2019s off. I\u2019m flying back to California tomorrow. Tell Kane he doesn\u2019t have to come get me.\u201d</p><p>Alex paused, and the discomfort on his end of the line was palpable. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Another pause. \u201cI\u2019ll be around if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Noah said, and his throat tightened around the word. He was thankful Alex had called, not Charles. Charles would have pressed him for information; Alex knew to let things lie.</p><p>Alex hung up without saying goodbye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah stared at his phone. Less than three minutes after he\u2019d hung up with Alex, it rang. Noah winced at the noise. Charles\u2019s name lit up the screen, just as he\u2019d known it would. Taking a shaky breath, he turned off the phone. Talking to Charles wasn\u2019t something he could handle yet.</p><p>It\u2019s for the best. She can live in the sun.</p><p>It was for the best.</p> <p>She\u2019d expected the day to pass quickly, they were so busy. But it didn\u2019t. The day moved as if coated in molasses. She pointedly ignored the questioning looks her family shot her after Noah\u2019s abrupt departure at the breakfast table. And she shook her head when her sister took her aside and asked her what was going on.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t talk about it. If she talked about it, she\u2019d never be able to pull herself together in time for the wedding the next morning.</p><p>So, like a zombie, she went through the motions. Helping Cindy with the final touches in the banquet room. Double checking that the food and cake was in order. Making sure the reverend was ready. And then there was the rehearsal.</p><p>She met Brent at the aisle\u2019s edge, and avoided his gaze as she took his arm. She couldn\u2019t look at him, he knew her too well. One look at the sadness in her eyes and he would know near enough what had happened. And if she saw the triumph that followed that knowledge, she just might deck him.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Brent murmured.</p> <p>Dammit. She was worse at hiding her expression than she\u2019d feared. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said stiffly, keeping her eyes firmly affixed at anything else. Anyone who wasn\u2019t Brent. And her gaze met Kristen\u2019s, where she sat on the groom\u2019s side of the aisle. Her former friend watched them, nervously chewing on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>It was then, walking arm in arm with Brent down the aisle that would be so beautifully decorated the next day, it hit her. A flash of a thought was all it was. Would Noah be jealous, seeing her walking with Brent? And she realized he wouldn\u2019t even get the chance to be. She hadn\u2019t seen him since she\u2019d left the cabin that morning. Would he avoid her for the rest of the cruise? He might skip the wedding, but the ship wasn\u2019t that big. And vampires still needed sleep\u2014she\u2019d seen Noah sleep after they\u2019re jaunt on the beach in Cabo.</p><p>But after...</p><p>There would be no more seeing Noah after this trip ended. No more pestering him until he finally smiled for her. No more glimpses of the intense personality behind the detached mask he usually donned. No more feverish kisses.</p><p>She kept an eye out for him, heart twisting every time she caught sight of a tall man with dark hair. But he didn\u2019t appear. Not even at dinner.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Cindy asked her quietly as they sat down for dinner in one of the cruise ship\u2019s restaurants.</p> <p>\u201cLater,\u201d Alice promised, and Cindy frowned. \u201cI...I can\u2019t talk about it right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cindy leaned over and gave Alice a half hug and swift kiss on the cheek. \u201cAll right. You know where to find me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>They ate in near silence, and Alice barely tasted the food they put in front of her. Noah had lied to her. She shouldn\u2019t feel bad. He was the one who messed it all up, tried to use her.</p><p>Her hand ached from how hard she gripped her fork, and she set it down carefully. Then she touched the spot on her neck where he\u2019d bitten her. The marks were gone already. When she\u2019d seen her blemish-free skin in the mirror before dinner, she\u2019d almost cried. It was like every bit of proof they\u2019d been together was disappearing.</p><p>Someone touched her shoulder and she looked up, half hoping, half dreading, seeing Noah behind her. But when her eyes met Brent\u2019s, she swallowed down the tears trying to rake their way out of her throat.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you for a sec?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>She shrugged. Why not? A conversation with Brent was just the thing she needed to make this the best day ever.</p><p>She glanced around the table as she pushed up from her chair, noticing for the first time that everyone seemed to have donned nice clothing, where she still wore the casual outfit she\u2019d worn all day. She should have felt embarrassed, but she couldn\u2019t summon the energy to care. She\u2019d been avoiding going back to the room.</p> <p>Not only was Noah missing from the gathering, Kristen was as well. The churning in her stomach kicked up a notch.</p><p>Once they\u2019d left the restaurant behind, she stopped. \u201cThis is far enough.\u201d</p><p>Brent frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s this balcony where we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll say what you have to say here, or you won\u2019t say it at all, Brent.\u201d Thank God. The tremors that Noah had put into her voice were absent now. Her words came out confident and without emotion.</p><p>Brent shot a quick glance over his shoulder. \u201cAll right.\u201d He stepped forward, a little too close, and she almost took a step back. But she stopped herself. She wouldn\u2019t back down from Brent unless she had to. She might not be able to face Noah yet, but she could damn sure face down Brent.</p><p>\u201cI need to apologize to you.\u201d</p><p>She managed to not roll her eyes at him. Just barely. \u201cReally? More apologies? You apologized while we danced. You\u2019re sorry. I get it. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d And she\u2019d had enough hollow apologies this week to last her a lifetime.</p><p>He winced as if she\u2019d hit him. \u201cNo, Alice. You don\u2019t understand. I really am sorry.\u201d His gaze caught hers, and she had to fight again to stand her ground.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she managed. \u201cApology accepted. Can we all get on with our lives now?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. I\u2014do you think there\u2019s any chance we could start over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Like as a couple? No,\u201d she said without hesitation, not even bothering to try to hide the disgust in her voice.</p><p>He gaped at her. \u201cNo? That\u2019s it? After all we\u2019ve gone through? All the time we loved each other? And you won\u2019t even give it a second of consideration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no we, Brent. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>He looked shocked, and she realized that maybe he had a right to be. What would she have said if he\u2019d made the offer a few months before? If he\u2019d seemed so truthful in his apology after she\u2019d caught them, right after her world as she knew it had imploded?</p><p>She might have bought it. And that realization hit her with a chill, like he\u2019d tossed ice water on her instead of apologizing so fervently.</p><p>Was Noah the difference? Had she traded caring about one jerk for another? No. Her eyes had opened up to the reality of Brent sometime in the last year, but the vampire didn\u2019t spur the change. He just gave her something to compare Brent to. Someone who highlighted exactly how much of an asshole Brent really was, no matter how well he hid it behind his slick exterior.</p><p>Someone so unlike Brent that she couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d ever compared them.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Brent didn\u2019t care about her\u2014she could see now he genuinely thought he did. Probably as much as he could, which was about a tenth as much as he cared about himself. But Brent was shallow in his affection. Not like Noah.</p><p>Noah had made a mistake. But who was she to not even allow him to explain himself? Not a perfect person, that was for sure. Yes, he\u2019d kept something from her. But he should have at least had the chance to explain.</p><p>Her heart cried out that she\u2019d made a mistake, and Brent watched her with fascination, hope pushing a half-smile to his face.</p><p>He reached out and slid his fingertips down her cheek softly, and then bent his head to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, Brent,\u201d she said in a rush of breath that stopped his descent. She stepped back then, and relief spread through her body at the distance it created. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve another chance with me, and I used to think you and Kristen deserved each other. Now I\u2019m not so sure\u2014maybe she\u2019s too good for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you\u2019re right about that,\u201d a clear voice said from behind her. Alice spun just in time to watch Kristen stalk away. Brent started after her before spinning around, his gaze resting on Alice\u2019s face for a second.</p><p>Disgust was the only thing he\u2019d see there. And he must have figured that out, because he frowned, and then turned and yelled for Kristen.</p><p>Reliable Brent. Always willing to settle for his second choice when the first fell through. She\u2019d have felt a bit flattered maybe, if she hadn\u2019t known it was the size of her inheritance that made her Brent\u2019s first choice. And maybe some affection he had for her, too. But her bank account had always drawn him more than she had.</p><p>Alice took a shaky breath.</p><p>Noah had done a shitty thing by not telling her his situation, and she wasn\u2019t entirely sure she could forgive his desire to use her. But, she\u2019d made a mistake too by not giving him the chance to explain. By immediately thinking he was a user like Brent. Not after her family\u2019s money, but after something even more valuable. Her heart.</p><p>But what if he wasn\u2019t a user?</p><p>Hope surged through her as she walked briskly to her cabin. Maybe Noah wouldn\u2019t have a good explanation, but maybe he would. And just the chance of that being the case made her almost painfully hopeful.</p><p>She opened the door to the suite and started at the darkness. Okay, Noah liked it dark, vampire and all. Maybe he hadn\u2019t wandered off to drown his sorrows at the bar or in a game at the casino. She clicked on the light, and something struck her as wrong about the room.</p><p>When she stuck her head into the bathroom, it hit her. His stuff was gone. His bags. His fake toiletries from under the sink. All of it, gone. Even the empty shampoo bottle.</p><p>Tears burning her eyes, she walked out to the main room. A piece of paper sat folded on her pillow. And something else.</p><p>She touched the glass-blown sun softly. It was so pretty. Bright and swirling with a rainbow of colors. Had he bought it for her?</p><p>Read the note. She knew she had to, but her hand stilled over it. What if it held mean, nasty words that would forever scar her? What if it said he\u2019d never felt anything for her, that the whole thing had been a farce?</p><p>No. Noah wouldn\u2019t do that. She wasn\u2019t that bad of a judge of character, she couldn\u2019t be. And every cell in her body screamed Noah was\u2014despite his omission\u2014a good man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With trembling hands, she picked up the paper, and then sat down on the bed gingerly. Forcing herself to breathe deeply, she opened the note.</p><p>It fluttered to the ground as she finally gave in to the tears that had pressed at her eyelids all day, clutching her hands to her chest. A few simple words, and they echoed in her mind.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry.</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Noah awoke to a small bit of sunshine streaming through a crack in the curtains, confused at the unfamiliar sight of the room around him. Confusion gave way to memory, and his chest tightened.</p><p>Alice had ended it. He\u2019d kept the truth of his situation from her, and she never wanted to see him again. She\u2019d compared him to Brent.</p><p>For a few minutes, he just laid on the bed, as if the weight on his chest wouldn\u2019t allow him to move. Alice\u2019s blood. God, he couldn\u2019t imagine never tasting it again. Never making love to her again. Never watching her laugh. How could she leave him like that? How was he supposed to return to his old life after tasting the possibility of a life with Alice?</p><p>Realization hit him, and he sat up on the bed. He didn\u2019t want to live without her. Because he loved her.</p> <p>He loved Alice.</p><p>When had he fallen for her? It was almost too fast. Or was it?</p><p>They\u2019d known each other for years, though their relationship had been casual. But he could still remember the first time they\u2019d met, and the lasting impression she\u2019d made on him. He\u2019d made an effort to see her whenever possible after that. Hell, he\u2019d never gone to a neighborhood gathering before meeting her. And after? He hadn\u2019t missed a single one.</p><p>While that had been more of a crush than anything, the chance to spend a week with her on the boat had made his feelings shift dramatically. Because every fantasy he\u2019d ever had about her or any other woman, she had fulfilled. They were opposites in many ways, but they meshed so perfectly in the ways that mattered.</p><p>And he had to tell her that.</p><p>Noah dressed quickly, trying to force down the hope surging through him. Just because he\u2019d come to understand his own feelings, didn\u2019t mean they\u2019d make one bit of difference to her. But he had to tell her. At least he could say he was\u2014finally\u2014being entirely honest with her.</p> <p>Bag in hand, he opened the hotel room door. Then stared at the man behind it.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to invite me in, Noah?\u201d Kane asked, voice harsh. When Noah didn\u2019t reply, Kane pushed past him. \u201cLuckily for me, you don\u2019t have to invite me into a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>Noah let the door shut and then turned around to face the man who had been a father to him for so long that he could scarcely remember a time when he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t really look old enough to be Noah\u2019s father, although he had been older when he was changed\u2014early forties to Noah\u2019s thirty years. And his Japanese descent would have given him away as not being a relative regardless of his age.</p><p>\u201cPlease, come in, Kanehito.\u201d He didn\u2019t have time for this. But one didn\u2019t just walk away from a vampire Kane\u2019s age without permission. And that he was Noah\u2019s blood father\u2014his creator\u2014made that even truer.</p><p>\u201cI am surprised to find you here, not on the boat with your woman.\u201d</p><p>Kane may have lost any trace of an accent centuries before, but he wasn\u2019t entirely modern in his speech or his way of thinking. Noah had often wondered, especially after Kane first changed him, what the man\u2019s background had been while he was still a human. He\u2019d almost had to have been some sort of warrior, and once Noah had pictured him as an old samurai, fully garbed in Edo period armor, he\u2019d never shaken the image.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d ever ask Kane. The man wasn\u2019t much of a talker, and that went doubly for talking about himself.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak clearly.\u201d</p><p>Noah flushed, annoyed the man could still make him feel like a child\u2014two centuries after he\u2019d become a vampire. \u201cShe found out about the wedding. She left me. But I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you no longer have a basis to postpone the bonding? Good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is good. We\u2019ll return to California immediately\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Noah yelled. Getting a word in edgewise with Kane hadn\u2019t become any easier in the decades since he\u2019d seen the man. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you. I\u2019m going back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d Kane said, raising his own voice. His jaw twitched and he eyed Noah like he\u2019d never seen him before. \u201cThis is not a discussion. I thought that after a century on your own, you would have matured, but I see this is not the case.\u201d</p><p>Noah took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m not going with you. There\u2019s something I have to do first.\u201d</p><p>Another twitch of Kane\u2019s jaw muscle, and Noah almost thought he was trying not to smile. That was wishful thinking though. Kane never smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou have a duty to fulfill. You\u2019re coming with me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Noah tossed his bag to the ground. \u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>Kane came at him so fast that his fist connected with Noah\u2019s cheek before he even noticed his mentor moving. But he reacted immediately, stepping back out of the way of the next hit before it could land.</p><p>Kane hadn\u2019t changed at all.</p><p>Noah ducked another punch, the air moving against his skin as the swing went wide.</p><p>Kane kicked, connecting with Noah\u2019s stomach with his knee. Pain radiated from the strike point. Noah half stepped, half fell, back, ducking the next punch.</p><p>\u201cToo slow, my son,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>What felt like a baseball bat\u2014but what was no doubt Kane\u2019s fist\u2014slammed into the back of Noah\u2019s head while he was still ducking a punch. He fell to his hands and knees. The room spun, and he shook his head to clear the fog filling his vision.</p><p>Kane backed up a couple of steps, his body still defensively turned to the side, and his arms still up. But it was clear that he considered the matter settled.</p><p>Noah touched the back of his skull. Wet. He\u2019d have been better off being hit with a crowbar.</p><p>He had to focus. Distraction during a fight would get you killed. Kane had taught him that, back when vampire factions still warred among themselves. A clear mind left more room for reaction to the fight itself. But his mind wouldn\u2019t clear, even while facing down his blood father.</p><p>Alice.</p><p>Her face. Her laugh. The look in her eyes when she studied him. She was there with him. In his mind and in his heart. He couldn\u2019t let her go without a fight. He had to talk to her. And no one\u2014not even one of the toughest sons of bitches in the world\u2014was going to stop him.</p><p>He leaped at Kane. Pain shot through his shoulder as he connected. The man was as hard as a damn rock, and while he was a couple of inches shorter than Noah\u2019s six-foot-two, he had to have twenty pounds on Noah, and every bit of it muscle. Not that physical appearance necessarily mattered with vampires. Some simply had more strength and speed due to bloodlines, while others inherited different abilities. But he knew from experience that Kane was very, very strong.</p><p>Kane stumbled back a step, but it was enough. Noah swung and connected with the other vampire\u2019s solar plexus to knock him off balance, then shoved him with all of his strength and desperation.</p><p>Kane flew through the hotel room wall, missing the window by less than a foot.</p><p>The third floor. He\u2019d just sent his blood father through the wall of a third story hotel room. Quickly calculating in his head, he figured that gave him about a thirty second head start. Maybe a minute, with the sunlight raining down, given Kane\u2019s age.</p><p>He had to get to Alice. Talk to her. Convince her somehow that he really did love her. Because if Kane caught him, he\u2019d never get another chance. He\u2019d gotten a lucky shot in, but he wasn\u2019t fool enough to believe he\u2019d beat Kane the next time.</p><p>Noah ran.</p><p>Alice tugged on the curling iron, and her sister\u2019s hair fell into a perfect twisted curl. Surrounded by the smells of makeup and perfume and hairspray, Alice\u2019s mood had lightened somewhat. She\u2019d spent the night alternatively calling Noah and crying, wishing she\u2019d done things differently and trying to sleep. Thank God for makeup, because every one of those fitful minutes had shown on her face this morning.</p><p>\u201cThanks for fixing that. I swear, doesn\u2019t matter how much hair spray I use, curls always fall out. And I think the hairdresser must have used a gallon,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>Alice nodded and murmured appropriate noises as her sister continued to talk about her hair and dress and big day. It was nerves, and Cindy had every right to burn away some of her stress by prattling at her maid of honor on her wedding day, less than fifteen minutes before her actual wedding. But Alice, for the life of her, couldn\u2019t keep her mind on the wedding.</p><p>It was seriously selfish, she knew that. And guilt only added fuel to her worry. She couldn\u2019t seem to keep her mind from wandering to Noah. What was he doing now? Where was he? Was he thinking about her?</p><p>Worse, was he actually going through with the arranged marriage she\u2019d heard him whisper about?</p><p>She\u2019d called him, multiple times the night before. And she feared her voicemails nudged toward the double digits. But he never answered. The calls always went immediately to voicemail.</p><p>Maybe his phone was off? Would he have called her back if it wasn\u2019t? She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201c...and then I decided we should have hippopotamuses for flower girls. And at the reception, we\u2019ll all wear purple, spandex one piece pantsuits that are cut low enough to show lots of cleavage and chest hair. If anyone refuses, we can shoot them,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>Alice stared at her sister. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpandex. It\u2019s an underrated material.\u201d Cindy laughed. \u201cSorry, couldn\u2019t help messing with you, even in your sad state.\u201d</p><p>Alice sat in the chair across from Cindy and put her face in her hands. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Careful not to smudge your makeup.\u201d</p><p>Alice moved her hands to her lap and stared at her sister, misery rolling through her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. This is your day. I\u2019m such a jerk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a jerk. You\u2019re sad, and it\u2019s understandable. Or, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s understandable since you won\u2019t talk to me about it. I\u2019m a pretty awesome person, so I\u2019m giving you the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>Alice groaned. \u201cThanks for trying, but I think my mood is beyond repair right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got,\u201d Cindy glanced at the clock hanging over the dresser, \u201cfifteen minutes. Talk to me. It\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is your day,\u201d Alice insisted.</p><p>\u201cSpill!\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and glared at her sister. \u201cFine, but if my makeup runs off my face, I\u2019ll hold you accountable.\u201d</p><p>Cindy grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll be five minutes late to fix your raccoon face if we have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI overheard Noah on the phone. I\u2014don\u2019t know all the details, but the gist of it is that he was planning on using our relationship to get out of some sort of vampire arranged marriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArranged marriage?\u201d Cindy\u2019s nose scrunched. \u201cHow old fashioned of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied to me. Not once did he mention this marriage thing.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI flipped out at the idea of someone being with me to...to use me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah isn\u2019t Brent, Alice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d She blinked back tears and nodded gratefully when Cindy offered her a tissue. \u201cBut I was so upset, and he didn\u2019t deny I\u2019d heard him correctly. So I broke things off. And when I got back to the room last night, he was already gone. I think he\u2019s left the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good riddance. Bastard was just trying to use you, anyway.\u201d Cindy tossed a free curl over her shoulder dramatically. Not an easy feat with the veil attached to her head.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that! Or, at least, I don\u2019t know for sure that it was. I didn\u2019t even give him a chance to explain the situation.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t she? She was too stubborn, that\u2019s why.</p> <p>\u201cExplain, shmexplain.\u201d Cindy waved her hand in the air dismissively. \u201cWhat excuse could he possibly have? You\u2019re better off without the jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a jerk. And I\u2019m not better off without him. I lo\u2014\u201d Alice clapped her hand over her mouth and her sister jumped up, a huge smile on her face. Crap. She loved him. She\u2019d let herself fall in love with her neighbor. Her vampire neighbor. Within the space of a few days at sea. What the heck was wrong with her? And what was she supposed to do about that?</p><p>\u201cI knew it! I knew you were totally falling for him.\u201d Cindy laughed and tugged at Alice\u2019s arm. \u201cHoney, things will work out. I just wanted you to realize how you felt. The rest of us\u2014well, it\u2019s been on your faces since you two slept together\u2014a fact that was totally obvious by the way, Miss Googly-Eyes. Even if neither of you realized it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014faces?\u201d she asked, putting emphasis on the plurality of the word.</p><p>Cindy sat back down, her eyes bright with unshed tears. \u201cOh, he\u2019s just as smitten with you as you are with him. I know things will work out for you. Don\u2019t fret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Cindy. He was going back to get married. And he won\u2019t answer my phone calls. And\u2014\u201d Her voice broke, and she swallowed hard. She couldn\u2019t cry. They had less than five minutes before they had to walk down the aisle. Making Cindy late to her wedding would only compound her guilt.</p><p>\u201cTry him again before we go.\u201d</p><p>Alice shot a nervous glance at the clock, but hit Noah\u2019s name on her cell phone. Again, right to voicemail. She almost hung up, but steeled her spine instead. She could live with failing to get him back\u2014maybe. But only if she knew she\u2019d tried her best. Anything less and she\u2019d always feel regret.</p> <p>\u201cNoah, it\u2019s me again\u2014Alice. I really need to talk to you. Please call me before you do anything drastic.\u201d I love you. The words teetered on the edge of her tongue, but she couldn\u2019t confess her love on his voicemail for goodness\u2019 sake. She hung up before the temptation overran her good sense.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we\u2019d better get you out there before Mom comes looking for us,\u201d Alice said. She set the phone down on the dresser, but the temptation to carry it with her was fierce. No. That would be crossing a line. What would she do if he called her back? Answer it during the ceremony? Not likely.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve left him messages. There\u2019s nothing else I can do about him right now.\u201d She forced a smile onto her face and looked at Cindy, really looked at her. Reaching out, she slid her fingertips over the veil. \u201cYou\u2019re such a beautiful bride.\u201d</p><p>Cindy smiled back, and fanned away tears of her own. \u201cThanks, sis. Now let\u2019s go do this before Robert decides we\u2019ve taken off with some cabana boys.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t bother with a cab. The cruise ship dock wasn\u2019t far, and it was nearly ten o\u2019clock, so the ship should have redocked for the day. It was the second, and final, day it would dock in Puerto Vallarta. Then it would be gone. And for all intents and purposes, Alice would be lost to him. He couldn\u2019t evade Kane for days, not with how intent the man was to bring him back. The sun beat down on him, and by the time he got to the ship, a headache threatened and he was faintly nauseous.</p><p>He boarded quickly. No one waited to get on the ship this time of day. They were all leaving to enjoy the city. Kane had yet to appear, but he was out there, and Noah had no doubt he would show up eventually.</p><p>He stepped aboard, and a warm feeling washed over him. He\u2019d never thought he\u2019d miss this garish place that buzzed with people and activity. But this is where he\u2019d gotten to know Alice. Sang karaoke with her. Made love to her. Fallen in love with her.</p><p>Noah knocked when he reached the room he\u2019d shared with Alice. The dial in the cabin door had been turned to \u201cDo Not Disturb,\u201d and no sound greeted him. He used the key card he\u2019d forgotten about in his wallet to enter the room. Empty. The smell of her inundated the air, fruity and fresh like her shampoo, but beneath that, the simple scent of her.</p><p>But some things were off about the room. Different. She hadn\u2019t made the bed\u2014a first since they\u2019d left California. She\u2019d even remade it one day after he made it, all sneaky-like after he\u2019d gone to take a shower.</p><p>But today the comforter and sheets were twisted together, and one of the pillows was in the middle of the bed. She\u2019d set the sun sculpture he\u2019d left for her on the nightstand. And the note...</p><p>His gaze swept the room, and finally found the note. It had been crumpled up into a tight little ball, and was wrinkled so badly he wondered if she\u2019d actually crinkled and smoothed it repeatedly. It was on the small table that sat in front of the couch he\u2019d slept on when they first arrived on the ship. His hands fisted at his sides.</p><p>Despite her coolness when they\u2019d spoken, she cared. She cared a lot, given the state of the room and the note. He picked up her pillow and took a deep breath, inhaling the smells lingering on the material.</p><p>Hope warred with guilt and self-hatred at the salty scent. She\u2019d cried on the pillow. God, he was a bastard. He\u2019d made her cry.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>He walked through the ship, feeling more and more agitated as he went. How could he hope to find her soon enough with Kane on his tail? He\u2019d hoped to at least run into a familiar face, a wedding guest who might know where she was, but saw no one he recognized. A cruise ship worker caught his eye. Of course. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of asking an employee sooner?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a guest. Alice Shepard. Can you page her for me, or tell me where she is?\u201d Noah said.</p><p>The young man looked puzzled for a moment, then understanding smoothed his features. \u201cThe wedding party, right? The Strub, Shepard wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s with that group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe they\u2019ve booked The Oasis Room, sir. But\u2014\u201d The man stopped as Noah strode past him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Noah told the man over his shoulder.</p><p>Thank God. She was still on board. And he could talk to her. Tell her how he felt. He recognized the room name, they\u2019d walked past it a couple of times headed to different dining areas. Ducking in and pulling Alice out to talk to him might be tough if she was still as angry as she\u2019d been the day before, but she wouldn\u2019t want to cause a scene. She\u2019d go with him. He\u2019d tell her he loved her, and make sure she understood how sorry he was. That was the best he could do.</p><p>And hopefully he could do it before Kane caught up with him.</p><p>The ship would slow him down. The vampire didn\u2019t have a ticket\u2014not that such a simple thing would stop him. But maybe, just maybe, it would slow him down enough for Noah to get Alice back.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t get her back\u2014no. He couldn\u2019t think like that. He had to stay fucking positive about this.</p><p>The large double doors to The Oasis Room stood closed, and Noah frowned. Had the cruise ship worker gotten the room name wrong? The doors usually stood open when a room was occupied.</p><p>He hesitated. Were they doing the dress rehearsal? No, it didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t have time for this.</p><p>Noah tried the knobs, and to his surprise, they turned easily. He shoved the doors open, but the hum of noise he\u2019d expected didn\u2019t hit him, instead, the scent of orchids touched his nose, and the gaze of over one hundred wedding guests turned to look at him.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>With everything going on, he\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>At the far end of the aisle, Alice stared at him, her mouth open and her eyes wide with shock. Her body was adorned in a beautiful yellow dress that highlighted her golden hair. Mimicking her expression, the rest of the wedding party also stared. As did the man officiating the wedding.</p><p>Fucking hell.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Alice would have never guessed that flustered was an expression Noah had in his arsenal, but interrupting a wedding was apparently an event that threw even the normally cool vampire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs...is there an objection?\u201d the minister asked, looking more than a bit flustered himself. She guessed that wasn\u2019t a question he\u2019d ever had cause to actually ask at a wedding before.</p><p>Cindy looked absolutely elated, an odd expression on a woman whose wedding had just been interrupted, but Noah\u2019s entrance probably struck her as the most romantic thing ever. And Cindy was nothing if not a romantic.</p><p>Alice glanced anxiously at Cindy\u2019s beau. But while Robert appeared a bit surprised at Noah\u2019s entrance, he didn\u2019t look at all angry. To his side, Brent seethed, a deep scowl cutting across features she\u2019d once thought handsome.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Noah\u2019s eyes found hers, and the raw emotion in his expression stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good time,\u201d she whispered loudly enough to carry across the room at him. \u201cTrying to have a wedding, here.\u201d Her heart hurt to say it, but couldn\u2019t he see that this was Cindy\u2019s big moment? And it wasn\u2019t as if she didn\u2019t want to talk to him badly too, but they could wait ten minutes. It was her sister\u2019s wedding, and leaving before it was over to talk to Noah would be beyond selfish.</p><p>And she\u2019d been self-involved enough the last twenty-four hours.</p><p>Noah took a couple of steps forward, releasing the doors. But they\u2019d been pushed far enough that they remained open behind him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really explain why, but I really need to\u2014\u201d Noah stiffened. And a second later a man appeared in the doorway behind him.</p> <p>Asian, he was nearly as tall as Noah, and quite handsome in a scary I-can-kill-you-all-with-my-pinky sort of way. He looked older than Noah, but he had the same wariness in his eyes. Vampire? His head was shaved, but he wore a closely trimmed mustache and goatee. Nonchalantly, he crossed his arms and leaned on the doorframe, his gaze moving over the room. Sand and dirt covered his clothes, as if he\u2019d rolled around in them at the beach.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t look like the kind of man who rolled around anywhere.</p><p>She turned her attention to Noah and really looked at him, beyond the tortured expression that had captured her attention when she\u2019d first seen him. He wasn\u2019t as filthy as the stranger, but if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, he had the beginning of a bruise on his cheek. A mark that, given his vampire heritage, would probably disappear before it ever had the chance to fully form.</p><p>What was going on? Maybe she should step outside with him. Cindy would forgive her, even if she wouldn\u2019t forgive herself if it didn\u2019t really turn out to be as urgent as Noah said. She took a hesitant step toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say your piece right here, dear,\u201d Edna said, standing from her place in the first row to face Noah.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea, Noah. And since it\u2019s my wedding, you\u2019ll do as I say.\u201d Cindy took a step forward and shook her bouquet at him. Alice stifled a giggle at the sight of her sister and her flowery weapon.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Cindy spun around. \u201cYou will keep your mouth shut or I will deck you. I\u2019ve wanted to for a very long time, so don\u2019t you tempt me, Brent.\u201d She slapped her chest with the bouquet, and the flowers rustled. \u201cBride, remember?\u201d</p><p>Brent didn\u2019t open his mouth again.</p><p>Cindy turned back to face the door. \u201cAnd you. No idea who you are, mystery man, but you need to sit down or get out.\u201d</p><p>The man raised an eyebrow at that, but then walked to an empty seat on the bride\u2019s side of the aisle and sat, almost primly. He looked ridiculous, a warrior who was probably hundreds of years old obeying a young bride on a cruise ship built for twentieth-century kicks.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, Noah.\u201d Cindy smoothed her dress and returned to stand by Robert, whose mouth snapped shut and he gazed at his soon-to-be wife with pride glowing in his eyes.</p><p>Alice shot Cindy a glance and her sister gave her an encouraging nod. She took a deep breath and then walked down the aisle and met Noah. Frozen, he stood in the same place he\u2019d stopped just a couple of strides from the door. But his expression was anything but icy.</p> <p>Emotions crossed his features, some so fleeting she couldn\u2019t catch them as he watched her approach. But hope seemed to war with fear most of all.</p><p>Fear of what, she couldn\u2019t be certain. Of the man behind him? She doubted that. Of speaking his piece in front of her family and the rest of the wedding guests? Almost definitely\u2014at least a little bit. Of her reaction to whatever it was he wanted to tell her? Maybe.</p><p>She stopped a couple of feet in front of him, and shifted her weight uncertainly. What if he gave in to the fear and ran?</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. He unclenched his fists from his sides, and took her hand in his. The man behind him watched with interest, but made no move to interfere. And it felt like the whole room held its breath.</p><p>Noah\u2019s dark eyes, stormy with emotion like they had been when he\u2019d looked at her after they made love, met hers, and she lost herself in them. It was as if they were suddenly alone. Only the two of them stood in this room. Only the two of them existed in the whole world. Only the two of them mattered.</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology. I wasn\u2019t entirely honest with you, and I should have been,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook her head. The fault wasn\u2019t his alone. \u201cI should have let you explain.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a small smile and her heart melted. \u201cMaybe we both made mistakes. But, Alice, I needed to tell you that I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d He glanced around, still aware of their audience. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be with you\u2014for any reason\u2014if I didn\u2019t care about you. I know we haven\u2019t been together for that long...\u201d</p><p>If the people around them knew how short of a period of time they\u2019d really been together.</p><p>\u201c...but I love you. Hell, I think I\u2019ve been falling in love with you since I first met you. Do you remember? You came to my house to get me to sign up to donate a tree.\u201d He smiled down at her, but she couldn\u2019t find her voice.</p><p>He loved her? She shook her head. She hadn\u2019t heard much after that. The word thundered through her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou were so forceful, so passionate about some neighborhood thing.\u201d</p><p>The memory he spoke of hit her. \u201cThe park. I wanted everyone to pitch in\u2014donate some time\u2014to build that small park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And you smiled so brightly, with your golden hair...\u201d his eyes grew distant. \u201cYou made me think of sunshine.\u201d</p><p>No wonder he\u2019d gotten her the glass-blown sun. \u201cI remember thinking you were far too handsome for a man living alone. Then you glared at me and I realized why you were single.\u201d Noah raised an eyebrow at that and glared. She laughed at his mock indignation. \u201cBut then...you listened to my spiel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could hardly interrupt.\u201d His eyes never moved from her, but more loudly he added, \u201cHave you tried to interrupt her during a good spiel, Edna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear heavens, no,\u201d her mother said from behind her.</p><p>Traitor. \u201cBut then you signed up. You offered materials. You offered to help. And I...I was still unavailable. But more than a tad smitten.\u201d</p><p>Someone gasped behind her. It sounded like Brent, but she didn\u2019t turn around to look. She couldn\u2019t have cared less.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re available now,\u201d he said, but while he gazed at her with the same confident smile that had always charmed her, uncertainty traced his eyes. And he looked like he was ready for bad news.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>The touch of uncertainty she\u2019d seen in his face disappeared, replaced with a mixture of sadness and anger. His gaze shifted to something behind her, and it suddenly hit her how that must have sounded.</p><p>She took a step forward and placed her hand on his chest. He wasn\u2019t cold, like vampires of legend\u2014he was always so warm. His gaze returned to her, but the worry in his eyes remained.</p><p>Her gut wrenched at the sight of his sadness. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d he sounded a tad breathless.</p><p>She played with the decal on his T-shirt. \u201cOh yes, and he\u2019s quite a hunk, even though he doesn\u2019t seem to know how to dress for formal events.\u201d She looked up and their eyes met, and her breath escaped her too. He really did love her, she could see the love in his eyes. Brent had never looked at her that way, and she\u2019d certainly never felt anything like this rolling of emotion\u2014love and lust, fear and need\u2014with Brent.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m so completely in love with him, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be available again.\u201d</p><p>Any reply he might have made was tabled, because he took her mouth with his. The kiss, so tender it swept her away, made her shake in his arms from the excitement of it all.</p><p>But the sound of applause yanked her back to reality. She pulled her mouth from his and her face flushed with heat. Noah took the applause in stride, and simply laughed and wrapped an arm around her, pulling her close.</p><p>She got on her tiptoes and tugged his head down to whisper in his ear. \u201cMaybe we should finish this talk after the wedding.\u201d</p><p>In response, he kissed her cheek and then released her. He strode to the doors and then shut them with a loud thud. Noah sat next to the man who\u2019d followed him in, and the other man produced what she supposed was his version of a smile. It looked more like a grimace.</p><p>Alice, grinning ear to ear, walked back down the aisle.</p><p>The ceremony continued as if it had never been interrupted. And a very emotional Cindy wed the equally emotional Robert, sending the wedding guests into their second loud applause of the day.</p><p>Noah sat next to Kane as the vows were exchanged, but the other vampire made no attempt to accost or even speak to him. And with his focus on Alice, Noah barely remembered the other vampire was there. Alice\u2019s gaze stayed on Noah. And as the couple spoke their vows, her face took on a tender expression that made him want to drag her off to a corner to kiss her.</p><p>After the ceremony ended, the bride and groom left the room under a shower of confetti, and Noah headed for Alice. Her cheeks were flushed with happiness for her sister, but her gaze stayed locked with Noah\u2019s during the ceremony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A hard grip on his upper arm stopped Noah in his tracks and he turned to face Kane, regretting even the momentary loss of Alice in his sight.</p><p>He braced himself for Kane\u2019s words, but it didn\u2019t matter what the older vampire said, he wasn\u2019t leaving this ship. He wasn\u2019t abandoning Alice. And he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t marry a stranger.</p><p>\u201cThat one will challenge you, but I think you\u2019ll do well together.\u201d Kane nodded in Alice\u2019s direction.</p> <p>Noah blinked at him. He should have guessed that Kane wouldn\u2019t have pushed him to bond a stranger after he saw him with Alice, but he couldn\u2019t be sure. The man hadn\u2019t been around in a century, and they hadn\u2019t exactly chatted about women or much else of a personal nature before he left.</p><p>What to say to that? \u201cI know. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take care of the hotel\u2014fuzzy the minds of the witnesses.\u201d Kane said. \u201cYou\u2019ve chosen well.\u201d</p><p>Noah turned to look at her, unable to help himself. And when he looked back, Kane was gone.</p><p>A soft touch on his shoulder drew his attention away from his vanishing mentor, and he met Alice\u2019s smiling eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWho was that mysterious man?\u201d She raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cThat was my father, Kane.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cOh, wow. Is he still around? I\u2019d love to meet him.\u201d She leaned to look behind him, as if Kane would suddenly reappear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet him someday, I\u2019m sure. I think he didn\u2019t want to intrude on the wedding any more than we already did.\u201d And that was almost definitely true. Kanehito was nothing if not painfully polite in social situations. He hadn\u2019t been invited to the wedding, so he hadn\u2019t stayed. Of course, if he\u2019d still thought Noah needed to go back to California to bond a stranger, he would have. But he\u2019d probably still stand outside, waiting to ambush Noah, rather than interrupt the service.</p><p>The room was emptying. Noah held out his arm and Alice took it, and together they followed the rest of the wedding guests to the room next door where the reception was being held.</p><p>Music already played, and a line formed quickly at the bar. Alice tugged him toward the dance floor.</p> <p>\u201cDance with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go change first.\u201d He glanced down at his T-shirt and jeans. And he couldn\u2019t see it, but he could feel a bit of blood in his hair.</p><p>\u201cAfter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The music was slow and intimate, and they barely moved, holding on to one another and swaying gently. He buried his face in her hair and took a deep breath, happy to have her scent surrounding him again.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he murmured into her hair. It was such a stupid thing to say, they\u2019d only been a part for a day, but it was true.</p><p>She pulled her head back and looked up at him, a smile tugging on her lips. \u201cI\u2019d play this all cool and stuff, but the second you turn on your phone my cover would be ruined anyway. I...may have left you a few voicemails.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and spun her around on the dance floor. \u201cIt was off. I\u2019m sorry. I would have answered...but, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one who took our fight badly.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cI may have been a teeny bit upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want to upset you again,\u201d he said, trying in vain to fight the smile pulling on his lips.</p><p>She arched an eyebrow at him, looking so beautiful and confident, his heart warmed. \u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The music changed and her smile blossomed. It took him a second to realize why. \u201cSalsa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy new favorite dance,\u201d she said, throwing her head back as she assumed a dramatic salsa pose, and her hair sparkled in the light.</p><p>He laughed and took her hand in his. It was his favorite, too. </p> </body></html>"]
