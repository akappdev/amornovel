Trystan offers the woman a crooked smile as he steps away from Brie. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken, although I\u2019ve heard that I\u2019m hotter than Day Jones.\u201d He winks at the reporter before turning toward his locker. Trystan\u2019s mind is reeling a mile a minute. All he could think to do on the fly was to deny the whole thing. There\u2019s no way they can prove he\u2019s Day Jones.</p><p>The reporter is momentarily stunned, but Brie laughs and catches his shoulder. \u201cTrystan! Tell her the truth. Tell her that you\u2019re Day!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not Day Jones.\u201d Trystan is wearing his most charming smile, trying to hide the knots in his stomach, and then he does what he always does when things get unbearable \u2013 he acts his way out. With enough charm and vibrato, no one sees what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not\u2014well, no one but Mari. He scans the hall for her, but she\u2019s not in sight.</p><p>Brie laughs that high pitched giggle that drives him insane as her catlike claws drift up and down his arm. \u201cOh, come on, Trystan. Everyone knows. There\u2019s no reason to be shy about it anymore. Tell the reporter what you told me.\u201d</p><p>He gives Brie a blank look before responding to the reporter. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. It was nice meeting you, but I need to get to class.\u201d Trystan intends to shoulder past the crowd. People are speaking in hushed whispers, trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. About half the group believes him. Good. Tucker catches his eye from across the hall. The teacher\u2019s arms are folded across his round chest while he watches the situation unfold. Just as Trystan starts to leave, Brie catches his elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive him for this. When he wrote that Day Jones song, Trystan swore that he\u2019d never tell anyone about it, but it was for me. See, I have it right here.\u201d Brie holds up a piece of paper and waves it around.</p><p>The reporter takes it and looks down at the sheet. \u201cIs this your handwriting, Mr. Scott?\u201d She tilts the paper so he can see it, but Trystan already recognizes it. It\u2019s the song he wrote for Mari.</p> <p>Brie is beaming and still tethered to his arm. She lets go and steps in front of Trystan, taking the paper and turning it over. \u201cLook at the last line. That\u2019s the original version. He wrote it for me.\u201d Brie is all girlish charm and warm smiles.</p><p>Trystan can see the avalanche of crap hurling toward him but nothing will allow him to side-step it. It\u2019s too late. The paper has damned him. He could deny it, and say Brie\u2019s a lying whore, but what good will that do? They already know. The crowd of students and teachers grows louder. They sense it. The reporter is talking, but her words sound like noise in his ears. A teacher steps up and nods, confirming that the song on the paper is Trystan\u2019s handwriting. Someone shoves a guitar at him, as Trystan stands there unblinking. His mind is caught, reliving the worst parts of his life\u2014and realizing that everyone is going to know. It\u2019s a matter of hours before they dig up the police report from the other night. Trystan shoves the guitar away and shoulders his way through the crowd without looking back.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>I\u2019ve never crashed so hard, so fast, before. Trystan tenses next to me when he sees the people around his locker. Before we even make it to his locker, Trystan is engulfed in the mass of bodies, all of which are brimming with excitement. I stand there for a moment and feel sick for him. Trystan is going to hate this. I wonder how they found him, how they know.</p><p>At that moment, Brie steps between us. She takes Trystan\u2019s arm and pulls him forward. Just before she does it, she looks over at me with a sharp smile. Acid fills my stomach. I don\u2019t know how she figured it out, but she did. I feel my feet sliding backwards, moving away from the crowd. Suddenly, Katie is beside me.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit, Trystan is Day Jones?\u201d She\u2019s smacking gum in her mouth and staring. When I don\u2019t answer, Katie stops chewing and looks over at me. Bright blue eye shadow is painted across her eyelids. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>The mob seems to get sucked down the hallway. It forms a chasm between me and Trystan\u2014a gaping hole is expanding and swallowing him\u2014and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Katie\u2019s eyes are on the side of my face. Her gaze flicks toward Trystan and then back to me. I hate this. It\u2019s as if I can feel his skin crawl even from here. I don\u2019t see Trystan look up for me and there\u2019s no way to get to him. I turn back and duck around the corner with my heart racing like someone is trying to kill me. I\u2019d pull the fire alarm if it would help him, but nothing will help him now. Maybe this was meant to be? Maybe he needs this?</p><p>Katie\u2019s knuckles wrap the top of my skull. \u201cHello? Earth to Mari.\u201d</p><p>Jerking my head out of the way, I manage to avoid getting my brain knocked again. \u201cCut it out, Katie,\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cSo let me get this straight. You were with Trystan this morning before he was ambushed by reporters, doing God-knows-what in the basement.\u201d She ticks off two fingers as she says it, acting like it\u2019s no big deal, even though it is. I know she wants to scream and giggle with me, but we can\u2019t right then because everything is falling apart. So, last night doesn\u2019t matter, not after this. She senses my worry and it makes her mood drop.</p><p>I have my back to the wall and suck in a huge breath. I keep telling myself that this isn\u2019t bad, but it feels horrible. I nod at Katie.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re still stuck on him and now Brie wants him back, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I glance up at her and try to shove away the nauseous feeling that\u2019s making me sweaty. I didn\u2019t think of that. Is that what she\u2019s been doing this whole time? How did I miss it? Jaw hanging open, I manage, \u201cYou think Brie wants him back?\u201d</p> <p>She smirks at me and gives me a look that clearly says I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cYes, for starters she\u2019s a whore and secondly, if Trystan is Day Jones, she\u2019s going to let everyone know that they were together. It\u2019s not like Brie to just be pushed aside, not when something this big happens. Trystan was her first and only long term relationship\u2014well, long term for Brie. Add to the fact that she\u2019s a glory-hog and yeah, there\u2019s no doubt she\u2019s after Trystan.\u201d</p><p>Acid is creeping up my throat and no matter what I do, I can\u2019t calm down. No one knows about Trystan and me, nobody realizes we\u2019re together, and right now he\u2019s not with me\u2014he\u2019s with Brie talking to reporters. I want to slam my head into the lockers, but I don\u2019t. My mind drifts to what things will be like without Trystan. I knew it was coming next year, but I couldn\u2019t picture it until this second. My heart flutters nervously as I realize what it means\u2014no more Trystan to run lines with, no more teasing in the basement, no more friendship, no more anything\u2014Trystan Scott won\u2019t be here, but I will. The hollow space inside my chest fills with dread. I\u2019ll spend the next year waiting to graduate, waiting for college, and trying to manage my craptacular parents without him.</p><p>I shove off the wall and dart down the hallway to the office with Katie on my heels. \u201cWhere are you going? Class is that way.\u201d Katie points behind us, but continues to follow me to the office.</p><p>I shove through the doors and hear the women chattering about Trystan, wondering if their golden boy is really Day Jones. They\u2019re excited for him, I can hear it in their voices.</p><p>\u201cThat kid needed to catch a break,\u201d one woman says. She\u2019s standing next to the humming copy machine, running off worksheets.</p><p>They look up and see me at the counter. The secretary doesn\u2019t get up from her desk. \u201cCan I help you girls?\u201d</p><p>Katie leans her hip against the counter and shrugs as she picks at her black nail polish.</p><p>Nodding, I say, \u201cI\u2019d like an application for early graduation.\u201d The idea has been bouncing around in my head for a while now, but I was too chicken to act on it. It means defying my father, and I didn\u2019t think I had the backbone, but at this moment I do. At this moment the acceptance letter at the bottom of my sock drawer looks like a way to escape and I plan to take it. The only obstacle is the application for early graduation. It was due weeks ago, so I don\u2019t know what the chances are of the school giving me my diploma early, especially since the principal has the final say and the guy is a stickler for the rules. He\u2019ll probably deny me without even looking at my transcript.</p><p>Katie\u2019s jaw drops and she stares at the side of my face. I never told her that this is what I wanted, or that I was even thinking about it. The truth is, leaving her early will suck, but staying here will suck even more. She gapes at me and a wad of gum tumbles out of her mouth. \u201cYou can\u2019t graduate early! Why would you want to do that? Senior year is almost here\u2014it\u2019s time for fun\u2014and you\u2019re going to cut out on me? Who am I supposed to hang out with at senior cut day? What about at lunch? We can finally leave campus. What about prom, Mari?\u201d Katie\u2019s shocked posture says it all\u2014how could you leave me?</p><p>Trying to explain is difficult, but my senior year won\u2019t look like hers because of my parents. \u201cKatie, my senior year is going to be all advanced classes. It\u2019s not going to be fun because my parents won\u2019t let me slack off, so what am I waiting around here for? I could go take the classes at college.\u201d</p><p>The secretary digs through the filing cabinet next to her desk, and then walks over and hands me the paper. She taps at certain parts, including the deadline. \u201cIt\u2019s already passed, honey, but it can\u2019t hurt to try. I\u2019ll add it to the stack if you get it back to me by the end of the day.\u201d She winks at me as she speaks. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s accepted, you walk with this year\u2019s graduating class. You\u2019re cap and gown will cost extra because you\u2019ll be paying for a rush, you can\u2019t get a class ring because it\u2019s too late, and unless you already submitted your college applications I\u2019m not sure who\u2019ll take you this late in the year.\u201d</p><p>Taking the paper, I say, \u201cThank you.\u201d I stand there filling it out with Katie burning holes into my head. After jotting down the reason, I thank the woman, and head out without another word. Katie trails behind me stomping her feet on the floor much louder than normal. She\u2019s mad, I know she is. \u201cI can\u2019t stay. Not after this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why?\u201d She races up to walk next to me just as the bell rings.</p><p>I can\u2019t say it. The words are in my head but I can\u2019t force them out.</p><p>Just as we round the corner, I see the mass of people standing there by Trystan\u2019s locker, but he\u2019s gone. Teachers are telling everyone to get to class. That\u2019s when I see Brie walking toward me. Her books are clutched against her chest and there\u2019s a triumphant smile on her face. As she passes, she says, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without you. Thanks for leaving that song where I could find it, Virgin.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen as she passes. Her words hit me like a steady stream of bricks. That\u2019s why Trystan\u2019s song was on the floor behind the desk. She must have taken a picture of it last night and printed it out. The reason they know Trystan is Day Jones is because of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>He shoves out the front doors of the school thinking that he\u2019s evaded the reporters, but walks straight into a mob of people. Awh, what the hell? How did Brie get his song and why is her name on the back and not Mari\u2019s? He was too dumbstruck to speak before, but now Trystan\u2019s angry. Without a doubt, he knows that this is Brie\u2019s fault, that she\u2019s the one who called the press, and she\u2019s the one who exposed him.</p><p>Trystan stands there for a second before turning back toward the building. Seth comes crashing through the door next to him. \u201cCome on, man. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Seth\u2019s voice is deep and demanding. It\u2019s like he knows that Trystan wants to run.</p> <p>\u201cTucker will fail me if I cut,\u201d Trystan blurts it out without thinking.</p><p>Seth shakes his head. \u201cNo way. Not after this. Show up for the play tonight and you\u2019re golden. Come on, my car\u2019s around the side and I bet all these pussies parked out front.\u201d Seth is walking down the sidewalk and cuts toward the student parking lot. He ducks through a hole in the chain link fence and Trystan follows.</p><p>A few reporters trail after them, but the camera guy can\u2019t follow. The equipment doesn\u2019t fit through the fence, so they have to walk around. By the time that happens, Trystan and Seth will be driving away.</p><p>Trystan settles into the passenger\u2019s seat and presses his hand to his temple, shading his eyes. Seth starts the engine and they peel out of the lot, cutting into the busy road. Seth floors it, bobbing and weaving through traffic to put some distance between them and the reporters.</p><p>For a while Seth doesn\u2019t say anything, but then he explodes and once he starts talking the words don\u2019t stop. \u201cHow could you not tell me? I\u2019m watching all these people gathering in the hallway this morning and thinking, there is no way in hell that Scott is this Day Jones guy because I would have known. He would have told me. I\u2019m the guy\u2019s best friend and shit like this wouldn\u2019t be kept a secret, but what the fuck do I know? Because apparently, you\u2019re all about the secrets, Scott. Do I even know you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole if you think you don\u2019t.\u201d Trystan doesn\u2019t drop his hand from his brow. A queasy feeling has been surging through him since he saw the mass of people. His mind drifts to Mari. He\u2019ll have to text her and make sure she\u2019s okay as soon as he can patch things up with Seth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing you\u2019ve got to say? Are you shittin\u2019 me? After everything we\u2019ve been through, you\u2019re seriously going to keep lying to me?\u201d Seth cuts someone off and a horn blares behind them. Seth flips off the other driver and gives the car more gas.</p><p>Trystan looks up from under his hand. \u201cWhat am I lying about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Scott. You want to play it this way? Fine. I\u2019ll play. Tell me if you\u2019re Day Jones. Tell me you didn\u2019t write that song for that skank Brie. Tell me who you nailed last night. Or how about you tell me why the hell someone saw you at the police station.\u201d His gaze cuts to Trystan\u2019s, sharp as glass. The tension in his jaw is enough to make it snap. \u201cPick one, Scott. I know you\u2019ve been making stuff up, and I figure that\u2019s fine\u2014he\u2019ll tell me when the shit hits the fan\u2014but since that happened, and you still haven\u2019t said two words\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trystan drops his hand and looks over at him. \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Seth? That I\u2019m Day Jones? Fine, I am. I wrote that song for someone else, not Brie. I don\u2019t even know how she got it. And yeah, I was at the police station, and no, I\u2019m not telling you why, because it\u2019s none of your goddamn business.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s grip tightens on the steering wheel, making his knuckles rise up under his skin. \u201cI see. So where were you last night? Tell me who you fucked \u2018til morning, because I know you weren\u2019t at home. You used to tell me that kind of thing Scott, you know, back when we were friends. Choke up a name right now or I\u2019ll toss your ass out of my car\u2014\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s none of Seth\u2019s business, but the guy is in torch everything and ask questions later mode. Trystan\u2019s been keeping things from him, yeah, but he keeps things from everyone. Well, not from everyone. Mari knows. The vein on the side of Seth\u2019s head is about to explode. It\u2019s throbbing under his skin, making Trystan feel guilty. Maybe he is a shitty friend. So he answers, \u201cMari Jennings.\u201d But as soon as Trystan says her name, he regrets it.</p><p>Seth turns abruptly, and smashes his mouth shut. Taking the wheel hand over hand, making the tires shriek as the car skids into a parking lot. He slams on the brakes and they come to a quick stop. \u201cGet out of my car, you lying sack of shit. You honestly think that I\u2019d believe that? You didn\u2019t even try to\u2014\u201c</p><p>Trystan glares at his friend, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. Seth is so dense with this stuff. \u201cYou think I\u2019d lie and make up Mari? Are you seriously telling me that you can\u2019t see it? I\u2019m with her whenever I\u2019m not with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spend the night at Jenning\u2019s house? You slept with her?\u201d</p><p>Trystan nods slowly, even though he knows that Seth thinks they did more than sleep. \u201cYeah, I ducked out this morning after her dad got home from work.\u201d</p><p>Seth looks disgusted and disappointed. He tenses in his seat and Trystan\u2019s ready for the verbal onslaught that spews from his friend. \u201cI told you to stay away from her. That family has enough money to bury you and don\u2019t think that her dad won\u2019t do it. The guy is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rubbing the heel of his hands over his face, Trystan yells back, \u201cI know what he is, but she\u2019s worth the risk.\u201d</p><p>Seth sucks in a deep breath, trying to rein in his temper. Trystan slips down in his seat and stares blankly out the windshield. \u201cSo,\u201d Seth finally says, \u201cEverything changes now, right? You go and sign with some company and get rich, while I go and serve four years in some hellhole country that I can\u2019t point to on a map.\u201d</p> <p>Trystan glances over at Seth and his stomach sinks. \u201cYou enlisted?\u201d</p><p>Seth nods. \u201cI signed on the line. They own me after graduation.\u201d</p><p>Horrified, Trystan sits up straight. \u201cFuck, Seth. Tell me you didn\u2019t! Why\u2019d you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought that\u2019s what you were doing! I thought we\u2019d be shipping out together, but there\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re doing that now, not with this opportunity. You\u2019ll be rich in a week and have a penthouse in Manhattan. You can leave this shithole behind and nail a different chick every night.\u201d</p><p>Guilt is choking him so hard that he can barely speak. Seth enlisted because of him. Damn it. There\u2019s no way to undo this. It\u2019s already been done. \u201cThat\u2019s what you would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019d have a different three-way every night. I pussied it down for your version of the American dream.\u201d Seth settles back into his seat and tilts his head back. \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d</p><p>Trystan sighs and pushes his hands up over the top of his head and down the back of his neck, digging his fingers into the muscle. Every part of him wants to scream, but he can\u2019t. \u201cNo fucking clue. But I\u2019m guessing that everyone finds out everything I\u2019ve been trying to keep hidden, and my life becomes a living hell.\u201d</p><p>Seth snorts and smiles at him. \u201cOnly you would say that pussy and cash are hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you would focus on that shit after what happened this week. Life is more than getting laid, Seth.\u201d</p><p>Seth laughs once, like he doesn\u2019t agree at all. \u201cThen spill, Scott. What the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Trystan works his jaw, thinking about whether or not to tell Seth. In the end, Seth will find out\u2014they all will\u2014so he tells him now. Trystan tells him about his father, about Mari showing up and saving his life, and about the songs he wrote for her. \u201cNo one was supposed to give a shit about the videos, no one was supposed to find out about my father, and I sure as hell didn\u2019t want Mari caught in the middle.\u201d</p><p>Seth doesn\u2019t react to anything Trystan says. For a moment Trystan thinks that his friend isn\u2019t listening, but there\u2019s not much to say after something like that. Being beat reminds them both that they\u2019re insignificant.</p><p>Seth finally smirks at Trystan. \u201cDo you want me to mow down your old man?\u201d</p><p>Trystan laughs darkly and shakes his head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not worth it, and I have no intention of seeing him again\u2014ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so let me get this straight\u2014you\u2019re homeless, kind-a, sort-a banging an under-age good girl, you\u2019ve got a father who blames you for his life being shit, and a reporter that wants to publically out you. Did I forget anything?\u201d</p><p>Staring straight ahead, Trystan adds, \u201cYeah, you forgot vengeful ex-girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah. The Skank. I need to make her up a tee shirt that says that in glittery letters. Ten buck says she wears it.\u201d Seth laughs at his own joke, but Trystan is lost in thought. He needs to play his next move well, so that it cuts off all the crap and gives him a sure footing, but Brie and Mari create vulnerable spots in his plans. He can\u2019t figure out how to lose Brie or how to keep Mari from being found out. Damn, if the press realizes that she was there the other night...</p><p>\u201cScott?\u201d Seth sounds irritated, like he\u2019s been trying to talk to Trystan while he\u2019s been lost in his own head. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to play this hand. Live it. Own it. Claim that title and then the next move is yours. Tell the reporter about your shitfaced father, about how you worked your ass off to keep food on the table, and about Sam giving you a job. It\u2019ll make your fans love you even more.\u201d</p><p>Trystan is staring at the people in the parking lot and realizes that this is one of the last times he\u2019ll be able to move freely. Once they know he\u2019s Day Jones, his life will change. Folding his arms over his chest, Trystan mutters, \u201cI don\u2019t want fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit. Deal with it, Scott. This is your ticket out of this hell hole and the train\u2019s only going one-way. Get on or get run over.\u201d Seth puts the car in gear and drives over to a deli in the center of the strip mall. \u201cI\u2019ll get us some breakfast, knowing you, you didn\u2019t eat. But, when you become rich and famous I expect a hooker or two for my troubles.\u201d</p><p>Trystan laughs. \u201cYou make your own troubles, Seth. Hookers are not a good thing to factor into the equation.\u201d</p><p>Seth flashes a ghost of a smile and he nods. After getting out of the car, he leans into the open window. \u201cI don\u2019t usually say shit like this, but I got your back, Scott. Whatever you decide, I\u2019m still your man.\u201d Seth lets out an uncomfortable breath and turns away, and walks into the deli.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>Katie fires off a slew of profanity at Brie\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cI can hear you,\u201d Brie snaps, as she sashays away from us.</p><p>\u201cI know! I\u2019m talking loudly!\u201d Katie is seething. She grabs my arm and pulls me toward the side doors. \u201cThere is no way in hell that we\u2019re going to learn a damn thing today. Come on. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Katie pushes through the metal doors and we\u2019re in the parking lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf my Dad finds out that I cut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t, Mari. Who\u2019s taking attendance right now? All the teachers are in the hallway buzzing about Trystan. No one is going to file a cut slip on you.\u201d Her venom for Brie drains as soon as we\u2019re outside. Katie tugs my arm. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s walk to the deli and grab some grub. Katie hungry.\u201d She says the last few words like Cookie Monster.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but wonder what this means for Trystan, but I bet he\u2019s dreading it. For someone that shines so brightly in the spotlight, he really doesn\u2019t like being in it. The main road isn\u2019t too busy right now. A few of the news vans drive past us. Others stayed and are interviewing Trystan\u2019s teachers. By tonight, it will be on every channel\u2014Trystan Scott is Day Jones. They\u2019ll all think Trystan wrote that song for Brie and I\u2019ll get shoved aside.</p><p>Katie glares at me. \u201cYou planning on answering anything any time soon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, what\u2019d you ask?\u201d</p><p>Katie makes an overly dramatic noise and stomps her combat boots. She\u2019s wearing a floral print skirt, knee highs with skulls on the side, and a lacy white shirt with a big sparkly belt. Her hair is slicked back into a ponytail and swishing high on her head. I feel frumpy standing next to her in my flannel shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cI said what\u2019s up with you and Trystan?\u201d All the color drains from my cheeks. I can\u2019t hide it. I\u2019ve been blindsided too many times to mask my emotions and keep them off my face. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s pretend I didn\u2019t see your reaction. Come on, use your words, Mari. Tell me what happened.\u201d Katie says it like she\u2019s talking to a toddler.</p><p>My gaze is on the ground when I answer. \u201cI love him, okay. He spent the night last night. The reporters couldn\u2019t find him, because he was with me.\u201d</p><p>Katie stops in her tracks, and grabs my arm. When I turn, her eyeballs are still expanding in shock. \u201cWhat the hell? You tell me you\u2019re over him and then you sleep with him? As in you guys had sex?\u201d She makes a shrieking noise and spins in a circle. It looks like an angry chicken dance. \u201cHow could you not tell me that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShhh!\u201d I shove her past the store front. There are people inside looking out at us. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re loud. And no, Miss Dirty Brains, it wasn\u2019t like that. He needed a place to stay. Trystan\u2019s been coming over for a while, but last night was the first night he stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your parents\u2014Mr. and Mrs. Rodup D\u2019Ass\u2014didn\u2019t have issues with this?\u201d</p><p>I smile sheepishly. \u201cThey don\u2019t know. Trystan was in the closet when Dad came home this morning. I thought we were going to get caught.\u201d</p><p>Katie squeals and slaps her hands over her mouth. \u201cShut up! Mari Jennings turned into a bad girl. We need to stop at the pet store and buy you a big fat dog collar\u2014the kind with the spikes. Your Dad would so shit himself when he saw you wearing it.\u201d</p><p>Katie makes me smile even though I\u2019m a bunch of tangled nerves inside. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine what would happen then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should totally do it. They take you for granted. It\u2019d serve them right if you went all nutso on them for a while.\u201d</p> <p>I tuck my hands under my arms. \u201cProbably not a good plan. My Dad would sue me or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, your father is a douche. I need to tell him that the next time I see him. I\u2019m pretty sure that your dad and my dad went to Douchiversity together, because they\u2019ve both got that bastard thing nailed. Hey, isn\u2019t that Sexbot\u2019s car?\u201d All of Katie\u2019s sentences flow together, but my gaze follows her finger to an old muscle car running in the parking lot when we finally reach the deli.</p><p>I smile to myself. \u201cIt is.\u201d I see Trystan sitting in the front seat with his arm over his face. \u201cGo grab us something. I need to talk to Trystan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but if me and Seth come back and you guys are all making out, he\u2019s probably going to want to watch. He\u2019s a perv like that.\u201d Katie laughs and disappears inside before I can say anything.</p><p>I walk over to the car and wonder what I\u2019m going to say. He\u2019s got to be coming unglued. Too much has happened to him, too close together. I walk over to his side of the car and tap on the window. \u201cHey stranger, or should I call you rock star?\u201d</p><p>Trystan smiles when he sees me. He opens the door and pulls me into the car. I fall onto his lap and he holds on like I\u2019m an anchor. \u201cI prefer kiss ninja. I\u2019ll always prefer that.\u201d Trystan\u2019s hands wrap around my waist and he pulls me in for a hug. Being on his lap makes me so excited and nervous at the same time, but his hands feel good so I don\u2019t wriggle away. He kisses my cheek lightly and the sensation shoots a current through my veins and a soft smile spreads across my lips.</p><p>\u201cSo, I see that I\u2019ve corrupted you. It\u2019s not even second period yet and you\u2019re already cutting class.\u201d The smirk on Trystan\u2019s face is so cute that I want to lean in and lick it off. That cocky arrogant smile excites the butterflies that are ravaging my stomach.</p><p>\u201cHa! As if I could be so easily manipulated by you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s Katie that\u2019s the evil force at play here? Hmmm. I\u2019ll have to study her methods.\u201d Trystan beams and I swat at him, needing him to be serious for a moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I ask. After everything that\u2019s happened, I doubt it. Trystan tried so hard to hide this, and now it\u2019s exposed.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re here, now. Everything will be fine.\u201d His confident smile falters and his voice loses the token Trystan Scott vibrato.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be fine. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He smirks at me. \u201cIt sounds better when you say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I believe it. This can be a good thing, Trystan. You\u2019ll never have to hide from anyone or anything ever again. You just have to be brave this one time, and take whatever crap comes your way, but after that you can live your own life. You don\u2019t have to enlist. Your life is yours now.\u201d As I speak, Trystan\u2019s fingers run through my hair.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know you were there. They\u2019ll know what you did. People will talk, they\u2019ll say things about you and me. I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d His eyes are on the dashboard, like he can\u2019t look at me.</p><p>Tilting his chin up so our gazes meet, I say, \u201cThey\u2019re only words, Trystan. Let them say whatever they want. I owe you that much\u2014\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes lock onto mine, confused. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the reason the reporters where there. They found out you\u2019re Day because of me.\u201d</p><p>Trystan stiffens and his hands fall to the seat. \u201cYou told them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I might as well have. Brie was in my room, she found the song and recognized your handwriting. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulls me to his chest and it\u2019s all I can do to keep the tears from falling. I know Trystan didn\u2019t want this and it\u2019s my fault it happened. \u201cShhh, it wasn\u2019t your fault. You\u2019re not the one who called them. Why the hell were you hanging out with Brie, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I was forced to apologize so her dad wouldn\u2019t sue my father. My mother left her in my room for god knows how long. Brie saw the song.\u201d</p><p>Trystan holds me tighter. \u201cBrie\u2019s my fault, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Seth chooses that moment to materialize next to the open window with Katie in his wake. They say in unison, \u201cBrie\u2019s a bitter skank.\u201d The two of them stop and this awkward thing happens. Seth looks down at the juice in his hands with a weird expression on his face.</p><p>Katie gapes at him like a docked fish. \u201cStop stealing my thoughts, perv.\u201d</p><p>Seth comes back to himself and snaps, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a novel idea, G.I. Hoe.\u201d</p><p>Trystan groans and slams his head backward into the seat. \u201cI\u2019ll jump out of the car right now if you two are going to fight all day.\u201d</p><p>Seth sees me on Trystan\u2019s lap. \u201cShe is not staying. You got some, now you can get out.\u201d</p><p>Katie shoves Seth aside and slips into the backseat. \u201cThat\u2019s a suckie idea. I\u2019m not walking home and Trystan isn\u2019t going to let you talk crap about Mari, so keep your disgusting comments to yourself.\u201d Katie opens the bag and holds it out to me. \u201cBagel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You two are not coming with us!\u201d Seth stands with the door open and is pointing, like we\u2019re bad dogs for climbing on his seats.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d Katie bites into her bagel. \u201cDid you guys get bacon? I swear to God, I smell bacon.\u201d She lifts her nose to the air and sniffs.</p><p>Everyone looks at Seth. He shifts all his weight to one foot and surrenders. \u201cFuck, yeah. I got bacon and if you get grease on the upholstery, I\u2019ll take it out of your ass.\u201d He holds the bag out to Katie.</p><p>She snatches it from his hand. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not into that, but thanks for the offer.\u201d</p><p>Trystan tries to hide a surprised smile, as Katie inhales a strip of bacon before handing us the bag. He asks me, \u201cIs she always like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when she\u2019s wearing those boots. She goes all Combat Katie and thinks she can kick ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a great ass,\u201d Seth smirks and slips into the car.</p><p>Katie glares at him as she glances at her wooden handbag. \u201cI should hit you with my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It was a compliment.\u201d Seth\u2019s smiles in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cThen, you suck at compliments. Why can\u2019t you just learn to secretly leer like everyone else? Damn, Seth.\u201d Katie smiles crookedly and munches another piece of bacon.</p><p>\u201cWho said I wasn\u2019t doing that too?\u201d Seth looks at her in the mirror again. I expect more pointed comments from Katie but she just eats her food like she doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s watching.</p><p>Seth grabs his breakfast, unwraps it, and takes a huge bite before looking over at Trystan. \u201cWhere are we going, Scott? The next move is your call.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>Mari tenses in his lap as soon as Seth and Katie get into the car. Trystan knows she wants to slide in the seat next to him, but he isn\u2019t ready to let her go yet. His fingers lace together around her narrow waist as Seth and Katie attempt to verbally castrate each other. The familiarity makes his raging pulse slow to normal\u2014well, almost. Mari is in his lap. If he lets his mind wander, it\u2019ll go back to her bedroom and run through the things he could have done with her last night if he didn\u2019t have a conscience. Telling her no seemed like the right thing at the time, but now Trystan\u2019s worried that she\u2019ll slip through his fingers.</p><p>There\u2019s no way to hold onto Mari, not with the world going up in flames around him. He can\u2019t even bring Mari with him, assuming he signs with one of the deals that he\u2019s been offered. Mari\u2019s a minor and is stuck living with parents who don\u2019t love her for another year, while he does what? While he becomes famous and she forgets all about him. There\u2019s nothing Trystan can offer her, not if he doesn\u2019t step up and change something.</p><p>The idea of publically professing what happened at home makes him sick. Telling everyone about it seems unbearable, but it\u2019s one barbed hurdle and the reward on the other side is worth risking impalement. Trystan isn\u2019t accustomed to telling people his secrets, but he\u2019s guessing that everyone in the car already knows most of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trystan looks over the seat at Katie. \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw drops and she blinks repetitively, batting her eyelashes. Katie presses her hand to her heart and drops her bagel. Her voice drips with sarcasm as she speaks. \u201cAre you really asking me? Oh my God! Day Jones is asking me a question!\u201d She sounds like a crazed fan, and then laughs, falling back into the seat, and taking another bite of her bagel. \u201cSeriously, Scott. Get over yourself. What do you think is going to happen if people know?\u201d</p><p>Trystan realizes that he likes Katie more than he thought he did. She spars with Seth so much that he\u2019s hardly gotten two words in when she\u2019s around. He didn\u2019t expect her to react this way, and that\u2019s good. Mari needs friends like that. Hell, I need friends like that, he thinks, and grins at her. \u201cOkay, wiseass, try again. What happens if I confess and sing? What happens when they know without a doubt that I\u2019m the online legend?\u201d</p><p>Mari cuts off Katie. She sees where he\u2019s going with this, and that he needs to think it through. \u201cThe agents that tried to sign you show up, the record labels do the same\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Seth adds, \u201cExcept they go to your house, because they think your dad isn\u2019t an asshole\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mari nods and continues, \u201cThen, they find out your stuff is gone. Your dad is a wild card\u2014he could claim you or disown you and say you never lived there\u2014and since he threw out all your stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>Katie cuts her off. \u201cYour dad threw out all your stuff?\u201d</p><p>Trystan doesn\u2019t answer. Seth gives Katie the drive-by version. \u201cTrystan\u2019s dad is a shithead and abused him, on and off, forever. Mari almost killed the old guy with a brick the other night, which is what has Trystan on edge. He thinks the press is going to find out and it\u2019ll ruin Mari\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Mari turns and looks at Trystan as Katie\u2019s jaw hits the carpet. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid for me?\u201d</p> <p>He nods, avoiding her gaze. \u201cI can\u2019t keep them from finding any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t find it, Trystan. My files are gone, my dad probably had them all burned. You know how he is. He didn\u2019t want to sue because he didn\u2019t want to leave a paper trail that could come back and haunt him.\u201d The words stick to the back of her throat, but she manages to spit them out.</p><p>\u201cWhat if they know we were together last night?\u201d He takes one of her lose curls and tucks it behind her ear. \u201cIf someone saw me come or go, then you\u2019d get in trouble and I don\u2019t want to make your life harder than it already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrystan, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Smiling kindly, Mari tilts her pretty face to the side. \u201cThe worst thing that I had to worry about was Brie, and if this is the best she can do, then I\u2019m overjoyed. Go meet with the suits and pick one. You\u2019ll be good at this Trystan, but you have to want it. You have to own it the way you do when you\u2019re on stage. They\u2019ll love you\u2014all of them\u2014and you\u2019ll be unstoppable no matter what skeletons from your past are aired out.\u201d By the time she stops speaking, Mari has her head tipped in and pressed against his. \u201cYour next move is to let the world know that you\u2019re Day Jones and that you have more songs that are even more awesome than the first.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s blue gaze is locked with hers. His hand is on her back with his thumb sweeping in slow circles. \u201cI can\u2019t do it your expense\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. My path is already set. Trystan, I didn\u2019t mention this before, but I applied to a little college not too far from here. They accepted me. Actually, they offered me a full ride\u2014full tuition, fees, room and board\u2014everything. I didn\u2019t mention it because I didn\u2019t think I could go through with it, but...\u201d her words trail off as a smile creeps across her lips.</p> <p>Katie butts in, \u201cBut she\u2019s going through with it. Little Miss Secrets here just submitted an application for early graduation. She\u2019s ditching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d Seth\u2019s breakfast stops half way to his mouth and he stares at Mari.</p><p>She nods and flashes smiles. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>Trystan asks, \u201cWhat about your Dad?\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s is the one who answers. She\u2019s sucking on a piece of bacon and removes it from her mouth like it\u2019s a lollipop. \u201cHer dad is going to shit bricks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d Mari yells at her, but she\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s the truth.\u201d She chomps on the bacon and starts fighting over the remaining pieces with Seth.</p><p>Trystan turns Mari\u2019s face towards his. There are so many emotions flooding through him that he can\u2019t figure out who he feels. \u201cAre you really going to do it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Are you going to admit that you\u2019re Day Jones?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flick to Seth as the guy snort-laughs. Trystan says to his friend. \u201cI walked right into that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. She played you, lover boy.\u201d Katie uses the moment to her advantage. She grabs a fist full of bacon before Seth can stop her and shoves the slices in her mouth. \u201cAh! You bitch! You ate all the bacon!\u201d The greasy meat hangs out the sides of Katie\u2019s mouth. She grins and waves the tips of her fingers at him, laughing. \u201cFuck it.\u201d Seth turns around and pulls a piece from between her lips and eats it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting!\u201d The words come out of Katie\u2019s mouth garbled as she blinks at Seth in shock.</p><p>Trystan laughs and squeezes Mari tight. \u201cYes, he is. And you\u2014Mari Jennings\u2014you\u2019re diabolical.\u201d She laughs as Trystan tickles her. The little movements of his fingers make Mari jerk around on the front seat like a squirrel on a string. She tries to tickle him back, but Trystan has the better angle. There\u2019s no way to get away from him. Katie and Seth are busy telling them how disgustingly cute they are, and someone threatens to douse Trystan and Mari with juice so they stop.</p><p>Trystan is smiling wide, \u201cSo, we\u2019re both going to do it?\u201d</p><p>Mari is grinning at him. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh,\u201d Katie interrupts, \u201cthat was weak, Mari. Own it, woman!\u201d</p><p>Mari clutches her hands and screams, \u201cI\u2019m going to college early! Wahoo!\u201d Trystan laughs and hugs her.</p><p>\u201cWahoo?\u201d Seth makes a face. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what the fox says when he falls off a cliff?\u201d</p><p>Katie kicks the back of his seat with her big ass boot. \u201cYou\u2019re such a moron.\u201d</p><p>They continue to bicker, but Trystan doesn\u2019t care. He can\u2019t keep his eyes off of Mari\u2019s. Seth notices. \u201cYou guys are going to get slobber all over the leather. I\u2019m getting rid of her now. Where\u2019s your house, Mari?\u201d</p><p>Before Mari can object, Trystan slides her into the seat next to him and gives the address. When Seth stops in front of her house, Trystan gets out first and holds the door. Mari slips out and before Katie can crawl out of the backseat, he closes the door. Leaning in through the window, Trystan informs them, \u201cI\u2019m hanging out with Mari. See you at the school tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMari! You can\u2019t leave me with Seth!\u201d Katie has her face in the little gap between the seat belt and the window. She extends her hand. \u201cSave me!\u201d</p><p>Trystan wraps his arms around Mari and presses a kiss to her cheek. Seth revs the engine. \u201cTrust me, Katie, you don\u2019t want to hang out with them right now. They\u2019re going to be all lovey dovey and shit. Let\u2019s go find something else to do.\u201d</p><p>Seth hits the gas before anyone can reply. As the car travels down the street, Katie turns around and smooshes her face against the back window and gives them both the finger. Trystan laughs and waves at her. \u201cShe\u2019s going to kill you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019re the one who waved. She remembers stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>Trystan makes a mental note to never piss off Katie again. Then he turns to Mari and takes her hands. \u201cSo, we have an entire day to ourselves. What should we do?\u201d Stepping closer, he slips his hands around her waist and closes the space between them.</p><p>\u201cI might have a few ideas.\u201d She looks up shyly and then laughs.</p><p>In that moment, Trystan is so happy that his chest might combust. \u201cOh? I thought your parents were home during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey usually are, but today there\u2019s a meeting and some other stuff that they told me about. The general gist was that they wouldn\u2019t be at the house today or the school tonight.\u201d She mimics her dad\u2019s voice, \u201cBecause acting is a waste of your talents.\u201d</p><p>Trystan leans in close enough to kiss her. \u201cSo, that means that we both have until six o\u2019clock tonight with no parental supervision? That\u2019s a really long time.\u201d His eyes shift to her lips. \u201cGot any ideas?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she pecks him on the lips, and then tugs him toward the front door. \u201cI plan to kick your ass at Guitar Hero for the first hour. Your ego will be so bruised that you won\u2019t be able to look me in the eye after that\u2014\u201d The rest of her verbal jabs are lost in giggles as Trystan presses her against the front door and attacks her with tickles.</p><p>\u201cBruised ego, my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your ass.\u201d Mari spurts, between bouts of laughter. Suddenly, Trystan\u2019s body is pressed to hers. He steps closer, pressing her back against the door, before kissing her until she forgets to breathe.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>TRYSTAN</p><p>The bed is soft and it feels good to have Mari against his chest. She\u2019s laying on her side, snuggling into him on top of her comforter. They\u2019ve been lying like this since lunch. Trystan doesn\u2019t remember how they got into the position. They\u2019d been talking, sitting side by side, and now she\u2019s laying in his arms. Tightening his hold around her narrow waist, Trystan feels content. No, it\u2019s past that. For the first time in his life, he\u2019s happy. He can see a way out, a path that leads to something good, and he\u2019s glad that it includes Mari.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Trystan says, \u201cWhen were you going to tell me about the early graduation thing?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I was saving it for when you decided to tell everyone that you\u2019re Day. Have you thought about how you\u2019re going to do it?\u201d</p><p>They talk about it a little bit and decide it should be after the play. Otherwise they fear that the cast will have worked so hard for nothing. Trystan doesn\u2019t want to overshadow them, especially Mari. Plus, kissing her on stage is a moment that he doesn\u2019t want to pass up, and there are several hot kisses in the little production. \u201cNot really. What do you think I should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, as much as I hate to say this, I think Seth is right. You have to own it. Spill the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? I know I should, but knowing it and saying it are two different things.\u201d Her long hair is draped over her shoulder. She shifts and looks up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we helped? Like me, Seth, and Katie. What if we each said something about why you wouldn\u2019t come forward, so that way when you say that you\u2019re Day Jones, it makes more sense? People are going to wonder why you\u2019re saying it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they found me. If they didn\u2019t know where I was, I wouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Trystan rolls onto his side and leans on his elbow. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have risked this.\u201d He gestures between them. \u201cIt\u2019s too important to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mari smiles in that girlish way, with the shy eyes, before she slips off the bed. She walks over to her dresser and pulls something out. When she comes back, she sits on the edge of the mattress, and takes his hand. Trystan sits up as Mari drops something cold into his palm\u2014a ring. It\u2019s a thick silver band with strange letters etched onto it. Holding it up between his thumb and forefinger, Trystan asks, \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ancient Greek. It says...\u201d her cheeks redden and she looks away.</p><p>When she lifts her gaze, Trystan feels the pull to her. It starts in the center of his chest and travels deep into his bones. Those eyes, that hair, and her voice\u2014there isn\u2019t a more wonderful sound. Leaning in slowly, Trystan lingers within a breath of her lips. He can feel the heat from her skin and although he longs to touch her, he doesn\u2019t. \u201cWhat does it say, Mari?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lift and she tenses, seeing how close he is. If her heart is pounding like his, they\u2019re in trouble. Trystan leans in and closes the space, pressing his lips to the corner of her mouth. Mari\u2019s dark lashes close and when she lifts her gaze again, those pink lips curve into a beautiful shy smile.</p> <p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he breathes.</p><p>\u201cIt says \u2018my soul is your soul.\u2019 It means you\u2019re part of me and that our friendship is eternal.\u201d She presses her lips together hard and adds, \u201cAnd it means I love you. When you\u2019re famous and miles away, you can look at it and remember me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I could ever forget you,\u201d He pulls her against his chest and says in her ear, \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrystan, I know our lives are about to change and I want you to do what you need to do, to become who you need to be. But the thought of waking up every morning and not seeing you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He silences her worries with a kiss, and then pulls away. Both of his hands find her face, and slip back into her hair. \u201cCome with me. Whatever I do, wherever I go\u2014come with me, Mari. You don\u2019t have to stay here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m seventeen, Trystan. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to leave for college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t leave to live with a guy. Add in the fact that you\u2019re a rock star and my dad will throw your ass in jail for kidnapping me.\u201d Her dark gaze falls between us and when she looks up again, there\u2019s pain in her eyes. \u201cIt works better this way. You can come see me and I\u2019ll start college. I can catch up with you when I\u2019m eighteen or stay here and graduate. We\u2019ll have more choices then, Trystan. But right now, we both get to start over. We both get two shiny new lives and they\u2019re going in different directions. That\u2019s why I want you to have the ring. Remember me when things get rough, because they will. I\u2019ll always be there for you, no matter what happens between us.\u201d</p><p>Her words are like a stake through his heart. She\u2019s talking about them like they\u2019re already over, even though they\u2019ve barely started. The idea of losing her, of going through his life without her, is more devastating than anything he\u2019s ever felt. But she\u2019s right and he knows it. Their time together is limited and he wants to treasure the few moments they have.</p><p>They stay like that, embracing each other, on the side of Mari\u2019s bed. He can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s seconds or hours, but the tug inside his chest is demanding. Everything within him is making Trystan want to kiss her senseless and hold her in his arms.</p><p>Suddenly, she pulls back and takes his cheeks in her palms. \u201cKiss me, Trystan.\u201d Her voice is soft. Mari doesn\u2019t have to ask twice.</p> <p>Trystan lowers his lips and presses them softly to her mouth. Fighting to maintain control, he plans to kiss her slowly and take his time, but then Mari sinks back onto the bed and pulls Trystan down with her, which changes things. The kiss becomes all hot lips, and he can\u2019t get enough. His hands travel down the sides of her body, grasping her tighter, as he presses himself on top of her.</p><p>The moment is perfect, and his head is filled with the sounds Mari makes in the back of her throat and the way her nails scrape the back of his neck. Her scent fills his head and he\u2019s utterly lost, unable to think or focus on anything but her.</p><p>That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t hear the door or the footsteps until it\u2019s too late. A hand is on the back of his neck and a second later, Trystan is ripped away from Mari. He\u2019s pulled to his feet and then a fist connects with his stomach. Mari\u2019s father manages to keep a hold on his shoulder. The man is screaming incoherently as he tries to throw another punch, but Trystan is ready this time. He moves at the last moment. Mari screams drown out her father\u2019s angry words, as his fist connects with the wall, and goes straight through.</p><p>Trystan steps back, and pulls Mari to her feet, shielding her. When her father pulls his hand free and turns back, his jaw is clenched tight and his fists rise again. Trystan thought the man was yelling at him, but he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s giving Mari a verbal lashing that\u2019s worse than anything his old man ever said.</p><p>Her father is growling, his back curved, his arms ready to strangle her. \u201cI gave you everything and this is how you repay me? You cut school and sit at home, playing house with this piece of shit! You\u2019re a goddamn whore! And no daughter of mine is ever going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trystan knows he shouldn\u2019t do it, but his fist is already in motion, making a bee line straight for the doctor\u2019s jaw. On contact, the man staggers, and his back hits the wall. Hard. The picture frames that her mother so neatly displayed in a little row crash to the floor and shatter.</p><p>Broken glass glitters as Trystan steps forward, crunching it under his boot. \u201cNo one talks to Mari like that. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re her father or if you sue me. You daughter loves you, even though you don\u2019t deserve it. You\u2019re vicious words are destroying her and I\u2019m not going to let you do it. So, go back to your ivory tower and complain about how the world doesn\u2019t recognize how smart you are, just like you don\u2019t recognize what you\u2019ve done to your own child, you pathetic waste of life.\u201d</p><p>Trystan holds out a hand for Mari. Sweat drips from his brow as he sucks in air, trying to slow his heart rate back to normal. Every muscle in his body is tense, ready for an attack that never comes. Instead, Mari\u2019s father sits on the floor, glaring. He doesn\u2019t stand when his daughter walks past him with tears glistening on her cheeks. The doctor sits there, rigid, utterly still, like he\u2019s in shock. Trystan and Mari walk out of the house together in silence.</p> <p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>I can\u2019t stop crying. Trystan\u2019s arm is around me as he guides me to a picnic table and sits me down on top. My mom took me to this park when I was a little girl. It\u2019s a few blocks from my house. Trystan\u2019s hands are on my knees as he tries to look up into my face. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Frantically rubbing tears out of my eyes, I look up at him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Trystan. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be home. Dad never comes home. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he pulls me against his chest and holds on tight, and strokes my hair. I can hear the steady beating of his heart and it soothes me.</p><p>When I finally pull away, I feel embarrassed. We weren\u2019t even doing anything, but that\u2019s not what it looked like. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I say it again, because I don\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry about, Mari.\u201d I give him a weak smile and glance away, but Trystan doesn\u2019t let me. He takes my chin in his hand and lifts my gaze until our eyes meet. There\u2019s so much affection in those blue eyes, so much love. \u201cNo one will hurt you when I\u2019m around, okay?\u201d</p><p>I lean into him again, holding on tight. \u201cNo one has ever talked back to him before, and you yelled and punched him.\u201d</p><p>Trystan kisses the top of my head and rests his cheek there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made things worse. I couldn\u2019t stand there and watch him rip you apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t get up, Trystan. I expected him to fight back, but he didn\u2019t. Dad seemed more shocked than anything.\u201d The look on my father\u2019s face when Trystan defended me wasn\u2019t anger, it was something else. It was almost like he was shocked that someone had the nerve to talk back to him. No one ever talks back to my dad. He\u2019s above everyone at work and at home. He\u2019s always right, and a teenage rock star just told him he was wrong, and followed it up with an undercut. \u201cOh, god. He\u2019s going to kill me later.\u201d</p><p>Trystan pulls away and takes hold of my upper arms. He lowers himself so we\u2019re eye to eye. \u201cThen don\u2019t go home.\u201d</p><p>The thought brings a smile to my face. Stay with Trystan. I would love that, but I can\u2019t. \u201cTrystan, I can\u2019t. They\u2019ll tear the town apart looking for me, and say horrible things about you when they find me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze falls to the ground as his hands slip down to mine. \u201cI can\u2019t let you go back there alone. What if we figured out how to get you a room, so you\u2019re not with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA room?\u201d What is he thinking?</p><p>Nodding, Trystan says, \u201cYeah, a hotel room. I\u2019m kind of homeless and all of my regular go-to spots aren\u2019t going to be possible because of the media. Especially not after tonight.\u201d He takes my hands and pulls me to my feet. \u201cI need to call one of those record labels about a deal. I\u2019ll tell them that they need to give me a place to stay, and I\u2019ll get a room for you, too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I should do it. It feels like he wants me to run away. It\u2019s strange, but if I was a year older, I wouldn\u2019t be a runaway, I\u2019d be a smart woman leaving an abusive home. Trystan knows what\u2019s going through my mind before I even speak.</p><p>The wind catches my hair and blows it across my face, leaving little strands stuck to my drying tears. Trystan reaches for me and yanks me to him by my waistband, before he smoothes away the stray strands. When he\u2019s done, his gaze lifts. The way he looks at me makes my heart race. Every pain, every piece of anguish that I felt a moment ago fades until there is only me and him. A tingling sensation starts in my chest and awakens the butterflies in my stomach as Trystan leans in and presses his lips to mine. I\u2019ll never get tired of his kiss, because I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s kissing me. And it\u2019s not fake, it\u2019s not from rehearsal, and it\u2019s not part of a play.</p><p>For once, I don\u2019t hold back. I trust him completely and it shows. The kiss changes somehow and becomes hotter and more breathless. By the time I pull away, my entire body is searing and I\u2019m gasping for air.</p><p>He tilts his head forward and rests it against mine. Trystan\u2019s breathing as hard as I am. He laughs and smiles at me. \u201cI\u2019ve never had someone kiss me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It changed. It wasn\u2019t just kissing. It\u2019s like I could feel how much you care about me right here,\u201d his fist lands on the center of his chest. Trystan takes a deep breath and shudders, like it scares him. When he looks up, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re part of me and always will be. It\u2019s awesome, and utterly terrifying.\u201d</p><p>The way he smiles fills me with joy. There\u2019s vulnerability in his gaze, as if he wants me to reassure him, so I do. \u201cI love you, Trystan. I always will.\u201d I pull him against me and resist the urge to continue kissing him since we have some practical issues that need to be figured out quickly. \u201cI think you\u2019re right about calling someone, but I think it should be Tucker.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTucker?\u201d Trystan looks at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You can trust him, right? The guy\u2019s been looking out for you, hasn\u2019t he? You should have him talk to the record label.\u201d</p><p>Trystan thinks about it and says, \u201cYou mean I should ask him to be my agent? He\u2019s an English teacher, Mari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Which means he\u2019s underpaid and works his ass off. It also means he can read and parse stuff that makes your head spin. You could get a big name agent\u2014I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all trying to sign you\u2014but it makes sense to ask Tucker, right?\u201d I give him a lopsided smile.</p> <p>He laughs and shakes his head as I hand him my phone. \u201cYou know, most people spend their life trying to get away from their teachers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but good people are rare. He\u2019s good people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Trystan\u2019s smile is huge. He teases me for another second and then dials. \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p> <p>Trystan walks into the coffee house with Mari on his arm. Today has been so weird. He should be in school. Actually, he should be sitting in Tucker\u2019s classroom right now, but here they are in this little caf\u00e9.</p><p>Tucker is already at a little table that\u2019s jammed into the corner. His white shirt is rolled up to his elbows and his collar is unbuttoned. There\u2019s a cup in his hand that gets lifted to his lips. When Tucker sets it down, he sees them, and waves them over. When they stop in front of the table, he asks, \u201cSo, it\u2019s true then?\u201d Tucker asks while dabbing his forehead with a napkin. The guy is covered in sweat.</p><p>Trystan pulls out a chair for Mari and then sits next to Tucker. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Tucker seems amused. There\u2019s a smile on his lips that he\u2019s clearly trying to hide. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want to tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of my dad. I know you know,\u201d Trystan adds quickly.</p><p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t know for certain, Trystan. If I did, social services would have pulled you out of there. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Tucker takes a deep breath and leans back in his chair. \u201cSo, what do you need from me?\u201d</p> <p>Trystan glances at Mari. After everything they talked about, he suddenly feels shy asking. It\u2019s Tucker, the same man who he threatened to report, but he\u2019s also the same guy that let him nap in the school basement.</p><p>Mari speaks for him. \u201cTrystan wants to take a deal. Several were offered, but he needs someone to negotiate things for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to do that?\u201d Tucker\u2019s caterpillar eyebrows crawl up his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrystan, I\u2019m not an agent. Shouldn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trystan cuts him off. \u201cMaybe, but I\u2019d like you to help me with this. You\u2019d get the agent\u2019s cut. The thing is, I trust you. I can tell you stuff and it won\u2019t end up in the paper, you know? I don\u2019t know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrystan, there are people that would be much better at this. I can look over your contracts, but I\u2019m not taking your money.\u201d</p><p>Trystan smiles and taps the table between them. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why I want you to do it.\u201d Trystan tells Tucker the plan for that evening. Mari interjects once in a while, filling in anything he left out. When he finishes, he says, \u201cAnd since neither of us have any place to sleep tonight\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Tucker glances at Trystan and then Mari. \u201cWhy not? I mean, I know what happened with your father Trystan, but what\u2019s happened to you? Why can\u2019t you go home?\u201d He looks at Mari with concern.</p><p>\u201cWell, her parents neglect her most of the time and when they\u2019re actually around, they lash into her. It\u2019s verbal crap for the most part, but when her dad went after her today. I thought he was going to strangle her, so I, uh, kind of punched him.\u201d Trystan realizes how bad that sounds. Now that the moment is over, it seems like an overreaction on his part, but at the time Trystan felt the need to defend Mari.</p><p>For a second he wonders how much his father messed up his perception of things. Maybe all livid parents don\u2019t beat the shit out of their kids. Maybe they yell and that\u2019s it, but things had already taken a turn when he grabbed Trystan. He can\u2019t afford to second guess himself. He did what he had to and he\u2019d do it again.</p><p>Tucker pinches the bridge of his nose and presses his eyes closed. \u201cYou punched Dr. Jennings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound like I\u2019m the bad guy here\u2014\u201d Trystan bristles, but Tucker slaps his hand down on the table and cuts him off.</p><p>\u201cTrystan, you\u2019re not the bad guy, but you can\u2019t punch people. You\u2019re eighteen\u2014it\u2019s assault. We\u2019ve already been thought this! Did you think of that before you hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe grabbed me and then he went at Mari. I thought he was going to hurt her. I...\u201d His voice trails off as he looks over at Mari.</p><p>She takes his hand. \u201cMr. Tucker, I didn\u2019t like any of it, but Trystan didn\u2019t start it.\u201d</p><p>Tucker looks up at her and sighs. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done, but you two can\u2019t be in situations like this. It\u2019s not safe. Mari\u2019s a minor, for godsakes. If the police show up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Trystan says quickly. \u201cThey showed up at my house the other night when things got ugly with my father. I know what happens to Mari. They drag her ass back to her father, and we all know how that goes.\u201d Trystan swallows hard and leans back, running his hands through his hair. \u201cI want to make sure she\u2019s safe, Mr. Tucker. That needs to be part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>Tucker looks at each of them and shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t do that Trystan. Social Services won\u2019t intervene if she\u2019s not in immediate danger. Verbal abuse is frowned upon, and he never actually touched her. When there are kids getting beat within an inch of death, they just don\u2019t have the capacity to deal with the stuff Mari is living with. Even if I reported neglect, she\u2019s seventeen. She can feed herself. Her parents are wealthy. Do you see where this is going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to call social services,\u201d Mari squeaks, looking panicked.</p><p>Trystan takes her hand, \u201cWe won\u2019t. Besides, that\u2019s not what we need right now.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Tucker looks confused. \u201cThen, what do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake housing a provision of the contract with the record label. We both need a roof. At the very least, have them put her up somewhere until she can move into the dorm in the fall.\u201d</p><p>Tucker blinks and does a double take. \u201cCome again? She\u2019s going to college in the fall?\u201d</p><p>Mari finally speaks up. She loses the hitch in her voice and confidently tells Tucker her plans. \u201cYes, I applied to a little college out east. They accepted me and offered a full scholarship, but I can\u2019t move into the dorm until August.\u201d</p><p>Tucker\u2019s brow furrows as he thinks. After a few moments, he points at Mari. \u201cI can fix your problem. We can get you into the dorm now instead of at the end of the summer. I assume your parents don\u2019t approve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know.\u201d Mari glances at her hands as she speaks, looking younger than she is. \u201cDaddy wanted me at Harvard, pursuing something in the medical field. I don\u2019t want that life. So I applied. I was planning on disappearing one night and not telling them a thing.\u201d</p><p>Tucker closes his eyes. When he opens them again, he smiles at her. Tipping his head to the side, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re a good kid with a good heart and a brilliant mind. I agree that you should move into the dorm as soon as possible, but you need to tell them. Otherwise, they\u2019ll think you were abducted or something horrible. I assume that your application for early graduation was submitted?\u201d She nods. \u201cGood, then I\u2019ll make sure it goes through. As for you,\u201d Tucker glances at Trystan while his index finger traces the rim of his coffee mug, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the record labels for you and tell them what you want. We can go from there. You have a lot of potential, Scott. I want to see you succeed more than anyone, so promise me that you won\u2019t mess it up.\u201d</p><p>Trystan laughs and folds his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat makes you think that I want to mess it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure with this life, Trystan. People will always be looking at you, waiting for you to fall apart. Have you noticed your peers\u2014the other young actors and singers who flamed out? You get a lot by taking this path, but you\u2019re giving up a lot, too. I know how much you value privacy and that\u2019ll be gone. You\u2019ll belong to the world. There won\u2019t be a quiet moment for weeks on end. Do you think you can handle that life? Because it\u2019s so damn easy to reach for something to take the edge off and before you know it, you\u2019re constantly drunk or high.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s shoulders tense as he says it. \u201cI don\u2019t drink or do drugs. I\u2019ll never drink anything. Do you seriously think that I\u2019d touch that shit after living with my father? He tried to\u2014\u201c Words won\u2019t come. They stick in his throat like barbs. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t walked in\u2014\u201d He sucks in air, his eyes too wide, and heart beating too fast.</p><p>Tucker bumps Trystan\u2019s hand and cuts him off. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll do it on purpose, Trystan, but yeah\u2014at some point you\u2019re going to need a way to deal with things. You need to know what you\u2019re going to do before it sneaks up on you. Unless a person intentionally changes what they\u2019re doing, children will become their parents. Which means you\u2019ll deal with stress the same way your father did. I know you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t now, but unless you know what you\u2019ll do, it\u2019s inevitable. So do us both a favor and decide how to handle your life before you get to that point.\u201d</p><p>Tucker\u2019s words cut through Trystan and pierce his heart. Lots of guys become their father. Trystan swore up and down that he\u2019d never be like his old man, but there\u2019s nothing stopping it from occurring. Tucker is the first person to even say that it didn\u2019t have to happen, and the way to do that seems so simple. Decide not to drink, decide now what he\u2019ll do when life is too hard, and Trystan can get anything he wants to drown his stress. Trystan hates that his father is a part of him. He hates how much the man influenced his life, but Tucker is right.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d The air is thick with things yet to come. There\u2019s a slush pile filled with shit that he has to trek through before getting to the other side. If Tucker wasn\u2019t here, he wouldn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Trystan smiles awkwardly at the guy. \u201cHey, I suck at saying things like this, but it needs to be said. Thank you. Thank you for looking out for me and dealing with my shit. I pretty much blackmailed you this year and you just rolled with it. You left the school in the middle of the day to talk to us, and you always do stuff like that. You\u2019ve done more than I could ever thank you for. I know a good guy when I see one, and I hope I can make you proud. If I can be half the man you are, that\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d</p><p>Mari is smiling at Trystan, and leans in close as he speaks. She knows how hard it is for him to say things like this. It means Trystan\u2019s wrong, that someone did care about him all this time, and that he wasn\u2019t alone. Trystan couldn\u2019t see it before, but it\u2019s crystal clear now. It\u2019s funny how easy it is to see after the fact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tucker has a weird smirk on his face. Shaking his head, he laughs. \u201cTrystan, I\u2019m already proud of you. This stupid smile on my face is pride. You\u2019re the kid with the most crap stacked against you and you rose to the top. You finally learned what I was trying to teach you and I couldn\u2019t ask for more.\u201d</p><p>Tucker stands abruptly and smacks Trystan on the back, nearly knocking him out of his seat. \u201cI\u2019ll see you before the play tonight and tell you how it goes. And Mari, make plans to stay at Katie\u2019s in case I can\u2019t pick up your dorm room key until tomorrow.\u201d He drops fifty bucks on the table and adds, \u201cCelebrate, both of you. Grab a piece of cake and something for dinner. I\u2019ll see you guys later.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>~MARI~</p> <p>Trystan and I go to the diner for dinner. My parents won\u2019t show up and I doubt my dad is out looking for me. He\u2019ll wait for me to come home and then chew me out. I already called a left a message on the answering machine that I\u2019d be staying with Katie tonight, so I won\u2019t have to deal with that mess until tomorrow, and right now tomorrow feels so far away.</p><p>I\u2019m staring at the menu way too long. Trystan is sitting across from me in the little booth. He glances over the top of his menu and looks around. \u201cWhere do you think they went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? The press?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I thought they\u2019d be harder to ditch.\u201d</p><p>Seth appears next to me and interrupts, \u201cWell, you can thank me for that. And her, I guess.\u201d He jabs his thumb at Katie, who\u2019s giggling like a maniac and standing next to Seth.</p> <p>Trystan scoots in to give Seth room, and I do the same. Katie sits next to me and is trying really hard not to laugh. \u201cTell them what you did,\u201d she says to Seth.</p><p>Seth leans back into the booth and spreads his arms across the seatback. \u201cWell, the reporters were hanging around the school, like you\u2019d come back. So me and Katie walk over and ask if they\u2019ve seen you, yet.\u201d</p><p>Katie can\u2019t shut up. She blurts out, \u201cSeth gave an interview and totally made up a bunch of stuff. The reporters are out at Robert Moses beach looking for you right now. Seth told them that you always go out there before opening night, but that you\u2019d be back in time for the show.\u201d Her smile looks so weird, because she\u2019s trying to keep herself from laughing. \u201cTell them the other part\u2014about Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I told them that the Skank is a bit of a psycho and that she\u2019s not your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey believed you?\u201d Trystan asks, looking surprised.</p><p>\u201cNah, of course not. I said I was your best friend, but everyone is pulling shit and trying to get on camera. So I told them to confirm that I was your bro with Brie, which they did. So, Brie says yes, and then they ask her where you go before every performance and she says you don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d Seth is smiling like he\u2019s the most awesome guy in the world.</p> <p>Katie jumps in and finishes the story. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t believe that she\u2019s going out with you! They told her to step aside so they could talk to Trystan\u2019s real friends.\u201d Katie busts a gut laughing and doubles over. Her face comes dangerously close to hitting the table as her body shakes.</p><p>Seth reaches forward all of a sudden, and shoots his hand out, placing it between Katie\u2019s face and the table just before she smacks into it. \u201cWatch it, bacon girl. You\u2019ll knock the few brains you have left out of that pretty head.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s eyes widen and we give each other a silent what the heck was that stare.</p><p>Katie stares at Seth\u2019s hand and lifts her eyes slowly, smiling way too hard. \u201cTrying to steal a feel, Sexbot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly from you.\u201d Seth and Katie are in their own little world with their eyes locked. Katie practically swoons when he says that last bit.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what the hell is going on?\u201d Trystan elbows Seth in the side, adding, \u201cYou\u2019re freaking us out. What\u2019d you guys do all day?\u201d</p><p>Katie sighs and looks at Seth like she\u2019s love struck. \u201cNothing. Messed with reporters, cut class, toilet papered Brie\u2019s car, and stuck pickles on her antenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPickles?\u201d Trystan and I ask at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, cuz she\u2019s a dick,\u201d Katie says.</p><p>Seth laughs. \u201cI had no idea why you picked up pickles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because the lunch lady gave me the whole jar. I didn\u2019t think of the metaphor until later.\u201d They both start laughing again, and it\u2019s like aliens came down and snatched Katie\u2019s brains while we were gone.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Seth says and looks at us, \u201cDid you guys get stuff worked out? Is our boy going to be a rock star? Because I want backstage passes. I\u2019m going to take a marker and cross out the VIP and write PUS-E on mine.\u201d</p><p>Katie kicks him under the table. \u201cYou will not!\u201d</p><p>Seth laughs, \u201cDamn woman, those boots hurt. Stop kicking me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying dumb-ass stuff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only said it to get a rise out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll get a boot up your ass if you say it again.\u201d Katie\u2019s smirk is back. She\u2019s flirting with him.</p><p>\u201cUh, Trystan...\u201d I say and scoot away from her a little bit. \u201cI think someone stole Katie\u2019s brain. They must have sucked it right out of her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Trystan answers with a smirk on his lips, \u201cthat dazed look on her face says\u2014ahh! She kicked me!\u201d Trystan\u2019s eyes widen in shock and he looks under the table and then back up at my best friend.</p><p>Katie folds her arms over her chest and leans back in the booth, smugly. \u201cSorry, the alien made me do it.\u201d She examines the back of her hand, looking closely at her polish before looking up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>We all start laughing and things feel like they\u2019re going to be all right.</p><p>When we get to the school, the building is surrounded by reporters. Trystan stops in his tracks and his face turns white. His hand slips out of mine as he stares. This will be his life from now on and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s questioning whether or not he can handle it. Seth and Katie stop when they notice we aren\u2019t following them.</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing, Scott. We can elbow past them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d Trystan asks as he looks at the news vans again. There are more people here than before. This morning it was manageable, but now there are close to twenty different reporters, plus their crew, and cameras are everywhere. Some of the media people are standing in front of the school, blocking the doors, with a microphone in hand, ready to pounce when Trystan arrives. Since Trystan doesn\u2019t want to make the announcement until after the performance, it\u2019s an issue.</p><p>\u201cOr, we can open the basement door. Come on, Katie. I\u2019ll distract them and you sneak through. Knock three times on the door and wait for her to open it. Got it?\u201d Seth doesn\u2019t wait for an answer. Instead he walks away with Katie a few paces behind.</p><p>Trystan looks over at me. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ready for this, are you?\u201d He takes my hand and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could ever be ready for this. I like the limelight, Mari, but only when I\u2019m on a stage and everyone else is far away. I\u2019m not used to having them in my face and sorting through my personal life. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d He sighs and pushes his silky hair out of his eyes.</p><p>Squeezing his hand, we round the side of the building and head toward the stairwell that leads to the basement. \u201cI know. I wish I could keep them away from you, but I think you need them. They\u2019re the ones that\u2019ll get you a contract and pay your bills, right? Maybe you could think of it like a show, throw out some personal stuff so they don\u2019t go digging for it. I\u2019m not na\u00efve enough to think that\u2019ll stop them, but it should slow them down, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. The truth is I don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for this, Mari. I\u2019m an actor. I never planned on signing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s exactly why they love you. Trystan, you\u2019re real. You aren\u2019t someone whose clawed his way to the top. You\u2019re the lovesick guy that wrote a girl a song. You\u2019re the guy who wanted to stay out of the spotlight, and that\u2019s why they love you. You\u2019re acting like a normal person, not some larger than life Hollywood type. When they look at you, you give them hope. People like you are rare. Remember who you are and you\u2019ll be happy for once. You won\u2019t have to scrounge for food or worry about where you\u2019re going to sleep.\u201d I lean into his arm as I say these things. Trystan has no idea what people see in him. I can hear it in his voice.</p><p>Trystan stops and slips his arms around my waist, before leaning in and giving me a peck on the forehead. Smiling, he takes a lock of hair in his hand and plays with the curl, wrapping it around his finger. \u201cYou have too much faith in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need people that love you for you and believe in you, Trystan. You\u2019ve been denied that basic right. And by the way, this isn\u2019t too much faith at all. I know what you\u2019re capable of, and I expect you shine bright and rock this Day Jones thing better than any play you\u2019ve ever done. You\u2019ve been handed the performance of a lifetime, and you\u2019re going to amaze us all. Wait and see.\u201d It\u2019s hard to say stuff like that to someone when it isn\u2019t true, but with Trystan I have no shortage of words. He\u2019s amazing and the whole world is about to know for certain that Day Jones pales in comparison to Trystan Scott.</p><p>\u201cMari,\u201d Trystan\u2019s lips are parted like he\u2019s searching for words, but nothing comes out. He shakes his head with laughter on his lips. \u201cI love you so much. You see this,\u201d he points to the ring I gave him, \u201cI\u2019m never taking it off. You\u2019re my everything, Mari.\u201d He wraps his arms around me and holds me tight.</p><p>Katie\u2019s voice echoes up to us. \u201cStop making out and get your asses down here before someone sees you!\u201d</p><p>Trystan takes my hand and we run down the metal stairs and into the basement. Katie yanks the door shut behind us and looks up, grinning. \u201cYou guys are going to get married and have little rock star babies!\u201d I elbow her in the side, but she keeps laughing anyway. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have little tiny guitars and chains on their diapers!\u201d</p><p>Horrified, I look over at Trystan wondering how much Katie just spooked him. The look of terror that I was expecting isn\u2019t there when I glance his way. Instead, Trystan is laughing with her and adds, \u201cDon\u2019t forget baby mohawks.\u201d He looks over at me. \u201cWhat? You never thought about what\u2019s next for us?\u201d</p><p>Shyness pulls my face to the floor like an anchor to the bottom of the ocean. I can\u2019t look up if I try. \u201cA little, but not that far.\u201d Trystan is still laughing when he yanks me toward him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have to go save Seth, otherwise I would love to hear this. Tell him that you want two babies and a little house upstate with a picket fence and a cow that eats your pansies.\u201d Katie runs off before I can kill her.</p><p>Trystan rests his forehead on mine. \u201cWhy does she know that stuff and I don\u2019t? And what\u2019s with the cow?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and look up at him. My stomach dips and I can barely find my voice. \u201cMost guys don\u2019t want to hear that stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince when am I most guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been like most guys, but that mask you wore threw me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMasks are sexy, right?\u201d He teases lightly and tugs at the waist of my jeans. \u201cMari, I\u2019d love to be the guy who gives you the house, the cow, and oh my God, I would love to make babies with you. I\u2019d try very, very hard\u2014\u201d</p><p>My face is on fire. Someone shoot me! Trystan laughs and lifts my chin when I try to look away, so I smack his chest. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it like that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Making babies is the fun part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t freak you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That you want a family? No, it doesn\u2019t freak me out at all. In fact, I like it. I want to be so insanely in love with someone that I\u2019d have a family with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d The way he smiles at me shoots excitement through my veins. I giggle like a crazy person and throw my arms around his neck, while kissing his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re my forever, Mari. Well get through this. I\u2019ll be with you every second I get. And when I\u2019m touring, you can meet up with me during your breaks. Or for a weekend. Or even a day. This will work out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is love, and I\u2019m never letting you go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>Tucker waits until they\u2019re in costume with their make-up finished before he pulls Trystan and Mari aside. \u201cWe can\u2019t head to my office because the hallways are filled with people, so let\u2019s just find a corner and I\u2019ll tell you what I was able to work out.\u201d</p><p>Tucker walks to the far side of the stage, and stops at the back corner. He checks the side door to make sure it\u2019s locked and then huddles them together. Handing Trystan a packet of papers, he says, \u201cAs soon as you say the last line of the play tonight, you\u2019ve graduated. I talked to the principal and a few of your other teachers to make sure you had passing grades, and they said you\u2019re good. So, that\u2019s settled. You don\u2019t have to come back here tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the play?\u201d he asks, surprised to think that Tucker would let him off the hook like that. Besides, Trystan wanted to do all three performances this weekend.</p><p>Tucker shakes his head. \u201cThis is the only night. We sold out, like standing room only, so the department made more money from this one show than we usually make all year. It\u2019s worked out and the school more than recovered the cost of the production. Having you here, and making the announcement this way is a huge help.\u201d</p><p>Tucker is holding a large envelope in his hand, and smacks it against his palm lightly before continuing. \u201cListen, you need to look at these contracts and pick one. There are three offers in here for seven figures, Trystan. They want your songs and there are plans for tours. I made notations and altered things that needed to be changed, such as your lodging requirements, privacy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven figures?\u201d Mari gasps and touches her fingers to her lips.</p><p>Tucker smiles. \u201cYes, the smallest offer is seven figures. There\u2019s one in here for eight. You\u2019re a millionaire, kid.\u201d Trystan stands there shocked, unblinking, and unable to speak. Tucker slaps him on the back and laughs. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know, did you?\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s shoulders creep up as his jaw drops. His voice is a squeak, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I thought maybe they\u2019d give me ten thousand bucks for the song.\u201d He goes to rub his hands over his face and stops because he\u2019ll smear his stage make-up. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>There have been times when life snuck up and robbed him. It fucking stole everything, and it happened so often that Trystan just expects it. Fate was cruel, but this\u2014he never expected anything like this. Staggering, Trystan takes a step back and hits the wall. Mari\u2019s hand is on his shoulder. She\u2019s speaking, but the only thing that he can think is that he won\u2019t have to buy semi-perished food from Sam ever again.</p><p>His thoughts fall out of his mouth because the shock has disabled the filter between his mouth and brain. \u201cI can buy as much peanut butter as I want.\u201d A smile creeps across his unbelieving face as he looks up at them slowly, and laughs.</p> <p>Tucker and Mari chortle with him. Tucker grabs his shoulder and says, \u201cYou can buy anything you want, Trystan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God... Do you know?\u201d His thoughts come out in jagged statements and grow louder. He finally slaps his hands over his lips to shut up. He sounds crazy. Is this how people react when they win the lottery? Trystan giggles behind his hand and then reaches for Mari, pulling her against his side with a huge grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot, Trystan.\u201d Tucker keeps talking in the low hurried voice he was using before. It takes a lot of effort for Trystan to stand and listen. Part of him wants to run up and down the school hallways, whooping at the top of his lungs.</p><p>Tucker snaps his fat fingers in front of Trystan\u2019s face. \u201cPay attention. I know you\u2019re excited, but there\u2019s more. If you pick a contract and sign tonight, they\u2019ll have a hotel room for you. You can stay there until you buy a house, all expenses paid. It\u2019s part of the requirement to sign with them, so all of the contracts have that clause.\u201d</p><p>Tucker looks at Mari next. \u201cI have a dorm room for you. It\u2019s all set and the key is in the housing office. Housing expenses and board are paid until school begins in the fall. And, I talked to the principal about your application for early graduation. It was denied.\u201d Tucker tries to keep talking but Mari\u2019s smile falls.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d She steps toward him with dread in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWait. Don\u2019t freak out yet. Listen to what I worked out first.\u201d His voice is gentle, like he can tell that Mari is going to lose it. Her jaw is locked tight and her thin frame is practically shaking as she tries not to show emotion. \u201cYou\u2019re short an elective, but it\u2019s taken care of. You\u2019re going to take a summer class that\u2019s offered to high school students at the college. It\u2019s a one week class, all day, every day. Finish that and you\u2019ve satisfied the state requirements. The school will give you a conditional graduation, and you won\u2019t get your diploma until after you finish the class. The college knows and has agreed to wait on your final transcript. Everything is already arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey offered to pay my room and board over the summer, too?\u201d Tucker nods, but his eyes flick away from hers. Mari doesn\u2019t notice it, but Trystan does. She sucks in a deep breath and presses her fingers to her lips. \u201cI\u2019m going to college! Trystan, I\u2019m going to college!\u201d She takes his hands and jumps up and down before he pulls her into his arms and hugs her hard.</p><p>When Mari steps away, she turns to Tucker and throws her arms around him too. \u201cThank you so much. I can\u2019t even tell you what this means to me. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\u201d Her voice is giddy, and he can tell she\u2019s trying not to cry.</p><p>Tucker peels her off and smiles kindly. \u201cIt was my pleasure, Mari. Now, go on and have them check your make-up one last time. I think some of your lipstick came off.\u201d Mari races off, skipping backstage and laughing. She\u2019s happier than Trystan remembers seeing her. Like ever.</p><p>When she\u2019s gone, he looks up at Tucker. The man is a better person than he\u2019d originally thought. Tucker hides his kindnesses. Call it a gut feeling, but Trystan knows that Tucker did more than arrange for the college to let Mari into the dorms early.</p><p>Trystan leans his shoulder against the cinderblock wall and slips his hands into his pockets. Tilting his chin up, he says, \u201cYou paid for her housing, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Tucker gives him a lopsided grin. Surprisingly, he doesn\u2019t deny it. \u201cShe earned it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>There are people who do good deeds in silence. They come and go like a whisper, and most of the time we think it was luck, but it\u2019s so much more than that. Tucker isn\u2019t a wealthy man\u2014he\u2019s on a teacher\u2019s salary\u2014and he just paid a massive bill for a student. Mari isn\u2019t his daughter. He doesn\u2019t owe her a damn thing, and yet he did this for her. It makes Trystan wonder exactly what Tucker\u2019s done for him, and what kindnesses swept by unnoticed, because now he\u2019s certain that there have been many.</p><p>The words knock around in Trystan\u2019s head for a moment before he asks, \u201cYeah, but why not tell her you paid for it?\u201d It\u2019s not that he thinks Tucker should draw attention to it, but he wants to know why the teacher did it and doesn\u2019t want credit for his actions. The behavior is so contradictory to everything Trystan experienced growing up that he can\u2019t fathom the situation. What would compel someone, an acquaintance at best, to act so selflessly?</p><p>The large man doesn\u2019t answer at first. Instead, he glances around to make sure they\u2019re still alone before leaning in closer to Trystan\u2019s ear. \u201cBecause ownership of the action devalues the kindness in some cases. It\u2019ll make her feel indebted, and that isn\u2019t the reason it was done. Well, not that I would know.\u201d Tucker grins, and admits nothing and everything with his statement.</p><p>Having ideals is one thing, and acting on them is quite another. Trystan knows what kind of man he wants to be and sees a reflection of himself in Tucker. Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around. It\u2019s possible that the young teacher already rubbed off on him over the years.</p><p>Tucker is quiet for a moment and then points to Trystan\u2019s packet. \u201cThe contract that I think you\u2019ll be the happiest living with is on top. There\u2019s a pen in the envelope. Congratulations, Mr. Scott.\u201d</p><p>Trystan pulls the contract out and scans it. Just as Tucker starts to walk off, Trystan says, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in here for you.\u201d There\u2019s no notation of a commission percentage for Tucker. No flat fee. Nothing.</p><p>The teacher doesn\u2019t stop, look back, or try to explain. He simply acts as if he didn\u2019t hear and heads off toward the lighting cage to make sure everyone is where they need to be before the curtain goes up. Trystan watches as Tucker disappears around the corner. He looks at the contracts in his hands and knows what he\u2019s going to do.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>I\u2019ve never gone on stage before to do a live performance. Up until now, I was the girl who sat in the shadows, the person that no one knew was there. By intermission everyone knows my name. They\u2019ll see me flooded in golden light, standing center stage with Trystan. I\u2019ve always thought he had charisma. The way he says his lines makes the night feel surreal. It\u2019s like we\u2019re star-crossed lovers trapped in another time, in another life.</p><p>There are more people in the audience than I\u2019ve ever seen. I peeked between the curtains from backstage before the play started. Now that things are underway, my heart doesn\u2019t pound so frantically. Periodically, the glint of a camera lens catches my eye from somewhere in back, but I can\u2019t see past the second row. The rest of the audience is swallowed in blackness, which is good, otherwise my nerves would choke me to death and I\u2019d die.</p><p>The lights keep me from looking out into the audience. They\u2019re blinding, and every time I feel the racing of my heart as I start to panic, Trystan seems to sense it. He touches me lightly\u2014on my cheek or my wrist\u2014and pulls me back to where it\u2019s only the two of us. When he does that, I realize that I could go on like this forever. He anchors me, steadies me, and makes me a better person. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019re at the end of the second act, and that steamy kiss is about to happen. My heart pounds as I say my lines. I never thought about him kissing me like this in front of so many people. Sweat trickles down my back and it feels like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before. My head is in the clouds, as my hands tremble. Trystan reaches for me, his eyes locked on mine. Smooth words flow softly from his lips as he leans in, closing the distance between us. His hands tangle in my hair and his mouth brushes against mine. The kiss feels more real, more intense than anything before. I gasp as he pulls away, and my eyes flick to the side\u2014to the audience\u2014as the lights fade to black and the curtain swings shut.</p><p>She\u2019s here.</p><p>I stand utterly still, even after the dim blue stage lights come up so we don\u2019t trip as we walk off stage. We have fifteen minutes before the next act. Trystan is smiling. He loves this so much and I don\u2019t want to ruin it for him, so I try not to react, but he\u2019s already noticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mom. She\u2019s out there.\u201d I stare at the floor, at the way the wood takes on blue tones in the light.</p><p>\u201cIs that bad?\u201d</p><p>Glancing up at him, I answer truthfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They said they wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad said they wouldn\u2019t come. Maybe your mom realizes he\u2019s been acting like an ass. Mari, you are exceptional. You\u2019re dazzling everyone out there. She has to see that.\u201d</p><p>I smile up at him, but it\u2019s forced. Seeing her there makes me question myself. Everything I do is lacking in her eyes and it\u2019ll crush me if she thinks my performance is subpar. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t see much when she looks at me, Trystan. She sees that I\u2019m not what she wanted, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p> <p>The conversation is cut short when we\u2019re shoved off stage, so the crew can change out the set. Trystan walks with me quickly into one the back dressing rooms. \u201cForget that she\u2019s here. Tonight is a new start for both of us. Try to be happy.\u201d He leans in and kisses my nose, which makes me smile. It\u2019s such a sweet thing, innocent and kind, that I can\u2019t help but grin.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, I nod. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We both get a new start after this. And honestly, I\u2019m loving every second of it. They love you Trystan. You could hear a pin drop out there, and it\u2019s because of you.\u201d</p><p>Trystan never takes compliments well. He usually boasts or does something silly to deflect or distract people from seeing it, but I know. This time he does neither. His voice is a whisper. His dark lashes lower and he leans into me, holding me in his arms and whispers in my ear. \u201cThank you, Mari. I couldn\u2019t have done this without you.\u201d As he pulls away, he pecks the side of my face. \u201cI need to take care of something, okay. You should go get a drink and have your make-up touched up before curtain call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you in a little bit.\u201d I wander around backstage until I find the side door that leads to the water fountain. Pushing through, I head into the only hallway that is blocked off from the public. Still, some people have managed to get backstage, including Brie.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a tight little skirt and saunters over to me as I guzzle water from the fountain. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they let you on stage. Trystan is totally carrying you. If it wasn\u2019t for him, they\u2019d be throwing rotten vegetables at you.\u201d She laughs and tips her head back. The bruises under her eyes are half hidden by make-up. She must have rubbed her face and some of the concealer came off. Either that or she\u2019s been crying.</p><p>I straighten and look her over once, and raise an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019d rather get hit with rotten fruit than have a rotten soul. Good luck with that.\u201d My throat is still dry, so I bend my head to the fountain again, but Brie doesn\u2019t leave.</p> <p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re better than me? Please!\u201d She cackles and several pairs of eyes turn our way. Some of the actors are lingering backstage with me, waiting for water while others are practicing their lines. They all stop what they\u2019re doing and watch. Brie rants, \u201cYou\u2019re just the spoiled daughter of a rich man. You\u2019ll never amount to anything, and as for Trystan, I\u2019ll always be his first love. I\u2019ll always be the woman who slept with him first and nothing you can do will ever change that.\u201d Her words are spoken loudly in a clipped tone, like she\u2019s superior.</p><p>The urge to punch her in the face courses through my arms, and my muscles tense, but I\u2019m not a fool. Besides, Tucker went out of his way for me and I\u2019m not going to get into another fistfight with her, so I straighten, look straight at her, purse my lips together, and spew. A splattering of water comes out and hits her face right before I start choking. By the time she squeals, I\u2019m doubled over and hacking up a lung.</p><p>It looks like she was in the spray zone and the rest of the cast that\u2019s loitering down the hallway come over to make sure I\u2019m all right. No one notices Brie, but I do. There\u2019s murder in her eyes as she wipes away the smeared make-up. It was childish. Maybe. But I\u2019m not letting people like her talk to me that way anymore. Brie stomps off and disappears into the crowd on the other side of the barricade. I hope she goes home, but I doubt it. She\u2019s probably waiting around to see what damage she can do.</p><p>There are several sets of hands on my back when I hear Mom\u2019s voice. \u201cMari?\u201d I glance up, horrified that she\u2019ll try to talk to me now.</p><p>Her gaze meets mine and we stare at each other. Everything within me says to walk away, that talking to her right now is not a smart move, but I can\u2019t. There\u2019s something about her, about the look on her face, that draws me down the hallway. Soon I\u2019m standing in front of her with only the wooden posts separating us.</p><p>Glancing up at her with a stern tone, I ask, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>There are people around. Many voices are talking at the same time. A camera pushes its way to the front and soon I can see the man wielding it. He shoves it in my face and I think that Mom will back away, but she doesn\u2019t. Rather, she lifts her hand and I can see what she\u2019s been holding. A single red rose with a white ribbon tied around it, forming a little bow.</p><p>Holding it out to me, Mom offers the flower. \u201cYou amaze me, Mari. I never knew you could do anything like this and seeing you up there on the stage...\u201d Her fingers cover her mouth quickly as she swallows a sob. The rose remains between us, an offering not accepted. I can\u2019t touch it. I\u2019m frozen in place. Her words hit me like a sheet of water and I\u2019m drowning, dying to hear what she has to say.</p> <p>Mom continues, \u201cI never knew.\u201d She looks down at the rose in her hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been holding you back. I\u2019m so sorry, honey.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, too shocked to speak. When I find my voice, I ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s spine straightens and her eyes lock with mine, offering an apology that words cannot express. She doesn\u2019t have to answer because I know he isn\u2019t here. Remorse fills her eyes, like there are more things to say, but not here\u2014not now.</p><p>The rose starts to fall to her side, clutched in her hand, but I reach for it, refusing to make the same mistakes my father\u2019s made time and time again. Forgiveness is something I want, so it\u2019s something I have to offer, and there\u2019s no one that I\u2019d rather give it to than my mother.</p><p>\u201cThis is beautiful. Thank you, Mom.\u201d I take the rose and reach over the barricade and hug her quickly before saying, \u201cI need to get back. I\u2019ll talk to you after. I have some really exciting news.\u201d Hiding my face, I hurry down the hall. Tears prick my eyes as hope fills my chest.</p><p>She\u2019s proud of me. My mother is finally proud of me.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>The play is over too quickly. Trystan basks in every moment, willing time to slow, but it doesn\u2019t. Rather, it seems to fly by, the minutes passing like seconds. He saw Mari with her mother and the smile on her face as she hurried back toward the stage during intermission. At least she has one parent now. Going through life alone is hard and Trystan wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. For some reason, blood matters. There isn\u2019t a day that goes by that he doesn\u2019t wish his mother would show up and say something like that to him, but the woman is a ghost\u2014gone forever.</p><p>The last line is said and something inside his chest tugs hard. This is the end of one life and the beginning of another. Most people never get a chance like this, and he knows he should feel lucky, but he\u2019s going to miss this place. Trystan will miss his afternoons with Mari, and driving Tucker crazy in class. He\u2019ll miss the hallways and Seth\u2019s crude mouth. If Trystan doesn\u2019t make an effort, he knows the people he holds most dear will vanish from his life.</p><p>The curtain swings closed as he stands there with Mari in his arms. He beams down at her and kisses her hard, not holding back a bit of emotion. Without warning the curtain swings open again and a single spotlight shines across the room, illuminating their private kiss.</p><p>The audience is cheering wildly, standing and clapping so loudly that he can\u2019t hear a thing. Mari and Trystan pull apart. She smiles and covers her lips with her fingers, trying to hide a beautiful, shy, grin. Trystan tugs her forward toward the edge of the stage. The spot light follows the pair until Trystan stops. He holds up their hands and they bow together, which makes everyone cheer louder. The casting call begins and one by one, the entire cast is called out onto the stage.</p><p>At the end, Mr. Tucker is called out and applauded. Up until this moment, everything is normal. Now, Tucker would normally take a mic and thank everyone for their hard work, but not tonight. Tucker taps the mic in his hand and clears his throat. \u201cThere are members of the press here tonight with a question for one of our students, and I believe he has an answer for you.\u201d</p><p>Tucker turns to look back at Trystan. This is it. His heart feels like it\u2019s going to leap out of his chest. It\u2019s a combination of dread and excitement. Trystan steps forward and tugs Mari with him before releasing her hand after a couple of steps.</p><p>Trystan taps his mic to make sure it\u2019s still on before his voice rings across the auditorium. \u201cA few months ago I was completely and totally in love with a beautiful woman who didn\u2019t know how I felt, so I wrote her a song.\u201d Trystan reaches for Mari and pulls her to him. \u201cShe knows how I feel, now.\u201d Trystan laughs lightly as he looks at Mari, and the audience laughs with him.</p><p>\u201cAnd before tomorrow morning, everyone will know everything about me, so I might as well tell you a little bit about who I am. When I was a baby, my mother left. It broke my father\u2019s heart and for the longest time, he blamed me. He took it out on me with words and fists. I\u2019m not the guy from the pristine home with the perfect parents. I didn\u2019t have that life.\u201d Trystan\u2019s throat tightens as he speaks, but he pushes through. He lifts his gaze and looks at the reporters and smiles the confident smirk he always wears when things are difficult.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the kid that cut class and drove my teachers crazy. I\u2019m the guy who fell in love with his best friend.\u201d He glances at Mari and squeezes her hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the guy who wrote her a love song and uploaded it to the internet. I\u2019m the guy everyone has been calling Day Jones, and my name is Trystan Scott.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth steps onto the stage and shoves a guitar into Trystan\u2019s hands. Grinning he says, \u201cShow them,\u201d before backing away into the crowd on stage. They\u2019re separated from Trystan, watching in awe.</p><p>The audience goes nuts when the guitar is brought out. Mari stands to the side as Trystan grabs a stool from Katie. She grins at him as she backs away. The guys in the lighting cage, blink the house lights and then turn them off. As Trystan begins to sing, a single light flips on behind him. There are several gasps and squeals of excitement as people realize that Trystan is really the guy in the video.</p><p>Trystan continues to sing, losing himself in the song like he\u2019s done so many times before. His dark hair covers his eyes as he looks down at the floor. The music fills the room, rendering the buzzing audience silent. The music fills the room, softly resonating and causing that soft vibration that only a live performance can bring.</p><p>When he finishes the song the room goes from complete silence to an explosion of applause. Trystan stands and walks toward Seth who hands him the contracts. Trystan holds up his hand to silence the room. There\u2019s joy in his voice when he announces his decision. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to sign with one of the record labels and accept their generous offer. Mr. Tucker, will you do the honor?\u201d</p> <p>Tucker gives him a strange look. This isn\u2019t what they planned. Trystan was supposed to announce what he decided. Tucker steps forward and takes the papers. Reading the papers as he speaks, Tucker announces, \u201cTrystan Scott, formerly known as Day Jones, has signed with Harbor House Records with the stipulation that...\u201d his voice fades which makes the audience grow even more excited. Tucker looks up at Trystan and then back down at the paper, and continues reading, \u201cWith the stipulation that the school drama department receive a portion of his sales, and that Mr. Tucker will be his representative and receive a standard commission as compensation for his time and expertise.\u201d Trystan wasn\u2019t certain how Tucker would react. Doing it this way kind of forced the guy to say yes, at least that\u2019s what he was hoping for.</p><p>Trystan speaks, filling the silence as Tucker stares at him in shock. \u201cThere are two people who made this possible\u2014Marie Jennings for inspiring me to write the song, and Mr. Tucker, who negotiated the contract. This guy has been watching my back for years, even though I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Trystan\u2019s body pulses with excitement. For some reason this part feels more exciting than anything else. He looks out at the crowd, nodding, gesturing for them to join in. \u201cCome on, Tucker. Say yes. You can still teach. There\u2019s a lot more I can learn, and I promise I won\u2019t cut.\u201d</p><p>Tucker\u2019s jaw is hanging open. Several cameras shift in his direction, waiting for an answer, while the audience cheers for him to do it. A rumble of laugher falls out of his mouth before he speaks. \u201cYou amaze me, Trystan. You always have. I\u2019m honored, beyond words...\u201d</p><p>Trystan extends his hand. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Tucker grabs Trystan\u2019s hand and almost rips his arm off as he shakes it hard.</p> <p>The moment seems to last forever, with endless applause and cheering. Trystan turns to Mari and takes her hand, pressing a kiss to it, as he waves at the people chanting his name. The sound rushes over him as he smiles back.</p><p>Until today, they called him Day Jones. No one knew who he was or what hell he endured to get to this point. There was this idealized version of the rock star who wrote Mari\u2019s song, but that man doesn\u2019t exist. Life makes us what we are. Cruelty and compassion shape us into what we become, and nothing about that is ideal.</p><p>Today the fictional life of Day Jones shattered, and by tonight the world will know him for who he really is\u2014Trystan Scott. </p> </body></html>"]
