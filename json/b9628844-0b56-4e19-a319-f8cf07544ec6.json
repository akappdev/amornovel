Female-targeted ads are ridiculous. I don\u2019t care how \u201cflawless\u201d looking the makeup claims to be; if you don\u2019t already look like a Victoria\u2019s Secret model, no cover-up in the world is gonna make you look like one.</p><p>Another thing I don\u2019t get\u2014everyone always raves about The Plaza, but the room is wall to wall florals\u2014the bedding, the upholstery, the framed pictures. It looks like it was designed by a deranged Mistress Mary, quite contrary-obsessed grandmother. I shift in the chair, trying to get comfortable, but the seat was obviously made to be \u201clooked at\u201d not \u201csat in.\u201d I give up on the magazine and wait.</p><p>Waiting for what, you ask?</p> <p>For Kate, of course.</p><p>She\u2019s behind the closed bathroom door, probably taking a bath. And she doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here yet. It\u2019s going to be a surprise. A lust-filled, haven\u2019t-seen-her-in-twenty-four-hours-and-I-can\u2019t-wait-to-get-inside-her kind of surprise.</p><p>You have no idea what\u2019s going on right now, do you? Well, hang on; you\u2019ll figure it out shortly.</p><p>Because the bathroom door opens, and Kate steps into the bedroom. And like a dog who hasn\u2019t seen his master all day, my lonely c*ck lifts its head at the sight of her.</p><p>She holds a champagne glass filled with bubbly, orange liquid. Her hair is twisted up in a high knot, while delicate, curling strands brush against her damp neck. She\u2019s wearing a short, red silk robe that leaves little to the imagination\u2014which is exactly why I bought it for her.</p> <p>I smile when she sees me. Her beguiling brown eyes widen. \u201cDrew?\u201d She glances at the door. \u201cWhat are you doing here? You\u2019re not supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I snuck in. I\u2019m stealthy like that.\u201d</p><p>She steps towards me. \u201cIf Dee sees you, she\u2019s going to freak out.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at the mention of Kate\u2019s psychotic best friend, whose mission in life is to interfere with mine. \u201cScrew Dee. I wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>Last night was the first night we\u2019ve spent apart since Kate moved in with me. Now, you might think that one night shouldn\u2019t be that big a deal\u2014but you\u2019re wrong. Ask any recovering drug addict which night of detox was the worst? When they were hungriest for a fix? The initial hours of withdrawal are always the hardest.</p><p>Kate smiles forgivingly, but reminds me, \u201cThe guys aren\u2019t supposed to see the girls before the reception. It\u2019s a tradition.\u201d</p> <p>I stand up and pull Kate flush against me, because seeing her, smelling her vanilla- and lavender-scented skin, makes touching her a must. \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid f**king tradition. And that\u2019s not even accurate\u2014the actual rule is the groom isn\u2019t allowed to see the bride before the ceremony. Delores just made up this shit up to make me miserable.\u201d</p><p>Are you starting to figure it out now?</p><p>Kate giggles. \u201cBecause everything is always about you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...yeah.\u201d</p><p>I lean in to kiss her lips, but she leans back. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>I counter her dodge with a move towards her neck. I kiss and suck the sensitive skin above her collarbone. Delicious.</p><p>I mumble against her, \u201cSure I can.\u201d</p><p>Kate tilts her head with a sigh, giving me more room to taste, even while she argues, \u201cAnd when Dee finds out you\u2019re here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf Delores comes in this room, she\u2019s going to get an eyeful.\u201d I chuckle. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll go blind. Or she\u2019ll learn something\u2014lucky Matthew.\u201d</p><p>Kate sees the wisdom of my words. Or else she\u2019s just as horny as I am. Her body relaxes against mine and her arms tighten around my shoulders, giving in.</p><p>Victory is mine.</p><p>My hand slides beneath her robe, palming her soft, gorgeous tit. And I whisper, \u201cTell me you missed me last night.\u201d</p><p>She pushes against my hand, wanting more. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>I trail light, tickling kisses down her chest and bend my knees to reach my target. I rub my face against the velvet flesh of her breast, breathing lightly on her aroused nipple. \u201cTell me you thought about me, Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm...I always think about you.\u201d</p><p>I reward her words with the flick of my tongue. I lave her gorgeous nipple, then suck it into my mouth. Kate holds onto my head for dear life. And just as my hand makes its move up her thigh...</p><p>There\u2019s a knock, and a voice comes from outside the bedroom door.</p><p>A grating voice, like the one those Satan-worshipping teens from the \u201880\u2019s probably heard when they played their heavy metal records backwards.</p><p>\u201cKate? Hey, Katie, did you fall asleep in there?\u201d</p><p>Delores thought it would be a great idea for her and Kate to share the two bedroom suite for the night. Their mothers shared an identical one a few doors down.</p><p>Kate tenses and I close my eyes, praying she\u2019ll go the hell away.</p><p>But not surprisingly, my prayers go unanswered. The doorknob jiggles. \u201cKate, open up.\u201d</p><p>I get in one last drag on Kate\u2019s tit, then release it with a pop. She closes her robe and drags me towards the door, pushing me to the corner so I\u2019ll be hidden when it opens. Then she breathes deeply, brushes her hair out of her face, and cracks the door open just enough to see Delores.</p><p>Kate tells her, \u201cI\u2019m here. I was just taking a bath\u2014what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe photographer\u2019s on his way. Get your buns moving\u2014he\u2019ll be here in an hour.\u201d Delores pauses, then asks, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Suspicion swims in Dee\u2019s tone. \u201cYou look flushed. Why are you all flushed?\u201d</p><p>Kate is good at almost everything she does. Except lying. She sucks at that.</p><p>She waves her hand at her face. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you masturbating?\u201d Dee teases.</p><p>Oh, to all the angels and saints\u2014how I wish she f**king was.</p><p>Watching Kate get herself off\u2014in front of me\u2014would be epic. It\u2019s a major fantasy. But she\u2019s hesitant, self-conscious. I\u2019m trying to get her comfortable with the idea. Two birds, one stone and all that.</p><p>For guys, it\u2019s a phenomenal turn on. So if you ladies are looking to spice things up a bit? Try a little self-diddling. Trust me\u2014your audience will be begging for an encore.</p><p>Kate scoffs, \u201cNo, Dee, I wasn\u2019t masturbating.\u201d</p><p>Delores still isn\u2019t convinced. \u201cAre you having phone sex with the Goatfucker?\u201d</p><p>Phone sex.</p><p>Also at the top of my to-do list.</p><p>\u201cI told you to stop calling Drew that,\u201d Kate scolds.</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t help it. I picture his face and it just comes out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Now Kate sounds impatient. \u201cOkay\u2014yes, alright? I\u2019m having phone sex with Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww! Why did you tell me? I don\u2019t want to know that.\u201d</p><p>Kate sighs. \u201cThen why did you even ask? Look Dee, you worry about you right now, okay? I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m ready when the photographer gets here.\u201d</p><p>Begrudgingly, Delores says, \u201cAlright. Your mom\u2019s almost dressed, if you need any help.\u201d Then she suggests, \u201cHey\u2014maybe you should leave him hanging? Dipwad\u2019s balls could be our something blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Delores.\u201d Kate closes the door.</p><p>After we hear Dee close the door to her own bedroom, Kate locks ours and turns to me. \u201cShe\u2019s onto us. I\u2019m going to have to make sure she\u2019s completely occupied before you sneak out. You might be here a while.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cOh, no...however will we ever fill the time?\u201d</p><p>Kate turns and walks towards the forgotten chair. The silk robe sways teasingly, revealing the barest glimpse of her sumptuous ass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be filling the time perusing Bridal Magazine, while I get dressed. Not all of us can look presentable in five minutes flat.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSeven if I need to shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless. There\u2019s no time to mess around\u2014even for a quickie.\u201d</p><p>I stalk towards her. \u201cA\u2014there\u2019s always time to mess around. B\u2014it depends on your definition of quickie. My interpretation happens to be how quickly I can make you scream my name. Past experience has shown I can make that happen pretty damn fast.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, I notice the lace undergarments laid out on top of the dresser. A sheer, white bustier and matching string thong. I motion to them with my chin, \u201cNo garters?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not the biggest fan of lingerie, but if you\u2019re going to wear it, garters are always a nice touch.</p><p>Kate pulls her hair free from its bun and shakes it out. Shiny darks strands fall down around her, making her look bed-rolling wild and accentuating the refined beauty of her dark eyes, pert nose, and sweetly kissable lips.</p><p>She answers, \u201cNo, no garters. You\u2019ll understand why when you see the dress--\u201d She stops, her expression panicked. She glances towards the garment bag hanging next to the bed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t look at my dress, did you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still distracted by Kate\u2019s disheveled hair. I imagine running my hands through its soft waves, then wrapping it around my fingers for a tug while I\u2019m buried deep inside her.</p><p>That\u2019s why my voice sounds less than convincing when I answer, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>Kate points her finger at me, like a teacher reprimanding a student. \u201cTell the truth, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I? Ten years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotionally? Sometimes. But that\u2019s beside the point. Did you peek at my dress?\u201d</p><p>I reach around her waist and press our lower halves together. \u201cNo, baby, I didn\u2019t look at your dress.\u201d</p><p>Kate settles in to my embrace, toying with the neck of my t-shirt as she explains, \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t look, because I want you to be surprised. You\u2019re going to lose it when you see me in it. It\u2019ll be your new favorite dress.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her forehead, and work my way down over her temple, across her cheek. \u201cMy favorite dress of yours will always be...the one on the floor.\u201d</p><p>I nip at her lower lip as my hands skim the silk from her shoulders. \u201cLike this robe.\u201d Kate lowers her arms, allowing me to slide it off her completely until it pools around her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s my f**king favorite.\u201d</p><p>Then I cup her jaw in one hand and kiss her fully. Deeply. I waste no time in sliding my tongue against hers, which eagerly joins mine in the sensuous give and take.</p><p>Between kisses I whisper, \u201cYou taste like champagne.\u201d</p><p>She giggles as I move to her shoulder, scraping it with my teeth and then soothing the love bite with my lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mimosa. I had a few with breakfast and some more in the bath.\u201d</p><p>I push her knees open with my leg and caress the firm flesh of her ass, before dragging her up onto my thigh. The friction makes her moan. She pulls my head back down to her lips for another mimosa-flavored kiss.</p><p>Holding her steady, I move us back to the bed. I slide her down my leg and lay her in the middle of the rumpled sheets. Then I pull my t-shirt over my head and push my gym shorts to the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My ever-enthusiastic dick stands hard and thick. Kate leans up on her elbows, devouring me with her eyes. Her cheeks are tinged pink with desire, her lips parted, and her thighs rub together in anticipation. Fucking stunning. With a needy lick of her lips, her gaze settles on my c*ck as she waits for me to make the next move.</p><p>And I think about how hot it\u2019d be to see Kate touch herself. Maybe she needs the \u2018I show you mine, you show me yours\u2019 approach? I take my dick in my hand, and stroke it up and down. Kate follows my every move, mesmerized. After a few more slow pumps I say, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never really liked champagne. But maybe I\u2019ve just been drinking it from the wrong glass. We should test that theory.\u201d</p><p>I pick up Kate\u2019s glass from the bedside table and sit beside her on the bed. She reaches out and replaces my hand with her own, stroking me expertly, caressing the tip with her thumb.</p><p>And I can\u2019t help but groan.</p><p>I raise the glass over her, tip it slightly, and pour the cold liquid between her br**sts. She gasps and her hand tightens around me in the most fantastic way.</p><p>Then I lean forward, lapping at the champagne infused juice. Over her sternum, around the supple base of her perfect frigging tits, I lick every drop, tasting the drink\u2014and her. It\u2019s a heady combination.</p><p>\u201cMmm...good stuff.\u201d</p><p>And as much as I love the feel of her hand on me, I take Kate\u2019s wrists and bring both hands over her head, so she\u2019s lying flat on her back. Kneeling on the bed, I lean over her and dribble more of the mimosa onto the peaks of her br**sts and suckle hard, flicking at the nipple with my tongue\u2014first one, than the other.</p><p>She writhes on the bed and moans, a needy, desperate sound that spurs me on.</p><p>A few more drops are poured on her stomach. Kate tenses reflexively, but relaxes again when my warm mouth glides across her skin, following the path of the sweet liquid.</p><p>Her moans turn to gasps as I lick and suck my way around her adorable belly button, then down to her thighs. And her gasps turns to high pitched whimpers as I nibble on the flesh of her thighs, inching ever higher.</p><p>Kate likes to get creative with the p**sy grooming. Today it\u2019s a barely-there landing strip, which has me practically shaking to sink my face into it.</p><p>I don\u2019t make myself wait long.</p><p>I hold the glass above her and pour the rest of the liquor between her spread thighs. Then I cover her with my mouth, sucking and licking, lapping up every trickle like an alcoholic consuming his last indulgence before going cold turkey.</p><p>I feel light headed from the taste, the fragrance, the smooth, slick feel of her p**sy against my tongue. I moan against her flesh and Kate cries out in carnal f**king joy.</p><p>I bring two fingers to her cl*t and rub it in firm, quick circles. Kate\u2019s h*ps rise and push instinctively as she gets closer, in time with my tongue as it pushes in and out.</p><p>Her thighs squeeze my head and I grip her h*ps hard, lifting her against my mouth. She stiffens as one last, long, serrated moan escapes her lips.</p><p>Then she goes slack in my hands. Spent and satisfied.</p><p>And it still gets me. The undiluted gratification of going down on her. Of giving her bliss. But as happy as I am that I made her come, my own hedonistic craving pushes at me, driving me like the roar of a crowd at a college football game.</p><p>Go, go, go!</p><p>I rise to my knees and hook my arms under Kate\u2019s calves, spreading her wide. Then I bury myself fully in one powerful push.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing better than this\u2014nothing on earth that feels this perfect. That first thrust, when my c*ck is enveloped by Kate\u2019s tight, wet, warmth\u2014it\u2019s rapture so intense, it borders on pain.</p><p>My head rolls back on my neck as I savor the feeling. Then I pull my h*ps back, sliding against her grip, and drive back in.</p> <p>Using her legs for leverage, I f**k her hard, but slow. When I\u2019m buried to the hilt I rock my h*ps side to side, rubbing my pelvis against Kate\u2019s sweet spot, until she\u2019s recovered from her first orgasm and climbing towards number two.</p><p>With each move of my hips, Kate cries out in harsh breaths.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore!\u201d</p><p>The pleasure tingles and builds, gathering low in my stomach. And when Kate arches her back and clamps down around me, I push forward a final time and pulse inside her as I groan and curse.</p><p>Out of breath, I collapse on top of her, and she presses her lips to mine in an open- mouthed, chest-heaving kiss. Afterward, I turn my head and pant against her neck.</p><p>With a small laugh she says, \u201cWow. So I guess you really missed me last night, huh?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d</p><p>I roll to the side and Kate snuggles against me. Once her heartbeat slows, she complains, \u201cNow I have to take another bath. You made me sweaty.\u201d</p><p>I run my fingers through her hair. \u201cI like you sweaty. You should stay like this.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkles. \u201cI smell.\u201d</p><p>I press my face against her neck and inhale dramatically. \u201cYou smell like sweat and sex...and me. It\u2019s hot. Eau de Cum kicks Chanel Number Five\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>For a guy, there\u2019s something primordial about a woman covered in your scent\u2014it\u2019s the most primitive way of staking your claim. Of showing every other peckerhead that a woman is very much taken. It\u2019s animalistic, sure, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less arousing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gross. I\u2019m taking another bath.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cWhatever makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>Plus, it\u2019ll give me a reason to make her sweaty again. Another reason.</p><p>After five minutes of customary cuddling, Kate lifts her head from the pillow of my chest and orders, \u201cYou have to get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>My brow furrows. \u201cKicking me out already? I feel so used.\u201d</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>I say, \u201cI see how it is. You only want me for my body.\u201d</p><p>Mimicking my earlier tone, Kate replies, \u201cWell...yeah. Although your mind can be mildly entertaining.\u201d</p><p>I smack her ass with an open palm.</p><p>Slap</p><p>She squeaks and jumps out of bed, out of my reach.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed.\u201d My clothes are thrown at my head as Kate slips into her robe and tip-toes out the door to check if the coast is clear.</p><p>I\u2019m dressed by the time she comes back in.</p><p>She holds out her hand. \u201cCome on, Dee\u2019s in her room. You\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>I pull on her hand until she crashes against me. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna go. I want to defile the prestigious Plaza Hotel by having you ride me like a slutty mermaid in the bathtub.\u201d</p><p>Kate shakes her head. \u201cNot today. I\u2019ll see you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cFine.\u201d I brush my lips against hers quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll be counting the minutes.\u201d</p><p>Kate pinches me, because she knows I\u2019m being sarcastic. \u201cI\u2019ll see you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of people downstairs. How am I going to find you?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to miss me. I\u2019ll be the one walking down the aisle to you. Wearing...silver.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>MARRIAGE.</p><p>The final frontier.</p><p>Steven went first. He was kind of our test subject. Like those monkeys that NASA sent off into space in the fifties, knowing they\u2019d never make it back alive.</p><p>And now Matthew has followed in his footsteps.</p><p>What? You didn\u2019t think I was getting married today, did you?</p><p>No frigging way. I\u2019ve barely got the boyfriend thing down. I\u2019m not ready to tackle the title of husband. Don\u2019t want to bite off more than I can chew. Matthew, on the other hand, is just crazy enough to give it a try.</p><p>And the proposal\u2014now, there\u2019s a f**king story. Matthew had this whole romantic thing going. Rented out an entire restaurant for just him and Delores. He even had a string quartet playing music in the background. But when the big moment came? He was so nervous, he hyperventilated.</p><p>And then he passed the f**k out.</p><p>Nailing his head on the table on the way down.</p><p>Delores freaked\u2014Kate said she was never good with blood. She called 911. And even though he swore up and down that he was fine, she made him go to the hospital in the ambulance.</p><p>That\u2019s when things got interesting.</p><p>Because hospitals have certain protocols they have to follow. One of them involves hospital gowns. So when they wheeled Matthew in, a bloody bandage on his head, they started to cut his clothes off. Then they put all of his belonging in a big plastic bag\u2014including the two hundred thousand dollar diamond ring he\u2019d purchased for the occasion.</p><p>The idea of losing that ring cured Matthew of his cold feet real frigging quick. So he hops off the gurney, grabs the ring, runs out into the ER, and drops to his knees in front of Delores. And that\u2019s how he popped the question.</p><p>In the middle of the god damn emergency room with his ass hanging out the back of a hospital gown as bare as the day he was born.</p><p>Naturally, Delores said yes. And two days later, the four of us jetted to Vegas for the Elvis Chapel Special.</p><p>Crazy? Sure. But it kind of fits, don\u2019t you think?</p><p>Anyway, we come back to the city, where Matthew announces to his parents that he\u2019s a married man. I\u2019ve never seen Estelle Fisher so animated in my life. She started bawling her eyes out, sobbing about how she missed her only child\u2019s wedding.</p><p>I felt bad, so I can only imagine how shitty Matthew felt. Making your mother cry? That guilt is like the sixth circle of hell.</p><p>Frank, being a man of few words, just looked at his son and said, \u201cFix this.\u201d</p><p>But his eyes said so much more. They said, \u2018You may be thirty years old, but I will still kick your ass up and down Park Avenue if you don\u2019t make this right real motherf**king quick.\u2019</p><p>And so here we are.</p><p>At Matthew and Delores\u2019s grand New York City wedding reception, courtesy of Frank and Estelle. No expense was spared\u2014very New York high society. It\u2019s supposed to be elegant. Classy. And it is.</p><p>Except for Delores\u2019s dress, of course. Have you ever seen Madonna\u2019s Like a Virgin video?</p><p>Perfect\u2014then you know just what Delores looks like.</p><p>Cocktail hour\u2014hands down, it\u2019s the best part of a wedding. Exceeded only by that garter thing. I\u2019ve always been an excellent garter catcher, and there\u2019s no better way to get to know a chick than sticking your hands up her dress as high as you can go.</p><p>But that was then. My now is much better.</p><p>Because I\u2019ve got the hottest girl in the room sitting next to me\u2014and I can stick my hands up her dress anytime I want.</p><p>Now that Kate is wearing her dress, I understand why she said garters wouldn\u2019t work. It\u2019s silver and short. I\u2019m talking micro-mini. And strapless. Every time I look at her, I can\u2019t help but think about how easy it will be to get it off. And her shoes? You remember my thing for shoes, right? They\u2019re very high, very strappy, open toed and...</p><p>Amelia Warren, Delores\u2019 mother, stands up from the table. She\u2019s thin, with shoulder length, feathered 80\u2019s style, strawberry blond hair. And like her daughter after her\u2014she\u2019s nuts. When I say nuts I mean that in the most literal way possible.</p><p>For Kate\u2019s birthday, Amelia sent her a huge, heavy, natural crystal necklace harvested from the caves of Perigord, because she believes they\u2019ll protect Kate\u2019s lungs from the city air pollution. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s a shame, how stringent the involuntary commitment protocols in this country have become.</p><p>Oh\u2014and Amelia doesn\u2019t like me at all. Don\u2019t know why. I only met her once before this blessed event, and we didn\u2019t speak more than five words to each other. I wonder if the withering glares she throws my way have anything to do with her nephew.</p><p>\u201cOh look\u2014Billy\u2019s here! He made it!\u201d</p><p>Speak of the Devil and he doth appear. I glance over to the doorway where, sure enough, the ball-licker just waltzed in.</p> <p>Yep, still hate him. He\u2019s like genital herpes\u2014he just won\u2019t go the f**k away.</p><p>He\u2019s been living in LA for the last eight months and much to my displeasure, he and Kate still talk. She says they\u2019re just\u2014say it with me\u2014\u2019friends\u2019\u2014but I don\u2019t buy it. I mean, sure, for Kate, they\u2019re just friends. That I believe. But for a guy? No way.</p><p>The \u201cfriend\u201d card is one of the oldest hook-up tricks in the book. Right up there with \u2018I think I might be gay.\u2019 He\u2019s just biding his time\u2014waiting for me to screw up so he can be the shoulder Kate cries on. Then when she\u2019s all vulnerable and weak, he\u2019ll stick his tongue down her throat.</p><p>Not gonna happen. Not on my f**king watch.</p><p>He makes his way over to our table and Kate goes up to him. They hug, and I grind my teeth together.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Billy.\u201d</p><p>Pardon me while I swallow the vomit that just surged into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDee Dee\u2019s going to be so excited to see you. I thought you had a show?\u201d</p><p>His smile is smug. Slick. Like a used car salesman. \u201cI had my agent move some things around.\u201d Then he looks Kate over, from head to toe.</p><p>And I want to simultaneously cover her with a tablecloth and scoop his eyeballs out with a coffee spoon.</p> <p>\u201cYou look amazing.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head to the side with a smile, \u201cAww. You\u2019re so sweet. You look great, too.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s actually stomaching this bullshit? Are you f**king kidding me?</p><p>I clear my throat and stand up behind her. \u201cWarren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvans.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes clash\u2014like a lion staring down a hyena\u2014and Kate is the fresh kill we\u2019re both looking to eat.</p><p>That\u2019s when my mom comes over. \u201cKate, could you be a dear and help me find your mother? The photographer would like to take a few more family shots outside before the sun goes down.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s dark eyes cloud over with concern. They dart between the two of us nervously. \u201cAh...sure, Anne. No problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Kate looks at each of us pointedly. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d As she turns to go, she stops at my shoulder and whispers, \u201cBe good, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you wanted this morning.\u201d</p><p>Her smile\u2019s tight and there\u2019s warning in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s what I want now.\u201d</p><p>I tuck a piece of her hair back behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m always good, baby.\u201d</p><p>She walks away, leaving me alone with my arch nemesis. This should be interesting.</p><p>He jumps right in with both feet. \u201cSo, I left Kate a couple voice mails last week. Apparently she didn\u2019t get them.\u201d His tone is accusing. Rightly so.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she just didn\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He snorts\u2014as pigs tend to do. \u201cOr maybe you deleted them.\u201d</p><p>I take a step closer, making him back up. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t be calling my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called to talk to Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u2014Kate who\u2019s living in my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t f**king tell her who she can talk to. Who the hell do you think you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend. Which means\u2014yeah\u2014I can. And I don\u2019t think that includes you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know something, Evans? I see right through you. You come off all arrogant and full of yourself, but deep down? You\u2019re shitting your pants. Cause you know it\u2019s just a matter of time before Kate is done with you.\u201d</p><p>My brow furrows in mock confusion. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I don\u2019t speak vag**a. Just what the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He moves forward, so we\u2019re nose to nose, like boxers before the bell. \u201cIt means newsflash, dickhead\u2014you\u2019re the rebound guy. A distraction. Kate will have her fun, and then she\u2019ll move on to more permanent prospects.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cLike you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have the whole rock star thing going for me, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Kate said he signed a record deal a few months back, and I\u2019ve heard a few of his songs on the radio. But I don\u2019t care how many records he sells\u2014he\u2019ll always be a douche bag to me. Though he\u2019s got a point about the rock star thing. It\u2019s a powerful force. Guys who look like Mick Jagger or Steven Tyler wouldn\u2019t have a shot in hell at getting laid without it, and they\u2019ve spent decades shoulder deep in p**sy.</p><p>\u201cBut no, not me,\u201d he says. \u201cKate and I are in the past. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s sticking with you, though. How long have you known her, Evans? Eight months? I dated her for eleven years and I was her friend for nine before that. I think I\u2019m a lot more qualified to predict what Kate will or won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>Okay\u2014that one hit a little too close to home. It\u2019s one of the reasons I hate the fact that Kate still talks to him. Because he had her before I did. I don\u2019t mean the sex; I could deal with that. I\u2019m talking about the fact that she loved him, came close to marrying him. So no matter what I do\u2014no matter how good Kate and I are\u2014I\u2019ll never be her first where it counts. And that sucks. Second place is just first loser.</p><p>But I\u2019ll eat my own tongue before I admit that to fuck-face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking out your ass. I know Kate. I--\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off with a shoulder nudge. \u201cYou know what Kate lets you know. I had a front row seat to every significant moment in her life, a**hole. Twenty years worth of memories will always mean more to her than you ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not to go all Popeye on you? But that\u2019s all I can stand and...well...you know the f**king rest.</p><p>I pull back and punch him right in the jaw. Iron Mike\u2019s got nothing on me right now, and it feels great. I should\u2019ve done this months ago.</p><p>He staggers back. I expect him to come back swinging and I\u2019m ready for the block. What I don\u2019t expect is for him to tackle me low in the waist with the skill of a NY Giants linebacker.</p><p>We fall back in a heap, taking out the pasta station behind us with a crowd-drawing crash. Marinara sauce flies everywhere, raining down on unsuspecting heads and spattering people\u2019s clothes. Kind of looks like the pigs blood scene in Carrie, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>Now, contrary to popular belief, these kinds of things don\u2019t go down like they do in the movies. Those fights are planned out. Choreographed. Real-life guy fights involve more rolling around on the ground, cursing and grunting, while getting in the occasional punch or kick between the verbal jabs.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>We roll over till we\u2019re side by side. I straight arm him, holding on to the front of his shirt. I get in a nice right hook to his chin, drawing first blood. With a growl he flips over so he\u2019s on top, straddling my waist. He nails me in the eye from the left.</p><p>I shake it off and grind out, \u201cMy sister hits harder than that. Pussy.\u201d</p><p>He grits his teeth, holding me down at the chest. \u201cSuck my dick.\u201d</p><p>I bring my leg up and knee him in the back. \u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? Oh, no, that\u2019s right\u2014you wouldn\u2019t. Kate sucks fantastic cock, by the way. You don\u2019t know what you were missing all those years, you f**king idiot.\u201d</p><p>Yeah\u2014I know.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just said that, either. In front of a room full of people. In front of Kate\u2019s mother.</p><p>And if the horrified gasp that sounds suspiciously like my girlfriend\u2019s voice is any indication? There\u2019s an excellent chance I\u2019ll go the rest of my life without ever getting head again.</p><p>Still, it was a great comeback, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Without warning, the scent of coffee fills the air. And a second later my legs are burning. It\u2019s scorching, like the boiling oil castle guards used to pour down on the invaders in Medieval times.</p><p>\u201cAhh! Christ!\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Warren and I forget about knocking each other\u2019s teeth out. We\u2019re too busy trying to get away from the sizzling liquid that\u2019s being poured on us.</p><p>I look up into the diabolical eyes of Amelia Warren, who\u2019s proudly holding two stainless steel carafes that used to be filled with coffee. And now aren\u2019t.</p><p>She reaches down and grabs my ear with one hand and Warren\u2019s with the other. And we\u2019re immobilized. Immediately. Amelia Warren\u2014pain in the ass by day, ninja warrior by night.</p><p>She drags us out of the room by our respective ears, not unlike Sister Beatrice would have in the good old days. But we don\u2019t go quietly.</p><p>\u201cOw...fuck...oooowwww!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Amelia, let go! I\u2019m a musician, I need my ear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop your whining! Beethoven was deaf and he did just fine.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re dragged towards an adjoining room. Out of the corner of my eye I see Kate tagging along. Arms folded, back stiff\u2014not a good sign for me. She opens the door and the four of us walk in.</p><p>And we all stop dead in our tracks.</p><p>Because there, on an empty table, is none other than Kate\u2019s mother, Carol, and Steven\u2019s father\u2014good old quiet, number-crunching George Reinhart\u2014going at it hot and heavy like two teenagers in the backseat at a drive-in movie theater.</p><p>I shit you not.</p><p>Kate\u2019s mouth opens wide, disbelief clear in her exclamation. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>I raise my brows. \u201cWow. Go, George.\u201d</p><p>Have I mentioned that Kate\u2019s mom is smokin\u2019 hot? She is. Very.</p><p>She\u2019s in her fifties, with wavy russet hair, familiar dark eyes with the barest of wrinkles, and a warm smile. Her body\u2019s softly rounded with age, but still petite. The best way to tell how a woman\u2019s going to look in her later years is to look at her mother. If I didn\u2019t know I was a lucky son of a bitch before? The moment I laid eyes on Carol Brooks, I was sure of it.</p><p>Carol and George bust apart like they\u2019re on fire, sputtering embarrassed apologies as they readjust their clothing. Carol\u2019s face reminds me of that pink dog on Blues Clues. Guess that\u2019s where Kate gets the blushing thing from. George straightens his tie, trying his best to look dignified\u2014like he wasn\u2019t just caught with his hands on Carol\u2019s fun bags.</p><p>He nods in our direction. \u201cBoys. Kate.\u201d</p><p>I wave.</p><p>Then Kate sputters, \u201cMom, the photographer needs you.\u201d Carol seems relieved to have an exit strategy and they scurry out the door. Amelia-san releases her kung fu grip on my lobe and turns on her heels like a drill sergeant.</p><p>I try to lighten the mood. \u201cBoy...didn\u2019t see that one coming, huh?\u201d</p><p>Kate frowns. And Amelia pokes me in the chest. \u201cEven though you are not my responsibility, if I ever hear such profane filth out of your mouth again, I will hog tie you, hold your nose, and pour dish detergent down your throat like your mother should have a long time ago! Am I clear, mister?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her wrath turns to Warren. \u201cAnd you\u2014for God\u2019s sakes, act like you have some sense!

I raised you better than this.\u201d</p><p>He looks down. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you boys to stay on opposite sides of the room the rest of the evening. Any more trouble from either of you and I\u2019ll have you thrown out on your asses.\u201d In a huff she walks out of the room, with Warren trailing behind her like a stray puppy.</p><p>Leaving Kate and me alone.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>THE SILENCE IS HEAVY. Awkward. Kate paces angrily, her movements sharp. She finally comes to a stop in front of me. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say to you.\u201d</p><p>I squirm\u2014just a little. \u201cHe started it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>I think about it for a minute. \u201cKind of.\u201d</p> <p>Kate shakes her head. And her chocolate eyes turn wounded. \u201cDo my feelings mean so little to you, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I groan. \u201cCome on, Kate. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake this into some big thing about me not respecting you, or caring about you enough. It\u2019s really not that complicated. I hate him. I hate that he\u2019s here. I hate that you f**king talk to him.\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms over her chest, \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this\u2014Billy was my friend long before you and I got involved. We grew up together. Like you and Matthew and Steven. You know what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>I do. There\u2019s nothing on earth more valuable than an old friend. Someone who understands you, knows why you are who you are, why you do what you do. No explanations needed.</p> <p>\u201cMatthew and Steven haven\u2019t seen me nak*d.\u201d And if they have, they certainly haven\u2019t enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cHalf the city has seen you nak*d, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNameless women who mean--\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen who we run into every time we step outside the door!\u201d</p><p>My voice rises. \u201cI can\u2019t help that!\u201d</p><p>Hers rises more. \u201cI never asked you to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the f**k are you bringing it up?\u201d</p><p>I can feel the discussion spiraling, gaining momentum like a tornado about to touch down. I push a hand through my hair and force my voice to level out. Not exactly calm, but reasonable.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I told you it was him or me\u2014that you couldn\u2019t have us both in your life? What would you say?\u201d</p><p>Kate stutters, \u201cAre you...are you giving me an ultimatum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just a hypothetical. If I told you that, who would you pick?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stare past me, thinking it over. The fact that she even needs to think about it bothers me more than I can put into words.</p><p>Then she looks back at my face. \u201cI\u2019d pick you. Billy\u2019s my past and I care about him very much. But you\u2019re my future.\u201d</p><p>I let out a relieved breath. Too soon, it turns out, because then she adds, \u201cBut I\u2019d resent you for it, Drew. It would hurt me...hurt us.\u201d</p><p>I know I should tell her that she doesn\u2019t have to choose. That just knowing she\u2019d pick me is enough. I should\u2014but I don\u2019t.</p><p>And a second later she\u2019s making a bee line for the door. \u201cI have to go help Delores.\u201d</p><p>I follow behind her. \u201cHey, we\u2019re not finished here.\u201d</p><p>Her hand\u2019s on the doorknob. \u201cYes, I realize that, but I can\u2019t deal with this at the moment, okay? Just...stay away from Billy and we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>And in a whirl of shiny hair, she\u2019s gone.</p><p>I walk back into the main ballroom and lean up against the wall, watching the middle-aged, half-gagged, designer-clad guests trying to get their groove on.</p><p>My sister Alexandra walks up and leans back against the wall beside me. \u201cInteresting show. Much better than anything WWF\u2019s come out with recently.\u201d</p><p>I scowl. \u201cNot now, Lex.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cOkay. Just happened to see you floating up shit\u2019s creek and thought I\u2019d throw you a paddle. But if you\u2019re not interested...\u201d</p><p>She lets the offer hang.</p><p>Until I turn my attention to her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re new to this whole thing, so I\u2019m going to give you some advice. Relationships only work when both parties put the other person\u2019s feelings before their own. Without that? Things tend to implode rather quickly. Let\u2019s take Matthew and Delores, for instance. It\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t like you very much, but she doesn\u2019t let that come between them. How do you think he would feel if she told Matthew she didn\u2019t want him talking to you anymore?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already shaking my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to you. But to Kate, it\u2019s exactly the same thing.\u201d</p><p>I clench my fists, frustrated. \u201cSo what are you saying? I have to invite the guy over to my place for a freaking slumber party? Do each other\u2019s nails?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to be friends with him. You just have to suck it up and accept the fact that Kate is.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms and look around the room, purposely not acknowledging her counsel.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cOr don\u2019t. Ignore everything I\u2019m saying, let your insecurities get the better of you, and completely disregard Kate\u2019s feelings on the matter.\u201d She pats my shoulder. \u201cLet me know how that works out for you.\u201d</p><p>Then she walks away. While I stand there. Pouting\u2014yes, I\u2019m aware.</p><p>I scan the room and find Kate, talking to Delores. She smiles at something her friend says, but her eyes don\u2019t. It\u2019s fake. A cover.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>And then I spot Warren, sitting at the bar. I look back and forth between the two. Then I let out a big breath and walk over. I nod to the bartender. \u201cWhiskey. Double.\u201d</p><p>Eating shit? Doesn\u2019t taste very good. I\u2019m going to need something to wash it down.</p><p>An hour later, I\u2019ve learned three things about Billy Warren:</p><p>1) He loves music.</p><p>2) He\u2019s really into his new truck.</p><p>3) He can\u2019t hold his liquor for shit.</p><p>Douchebag is a total lightweight. Which, for me, is a good thing\u2014a drunk guy is usually an honest guy.</p><p>\u201c...custom leather seats as soft as a baby\u2019s ass...\u201d</p><p>Blah blah blah. I\u2019ve tuned him out for a while now. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve been able to stop myself from getting as trashed as he is. But warm-up time is over now. Might as well get right to the point.</p><p>\u201cSo listen, Billy, I need you to level with me\u2014man to man. You looking to hook up with Kate again, or what?\u201d</p><p>His face wrinkles. \u201cNah, man...me and Kate...that\u2019s like so yesterday. We were done way before we were done. Water over the bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Started too young. I mean, I love the girl, always will. Not like...in a sister kind of way exactly, cause we\u2019ve done it...\u201d</p><p>So don\u2019t need to hear this right now.</p><p>\u201c...but almost. Her and Delores, they\u2019re like my inner sanctum. For a long time it was just the three of us against the world, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I digest this information while he takes a drag of his beer.</p><p>Then he leans forward and his voice drops low, like he\u2019s got a secret to tell. \u201cShe\u2019s happy, you know. Kate. These last few months, she\u2019s sounded really happy. More than she ever was with me, that\u2019s for damn sure. Dee Dee says so, too.\u201d</p><p>He fingers the label on his beer bottle. \u201cBut you know how it is\u2014the higher you climb, the farther you fall\u2014and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re the sticking type. So when I think about how bad you\u2019re gonna hurt her? Pretty much makes me want to put a f**king bullet between your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Now that, I can respect.</p><p>I slap him on the back. Maybe a little harder than I needed to. \u201cTell you what, Billy\u2014the day I hurt her? I\u2019ll buy you the gun.\u201d</p><p>His drunken eyes regard me suspiciously. Then he holds out his hand. And I shake it firmly.</p><p>Why are you so surprised? I can be mature. Sometimes. Besides, just because I\u2019ve decided not to punch him in the face the next time I see him doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to give Kate all of his goddamn messages.</p><p>What do I look like? A saint?</p><p>Out of nowhere the lovely woman in question appears beside me, standing between our bar stools. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What is this?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to explain, but Warren beats me to it. \u201cRelax, Katie. Me and Evans...just buryin\u2019 the old hammer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHatchet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicker back and forth between us. I smile calmly. Reassuringly.</p><p>She\u2019s not convinced. \u201cSo, what? You two get into a fight, have a few beers, and now you\u2019re all buddy buddy? You gonna go outside and pee on the wall together, too?\u201d</p><p>Warren holds up his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s not get crazy. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re gonna hang out and play foosball or something. But if Evans here ever needs an extra hand with an assisted suicide?\u201d He taps his chest. \u201cI\u2019m your guy.\u201d</p><p>I raise my glass. \u201cWell said.\u201d</p><p>He downs a shot and stands up. \u201cAnd on that note, I\u2019m gonna head over to that little hottie on the dance floor who\u2019s been givin\u2019 me the eye all night. Tell Aunt Amelia not to wait up. And hey, Evans-- you should watch your back. This shin-dig is my cousin\u2019s deal, and we messed it up. Dee Dee\u2019s not gonna let that slide.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019s gone, there\u2019s a moment of silence. And Kate looks sideways at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s your game, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I look surprised. Innocent. \u201cGame? Me? No game. I just...like you more than I hate him. Simple, really.\u201d</p><p>She nods slowly, the corners of her mouth turning up in a half smile. \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t have had this little revelation before you announced my talent for fellatio to our family and friends?\u201d</p><p>That probably would have been better.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry about that. Got caught up in the moment. Although it was the truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.\u201d</p><p>She snorts, shaking her head. \u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>And with that, I know I\u2019m in the clear. My hands circle her waist and pull her between my legs as I change the subject. \u201cHave I told you how cock-stiffeningly gorgeous you look tonight?\u201d</p><p>Kate smiles as she rests her forearms on my shoulders. \u201cNot in the last few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider yourself told.\u201d</p><p>She leans in and lays her head against my chest.</p><p>And all is right with the world.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>And I know she means for more than just the compliment. I brush my face against her hair, inhaling the scent that still captivates me.</p><p>\u201cAnytime, Kate. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Over her head, I spot Warren\u2014and more importantly, the woman he\u2019s hitting on. And I start to laugh.</p><p>Kate\u2019s head pops up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I motion with my chin. \u201cWarren\u2019s talking to Christina Berman\u2014a distant cousin of Matthew\u2019s.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looks towards them. \u201cAnd that\u2019s funny because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause up until a year ago, her dick was bigger than mine. She used to be a guy.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes bug out of her head. \u201cWow. You\u2019d never know it, looking at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>Then her gaze falls on me. Thoughtfully.</p><p>And I ask, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shine. At me. For me. \u201cNothing. I just...I love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m a loveable guy.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. And brings her palm to my cheek, smacking it softly. \u201cAnd slappable\u2014definitely a slappable guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKinky. We should explore that further, later on.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles again and kisses me softly. Then she pulls back and hooks her thumb towards the dance floor. \u201cYou want to dance?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m almost offended. \u201cThe Electric Slide? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Not that I have anything against dancing. Some guys will tell you it\u2019s effeminate but I\u2019m not one of them. Today\u2019s dancing is practically sex with your clothes on, dry humping in a room full of people. And I\u2019m definitely into that.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Too cool for the Electric Slide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Besides, Steven has the monopoly on group dances.\u201d I point over to where my brother-in-law is burning up the dance floor, at the head of the pack with Mackenzie at his side. \u201cHe also does a mean funky chicken.\u201d</p><p>Kate cracks up.</p> <p>A few hours later, we\u2019re all walking out to the private parking garage together. My tie\u2019s gone, the top three buttons of my shirt open. I\u2019m holding Kate\u2019s hand, which is lost in the arm of my tuxedo jacket that she\u2019s wearing like a teenaged girl after the prom. Steven carries a sleeping Mackenzie on his shoulder, while Alexandra adjusts her dress with one hand and holds her shoes in the other. Matthew and Delores are already outside, saying their final goodbyes to the departing guests.</p><p>When he spots us, Matthew comes jogging up. His face is nervous\u2014and remorseful.</p><p>\u201cDrew...I didn\u2019t know, man. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He rubs the back of his neck and his eyes slide to my car, parked a few feet away at ground level, clearly visible under the garage light.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I see it. Or more to the point\u2014that\u2019s when I see the words that have been carved into her hood.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no, no...\u201d</p><p>I stumble forward and fall to my knees beside my baby. I rub over the words, trying to erase the gouges with my hand. Then I yell over my shoulder at Delores, \u201cYou heartless monster! How could you?\u201d</p> <p>I turn back to my car and whisper soothingly, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019ll get the best body guy in the city. It\u2019ll be like it never happened. No one will ever know you were scarred.\u201d</p><p>From the upper level I hear Billy Warren\u2019s wail of anguish, and I know Delores got to his new truck, too.</p><p>I feel your pain, Douche Bag.</p><p>Leisurely, Delores strolls over. She looks down at me, eyes mocking, one fingerless-lace-gloved hand on her hip. \u201cPull any shit like that again and I\u2019ll carve it into your f**king forehead.\u201d</p><p>Then she smiles cheerily. \u201cNight, everyone. Thank you for being a part of our special day.\u201d</p><p>And she disappears into the shadows.</p><p>I feel bad for Matthew\u2019s Guardian Angel. He\u2019s going to be working overtime.</p><p>\u2018Cause I\u2019m pretty sure my best friend just married a demon.</p><p>THE END </p> </body></html>"]
